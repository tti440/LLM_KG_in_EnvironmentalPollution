The agent\u2019s properties are key to the conditions under which it will be transformed chemically as it forms within sources, moves to the atmosphere, and reaches its fate in the environment. For this reason, chemical transformation of an air pollutant considers more than atmospheric transformation. Indeed, the most obvious stage of the air pollutant\u2019s life cycle is its residence in the atmosphere. That is what makes it an air pollutant. However, the stages before and after its atmospheric presence must also be understood, for example, to prevent air pollution before it happens. As evidence, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an air pollutant that can be produced in a number of ways. If the source is combustion, the best means of preventing its formation occurs in the combustion process (using fuel with lower concentrations of sulfur). If it occurs as a result of the release of hydrogen sulfde (H2S) produced by anaerobic bacteria in sediment, which is subsequently transformed to SO2 in surface waters and the atmosphere, the prevention and controls would be different (e.g. increasing the oxygen content of the sediment to eliminate the anaerobes). The atmospheric and microbial transformation results are the same, i.e. does the SO2 become transformed to other oxidized sulfur species and how much and where will this chemical compound be deposited? Although the resulting atmospheric concentrations of SO2 might be equal in both scenarios described in the previous paragraph (Figure 17.1), the transformations leading to these concentrations are quite different. In the frst, the oxidation by combustion leads to the production of SO2 that is emitted directly to the atmosphere. In the second, sulfur compounds are formed in a low oxygen, reduced environment that releases a reduced form of sulfur, which is then oxidized abiotically in the atmosphere. The SO2 that is directly released to the atmosphere was already in an oxidized state, so it may remain in that form or be further oxidized. If the fate is the human body or that of another organism, transformations continue in what is known as toxicokinetics, i.e. biochemical reactions or biotransformations that occur as a result of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a substance. If the fate is an ecosystem or a habitat within the ecosystem, both abiotic and biotic transformations occur, depending on the conditions. Even if the fate is a material, such as part of a building or other structure, kinetics continue, e.g. a deposited sulfate compound may react with the calcium carbonate or metal in a bridge, causing corrosion and ultimately placing the driving public at risk. As discussed in Chapter 6, the inherent physical and chemical properties dictate some of these transformations, which can often be characterized using analytical tools, such as the quantitative structure activity relationship. These tools apply inherent properties of chemicals to estimate the damage these compounds will cause when released. The inherent properties discussed in this chapter affect chemical transformations in the atmosphere and in other environmental compartments. Molecular weight, polarity, and molar volume are fundamental properties that are directly ascertained from the chemical structure. These drive other inherencies important to air pollution, especially aqueous solubility, vapor pressure, and dissociation constant. The two properties that are always important in environmental and atmospheric transformation are solubility and vapor pressure, which have been described as saturation properties.1 That is, they are expressions of the maximum amount of the chemical that can be held in the liquid (solubility) and gas (vapor pressure) phases. These inherent properties combine with others to make a chemical compound comparatively susceptible to environmental transformation or degradation, especially decomposition by photons (photochemical decomposition), water (hydrolysis), and energy transfer in organisms (biotic decomposition). The inherent properties provide only part of the factors that explain the chemical transformation of a substance.

AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION FIGURE 17.1 Two possible transformation pathways leading to atmospheric sulfur dioxide: direct release from combustion and biotic transformation followed by oxidation in the atmosphere. (For color version of this fgure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) biological transformation must also account for the characteristics and processes of the environmental compartment (e.g. source substrates, air, water, biota) where the substances reside.", "Each chemical compound has a unique residence time or half-life (t1/2) within each compartment. It should be noted that t1/2, which is commonly used to indicate chemical and environmental persistence, is merely analogous, but not equal to the constant half-life of a radioisotope. The latter is so fxed that one can literally set an atomic clock by it. The t1/2 for chemicals in the environment is a function of inherent properties and environmental conditions.1 All chemical transformations depend on temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, radical concentrations (especially hydroxyl), substrate (including water content and porosity), oxidation and reduction states, oxygen content, and microbial abundance and diversity. Thus, the t1/2 is highly variable by compartment and by season of the year. Within each compartment, there are differences in factors and properties that trigger and maintain chemical reactions. For example, aromatic compounds with several halogen substitutions are highly lipophilic, so these compounds are likely to become dissolved in any organic solvents present in the soil or in a storage tank, rendering them more mobile. Conversely, these same compounds arelesslikelytocomeintocontactwithreactivesubstances in the absence of these organic solvents. Likewise, if oxygen moleculesorradicalsare presentin abundance, oxidation reactions are likely; whereas, if oxygen is scarce, reduction reactions are expected. Thus, the inherent properties of the substance are infuenced by and changed by theextrinsicpropertiesofthe mediainwhich thepollutant resides in the environment. How molecules are sorbed to and desorbed from substrate and matrix surfaces also affects the extent of chemical transformation, i.e. tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin is almost nonreactive in certain soils since the molecules are tightly bound to abundant sorption site (one reason dioxin-contaminated soils are so diffcult to treat; requiring large amounts of heat energy for desorption from soil surfaces). Type and amount of energy also dictates the kinds and rates of chemical transformation. If sunlight is abundant, photochemical reactions may occur. Oxidation and reduction (i.e. redox) reactions may occur if aerobic and anaerobic microbes are present, respectively, as these organisms accept and donate electrons for energy transfer. Although this chapter specifcally addresses chemical kinetics, it is diffcult to disentangle transport and fate. This is because both air pollutant transport and fate are driven by thermodynamics. Energy is often described as a system\u2019s capacity to do work, so getting things done in the environment is really an expression of how effciently energy is transformed from one form to another. Indeed, energy and matter relationships determine transport and transformation of substances in the environment. After a contaminant is released, transport mechanism begins. Physical processes determine theextenttowhich receptors(likepeopleand ecosystems) will be exposed to the released substance and to any new chemical compounds it has become as it has been transported. Thus, transport and transformation determine a contaminant\u2019s fate in the environment. Figure 17.2 shows how a chemical compound\u2019s transport, transformation, and fate lead to air pollution risk to human populations and ecosystems. Chemical transformation is crucial to these processes. If the compound is transformed into less toxic chemical species, the risks decline. Conversely, if the compound is released as a highly toxic compound that is not transformed during this journey, the risks remain high. The worst case scenario is that a toxic compound can become even more toxic and harmful after release, leading to increased risks. III.

TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION 17.2 KINETICS Chemical kinetics is the description of the rate of a chemical reaction. This is the rate at which the reactants are transformed into products. This may take place by abiotic or by biological systems, such as microbial metabolism. Since a rate is a change in quantity that occurs with time, the change we are most concerned with is the change in the concentration of our contaminants into new chemical compounds: change in product concentration Reaction rate \u00bc corresponding change in time (17.1) and, change in reactant concentration Reaction rate \u00bc corresponding change in time (17.2) When a compound breaks down, i.e. degrades, the change in product concentration will be decreasing proportionately with the reactant concentration. Thus, for substance A the kinetics is: D\u00f0A\u00de Rate \u00bc (17.3) Dt The negative sign denotes that the reactant concentration (the parent contaminant) is decreasing.", "It stands to reason then that the degradation product C resulting from the concentration will be increasing in proportion to the decreasing concentration of the contaminant A, and the reaction rate for Y is: D\u00f0C\u00de Rate \u00bc (17.4) Dt By convention, the concentration of the chemical is shown in parentheses to indicate that the system is not at equilibrium. D(X)iscalculatedasthe difference between an initial concentration and a fnal concentration: D\u00f0X\u00de\u00bcD\u00f0X\u00definal D\u00f0X\u00deinitial (17.5) Thus, the rate of reaction at any time is the negative of the slope of the tangent to the concentration curve at that specifc time (Figure 17.3). For a reaction to occur, the molecules of the reactants must collide. High concentrations of a substance are more likely to collide than low concentrations. Thus, the reaction rate must be a function of the concentrations of the reacting substances. The mathematical expression of this function is known as the \u201crate law\u201d. The rate law can be determined experimentally for any contaminant. Varying the concentration of each reactant independently and then measuring the result will give a 0.1 0 Time FIGURE 17.3 Kinetics of the transformation of a compound. The rate of reaction at any time is the negative of the slope of the tangent to the concentration curve at that time. The rate is higher at t1 than at t3. This rate is concentration-dependent (frst-order). Spencer J, Bodner G, Rickard L. Chemistry: Structure and Dynamics. 2nd ed. New York (NY): John Wiley & Sons; 2003. concentration curve. Each reactant has a unique rate law (this is one of a contaminant\u2019s physicochemical properties). In a reaction of reactants A and B to yield product C (i.e. A \u00feB / C), the reaction rate increases in accordance with the increasing concentration of either A or B. If the amount of A is tripled, then the rate of this whole reaction triples. Thus, the rate law for such a reaction is: Rate \u00bck\u00bdA \u00bdB (17.6) The rate law for the different reaction X \u00feY / Z, in which the rate is only increased if the concentration of X is increased (changing the Y concentration has no effect on the rate law), must be: Rate \u00bck\u00bdX (17.7) Equations (17.6) and (17.7) indicate that the concentrations in the rate law are the concentrations of reacting chemical species at any specifc point in time during the reaction. The rate is the velocity of the reaction at that time. The constant k in the equations is the rate constant, which is unique for every chemical reaction and is a fundamental physical constant for a reaction, as defned by environmental conditions (e.g. pH, temperature, pressure, type of solvent). The rate constant is the rate of the reaction when all reactants are present in a 1 molar (M) concentration. Accordingly, the rate constant k is the rate of reaction under conditions standardized by a unit concentration. By drawing a concentration curve for a contaminant that consists of an infnite number of points at each instant III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION of time, an instantaneous rate can be calculated along the concentration curve. At each point on the curve the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the compound at that moment in time. This is a physical demonstration of kinetic order. The overall kinetic order is the sum of the exponents (powers) of all the concentrations in the rate law. So for the rate k\u00bdA \u00bdB , the overall kinetic order is 2. Such a rate describes a second-order reaction because the rate depends on the concentration of the reactant raised to the second power. Other decomposition rates are like k\u00bdX , and are frst-order reactions because the rate depends on the concentration of the reactant raised to the frst power. The kinetic order of each reactant is the power that its concentration is raised in the rate law. So, k\u00bdA \u00bdB is frst-order for each reactant and k\u00bdX is frst-order X and zero-order for Y. In a zero-order reaction, compounds degrade at a constant rate and are independent of reactant concentration. A \u201cparent compound\u201d is transformed into degradation products, sometimes called \u201cchemical daughters\u201d or \u201cprogeny\u201d. For example, pesticide kinetics often concerns itself with the change of the active ingredient in the pesticide to its degradation products. The degradation products themselves often undergo transformations, depending on environmental conditions.", "For example, as shown in Figure 17.4, a parent compound that is highly reactive may degrade within a few minutes after exiting a stack, producing a less reactive degradation product (DP1). Within the plume downwind of the stack, water vapor, and other compounds react with the degradation product, degrading 99% of it within a few hours. These newly transformed compound (DP2) may be less reactive and do not undergo further transformation. At distance A in Figure 17.4, the measurements would indicate about equal mass of the parent and DP1. However, at distance B, none of the parent compound is detected, and about the same amount of DP1 is measured as at distance A because there has been suffcient time for this transformation since the peak concentration. Very little of the DP2 is present at distance B since it only began to be produced since DP1\u2019s degradation. At distance C, suffcient time has lapsed to allow all of mass of DP1 to be degraded into the less reactive DP2. Note that DP2 is not showing signs of decreasing even though all of DP1 is degraded, indicating it is not nearly as reactive as DP1. Indeed, it may travel a long distance before deposition. Persistent compounds can travel hundreds, even thousands of miles, before being deposited. This is known as long-range transport. Image of Figure 17.4 Incidentally, a compound dissolved in water vapor or sorbed to particulate matter can be washed out during a precipitation event. If this were the case for the three compounds in Figure 17.4, the atmospheric concentrations would decrease to nearly zero during the precipitation events. That is, if the washout occurred at time A, the atmospheric concentrations of the three chemicals would be about zero, but the wet deposition measurements (e.g. in sampling equipment on the earth\u2019s surface) would be about the same of as those shown at time A: parent \u00bc DP1 and DP2 \u00bc 0; at time B, parent \u00bc 0 and DP1>DP2; and at time C, parent \u00bc 0, DP1 \u00bc 0 and DP2 is at its maximum concentration. That points out one of the values of taking deposition measurements, i.e. to see what was in the atmosphere at the time of the rain event. The other value is to see what is reaching the earth\u2019s surface, since the air pollutants can become water and soil pollutants and can harm biota, e.g. sulfate compounds that stress vegetation. The combination of deposition and transformation is an example of how physics and chemistry must be considered in concert to determine the severity of air pollution. 17.2.1 Air Pollution Physics and Chemistry Air pollution physics must be considered mutually with air pollution chemistry. Any complete discussion FIGURE 17.4 Hypothetical transformation of a reactive compound (parent), followed by the transformation of its frst degradation product (DP1) in a plume moving downwind from the point of release to the atmosphere. DP1 is further degraded into a less reactive chemical species (DP2), indicated by its steady state after all of DP2 has been transformed. DP2 will remain in the atmosphere until it is either washed out and deposited or until it is completely degraded.

AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION of the physical process of solubility, for example, must include a discussion of polarity. Further, any discussion of polarity must include a discussion of electronegativity. Likewise, discussions of sorption and airewater exchanges must consider both chemical and physical processes. Such is the nature of environmental science; all concepts are interrelated. The interconnectedness between physical and chemical processes is evident in Table 17.1, which lists some of the most important processes involved in the fate of environmental contaminants. This chapter highlights basic chemical processes that affect air pollution. It is important to bear in mind that the air pollution processes are a function of both the chemical characteristics of the compartment (e.g. air) and those of the contaminant. The inherent properties of the air pollutant are infuenced and changed by the extrinsic properties of the air and other media in which the pollutant resides in the environment. Thus, Table 17.1 describes both sets of properties.a Air pollution involves fve categories of chemical reactions. Various types of reaction occur within boilers and other industrial operations; in stacks; in the plume; in the microenvironments and ecosystems; and within organisms. 17.2.1.1", "Synthesis or Combination In combination reactions, two or more substances react to form a single substance: A \u00feB/AB (17.8) Two types of combination reactions are important in environmental systems, i.e. formation and hydration. Formation reactions are those where elements combine to form a compound. Examples include the formation of ferric oxide and the formation of octane: 4Fe\u00f0s\u00de\u00fe3O2\u00f0g\u00de/2Fe2O3\u00f0s\u00de (17.9) 8C\u00f0s\u00de\u00fe9H2\u00f0g\u00de/C8H18\u00f0l\u00de (17.10) Hydration reactions involve the addition of water to synthesize a new compound, for example, when calcium oxide is hydrated to form calcium hydroxide, and when phosphate is hydrated to form phosphoric acid: CaO\u00f0s\u00de\u00feH2O\u00f0l\u00de/Ca\u00f0OH\u00de\u00f0s\u00de (17.11) 2 P2O5\u00f0s\u00de\u00fe3H2O\u00f0l\u00de/2H3PO4\u00f0aq\u00de (17.12) 17.2.1.2 Decomposition AB/A \u00feB (17.13) In decomposition, one substance breaks down into two or more new substances, such as in the decomposition of carbonates. For example, calcium carbonate breaks down into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide: CaCO3\u00f0s\u00de/CaO\u00f0s\u00de\u00feCO2\u00f0g\u00de (17.14) Most decomposition reactions need energy added to the reaction. When electricity provides the energy, it is known as electrolysis. When photons provide the energy, it is known as photolysis. When microbes decompose an organic compound into simpler compounds, the process is known as biodegradation. 17.2.1.3 Single Replacement A \u00feBC/AC \u00feB (17.15) Single replacement (or single displacement) commonly occurs when one metal ion in a compound is replaced with another metal ion, such as when trivalent chromium replaces monovalent silver: 3AgNO \u00f0aq\u00de\u00feCr\u00f0s\u00de/Cr\u00f0NO3\u00de\u00f0aq\u00de\u00fe3Ag\u00f0s\u00de (17.16) 33 17.2.1.4 Double Replacement Double replacement is also known as metathesis or double displacement: AB \u00feCD/AD \u00feCB (17.17) In these reactions, metals are exchanged between the salts. These newly formed salts have different chemical and physical characteristics from those of the reagents and are commonly encountered in metal precipitation reactions, such as when lead is precipitated (indicated by the \u201c(s)\u201d following PbCl2), as in the reaction of a lead salt with an acid like potassium chloride: Pb\u00f0ClO3\u00de\u00f0aq\u00de\u00fe2KCl\u00f0aq\u00de/PbCl2\u00f0s\u00de\u00fe2KClO3\u00f0aq\u00de 2 (17.18) 17.2.1.5 Complete Combustion Complete or effcient combustion (thermal oxidation) occurs when an organic compound is oxidized in the presence of heat (indicated by D): D a\u00f0CH\u00de\u00febO2/cCO2 \u00fedH2O (17.19) x Combustion is the combination of O2 in the presence of heat (as in burning fuel) producing CO2 and H2O during complete combustion of organic compounds, such as the combustion of octane: D C8H18\u00f0l\u00de\u00fe17O2\u00f0g\u00de/8CO2\u00f0g\u00de\u00fe9H2O\u00f0g\u00de (17.20) a This table is a useful reference for several chapters, especially Chapters 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, and 26.

Some are more toxic than the original compounds being oxidized, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, furans, and CO. The alert reader will note at least two observations about these categories. First, all are kinetic, as denoted by the one-directional arrow (/). Second, in the environment, many processes are incomplete, such as the common problem of incomplete combustion and the generation of new compounds in addition to carbon dioxide and water. With respect to the frst observation, indeed, many equilibrium reactions take place. However, as mentioned in previous discussions, getting to equilibrium requires a kinetic phase. So, upon reaching equilibrium, the kinetic reactions (one-way arrows) would be replaced by two-way arrows (4). Changes in the environment or in the quantities of reactants and products can invoke a change back to kinetics. Incomplete reactions are very important sources of environmental contaminants. Forexample, these reactions generate products of incomplete combustion (PICs), such as CO, PAHs, dioxins, furans, and hexachlorobenzene. However, even the products of complete combustion are not completely environmentally acceptable. Both carbon dioxide and water are greenhousegases. Bothare essential to life on earth, but excessive amounts of CO2 are strongly suspected of altering climate, especially increasing mean surface temperatures on earth. Thus, CO2 is considered by many to be an \u201cair pollutant\u201d.b 17.3 RATE LAWS AND AIR POLLUTION THERMODYNAMICS Reaction rates give clues as to whether a reaction will occur within the atmosphere or any other environmental compartments.", "For example, if an air pollutant is highly reactive (i.e. fast reaction rate) in water vapor that is dispersed and remains in a plume for days, it is quite likely that much if not all of the original compound will not be measured after that time. Instead, the compound\u2019s transformation products would be present. However, if a compound has a very slow reaction rate, most of it is likely to be found in the plume. This is known as the atmospheric residence time, which is often expressed as its atmospheric half-life, i.e. the time it takes for half of the mass of the substance to be degraded. Thus, reaction rates also give clues as to how a pollutant will behave in the environment. This is the concern of equilibrium and partitioning in the environment (see Chapter 18). Elemental mercury vapor (Hg0), for example, does not readily react with other atmospheric constituents. In addition, Hg0 has a very low aqueous solubility. These properties make for long atmospheric residence time (approximately one year).2,3 However, Hg0 can be transformed to more reactive species that have much higher aqueous solubility than the zero-valence form. Chemical transformation is explained by air pollution thermodynamics. Ecosystems and individual organisms and their components are systems.c Within the context of thermodynamics, a system is a sector or region in space or some parcel of a sector that has at least one substance that is ordered into phases. Reactors, stack gases, plumes, the open atmosphere, microenvironments, organisms and cells have qualities of both closed and open systems. A closed system does not allow material to enter or leave the system (engineers refer to a closed system as a \u201ccontrol mass\u201d). The open system allows material to enter and leave the systems (such a system is known as a control volume). In reality, air pollution results from complex interactions of substances in various states not only in the atmosphere, but in the many environmental media where substances are transformed. These transformations may render a compound that was previously not very toxic into a very toxic substance. Conversely, what may have been a precursor to an air pollutant may have been changed into a less toxic compound or compounds. During airborne transport, an air pollutant may also b At the time this section was written, various governmental and nongovernmental groups in the United States were debating whether CO2 should become the seventh criteria air pollutant under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of the Clean Air Act Amendments. One major question is whether indirect health effects, e.g. heat-related cardiovascular disease, should be considered strong enough rationale for this designation. c Unfortunately, the English language has numerous connotations of \u201csystems\u201d. Even scientists have various defnitions. For example, a more general understanding of scientists and technicians is that a \u201csystem\u201d is a method of organization, e.g. from smaller to larger aggregations. The \u201cecosystem\u201d and the \u201corganism\u201d are examples of both types of systems. They consist of physical phases and order (e.g. producereconsumeredecomposer; predatoreprey; individualeassociationecommunity; or celletissueeorganesystem). They are also examplesof another concept of systems, i.e. a means for understandinghow matter and energy move and changewithin a parcel of matter. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION undergo chemical changes. These changes may form toxic compounds or other types of problems, e.g. they may become stronger greenhouse gases. After deposition, chemical reactions occur in the soil, water, and biota. Thus, air pollutants are a mix of chemical reactions occurring at myriad rates. Air pollution seldom occurs in a single system. Indeed, a better way to consider these mixed systems is pseudo orders in the rate laws, i.e. \u201cpseudo-open\u201d and \u201cpseudo-closed\u201d systems. Applying the qualifer \u201cpseudo\u201d to absolute terms is a good way to describe the actual rates that occur in the environment, as opposed to well-controlled laboratory experiments. The rate law for a chemical reaction is an equation that links the rate of the reaction with concentrations of reactants and rate constants (commonly, partial order reactions and rate coeffcients). The rate is expressed as: r \u00bc k\u00bdA x \u00bdB y (17.22) where k is the rate coeffcient, the concentration of each chemical species are in brackets and the exponents are derived experimentally. A frst-order reaction occurs at a linear rate: d\u00bdA 1 r \u00bc\u00bc k\u00bdA \u00bc k\u00bdA (17.23) dt Similarly, a second-order reaction rate is: d\u00bdB 2 r \u00bc\u00bc k\u00bdB (17.24) dt or, d\u00bdB r \u00bc\u00bc kdt (17.25) 2 \u00bdB The rate equations for third and next orders would follow the same format.", "In air pollution, numerous reactants are involved in reactions. Thus, mixed second order rate reactions can be expressed as: d\u00bdB r \u00bc\u00bc k\u00bdB \u00bdA (17.26) dt When reaction rates exceed frst-order, the chemical concentrations can be adjusted so that the kinetics appears to be frst-order. So, for the simple reaction 2A \u00fe B / C, the rate law would be: 1d\u00bdA \u00bc k\u00bdA \u00bdB (17.27) 2dt Since the right side is a product of two reactants, the overall rate law is second order, but with excess concentrations of B, then [B] is almost completely changed in the reaction, i.e. [B] changes extremely more slowly than the change in [A]. In this instance, Eqn (17.27) can be better written as: 1d\u00bdA zk0\u00bdA \u00bdB (17.28) 2dt where k0 is a pseudo-frst-order rate coeffcient (units are inverse time, s 1). 17.3.1 Examples of Reaction Rate Order Extending the logic of the pseudo rate law to pseudo-open and pseudo-closed systems, the environment will be a mix of systems, none of which are completely open, closed, or isolated. Unlike a completely closed system, a microenvironment (e.g. roomin a home) that allows a small amount of energy and mass to fow in and out may be treated as a pseudo closed system, since like the pseudo-frst-order rate law, the infows and outfows may virtually not limit reaciton rates when compared to other factors. Even though the atmosphere is an open system, at certain scales and for defned conditions, it can be treated as a set of closed systems (e.g. layers that in fact allow heat exchange may be so different that each layer may be treated as a closed system). Another thermodynamic concept that is important to air pollution is the thermodynamic property, i.e. a trait or attribute that can be used to describe a system and to differentiate that system from others. A property must be able to be stated at a specifc time independently of its value at any other time and unconstrained by the process that induced the condition (state). An intensive property is independent of the system\u2019s mass (such as pressure and temperature). An extensive property is proportionality to the mass of the system (such as density or volume). Dividing the value of an extensive property by the system\u2019s mass gives a \u201cspecifc property\u201d, such as specifc heat, specifc volume, or specifc gravity. The thermodynamics term for the description of the change of a system from one state (e.g. equilibrium) to another is known as a process. Processes may be reversible or irreversible; they may be adiabatic (no gain or loss of heat, so all energy transfers occur through work interactions). Other processes include isometric (constant volume), isothermal (constant temperature), isobaric (constant pressure), isentropic (constant entropy), and isenthalpic (constant enthalpy). 17.3.2 Free Energy Free energy is the measure of a system\u2019s ability to do work. If reactants in a reaction have greater free energy than the products, energy is released from the reaction; which means the reaction is exergonic. Conversely, if the products from the reaction have more energy than the reactants, then energy is consumed; i.e. it is an endergonic reaction. Equilibrium constants can be ascertained thermodynamically by employing the Gibbs free energy (G) change for the complete reaction. This is expressed as: G \u00bc H TS (17.29) III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17.3 RATE LAWS AND AIR POLLUTION THERMODYNAMICS where G is the energy liberated or absorbed in the equilibrium by the reaction at constant T. H is the system\u2019s enthalpy and S is its entropy. Enthalpy is the thermodynamic property expressed as: H \u00bc U \u00fe pV (17.30) where U is the system\u2019s internal energy. The relationship between a change in free energy and equilibria can be expressed by: DG \u00bc DG 0 \u00fe RT ln Keq (17.31) f where DG 0 \u00bc free energy of formation at steady state f \u00f0kJg mol 1\u00de. In summary, the total energy in systems is known as enthalpy (H) and the usable energy is known as free energy (G). Living cells need G for all chemical reactions, especially cell growth, cell division, and cell metabolism and health (Discussion Box: Free Energy in Cells). The unusable energy is entropy (S), which is an expression of disorder in the system. Disorder tends to increase as a result of the many conversion steps outside and inside of a system. FREE ENERGY IN CELLS Thermodynamics is key to air pollution science and engineering.", "Heat exchange, partitioning, and other thermodynamic concepts are employed to determine the amount of air pollution generated, how an air pollutant moves after being emitted and the dynamics and size of air pollutant plumes. Another key area in need of thermodynamic understanding is the cell, whether a single-cell microbe or part of an organism, especially human cells. Since disorder tends to increase as a result of the many conversion steps outside and inside of the cell, the cells have adapted ways of improving effciencies. This is not only important to understanding how air pollutants disrupt cellular metabolism, but is key to fnding biological treatment technologies for air pollutants, once the mainly province of water and soil treatment. Bioengineers seek ways to improve these effciencies beyond natural Catabolism Energy source (e.g. sugar) Waste products (CO 2, organic acids) EnEnEnPre Cell ergy ergy ergy cursors Anabolism Biomass Walls, membranes , and other cell structures Proteins, nucleic acids\u2013 macromolecules Amino acids, nucleotides\u2013 subunits Nutrients (compounds containing N, S, P, etc.) FIGURE 17.5 Cellular metabolism results from catabolic reactions that break down compounds to gain energy that is used to build biomolecules (anabolic metabolism) from nutrients that are taken up by the cell, beginning with simple precursors, then subunits, macromolecules. From these biomolecules, the cellular structures are built. (Continued) III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION FREE ENERGY IN CELLS (cont\u2019d) acclimation. Thus, to understand both air pollution toxicity and air pollution control biotechnologies, the processes that underlie microbial metabolism must be characterized. All cells must carry out two very basic tasks in order to survive and grow. They must undergo biosynthesis, i.e. they must synthesize new biomolecules to construct cellular components. They must also harvest energy. Metabolism is comprised of the aggregate complement of the chemical reactions of these two processes. Thus, metabolism is the cellular process that derives energy from a cell\u2019s surroundings and uses this energy to operate and to construct even more cellular material. Energy that does chemical work is exemplifed by cellular processes (Figure 17.5). Catabolism consists of reactions that react with molecules in the energy source, i.e. incoming food, such as carbohydrates. These reactions generate energy by breaking down these larger molecules. Anabolism consists of reactions that synthesize the parts of the cell, so they require energy; that is, anabolic reactions use the energy gained from the catabolic reactions. Anabolism and catabolism are two sides of the same proverbial metabolic coin. Anabolism is synthesizing, whereas catabolism is destroying. But, the only way that anabolism can work to build the cellular components is by the energy it receives from catabolism\u2019s destruction of organic compounds. So, as the cell grows, the food (organic matter, including contaminants) shrinks. Air pollution biotechnology takes advantage of these two metabolic functions, depending on the microbial biodegradability of various organic substrates. The microbes CO + water in a bioflter, for example, use the organic compounds as their exclusive source of energy (catabolism) and their sole source of carbon (anabolism). These life processes degrade the pollutants (Figure 17.6).

TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17.3 RATE LAWS AND AIR POLLUTION THERMODYNAMICS FREE ENERGY IN CELLS ( cont\u2019d) Microbes, e.g. algae, bacteria, and fungi, are essentially miniature and effcient chemical factories that mediate reactions at various rates (kinetics) until they reach equilibrium. These \u201csimple\u201d organisms (and the cells within complex organisms alike) need to transfer energy from one site to another to power their machinery needed to stay alive and reproduce. Microbes play a large role in degrading pollutants, whether in natural attenuation, where the available microbial populations adapt to the hazardous wastes as an energy source, or in engineered systems that do the same in a more highly concentrated substrate (Table 17.2). Some of the biotechnological manipulation of microbes is aimed at enhancing their energy use, or targeting the catabolic reactions toward specifc groups of food, i.e. organic compounds.", "Thus, free energy dictates metabolic processes and biological treatment benefts by selecting specifc metabolic pathways to degrade compounds. This occurs in a stepwise progression after the cell comes into contact with the compound. The initial compound, i.e. the parent, is converted into intermediate molecules by the chemical reactions and energy exchanges shown in Figures 17.4 and 17.5.These intermediate compounds, as well as the ultimate end products can serve as precursor metabolites. The reactions (Continued) III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION FREE ENERGY IN CELLS (cont\u2019d) along the pathway depend on these precursors, electron carriers, thechemicalenergy, adenosinetriphosphate(ATP), and organic catalysts (enzymes). The reactant and product concentrations and environmental conditions, especially pH of the substrate, affect the observed DG values. If a reaction\u2019s DG is a negative value, the free energy is released and the reaction will occur spontaneously, and the reaction is exergonic. If a reaction\u2019s DG is positive, the reaction will not occur spontaneously. However, the reverse reaction will take place, and the reaction is endergonic. Time and energy are limiting factors that determine whether a microbe can effciently mediate a chemical reaction, so catalytic processes are usually needed. Since an enzyme is a biological catalyst, these compounds (proteins) speed up the chemical reactions of degradation without themselves being used up. They do so by helping to break chemical bonds in the reactant molecules (Figure 17.7). By decreasing the activation energy needed, a biochemical reaction can be initiated sooner and more easily than if the enzymes were not present. Indeed, enzymes play a very large part in microbial metabolism. They facilitate each Energy (with catalyst) Heat released to environment Products Energy Direction of endothermic reaction FIGURE 17.8 Effect of a catalyst on an exothermic reaction (top) and on an endothermic reaction (bottom). III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17.4 ATMOSPHERIC TRANSFORMATION FREE ENERGY IN CELLS (cont\u2019d) step along the metabolic pathway. As catalysts, enzymes reduce the reaction\u2019s activation energy, which is the minimum free energy required for a molecule to undergo a specifc reaction. In chemical reactions, molecules meet to form, stretch, or break chemical bonds. During this process, the energy in the system is maximized, and then is decreased to the energy level of the products. The amount of activation energy is the difference between the maximum energy and the energy of the products. This difference represents the energy barrier that must be overcome for a chemical reaction to take place. Catalysts (in this case, microbial enzymes) speed up and increase the likelihood of a reaction by reducing the amount of energy, i.e. the activation energy, needed for the reaction. Enzymes are usually quite specifc. An enzyme is limited in the kinds of substrate that it will catalyze. Enzymes are usually named for the specifc substrate that they act upon, ending in \u201c-ase\u201d (e.g. RNA polymerase is specifc to the formation of RNA, but DNA will be blocked). Thus, the enzyme is a protein catalyst that has an active site at which the catalysis occurs. The enzyme can bind a limited number of substrate molecules. The binding site is specifc, i.e. other compounds do not ft the specifc three-dimensional shape and structure of the active site (analogous to a specifc key ftting a specifc lock). The complex that results, i.e. the enzymeesubstrate complex, yields a product and a free enzyme. The most common microbial coupling of exergonic and endergonic reactions (Figure 17.8) by means of high-energy molecules to yield a net negative free energy is that of the nucleotide, ATP with DG \u00bc 12 to 15 kcal mol 1. A number of other high-energy compounds also provide energy for reactions, including guanosine triphosphate (GTP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), cystosine triphosphate (CTP), and phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP). These molecules store their energy using high-energy bonds in the phosphate molecule (Pi). An example of free energy in microbial degradation is the possible frst step in acetate metabolism by bacteria: Acetate \u00feATP/acetyl coenzyme A \u00feADP \u00fePi (17.32) In this case, the Pi represents a release of energy available to the cell. Conversely, to add the phosphate to the two-Pi structure ADP to form the three-Pi ATP requires energy (i.e. it is an endothermic process). Thus, the microbe stores energy for later use when it adds the Pi to the ATP. 17.4 ATMOSPHERIC TRANSFORMATION During their time in the atmosphere, chemical compounds generally become oxidized. Gases in reduced states undergo step reactions to form ionic substances, which are in turn washed out by rain and other precipitation, known in the atmospheric sciences as deposition.", "For example, hydrogen sulfde (H2S) is a reduced species of sulfur. After emission to the atmosphere, it is dissolved in water vapor and is oxidized to form sulfate compounds or anions. For example, sulfate ions are formed when hydrogen sulfde is hydrolyzed: H2S\u00f0g\u00de\u00feH2O\u00f0l\u00de/SO2 \u00fe4H\u00fe (17.33) 4 As mentioned, mercury can undergo chemical transformations in the atmosphere which change its properties, including its likelihood to accumulate in organisms. Mercury will react in gas, liquid and solid phases. Reactions with ozone 4 (O3)and OH radicals5 are the most important gas phase oxidation pathways. The Hg0 is oxidized to divalent (Hg2\u00fe), which is less volatile and more likely to condense on surfaces, including particulate matter and biota. When Hg is dissolved in water, it can be oxidized, e.g. by O3 and OH radicals.6,7 The Hg aqueous phase reaction rates are much faster than those in the gas phase. However, the low aqueous solubility of Hg0 and the low water concentrations in the atmosphere make for about equal amounts of transformations for gas and liquid phases. Incidentally, reduction also occurs in the atmosphere. For example, divalent mercury will be reduced to Hg0 if certain molecules, ions or radicals are present. For example Hg2\u00fe can be reduced to Hg0 if sulfur dioxide (SO2) is dissolved in water vapor or hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals are present. Numerous types of reactions occur in air pollution chemical transformations. Atmospheric chemical reactions are often differentiated as either photochemical or thermal (or dark). Photochemical reactions are the interactions of photons with chemical species to form products, which may undergo further chemical reactions. These subsequent chemical reactions are called thermal reactions. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION Atmospheric transformations are also differentiated as either homogeneous or heterogeneous. If the reaction only occurs in the gas phase, the reaction is homogeneous. If the reaction involves an interface with a surface of an aerosol or within a liquid droplet, it is heterogeneous. Another primary differentiation of reaction types is whether they are inorganic or organic reactions. 17.4.1 Inorganic Reactions The inorganic chemical species most important to atmospheric kinetics and transformation reactions can be grouped into fve classifcations8: 1. Odd oxygen species 2. Odd hydrogen species 3. Reactive nitrogen species 4. Reactive sulfur species 5. Reactive halogen species Odd oxygen species include O3, atomic O and O(1D), which is an O atom in an excited singlet state. Odd hydrogen species include OH, HO2, and atomic H. Reactive nitrogen species include NO, NO2,NO3, HNO2, HNO3, and NH3. Reactive sulfur species include SO2, SO3,H2SO3,H2SO4, and H2S. Reactive halogen species include F, FO, Cl, ClO, Br, BrO, I, IO, HCl, and Cl2. Solar radiation initiates the formation of free radicals. The internal energy of molecules is composed of electronic energy states. Molecules interact with solar radiation by absorbing photons, causing the molecule to undergo a transition from the ground electronic state to an excited state. The change in energy between the two states corresponds to a quantum or photon of solar radiation. The frequencies (n) of absorption are expressed by Planck\u2019s law: E \u00bchv \u00bchc=l (17.34) where h is Planck\u2019s constant, c is the speed of light, and v and l are the frequency and wavelength of the light of the photon, respectively. The photon is represented as hv. Molecules and atoms interact with photons of solar radiation under certain conditions to absorb photons of light of various wavelengths. Each molecule absorbs solar radiation at its own range of wavelengths (Table 17.3). An excited molecule can follow several pathways, including fuorescence, collisional deactivation, direct reaction, and photodissociation.d Transformations occur by rate order. The photolytic reactions discussed in the next section include TABLE 17.3 Bond Energy and Wavelengths for Important Bonds in Air Pollutant Molecules. The Likelihood of a Photolytic Reaction Depends on the Probability that a Compound Will Absorb a Specifc Wavelength of Light or on the Probability that the Excited Molecular Species Will Undergo a Particular Reaction Bond Bond Energy (kJ molL1) Wavelength (nm) OeH 465 257 HeH 436 274 CeH 415 288 NeH 390 307 CeO 360 332 CeC 348 344 CeCl 339 353 CleCl 243 492 BreBr 193 630 OeO 146 820 Felsot A. Abiotic/biotic degradation & transformation (environmental attenuation of contaminants) ES/RP 531dFundamentals of environmental toxicology. Richland (Washington): Washington State University; 2005. frst-order reactions in the troposphere. For example, ozone is photolyzed to O(1D) and molecular oxygen: O3 \u00fehv/O\u00f01D\u00de\u00feO2 (17.35)", "This is an extremely important frst-order transformation because the O(1D) is hydrolyzed in a second-order reaction to form OH, which is the most important oxidizing agent in the atmosphere: O\u00f01D\u00de\u00feH2O/ \u00fe2OH (17.36) Another frst-order photolytic reaction occurs when nitrogen dioxide is converted to atomic oxygen and NO: NO2 \u00fehv/O \u00feNO (17.37) The atomic O leads to the production of ozone in the atmosphere when it combines with molecular oxygen and a relatively nonreactive molecule (M): O \u00feO2 \u00feM/ \u00feO3 \u00feM (17.38) In the stratosphere, frst-order reactions include photolysis of molecular oxygen and nitrous oxide, which yield the atomic O needed to form the ozone layer: O2 \u00fehv/ \u00feO \u00feO (17.39) d Chapter 22 provides the reactions for each of these pathways for NO2. For example, for each photon absorbed below 400 nm, photodissociation occurs. For other photoabsorbers, HNO2 and aldehydes, the photodissociation process leads to the formation of free radicals. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17.4 ATMOSPHERIC TRANSFORMATION Another important frst-order reaction in the stratosphere is the photolytic transformation of greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, which slows its accumulation: N2O \u00fehv/ \u00feN2 \u00feO\u00f01D\u00de (17.40) Other frst-order reactions include those associated with chemical transfer across interfaces between physical phases (e.g. gaseliquid), such as those associated with acid rain. Heterogeneous reactions in a rain drop can break down nitric acid in the gas phase during washout, producing nitrate and hydronium ions in the rainwater: H2O\u00f0l\u00de HNO3\u00f0g\u00de! NO3 \u00feHNO\u00fe (17.41) Second-order reactions are actually the most common type of atmospheric inorganic reaction, including the reactions of radicals, such as Eqn (17.35). Others include the transformation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, the formation of HO2 and formation of nitrogen dioxide from nitric oxide: OH \u00feCO/ \u00feCO2 \u00feH (17.42) M H \u00feO2/HO2 (17.43) HO2 \u00feNO/ \u00feNO2 \u00feOH (17.44) Carbon monoxide is a quite conservative (i.e. nonreactive) air pollutant. One pathway for breaking down CO is by oxidation by molecular oxygen in water and sunlight.8 This can be ascertained by combining a number of the reactions discussed in this section: hv 2CO \u00fe3O2 \u00feH2O/2CO2 \u00feO3 \u00fe2OH (17.45) Second-order reactions also occur in the stratosphere, including the reactions involving O(1D): O\u00f01D\u00de\u00feO2/O \u00feO2 (17.46) O\u00f01D\u00de\u00feN2/O \u00feN2 (17.47) These reactions are involved in what is known as a null cycle, i.e. the net result of the reactions is that no products are formed or degraded, but light energy is absorbed and molecules are heated. However, when reactions 6.16 and 6.17 occur in the null cycle, that is how much of the ozone layer is formed8: hv 3O2/2O3 (17.48) Other second-order stratospheric reactions include the transformation of compounds involved in the destruction of the ozone layer, including halocarbons such as the chlorofuorocarbons. When these relatively stable compounds fnd their way to the stratosphere, the molecules and fragments of their molecules photodissociate to form radicals, including F, FO, Cl, and ClO. Second order reactions occur at extremely short wavelength ultraviolet radiation, such as: N \u00feO2/NO \u00feO (17.49) Including other reactions discussed in this section, a pathway explains how reactive NO and O are formed from relatively nonreactive molecular nitrogen and oxygen via ultraviolet radiation: hv N2 \u00fe2O2/2NO \u00fe2O (17.50) These radicals in turn react with ozone. Third and fourth-order reactions occur in the atmosphere. However, transition state and collision theories dictate that they are much less common than frst and second-order reactions. 17.4.2 Organic Reactions Rate reaction calculations for organic compounds are similar to those for inorganic reactions, but elementary reactions are not often applied to transformations of organic compounds in the atmosphere. More often, transformation pathways are described, such as oxidationereduction and degradation pathways. These are discussed under \u201cBiotic Degradation\u201d below. 17.4.3 Hydrolysis Compounds are degraded when they react with water. Hydrolysis is the potential of the chemical to be transformed into a byproduct and water. It has units of time for a pH of 7. A long hydrolysis time is of the order of many years. It contains the same root as photolysis, i.e. \u201clysis\u201d meaning to break down. Hydrolysis occurs in every environmental compartment and is a key part of metabolism by organisms. Molecules react with water vapor in the atmosphere. Hydrolysis is also important before and after the atmospheric residence of a pollutant. For example, complex molecules may be hydrolyzed by biotic and abiotic mechanisms, forming smaller, lighter molecules that have higher vapor pressures or that are more soluble in water. This increases the likelihood that they will reach the atmosphere.", "Following deposition, air pollutants may become hydrolyzed, making them more bioavailable and more likely to be taken up by organisms. Within organisms, hydrolysis is a key process in metabolism, making substances more polar (i.e. adding hydroxyl ions [OH ]), and increasing the aqueous solubility; thus, the compounds are more easily eliminated. Hydrolysis often occurs simultaneously with other chemical transformation mechanisms. For example, in thermal processes to break down large organic III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION molecules, hydrolysis occurs along with gasifcation, pyrolysis, and combustion9: C20H32O10 \u00fe x1O2 \u00fe x2H2O / y1C \u00fe y2CO2 \u00fe y3CO D \u00fe y4H2 \u00fe y5CH4 \u00fe y6H2O \u00fe y7CnHm (17.51) The coeffcients x and y balance the compounds on either side of the reaction. The delta under the arrow indicates heating. In many thermal reactions, CnHm includes the alkanes, C2H2,C2H4,C2H6,C3H8,C4H10, C5H12, and benzene, C6H6. Certain classes of chemicals hydrolyze extremely rapidly (e.g. a few hours), such as acid chlorides, epoxides and siloxanes. For these, knowledge of rate constant is not important since the reactions are considered to be immediate; meaning that the hydrolyzed products will comprise almost all of the mass reaching the troposphere. Hydrolysis is highly dependent on temperature, with slight changes dramatically affecting the rate of the reaction e.g. some reaction rates will more than double with a10 F increase.10 17.4.4 Multicompartmental Photochemical Transformation Within the atmosphere, photochemical reactions account for a substantial amount of transformation of air pollutants. As mentioned, solar radiation infuences the chemical processes in the atmosphere by interacting with molecules that act as photoacceptors. Free radicals are formed by the photodissociation of certain types of molecules. These free radicals are highly reactive neutral fragments of stable reactive molecules. Examples include atomic oxygen (O), atomic hydrogen (H), the hydroxyl radical (OH), and the hydroperoxy radical (HO2). Aldehydes are the principal photoacceptors in photochemical oxidant smog, NO2, nitrous acid (HNO2), and O3. Photo-dissociation depends on the energy provided by photons. Photochemical transformation was discussed in detail above under \u201cInorganic Reactions\u201d within the context of atmospheric transformation. However, photochemical degradation occurs in all compartments where sunlight is present. Indeed, a compound will often undergo several types of transformation, including abiotic, e.g. photolysis and biotic degradation (Figure 17.9). Photons (hv) interact with and transform the mole cules directly: A \u00fe hv/A \u00fe B (17.52) Photons also form many highly reactive atmospheric free radicals. Radicals are chemical species with an unpaired electron in the outermost shell. This unpaired electron imparts very high free energies to a radical, making it much more reactive than its nonradical counterparts (i.e. those with completely paired electrons). A chemical species with an odd number of electrons is a radical, whereas one with an even number of electrons is a nonradical.e NO is a radical since N has seven electrons and O has eight, for a sum of 15 electrons. However, HNO3 is a nonradical since H has one electron, N has seven and three O atoms (3 8) has 24 electrons, for a sum of 32 electrons.11 Given their reactivity, free radical concentrations are quite small in the atmosphere, usually <1 ppb. These relatively small numbers are crucial to most atmospheric transformations, given that free radicals actually transform most chemical species in the atmosphere. Thus, free radical kinetics plays a large role in air pollution kinetics.12 The very low atmospheric concentrations of radicals translate into very few collisions between molecules. However, reactions between molecules almost always involve at least one radical species. Given a radical\u2019s high free energy, they are generally formed endothermically from nonradical species, i.e. an external source of energy is needed. This energy is supplied by sunlight in the atmosphere: nonradical \u00fe hv/radical \u00fe radical (17.53) Equation (17.53) provides the frst step in the propagation of radical reaction chains, i.e. subsequent reactions of radicals with nonradical species: radical \u00fe nonradical/radical \u00fe nonradical (17.54) To conserve the total odd number of electrons, the reaction of a radical with a nonradical must always yield a radical. The radical produced then reacts with another nonradical, and so on. This propagation processes large numbers of nonradicals through the chain. A nonradical species produced in this manner may photolyze so that additional radicals are generated according to Eqn (17.54). This photolysis is known as a branching reaction because it accelerates (i.e. \u201cbranches\u201d) the chain by augmenting the reservoir of radicals. Truncating the chain requires reactions between radicals; that is, a radical plus a radical that produces a nonradical and a nonradical.", "The termination may also involve a third body (M), which is any relatively e The major exception is atomic oxygen, which has eight electrons but two unpaired valence shell electrons in its \u201ctriplet\u201d O(3P) ground state (2s22px22py12pz1). Thus, it is a radical; actually known as a biradical. Atomic oxygen has an even higher energy state given that all of its electrons are paired (2s22px22py2), yielding a \u201csinglet\u201d O(1D) state that is even more reactive than O(3P). III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17.4 ATMOSPHERIC TRANSFORMATION nonreactive molecule (often N2 and O2) that removes excess energy, dissipating it as heat: radical \u00fe radical \u00fe M/nonradical \u00fe M (17.55) Such termination reactions generally occur more slowly than propagation reactions because radicals are present at low concentrations and collisions between radicals are therefore relatively infrequent. 17.4.5 Biotic Transformation Organisms degrade compounds. Most biotic degradation occurs in water, soil, sediment, and biota. However, these processes determine the types of compounds that are emitted to the atmosphere. Basically, biotic transformations can be a combination of biological and nonbiologically mediated processes, including hydrolysis, oxidation, and reduction. There are also completely biologically mediated processes, especially conjugation. Conjugation reactions chemically link products of hydrolysis, oxidation, and reduction (i.e. phase I metabolites) to glutathione, sugars, or amino acids, so that the subsequent metabolites (i.e. phase II metabolites) have increased aqueous solubility and, hopefully, less toxicity than the parent compound. Certain molecules resist biodegradation in the environment. Their structure makes them unattractive as electron acceptors and donors to microbes. This recalcitrance is a function of both the chemical structure and the microorganisms\u2019 preferences for electron acceptance and carbon. Actually, recalcitrance is not limited to microorganisms but is also applied to plants. Plants have the inherent capacity to degrade xenobiotic pollutants, but they generally lack the catabolic pathway to provide complete degradation, i.e. mineralization, relative to microbes. In fact, current research is being directed toward the transfer of genes involved in xenobiotic degradation from microbes to plants to enhance specifc plant taxon\u2019s potential for remediating more III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION FIGURE 17.10 Attenuation and degradation mechanisms in macrophytic plants. A compound (xenobiotic) is stabilized or degraded in the rhizosphere, adsorbed or accumulated in to the roots and transported to the aerial parts, volatilized or degraded inside the plant tissue. Degradation generally involves enzymatic mediated metabolism (Phase I); conjugation (Phase II); and active sequestration (Phase III). Note: Active transporters are marked in the green box (GST \u00bc glutathione S-transferases; GT \u00bc glucosyltransferases; Mt \u00bc malonyltransferases; OA \u00bc organic acids).

(For color version of this fgure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) recalcitrant compounds, e.g. trichloroethylene, pentachlorophenol, trinitrotoluene (TNT), glycerol trinitrate, atrazine, ethylene dibromide, metolachlor, and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine.13 In fact, phytodegradation and microbial biodegradation are interrelated and mutual. Plant evapotranspiration, plantemicrobe rhizosphere degradation, and microbial metabolic processes are combined. For example in situ natural and engineered remediation projects take advantage of both plant life and microbial populations, with much of the degradation at the rootemicrobe interface (i.e. in the rhizosphere) in the soil (Figure 17.10). Biotic transformation is enhanced in plants through numerous processes. During phytoextraction, recalcitrant compounds are removed and stored. In fact, recalcitrant compounds may be stored without metabolism for protracted periods. Phytodegradation, on the other hand, occurs when plants can metabolize a compound. The metabolism during phytodegradation may resemble that of animal degradation of toxic substances.14 The microbial-macrophytic rhizosphere stabilization and degradation are enhanced by the plant roots\u2019 release of cometabolites and by the roots\u2019 facilitating soil aeration (Figure 17.10). Thus, the physical contact and the Phytovolatilization Phytoextraction Translocation Xenobiotic Rhizodegradation Rhizostabilization Rhizosphere biochemistry needed for degradation is improved when roots and microbes are both available in the right environment. The chemicaleorganismeenvironmental systematics inevitably leads to the question, then, as to what are the properties of molecules that render them recalcitrant? Why do some compounds that should be broken down, in fact persist in the environment for so long? Indeed, certain small, low molecular weight molecules can be recalcitrant. Some relatively low molecular weight compounds can last for years in the environment. This can result from the types of bonds, substitutions, stereochemistry and chemical conformation (e.g. when substituted halogens are arranged so that the molecule is smaller than other enantiomers). In addition, certain environmental conditions add to the likelihood of biotic transformation.", "Therefore, the time it takes to break down molecules is a function of the structure of the molecule, the carbon preference of the organism and the environmental conditions. Pharmacologists use some standard screening approaches to characterize chemicals with respect to their likely biological activity based on chemical structures. For example, certain general molecular properties will drive Xenobiotic Phytodegradation Cell wall Phase I Cytoplasm Phase III Enzymatic modification Sequestration Mt GT GST Phase II Conjugation Mt GST OA GT OA Vacuole Enzymatic degradation GST GT Mt OA III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 17.4 ATMOSPHERIC TRANSFORMATION the pharmacokinetics, i.e. the extent to which a chemical will be absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated after uptake into an organism. One model is the so-called \u201crule of fve\u201d, proposed by C.A. Lipinski,15 which predicts that a compound is less likely to be absorbed and to permeate cellular membranes if: 1. The structure includes more than 5H-bond donors, expressed as the sum of hydroxyl and amine groups, i.e. OHs \u00fe NHs; 2. The molecular weight is greater than 500; 3. The log of the octanolewater coeffcient (Log Kow)is greater than 5; 4. There are more than 10 H-bond acceptors (expressed as the sum of Ns and Os); and, 5. Compound classes that are substrates for biological transporters are exceptions to the rule. Thus, large,lipophilic molecules that promote electron acceptance will resist biological activity. This rule can be instructive for understanding recalcitrance. Both chemical detoxifcation and chemical metabolism in cells of unicellular and multicellular organisms are biological processes. The degradation of a compound is a product of these biological processes. Therefore, the breakdown pathways may be predicted to some extent based on a substance\u2019s inherent chemical and physical properties. In fact, personal care products and pharmaceuticals usually have to be somewhat recalcitrant to be used in the marketplace; otherwise their shelf life would be very short. For example, drugs must resist the effects of oxidation, heat, photolysis, and pH. Environmental fate of air pollutants and their degradation products can also be predicted to some extent using similar, general rules. The insecticide DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-bis-(parachorophenyl)-ethane] is structurally quite similar to another insecticide, methoxychlor [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4methoxyphenyl)ethane], except for the substitution at theoutside(para)positionsofthemolecules(Figure 17.11). The DDT molecule is more recalcitrant because its parasubstitutions are with chlorines i.e. para-chloro substitution, whereas the methoxychlor molecule is vulnerable to dealkylation of the para-methoxy (H3CO) groups. Most methoxychlor is likely removed from the air by wet and dry deposition processes within weeks. Although methoxychlor binds tightly to soil particles, it usually does not persist since it is readily biodegraded. However soil-binding can increase persistence, especially when oxidation is suppressed. As evidence, methoxychlor has been found to have a soil half-life as high as 120 days in some low oxygen soil conditions.16 Methoxychlor\u2019s degradation products are generally detected in lower levels of soil, probably because these compounds are more mobile than the parent methoxychlor. Methoxychlor has an affnity for sediment, so coupled with its biodegradability potential is seldom protected above detection levels in ground and surface waters, except near sources of release, likely to a large extent due to its low aqueous solubility (about 1mgl 1). These factors mean that the less recalcitrant methoxychlor is much less likely to bioconcentrate in organisms compared to DDT, which has a range of bio-accumulation in fsh, insects, and mammals.17 Likewise, the herbicides 2-4-D [2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid] and 2,4,5-T [2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid] are quite similar, but 2,4,5-T is much more recalcitrant due to the additional halogen (Cl) substitution (Figure 17.12). 2,4-D\u2019s half-life in soil is less than 7 days, predominantly due to microbial degradation.18 In water, biodegradation rates increase with increased concentrations of nutrients, sediment load, and dissolved organic carbon. Under oxygenated conditions the sediment half-life is 1 week to several weeks. Despite its short half-life in soil and in aquatic environments, it has been detected in ground and surface water in the United States and ground water in Canada.19 The biodegradation rates for 2,4,5-T would be lower in most environments, due to the interference and added recalcitrance from the additional Cl atom. Biotic and other transformations do not exclusively apply to an entire molecule. In fact, larger molecules are likely to contain different components with varied reactivity. One part of a compound may be susceptible to degradation while other parts are recalcitrant. For example, microbial enzymes can enhance the cleavage of one of a molecule\u2019s moieties (e.g. an aliphatic group) which may be readily mineralized. However, other moieties will be recalcitrant to the enzymatic attack.", "In fact, Methoxychlor1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4methoxyphenyl)ethane DDT 1,1,1-trichloro-bis-(parachorophenyl)ethane FIGURE 17.11 Structures of the insecticides and methoxychlor, showing the primary sites of attack. DDT is more recalcitrant than methoxychlor due to the chlorine substitutions, rather than the more easily degradable methoxy groups.

AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION FIGURE 17.12 Increased chlorine substitution of 2,4,5-T[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid] makes it more recalcitrant than the similarly structured 2-4-D [2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid].(For color version of this fgure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Additional Cl substitution adds to recalcitrance 2-4-D 2,4,5-T [2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid] [2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid] the remaining molecule could become even more recalcitrant and more toxic (i.e. a process known as biological activation). Therefore, the expected kinetics of an environmental system depends on the characteristics of the air pollutant, the environmental compartment, and the atmospheric conditions. The next chapter introduces ways to predict the partitioning of the pollutant to and from the atmosphere. QUESTIONS 1.

III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18 Air Pollutant Kinetics and Equilibrium 18.1 KINETICS VS EQUILIBRIUM Chapter 17 applies chemical kinetics to the inherent properties of chemical compounds within the context of air pollutant transformation. The processes in Table 17.1 indicate that physics, chemistry, and biology are intertwined. Also introduced in Chapters 6 and 17 is the relationship between intrinsic properties of the pollutants and the environmental compartments where they reside. That is, the physicochemical properties must always be considered simultaneously with environmental conditions to understand fully the types and orders of the reactions introduced in Chapter 17. This chapter applies a number of the processes that occur among environmental compartments to estimate the af\ufb01nities that a chemical compound has for the atmosphere, water, organic tissue, and other substrates at equilibrium.a Air pollution physics and chemistry are always considered together. The pollution processes are a function of both the chemical characteristics of the compartment (e.g. air) and those of the contaminant, because the inherent properties of the air pollutant are in\ufb02uenced and changed by the extrinsic properties of the air and other media. which it will reach the atmosphere and how long it will remain there. Consider the reversible reaction: aA D bB 4 cC D dD (18.1) Equation (18.1) is depicted in Figure 18.1. Initially (t0), the rate of the forward reaction is high and the rate of the reverse reaction is low. As the reaction proceeds, the rate of the forward reaction decreases while therateofthe reversereactionincreases. Thischanges when the reaction rates become equal, i.e. at tequil the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, i.e. system has reached equilibrium. Actually, the forward and reverse reactions continue at a microscopic scale, so it is more properly stated that the system has reached dynamic equilibrium. Recall from Chapter 17 that the reaction has a forward rate: kf\u00bdA a\u00bdB b (18.2) The reaction also has a backward rate: kb\u00bdC c\u00bdD d (18.3) A + B \u2192 C + D 18.1.1 Equilibrium and Partitioning Reaction A + B \u2194 C + D Kinetics Equilibrium C + D \u2192A + B The kinetics discussion in Chapter 17 provides the \ufb01rst step in understanding an air pollutant\u2019s af\ufb01nity for an environmental compartment and, conversely, its propensity to exit that compartment. This is known as environmental partitioning. After kinetics, the chemistry of the air pollutant reaches equilibrium. This explains how a pollutant will behave in the environment, including the extent to t 0 tequil Time FIGURE 18.1", "The change in rate of forward and reverse chemical reactions leading to equilibrium in a closed thermodynamic system. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) a Partitioning is commonly considered to be an equilibrium phenomenon. However, it certainly occurs under nonequilibrium conditions. The equilibrium assumption makes the mathematics easier, but partitioning occurs before equilibrium is reached. For example, an octanolewater coef\ufb01cient applies to equilibrium conditions where molecules moving between the octanol and water compartment are equal. Of course, before equilibrium occurred, molecules were already moving between the compartments.

Fluid properties have a great bearing on the movement and distribution of contaminants to, from, and within the atmosphere. Environmental partitioning relationships govern the \u201cleaving\u201d and \u201cgaining\u201d of pollutants among compartments, especially air, particles, surfaces, and organic tissues. These concepts may be applied to estimating and modeling where a contaminant will go after it is released. This movement is affected by sorption, solubility, volatilization, organic carbonewater partitioning, organic carboneair partitioning, and bioaccumulation. In chemodynamics, the environment is subdivided into \ufb01nite compartments. Thermodynamically, the mass of the contaminant entering and the mass leaving a control volume must be balanced by what remains within the control volume (a requirement of all the conservation laws). Likewise, within that control volume, each compartment may be a gainer or loser of the contaminant mass, but the overall mass must balance. The generally inclusive term for these compartmental changes is known as fugacity or the \u201c\ufb02eeing potential\u201d of a substance. It is the propensity of a chemical to escape from one environmental compartment to another. Combining the relationships between and among all of the partitioning terms is one means of modeling chemical transport in the environment.1 This is accomplished by using thermodynamic principles and, hence, fugacity is a thermodynamic term. The simplest chemodynamic approach addresses each compartment where a contaminant is found in discrete phases of air, water, soil, sediment, and biota. This can be seen graphically in Figure 18.2. However, a complicating factor in environmental chemodynamics is that even within a single compartment, a contaminant may exist in various phases (e.g. dissolved in water and sorbed to a particle in the solid phase). The physical 10 12345 6 789 Log Kow Affinity for particles in water and air FIGURE 18.2 Relationship between airewater partitioning and octanolewater partitioning and af\ufb01nity of classes of contaminants for certain environmental compartments.

Persistence and transport potential of chemicals in a multimedia environment. In: Proceedings of the SETAC Pellston workshop on criteria for persistence and long-range transport of chemicals in the environment, Fairmont Hot Springs, British Columbia, Canada, July 14e19, 1998. Pensacola (FL): Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry; 1999. interactions of the contaminant at the interface between each compartment are a determining factor in the fate of the pollutant. During a designated time period within a compartment, a contaminant may remain unchanged or it may move physically, or it may be transformed chemically into another substance. Actually, in many cases all three mechanisms will take place. One mass fraction will remain unmoved and unchanged. Another fraction remains unchanged but is transported to a different compartment. Another fraction becomes chemically transformed with all remaining products staying in the compartment where they were generated. And, a fraction of the original contaminant is transformed and then moved to another compartment. So, upon release from a source, the contaminant moves as a result of thermodynamics. Fugacity requires that at least two phases be in contact with the contaminant. For example, the octanol-water coef\ufb01cient (Kow) value is an indication of a compound\u2019s likelihood to exist in the organic vs aqueous phase.b b Because of the large range in values, Kow is reported as its logarithm, i.e. log Kow.", "In many texts, especially those of the biomedical and pharmacological sciences, as well as certain environmental and air pollution texts, the log octanol-water coef\ufb01cient is designated as log Pow, but most commonly as simply log P. The terms are synonymous. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18.2 AIR POLLUTION CHEMODYNAMICS This means that if a substance is dissolved in water and the water comes into contact with another substance, e.g. octanol, the substance will have a tendency to move from the water to the octanol. Its octanolewater partitioning coef\ufb01cient re\ufb02ects just how much of the substance will move until the aqueous and organic solvents (phases) reach equilibrium. So, for example, in a spill of equal amounts of the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), decachlorobiphenyl (log Kow of 8.23), and the pesticide chlordane (log Kow of 2.78), the PCB has greater than \ufb01ve orders of magnitude af\ufb01nity for the organic phases than does the chlordane. This does not mean that a great amount of either of the compounds is likely to stay in the water column, since they are both hydrophobic, but it does mean that they will vary in the time and mass of each contaminant moving between phases. The rate (kinetics) is different, so the time it takes for the PCB and chlordane to reach equilibrium will be different. This can be visualized by plotting the concentration of each compound with time (Figure 18.3). When the concentrations plateau, the compounds are at equilibrium with their phase. When phases contact one another, a contaminant will escape from one to another until the contaminant reaches equilibrium among the phases contacting one another. Kinetics takes place until equilibrium is achieved. We can now consider the key partitioning factors needed for a simple chemodynamic model. 18.2.1 Partitioning to Solids: Sorption The fate of an air pollutant can be estimated in part by differentiating the various ways that a contaminant will attach to or permeate into surfaces of solid phase particles. The mechanisms underpinning the af\ufb01nity for the solid phase can be combined into a general phenomenon called sorption, which is the process in which a contaminant or other solute becomes associated, physically or chemically, with a solid sorbent. The physicochemical transfer2 of a chemical, A, from liquid to solid phase is expressed as A\u00f0solution\u00de D solid [ A solid (18.6) The interaction of the solute (i.e. the chemical being sorbed) with the surface of a solid surface can be complex and dependent on the properties of the chemical and the solvent, which is usually water in air pollution applications. Other \ufb02uids are often of such small concentrations that they do not determine the ultimate solideliquid partitioning. While, it is often acceptable to consider \u201cnet\u201d sorption, there are four basic types or mechanisms of sorption: 1. Adsorption is the process wherein the chemical in solution attaches to a solid surface, which is a common sorption process in clay and organic constituents in soils. This simple adsorption mechanism can occur on clay particles where little carbon is available, such as in groundwater. 2. Absorption is the process that often occurs in porous materials so that the solute can diffuse into the particle and be sorbed onto the inside surfaces of the particle. This commonly results from short-range electrostatic interactions between the surface and the contaminant. 3. Chemisorption is the process of integrating a chemical into porous materials surface via chemical reaction. In an airborne particle, this can be the result of a covalent reaction between a mineral surface and the contaminant. 4. Ion exchange is the process by which positively charged ions (cations) are attracted to negatively charged particle surfaces and negatively charged ions (anions) are attracted to positively charged particle surfaces, causing ions on the particle surfaces to be displaced. Particles undergoing ion exchange can include soils, sediment, airborne particulate matter, or even biota, such as pollen particles. Cation exchange has been characterized as being the second most important chemical process on earth, after photosynthesis. This is because the cation exchange capacity (CEC), and to a lesser degree anion exchange capacity (AEC) in tropical soils, is the means by which nutrients are made available to plant roots. Without this process, the atmospheric nutrients and the minerals in the soil would not come together to provide for the abundant plant life on planet earth.3 These four types of sorption are a mix of physics and chemistry. The \ufb01rst two are predominantly controlled by physical factors, and the second two are combinations of chemical reactions and physical processes. Generally, III.", "TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND EQUILIBRIUM 4 sorption reactions affect the following three processes 1000 that affect the fate of an air pollutant: 800 1. The chemical contaminant\u2019s transport in water due to distributions between the aqueous phase and 600 Concentration of pyrene in solid phase(\u00b5g kg 1 ) particles. 2. The aggregation and transport of the contaminant as a result of electrostatic properties of suspended solids. 3. Surface reactions such as dissociation, surface catalysis, and precipitation of the chemical contaminant. Therefore, the types of sorption can be applied in speci\ufb01c ways to collect pollutants in air pollution control technologies. For example, collecting a contaminant on 400 200 0 the surface of a sorbent depends solely on adsorption, while applying a control technology that traps the pollutant within the sorbent makes uses of absorption. Thus, adsorption is often a very effective means of collecting air pollutants in the vapor phase (See Section 30.9 in Chapter 30). Many technologies make use of both, as well as cation and anion exchange and chemisorption (see discussion below and in Chapters 30 and 31). Researchers attempt to parcel out which of the mechanisms are prominent in a given situation, since they vary according to the contaminant and the substrate. When a contaminant enters the air, some of the chemical remains in the air, some in water droplets, and some of the chemicals are adsorbed onto the surfaces of the particles. Sometimes this sorption is strong due to cations adsorbing to the negatively charged particles. In other cases the attraction is weak. Sorption of chemicals on solid surfaces needs to be understood because they hold onto contaminants, not allowing them to move freely with the surrounding \ufb02uid, whether it be in the air, in a suspended droplet, or after deposition, in the soil solution. Indeed, sorption slows the rate at which deposited contaminants move downwardly through the soil pro\ufb01le. Contaminants will eventually establish a balance between the mass on the solid surfaces and the mass that is in solution. Recall that molecules will migrate from one phase to another to maintain this balance. The properties of both the contaminant and the matrix will determine how and at what rates the molecules partition into the solid and liquid phases. These physicochemical relationships, known as sorption isotherms, are found experimentally. Figure 18.4 shows three isotherms for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, pyrene, from experiments using different matrices, i.e. soils and sediments. The x-axis shows the concentration of pyrene dissolved in water, and the y-axis shows the concentration in the solid phase. Each line represents the relationship between these concentrations for a single type of matrix material. A straight-line segment through the origin represents the data well for the range of concentrations shown. Not all portions of an isotherm are linear, Concentration of pyrene in solution (\u00b5g kg 1) FIGURE 18.4 Three experimentally determined sorption isotherms for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, pyrene.

Linear chemical partitioning can be expressed as S \u00bc KDCW (18.7) where S is the concentration of contaminant in the solid phase (mass of solute per mass of soil or sediment); CW is the concentration of contaminant in the liquid phase (mass of solute per volume of pore water); and KD is the partition coef\ufb01cient (volume of pore water per mass of soil or sediment) for this contaminant in this soil or sediment. For many soils and chemicals, the partition coef\ufb01cient can be estimated using KD \u00bc KOCCorg (18.8) where KOC is the organic carbon partition coef\ufb01cient (volume of pore water per mass of organic carbon) and Corg is the soil organic matter (mass of organic carbon per mass of soil). This relationship is a very useful tool for estimating KD from the known KOC of the contaminant and the organic carbon content of the soil horizon of interest. The actual derivation of KD is 1 KD \u00bc CS\u00f0CW\u00de (18.9) where CS is the equilibrium concentration of the solute in the solid phase and CW is the equilibrium concentration of the solute in the water. Therefore, KD is a direct expression of the partitioning between the aqueous and solid (e.g. particle) phases.", "A strongly sorbed chemical like dioxin or the banned pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) can have a KD value exceeding 106. Conversely, a highly III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18.2 AIR POLLUTION CHEMODYNAMICS Concentration on solid surface (C sorb) hydrophilic, miscible substance like ethanol, acetone, or vinyl chloride, will have KD values less than 1. This relationship between the two phases demonstrated by Eqn (18.9) and shown in Figure 18.5 is roughly what environmental scientists call the Freundlich sorption isotherm: Csorb \u00bc KFCn (18.10) where Csorb is the concentration of the sorbed contaminant, i.e. the mass sorbed at equilibrium per mass of sorbent, and KF is the Freundlich isotherm constant. The exponent determines the linearity or order of the reaction. Thus, if n \u00bc 1, then the isotherm is linear; meaning the more of the contaminant in solution, the more would be expected to be sorbed to surfaces. For values of n \u00bc 1, the amount of sorption is in smaller proportion to the amount of solution and, conversely, for values of n \u00bc 1, a greater proportion of sorption occurs with less contaminant in solution. These three isotherms are shown in Figure 18.5. Also note that if n \u00bc 1, then Eqn (18.11) and the Freundlich sorption isotherm are identical. Research has shown that when organic matter content is elevated in the particle, the amount of a contaminant that is sorbed is directly proportional to the particle\u2019s organic matter content. This allows for the conversion of the KD values from those that depend on speci\ufb01c substrates, e.g. soil or sediment, and site-speci\ufb01c conditions to those that are substrate-independent and more generally applicable sorption constants, KOC: 1 KOC \u00bc KD fOC (18.11) where fOC is the dimensionless weight fraction of organic carbon in the particle.

San Diego (CA): Academic Press; 2000. volume. Table 18.1 provides the log KOC values that are calculated from chemical structure and those measured empirically for several organic compounds, and compares them to the respective Kow values. Sorption is arguably the most important transfer process that determines how bioavailable or toxic a compound will be in surface waters, but it is also very important for atmospheric transport. Surface watereatmosphere exchanges are a means by which large quantities of air pollutants reach the atmosphere. Also, sorption occurs at the microscopic scale in water droplets. In addition, chemical transport can occur to and from a solid particle via any \ufb02uid, including air as well as water. 18.2.2 Partitioning to the Liquid Phase: Dissolution Unless otherwise stated, one can usually assume that when a compound is described as insoluble, such a statement means that the compound is hydrophobic. However, in environmental matters, it can be dangerous to make such assumptions, since such wide range of scienti\ufb01c and engineering disciplines are involved. A good resource for contaminant solubilities for water, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethanol, acetone, methanol, and toluene is the National Toxicology Program\u2019s Chemical Solubility Compendium5 and the program\u2019s Health and Safety reports.6 The latter are updated frequently and provide useful data on properties of toxic chemicals. Most characterizations of contaminants will describe solubility in water and provide values for aqueous solubility, as well as a substance\u2019s solubility in other organic solvents, such as methanol or acetone. The process of cosolvation is a very important mechanism by which a highly lipophilic and hydrophobic compound enters water. If a compound is hydrophobic and nonpolar, but is easily dissolved in acetone or methanol, it may well end up in the water because these organic solvents are highly miscible with water. The organic solvent and water mix easily, and a hydrophobic compound will remain in the water column because it is dissolved in the organic solvent, which in turn has mixed with the water. Compounds like PCBs and dioxins may be transported as cosolutes in water by this means. So, the combination of hydr-ophobic compounds being sorbed to suspended materials and cosolvated in organic cosolvents that are miscible in water can mean that they are able to move in water and receptors can be exposed through the water pathways. Solubility is determined from saturation studies.", "In other words, in the laboratory at a certain temperature, as much of the solute is added to a solvent until the solvent can no longer dissolve the substance being added. So, if compound A has a published solubility of 10 mg l 1 in water at 20 C, this means that the 1 l of water could only dissolve 10 mg of that substance. If, under identical III.

Soil Screening Program. conditions, compound B has a published aqueous solubility of 20 mg l 1, this means that 1 l of water could dissolve 20 mg of compound B, and that compound B has twice the aqueous solubility of compound A. Actually, solutions are in \u201cdynamic equilibrium\u201d because the solute is leaving and entering the solution at all times, but the average amount of solute in solution is the same. The functional groups on a molecule determine whether it will be more or less polar. So, compounds with hydroxyl groups are more likely to form H-bonds with water. Thus, methane is less soluble in water than methanol. Also, since water interacts strongly with ions, III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18.2 AIR POLLUTION CHEMODYNAMICS salts are usually quite hydrophilic. The less the charge of the ion, the greater the solubility in water. 18.2.3 Partitioning to the Gas Phase: Volatilization In its simplest connotation, volatilization is a function of the concentration of a contaminant in solution and the contaminant\u2019s partial pressure. Henry\u2019s law states that the concentration of a dissolved gas is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution: pa \u00bc KH\u00bdc (18.12) where, KH is the Henry\u2019s law constant, pa is the partial pressure of the gas, and [c] is the molar concentration of the gas or, pa \u00bc KHCW (18.13) where CW is the concentration of gas in water. So, for any chemical contaminant we can establish a proportionality between the solubility and vapor pressure. Henry\u2019s law is an expression of this proportionality between the concentration of a dissolved contaminant and its partial pressure in the headspace (including the open atmosphere) at equilibrium. A dimensionless version of the partitioning is similar to that of sorption, except that instead of the partitioning between solid and water phases, it is between the air and water phases (KAW): CA KAW \u00bc (18.14) CW where CA is the concentration of gas A in the air. The relationship between the airewater partition coef\ufb01cient and Henry\u2019s law constant for a substance is: KH KAW \u00bc (18.15) RT 2 11 where R is the gas constant (8.21 10 l atm mol K ) and T is the temperature (K). Henry\u2019s law relationships work well for most environmental conditions. It represents a limiting factor for systems where a substance\u2019s partial pressure is approaching zero. At very high partial pressures (e.g. 30 Pa) or at very high contaminant concentrations (e.g. >1000 ppm), Henry\u2019s law assumptions cannot be met.", "Such vapor pressures and concentrations are seldom seen in ambient environmental situations, but may be seen in industrial and other source situations. Thus, in HENRY\u2019S LAW EXAMPLE At 25 C, the log Henry\u2019s law constant (log KH)for 1,2-dimethylbenzene (C8H10)is 0.71 l atm mol 1 and the log octanolewater coef\ufb01cient (log Kow) is 3.12. The log KH for the pesticide parathion (C10H14NO5PS) is 3.42 l atm mol 1,but itslog Kow is 3.81. Explain how these substances can have similar values for octanolewater partitioning yet so different Henry\u2019s law constants. What principle physicochemical properties account for much of this difference? Answer Both dimethylbenzene and parathion have an af\ufb01nity for the organic phase compared to the aqueous phase. Since Henry\u2019s law constants are a function of both vapor pressure (P0) and water solubility, and both compounds have similar octanolewater coef\ufb01cients, the difference in the Henry\u2019s law characteristics must be mainly attributable to the compounds\u2019 respective water solubilities, their vapor pressures, or both. Parathion is considered \u201csemivolatile\u201d because its vapor pressure at 20 C is only 1.3 10 3 kPa. Parathion\u2019s solubility7 in water is 12.4 mg l 1 at 25 C. 1,2-Dimethylbenzene is also known as ortho-xylene (o-xylene). The xylenes are simply benzenes with two more methyl groups. The xylenes have very high vapor pressures of 4.5 102 kPa, and water solubilities8 of about 200mgl 1at25 C. Thus, since both the solubilities are relatively low, it appears that the difference in vapor pressures is responsible for the large difference in the Henry\u2019 law constants, i.e. the much larger tendency of the xylene to leave the water and enter the atmosphere. Some of this tendency may result from the higher molecular weight of the parathion, but is also attributable to the additional functional groups on the parathion benzene than the two methyl groups on the xylene (Figure 18.6). Another way to look at the chemical structures is to see them as the result of adding increasing complex functional groups, i.e. moving from the unsubstituted benzene to the single methylated benzene (toluene) to o-xylene to parathion. The substitutions result in respective progressively decreasing vapor pressures: Benzene\u2019s P0at20 C \u00bc 12.7 kPa Toluene\u2019s P0at20 C \u00bc 3.7 kPa (Continued) III.

It is important to keep in mind that Henry\u2019s law constants are highly dependent on temperature, since both vapor pressure and solubility are also temperature dependent. So, when using published KH values, one must compare them isothermically. Also, when combining different partitioning coef\ufb01cients in a model or study, it is important to either use only values derived at the same temperature (e.g. sorption, solubility, and volatilization all at 20 C), or to adjust them accordingly. A general adjustment is an increase of a factor of 2 in KH for each 8 C temperature increase. Also, any sorbed or otherwise bound fraction of the contaminant will not exert a partial pressure; so this fraction should not be included in calculations of partitioning from water to air. For example, it is important to differentiate between the mass of the contaminant in solution (available for the KAW calculation) and that in the suspended solids (unavailable for KAW calculation). This Vapor pressure (kPa) FIGURE 18.7 Effect of functional group substitutions on vapor pressure of four organic aromatic compounds. o-Xylene\u2019s P0at20 C \u00bc 0.9 kPa Parathion\u2019s P0at20 C \u00bc 1.3 10 3kPa The effect of these functional group additions on vapor pressure is even more obvious when seen graphically (Figure 18.7). is crucial for many hydrophobic organic contaminants, where they are most likely not to be dissolved in the water column (except as cosolutes), with the largest mass fraction in the water column being sorbed to particles. The relationship between KH and Kow is also important. It is often used to estimate the environmental persistence, as re\ufb02ected in the chemical half-life (t1/2)ofa contaminant. However, many other variables determine the actual persistence of a compound after its release.", "Note in the table, for example, that benzene and chloroform have nearly identical values of KH and Kow, yet benzene is far less persistent in the environment. Persistence is also an important factor in removing and treating the pollutant, including the choice between abiotic chemical destruction versus biodegradation. With these caveats in mind, however, relative af\ufb01nity for a substance to reside in air and water can be used to estimate the potential for the substance to partition not only between water and air, but more generally between the atmosphere and biosphere, especially when considering the long-range transport of contaminants (e.g. across continents and oceans).9 III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18.2 AIR POLLUTION CHEMODYNAMICS Such long-range transport estimates make use of both atmospheric t1/2 and KH. The relationship between octanolewater and airewater coef\ufb01cients can also be an important part of predicting a contaminant\u2019s transport. For example, Figure 18.2 provides some general classi\ufb01cations according to various substances\u2019 KH and Kow relationships. In general, chemicals in the upper left-hand group have a great af\ufb01nity for the atmosphere, so unless there are contravening factors, this is where to look for them. Conversely, substances with relatively low KH and Kow values are less likely to be transported long distance in the air. Partitioning to Organic Tissue: Relatively hydrophobic substances frequently have a strong af\ufb01nity for fatty tissues (i.e. those containing high Kow compounds). Therefore, such contaminants can be sequestered and can accumulate in organisms. In other words, certain chemicals are very bioavailable to organisms that may readily take them up from the other compartments. Bioavailability is an expression of the fraction of the total mass of a compound present in a compartment that has the potential of being absorbed by the organism. Bioaccumulation is the process of uptake into an organism from the abiotic compartments. Bioconcentration is the concentration of the pollutant within an organism above levels found in the compartment in which the organism lives. So, for a \ufb01sh to bioaccumulate DDT, the levels found in the total \ufb01sh or in certain organs (e.g. the liver) will be elevated above the levels measured in the ambient environment. In fact, DDT is known to bioconcentrate many orders of magnitude in \ufb01sh. A surface water DDT concentration of 100 ppt in water has been associated with 10 ppm in certain \ufb01sh species (a concentration of 10,000 times!). Thus, the straightforward equation for the bioconcentration factor (BCF) is the quotient of the concentration of the contaminant in the organism and the concentration of the contaminant in the host compartment. So, for a \ufb01sh living in water, the BCF is Corganism BCF \u00bc (18.16) CW The BCF is applied to an individual organism that represents a genus or some other taxonomical group. However, considering the whole food chain and trophic transfer processes, in which a compound builds up as a result of predatoreprey relationships, the term bio-magnifcation is used. Some compounds that may not appreciably bioconcentrate within lower trophic state organisms may still become highly concentrated. For example, even though plankton have a small BCF (e.g. 10), if subsequently higher-order organisms sequester the contaminant at a higher rate, by the time top predators (e.g. alligators, sharks, panthers, and humans) may suffer from the continuum of biomagni\ufb01cation, with levels many orders of magnitude higher than what is found in the abiotic compartments. For a substance to bioaccumulate, bioconcentrate, and biomagnify, it must be at least somewhat persistent. If an organism\u2019s metabolic and detoxi\ufb01cation processes are able to degrade the compound readily, it will not be present (at least in high concentrations) in the organism\u2019s tissues. However, if an organism\u2019s endogenous processes degrade a compound into a chemical species that is itself persistent, the metabolite or degradation product will bioaccumulate, and may bioconcentrate, and biomagnify. Finally, cleansing or depuration will occur if the organism that has accumulated a contaminant enters an abiotic environment that no longer contains the contaminant. However, some tissues have such strong af\ufb01nities for certain contaminants that the persistence within the organism will remain long after the source of the contaminant is removed. For example, the piscivorous birds, such as the common loon (Gavia immer), decrease the concentrations of the metal mercury (Hg) in their bodies by translocating the metal to feathers and eggs. So, every time the birds molt or lay eggs they undergo Hg depuration.", "Unfortunately, when the birds continue to ingest mercury that has bioaccumulated in their prey (\ufb01sh), they often have a net increase in tissue Hg concentrations because the bioaccumulation rate exceeds the depuration rate.10 Bioconcentration can vary considerably in the environment. The degree to which a contaminant builds up in an ecosystem, especially in biota and sediments, is related to the compound\u2019s persistence. For example, a highly persistent compound often possesses chemical structures that are also conducive to sequestration by fauna. Such compounds are generally quite often lipophilic, have high Kow values, and usually low vapor pressures. This means that they may bind to the organic molecules in living tissues and may resist elimination and metabolic process, so that they build up over time. However, the bioaccumulation and bioconcentration can vary considerably, both among biota and within the same species of biota. For example, the pesticide mirex has been shown to exhibit BCFs of 2600 and 51,400 in pink shrimp and fathead minnows, respectively. The pesticide endrin has shown an even larger interspecies variability in BCF values, with factors ranging from 14 to 18,000 recorded in \ufb01sh after continuous exposure. Intraspecies BCF ranges may also be high, e.g. oysters exposed to very low concentrations of the organometallic compound, tributyl tin, exhibit BCF values ranging from 1000 to 6000.11 Even the same compound in a single medium, e.g. a lake\u2019s water column or sediment, will show large BCF III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND EQUILIBRIUM variability among species of fauna in that compartment. An example is the so-called \u201cdirty dozen\u201d compounds. This is a group of persistent organic pollutants that have been largely banned, some for decades, but that are still found in environmental samples throughout the world. As might be expected from their partitioning coef\ufb01cients, they have concentrated in sediment and biota. The worst combination of factors is when a compound is persistent in the environment, builds up in organic tissues, and is toxic. Such compounds are referred to as persistent bioaccumulating toxic substances (PBTs). Recently, the United Nations Environmental Program reported on the concentrations of the persistent and toxic compounds. Each region of the world was evaluated for the presence of these compounds. For example, the North American report12 includes scienti\ufb01c assessments of the nature and scale of environmental threats posed by persistent toxic compounds. The results of these assessments are summarized in Table 18.2 (organic compounds) and Table 18.3 (organometallic compounds). In the United States, mining and mineral extraction activities contribute the large quantity of PBTs, with energy production the second largest source category (Figure 18.8). Organometallic compounds, especially lead and its compounds comprise the lion\u2019s share of PBTs in the United States. And, the second largest quantity is represented by another metal, mercury, and its compounds (Figure 18.9). The sources of PBTs are widely varied. Many are intentionally manufactured to serve some public need, such as the control of pests that destroy food and spread disease. Other PBTs are generated as unintended byproducts, such as the PICs. In either case, there are often measures and engineering controls available that can prevent PBT releases, rather than having to deal with them after they have found their way into the various environmental compartments. 18.2.4 Concentration-Based and Fugacity-Based Transport Models Let us now combine these phase and compartmental distributions into a simple fugacity-based, chemodynamic transport model. Such models are classi\ufb01ed into three types: \u0081 Level 1 model: This model is based on an equilibrium distribution of \ufb01xed quantities of contaminants in a closed environment (i.e. conservation of contaminant mass). No chemical or biological degradation, advection (discussed in detail later), and no transport among compartments (such as sediment loading or atmospheric deposition to surface waters). A Level 1 calculation describes how a given quantity of a contaminant will partition among the water, air, soil, sediment, suspended particles, and fauna, but does not take into account chemical reactions. Early Level 1 models considered an area of 1 km2 with 70% of the area covered in surface water. Larger areas are now being modeled (e.g. about the size of the state of Ohio). \u0081 Level 2 model: This model relaxes the conservation restrictions of Level 1 by introducing direct inputs (e.g. emissions) and advective sources from air and water. It assumes that a contaminant is being continuously loaded at a constant rate into the control volume, allowing the contaminant loading to reach steady state and equilibrium between contaminant input and output rates.", "Degradation and bulk movement of contaminants (advection) is treated as a loss term. Exchanges between and among media are not quanti\ufb01ed. Since the Level 2 approach is a simulation of a contaminant being continuously discharged into numerous compartments and which achieves a steady-state equilibrium, the challenge is to deduce the losses of the contaminant due to chemical reactions and advective (nondiffusive) mechanisms. Reaction rates are unique to each compound and are published according to reactivity class (e.g. fast, moderate, or slow reactions), which allows modelers to select a class of reactivity for the respective contaminant to insert into transport models. The reactions are often assumed to be \ufb01rst order, so the model will employ a \ufb01rst-order rate constant for each compartment in the environmental system (e.g. x mol h 1 in water, y mol h 1inair, z mol h 1 in soil). Much uncertainty is associated with the reactivity class and rate constants, so it is best to use rates published in the literature based on experimental and empirical studies, wherever possible. Advection \ufb02ow rates in Level 2 models are usually re\ufb02ected by residence times in the compartments. These residence times are commonly set to 1 h in each medium, so the advection rate (Gi) is volume of the compartment divided by the residence time (t): 1 Gi \u00bc Vt (18.17) \u0081 Level 3 model: Same as Level 2, but does not assume equilibrium between compartments, so each compartment has its own fugacity. Mass balance applies to whole system and each compartment within the system. It includes mass transfer coef\ufb01cients, rates of deposition, and resuspension of contaminant, rates of diffusion (discussed later), soil runoff, and area covered. All of these factors are aggregated into an intermedia transport term (D) for each compartment. III.

Most PCB congeners, particularly those lacking adjacent unsubstituted positions on the biphenyl rings (e.g. 2,4,6-, 2,3,6-or 2,3,6-substituted on both rings) are extremely persistent in the environment. They are estimated to have t1/2 ranging from 3 weeks to 2 years in air and, with the exception of mono-and dichlorodiphenyl, more than 6 years in aerobic soils and sediments. PCBs also have extremely long t1/2 in adult \ufb01sh, for example, an 8-year study of eels found that the t1/2 of CB153 was more than 10 years. weight. DDT has been shown to have an estrogen-like activity and possible carcinogenic activity in humans. The maximum residue level in food recommended by WHO/ FAO, ranges from 0.02 mg kg 1 milk fat to 5 mg kg 1 meat fat. Maximum permissible DDT residue levels in drinking water (WHO) is 1.0 mgl 1. Highly toxic in \ufb01sh, with 96-h LC50 values in the range of 1.8 mgl 1 in rainbow trout to 22 mgl 1 in bluegill. Longterm exposure to 0.5 mgl 1 reduced egg viability to zero. The acute oral toxicity is in the range of 49 mg kg 1 body weight in dogs to 365 mg kg 1 in guinea pigs.", "In long-term studies NOEL in rats was 0.35 mg kg 1 bw day 1,LD50 ranging from 60 to 293 mg kg 1 bw. For toxaphene, there exists strong evidence of the potential for endocrine disruption. Toxaphene is carcinogenic in mice and rats and is of carcinogenic risk to humans, with a cancer potency factor of 1.1 mg kg 1 day 1 for oral exposure. Acute toxicity for mammals is moderate with an LD50 in rat of 235 mg kg 1 and dermal toxicity in rabbits of 80 mg kg 1. Mirex is also toxic to \ufb01sh and can affect their behavior (LC50 (96 h) from 0.2 to 30 mg l 1 for rainbow trout and bluegill, respectively). Delayed mortality of crustaceans occurred at 1 mgl 1 exposure levels. There is evidence of its potential for endocrine disruption and possibly carcinogenic risk to humans. LC50 for \ufb01sh varies between 50 and 200 mgl 1. The acute toxicity of HCB is low with LD50 values of 3.5 mg g 1 for rats. Mild effects of the (rat) liver have been observed at a daily dose of 0.25 mg HCB kg 1 bw. HCB is known to cause liver disease in humans (porphyria cutanea tarda) and has been classi\ufb01ed as a possible carcinogen to humans by IARC. LC50 for the larval stages of rainbow trout is 0.32 mgl 1 with a NOEL of 0.01 mgl 1. The acute toxicity of PCB in mammals is generally low and LD50 values in rat of 1gkg 1 bw. IARC has concluded that PCBs are carcinogenic to laboratory animals and probably also for humans. They have also been classi\ufb01ed as substances for which there is evidence of endocrine disruption in an intact organism. Polychlorinated dibenzop-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) (C12H(8 n)ClnO2) and PCDFs (C12H(8 n)ClnO) may contain between 1 and 8 chlorine atoms. Dioxins and furans have 75 and 135 possible positional isomers, respectively. Atrazine 2-Chloro-4(ethylamino)-6(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (C10H6Cl8). Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) 1,2,3,4,5,6Hexachlorocyclohexane (mixed isomers) (C6H6Cl6). Chlorinated paraffns (CPs) Polychlorinated alkanes (CxH(2xy\u00fe2)Cly).

PCDD/Fs are characterized by their lipophilicity, semivolatility, and resistance to degradation (t1/2 of TCDD in soil of 10e12 years) and to long-range transport. They are also known for their ability to bioconcentrate and biomagnify under typical environmental conditions. Does not adsorb strongly to soil particles and has a lengthy t1/2 (60e100 days). Atrazine has a high potential for groundwater contamination despite its moderate solubility in water. Lindane and other HCH isomers are relatively persistent in soils and water, with half-lives generally greater than 1 and 2 years, respectively. HCHs are much less bioaccumulative than other organochlorines of concern because of their relatively low lipophilicity. On the contrary, their relatively high vapor pressures, particularly of the a-HCH isomer, determine their long-range transport in the atmosphere. May be released into the environment from improperly disposed metalworking \ufb02uids or polymers containing CPs. Loss of CPs by leaching from paints and coatings may also contribute to environmental contamination. Short-chain CPs with less than 50% chlorine content seem to be degraded under Toxicological effects reported refers to the 2,3,7,8-substituted compounds (17 congeners) that are agonist for the AhR. All the 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDDs and PCDFs plus dioxin-like PCBs (DLPCBs) (with no chlorine substitution at the ortho positions) show the same type of biological and toxic response. Possible effects include dermal toxicity, immunotoxicity, reproductive effects and teratogenicity, endocrine disruption, and carcinogenicity. At the present time, the only persistent effect associated with dioxin exposure in humans is chloracne. The most sensitive groups are fetus and neonatal infants.", "Effects on the immune systems in the mouse have been found at doses of 10 ng kg 1 bw day 1, while reproductive effects were seen in rhesus monkeys at 1e2ngkg 1 bw day 1. Biochemical effects have been seen in rats down to 0.1 ng kg 1 bw day 1. In a revaluation of the TDI for dioxins, furans (and planar PCB), the WHO decided to recommend a range of 1e4 TEQ pg kg 1 bw, although more recently the acceptable intake value has been set monthly at 1e70TEQpgkg 1bw. Oral LD50 is 3090 mg kg 1 in rats, 1750 mg kg 1 in mice, 750 mg kg 1 in rabbits, and 1000 mg kg 1 in hamsters. The dermal LD50 in rabbits is 7500 mg kg 1 and greater than 3000 mg kg 1 in rats. Atrazine is practically nontoxic to birds. The LD50 is greater than 2000 mg kg 1 in mallard ducks. Atrazine is slightly toxic to \ufb01sh and other aquatic life. Atrazine has a low level of bioaccumulation in \ufb01sh. Available data regarding atrazine\u2019s carcinogenic potential are inconclusive. Lindane is moderately toxic for invertebrates and \ufb01sh, with LC50 values of 20e90 mgl 1. The acute toxicity for mice and rats is moderate with LD50 values in the range of 60e250 mg kg 1. In a number of studies, lindane resulted to have no mutagenic potential but an endocrine disrupting activity. Acute toxicity of CPs in mammals is low with reported oral LD50 values ranging from 4 to 50 g kg 1 bw, although in repeated dose experiments, effects on the liver have been seen at doses of 10e100 mg kg 1 bw day 1. Short-chain and mid-chain grades have been shown, in laboratory tests, to show toxic effects on \ufb01sh and other forms of aquatic life after long-term exposure.

CPs are bioaccumulated and both uptake and elimination are faster for the substances with low chlorine content. Estimated t1/2 in soils is between 1 and 2 years, whereas in air is much higher, up to 50 years. Not expected to hydrolyze, biodegrade in the environment. Also direct photodegradation and vaporization from what not signi\ufb01cant. General population exposure to chlordecone mainly through the consumption of contaminated \ufb01sh and seafood. Moderately persistent in soil, with a reported average \ufb01eld t1/2 of 50 days. The two isomers have different degradation times in soil (t1/2 of 35 and 150 days for a-and b-isomers, respectively, in neutral conditions). It has a moderate capacity to adsorb to soils and it is not likely to leach to groundwater. In plants, endosulfan is rapidly broken down to the corresponding sulfate, on most fruits and vegetables, 50% of the parent residue is lost within 3e7 days. Photodecomposition rate increases with pH (t1/2 100h at pH 3.3 and 3.5 h at pH 7.3). Complete decomposition in soil suspensions takes >72 days; other authors report t1/2 in soils of about 45 days. Although enriched through the food chain, it is rapidly eliminated after discontinuing the exposure (t1/2 10e24 h for \ufb01sh). Strongly adsorbed to soil and sediments and usually persist in the environment. Resists chemical and biological range of 2e5 mgl 1 for the most sensitive aquatic species tested.", "Workers exposed to high levels of chlordecone over a long period (more than 1 year) have displayed harmful effects on the nervous system, skin, liver, and male reproductive system (likely through dermal exposure to chlordecone, although they may have inhaled or ingested some as well). Animal studies with chlordecone have shown effects similar to those seen in people, as well as harmful kidney effects, developmental effects, and effects on the ability of females to reproduce. There are no studies available on whether chlordecone is carcinogenic in people. However, studies in mice and rats have shown that ingesting chlordecone can cause liver, adrenal gland, and kidney tumors. Very highly toxic for some species such as Atlantic menhaden, sheepshead minnow, or Donaldson trout with LC50 between 21.4 and 56.9 mg l 1. Moderately to highly toxic to bird species (Mallards: oral LD50 31e243 mg kg 1) and it is very toxic to aquatic organisms (96-h LC50 rainbow trout 1.5 mgl 1). It has also shown high toxicity in rats (oral LD50:18e160 mg kg 1, and dermal: 78e359 mg kg 1). Female rats appear to be 4e5 times more sensitive to the lethal effects of technical-grade endosulfan than male rats. The a-isomer is considered to be more toxic than the b-isomer. There is a strong evidence of its potential for endocrine disruption. Acutely toxic to aquatic organisms. Certain effects on human health. 24 h LC50 values for trout were reported as 0.2 mg l 1, and chronic toxicity effects were observed at concentrations down to 3.2 mgl 1. Mammalian acute toxicity of PCP is moderateehigh. LD50 oral in rat ranging from 50 to 210 mg kg 1 bw have been reported. LC50 ranged from 0.093 mg l 1 in rainbow trout (48 h) to 0.77e0.97 mg l 1 for guppy (96 h) and 0.47 mg l 1 for fathead minnow (48 h). Few toxicity data are available from short-term tests on aquatic organisms. The LD50 values of commercial mixtures show a relatively low order of acute toxicity (LD50 range class polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs). Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (C12H(10 n)BrnO, where n \u00bc 1e10). As in the case of PCBs the total number of congeners is 209, with a predominance in commercial mixtures of the tetra-, penta-and octa-substituted isomers. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) A group of compounds consisting of two or more fused aromatic rings. Phthalates Includes a wide family of compounds. Among the most common contaminants are: dimethylphthalate (DMP), diethylphthalate (DEP), dibutylphthalate (DBP), benzylbutylphthalate (BBP), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)(C24H38O4) and dioctylphthalate (DOP).

Found in sediment samples from the estuaries of large rivers and has been identi\ufb01ed in edible \ufb01sh. Biodegradation does not seem to be an important degradation pathway, but the photodegradation may play a signi\ufb01cant role. Have been found in high concentrations in marine birds and mammals from remote areas. The half-lives of PBDE components in rat adipose tissue vary between 19 and 119 days, the higher values being for the more highly brominated congeners. Persistence of the PAHs varies with their molecular weight. The low molecular weight PAHs are most easily degraded. The reported t1/2 of naphthalene, anthracene, and benzo(e)pyrene in sediment are 9, 43, and 83 h, respectively, whereas for higher molecular weight PAHs\u2019 t1/2 are up to several years in soils and sediments. The BCFs in aquatic organisms frequently range between 100 and 2000, and it increases with increasing molecular size. Due to their wide distribution, the environmental pollution by PAHs has aroused global concern. Ubiquitous pollutants, in marine, estuarine, and freshwater sediments, sewage sludges, soils, and food. Degradation (t1/2) values generally range from 1 to 30 days in freshwaters. from >1 to 21.5 g kg 1 body weight in laboratory rodents). Oral exposure of laboratory animals to PBBs produced body weight loss, skin disorders, and nervous system effects, and birth defects. Humans exposed through contaminated food developed skin disorders, such as acne and hair loss. PBBs exhibit endocrine disrupting activity and possible carcinogenicity to humans. Lower (tetra-to hexa-)", "PBDE congeners are likely to be carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, and/or neurodevelopmental toxicants. Studies in rats with commercial penta-BDE indicate a low acute toxicity via oral and dermal routes of exposure, with LD50 values >2000 mg kg 1 bw. In a 30-day study with rats, effects on the liver could be seen at a dose of 2 mg kg 1 bw day 1, with a NOEL at 1 mg kg 1 bw day 1. The toxicity to Daphnia magna has also been investigated and LC50 was found to be 14 mgl 1 with a NOEC of 4.9 mgl 1. Although data on toxicology is limited, they have potential endocrine disrupting properties, and there are concerns over the health effects of exposure. Acute toxicity of low PAHs is moderate with an LD50 of naphthalene and anthracene in rat of 490 and 18,000 mg kg 1 body weight respectively, whereas the higher PAHs exhibit higher toxicity and LD50 of benzo(a)anthracene in mice is 10 mg kg 1 body weight. In Daphnia pulex,LC50 for naphthalene is 1.0 mg l 1, for phenanthrene 0.1 mg l 1 and for benzo(a)pyrene is 0.005 mg l 1. The critical effect of many PAHs in mammals is their carcinogenic potential. The metabolic actions of these substances produce intermediates that bind covalently with cellular DNA. IARC has classi\ufb01ed benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, and dibenzo[a, h] anthracene as probable carcinogenic to humans. Benzo[b] \ufb02uoranthene and indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene were classi\ufb01ed as possible carcinogens to humans. Acute toxicity of phthalates is usually low: the oral LD50 for DEHP is about 26e34 g kg 1, depending on the species; for DBP reported LD50 values following oral administration to rats range from 8e20 g kg 1 body weight; in mice, values are approximately 5e16 g kg 1 body weight. In general, DEHP is not toxic for aquatic communities at the low levels usually present. In animals, high levels of DEHP damaged the liver and kidney and affected the ability to reproduce. There is no evidence that DEHP causes cancer in humans but they have been reported as endocrine disrupting chemicals. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a maximum admissible concentration (MAC) of 6 mgl 1 of DEHP in drinking water. 18.2 AIR POLLUTION CHEMODYNAMICS III.

Animal studies show that PFOS is well absorbed orally and distributes mainly in the serum and the liver. The half-life in serum is 7.5 days in adult rats and 200 days in cynomolgus monkeys. The half-life in humans is, on average, 8.67 years (range 2.29e21.3 years, SD \u00bc 6.12). Acute toxicity values for \ufb01sh, invertebrates, and algae range from 17 to 3000 mgl 1. In chronic toxicity tests the lowest NOEC are 6 mgl 1 in \ufb01sh and 3.7 mgl 1 in invertebrates. The threshold for vitellogenin induction in \ufb01sh is 10 mgl 1 for NP and 3 mgl 1 for OP (similar to the lowest NOEC). Alkylphenols are endocrine disrupting chemicals also in mammals. Moderate acute toxicity to aquatic organisms, the lowest LC50 for \ufb01sh is a 96-h LC50 of 4.7 mg l 1 to the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) for the lithium salt.", "For aquatic invertebrates, the lowest EC50 for freshwater species isa48-hEC50of27mgl 1for Daphnia magna and for saltwater species, a 96-h LC50 value of 3.6 mg l 1 for the Mysid shrimp (Mysidopsis bahia). Both tests were conducted on the potassium salt. The toxicity pro\ufb01le of PFOS is similar among rats and monkeys. Repeated exposure results in hepatotoxicity and mortality; the doseeresponse curve is very steep for mortality. PFOS has shown moderate acute toxicity by the oral route with a rat LD50 of 251 mg kg 1. Developmental effects were also reported in prenatal developmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit, although at slightly higher dose levels. Signs of developmental toxicity in the offspring were evident at doses of 5 mg kg 1 day 1 and above in rats administered PFOS during gestation. Signi\ufb01cant decreases in fetal body weight and signi\ufb01cant increases in external and visceral anomalies, delayed ossi\ufb01cation, and skeletal variations were observed. An NOAEL of 1 mg kg 1 day 1 and an LOAEL of 5 mg kg 1 day 1 for developmental toxicity were indicated.

The assumption of equilibrium in Levels 1 and 2 models is a simpli\ufb01cation, and often a gross oversimpli\ufb01cation of what actually occurs in environmental systems. When, the simpli\ufb01cation is not acceptable, kinetics must be included in the model. Numerous diffusive and nondiffusive transport mechanisms are included in Level 3 modeling. For example, values for the various compartments\u2019 unique intermedia transport velocity parameters (in length per time dimensions) are applied to all contaminants being modeled (these are used to calculate the D values mentioned above). Lead and lead compounds 97.5% 18.3 FUGACITY As mentioned, the af\ufb01nities of a compound for each phase foretells the amount and rate of transformation, transport, and fate of a chemical compound. This means that an air pollutant behaves in the environment in ways that can be expressed by the partition coef\ufb01cients. These coef\ufb01cients can be viewed as a potential. That is, at the time when equilibrium is achieved among all phases and compartments, the chemical potential in each compartment has been reached. Chemical concentration and fugacity are directly related to one another via the fugacity capacity constant, known as the Z value1: Ci \u00bc Zi$f (18.18) where: Ci \u00bc Concentration of substance in compartment i (mass per volume) Zi \u00bc Fugacity capacity (time2 per length2) f \u00bc Fugacity (mass per length per time2) Thus, at equilibrium, the fugacity of the system of all environmental compartments is: Mtotal f \u00bc P (18.19) \u00f0Zi$Vi\u00de i where: Mtotal \u00bc total number of moles of a substance in all of the environmental system\u2019s compartments; and Vi \u00bc volume of compartment i where the substance resides.

TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION reciprocal of the gas constant (R) and absolute tempera-density of the fauna tissue (rfauna), and the chemical subture (T).", "Recall that the ideal gas law states: stance\u2019s BCF, and inversely proportional to the contam nP \u00bc (18.20) V RT where: n \u00bc Number of moles of a substance P \u00bc Substance\u2019s vapor pressure Then, n P \u00bc $RT \u00bc f (18.21) V And, n Ci \u00bc (18.22) V Therefore, 1 Zair \u00bc (18.23) RT This relationship allows for predicting the behavior of the substance in the gas phase. The substance\u2019s af\ufb01nity for other environmental media can be predicted by relating the respective partition coef\ufb01cients to the Henry\u2019s law constants. For water, the fugacity capacity (Zwater) can be found as the reciprocal of KH: 1 Zwater \u00bc (18.24) KH This is the dimensioned version of the Henry\u2019s law constant (length2 per time2). Fugacity can be calculated for every environmental compartment. This is important for air pollutants that have sources throughout the environment. For example, many persistent organic compounds spend part of their life cycles in sediment reservoirs beneath surface waters. As evidence, substances like polychlorinated aromatic compounds (e.g. PCBs) that have been banned and not used for decades continue to be emitted to the atmosphere. In sediment, the fugacity capacity is directly proportional to the contaminant\u2019s sorption potential, expressed as the solidewater partition coef\ufb01cient (Kd), and the average sediment density (rsediment). Sediment fugacity capacity is indirectly proportional to the chemical substance\u2019s Henry\u2019s law constant: rsediment$Kd Zsediment \u00bc (18.25) KH As discussed in Chapter 8, exposure assessment of an air pollutant focuses on ultimate fate in a human or other organism. Fugacity explains the partitioning that allows that to happen, but it also explains how the pollutant enters and exits biota in ecosystems. For biota, particularly fauna and especially \ufb01sh and other aquatic vertebrates, the fugacity capacity is directly proportional to the inant\u2019s Henry\u2019s law constant: $BCF rfauna Zfauna \u00bc (18.26) KH As in the case of the sediment fugacity capacity, a higher BCF means that the fauna\u2019s fugacity capacity increases and the actual fugacity decreases. Again, this is logical, since the organism is sequestering the contaminant and keeping it from leaving if the organism has a large BCF. This is a function of both the species of organism and the characteristics of the contaminant and the environment where the organism resides. So, factors like temperature, pH, and ionic strength of the water and metabolic conditions of the organism will affect BCF and Zfauna. This also helps to explain why published BCF values may have large ranges. The total biochemodynamic partitioning of the environmental system is merely the aggregation of all of the individual compartmental partitioning. So, the moles of the contaminant in each environmental compartment (Mi) are found to be the product of the fugacity, volume, and fugacity capacity for each compartment: Mi \u00bc Zi$Vi$f (18.27) Comparing the respective fugacity capacities for each phase or compartment in an environmental system is useful for a number of reasons. First, if one compartment has a very high fugacity (thus, a low fugacity capacity) for a contaminant, and the source of the contaminant no longer exists, then one would expect the concentrations in that compartment to decrease rather precipitously with time under certain environmental conditions. Conversely, if a compartment has a very low fugacity, the contaminant would have a strong af\ufb01nity for that compartment and only after much energy is added would it move away (the PCB example above illustrates this problem) and decrease the chemical concentration of the contaminant in that compartment. Second, if a continuous source of the contaminant exists, and a compartment has a high fugacity capacity (and low fugacity), this compartment may serve as a conduit for delivering the contaminant to other compartments with relatively low fugacity capacities. Third, by de\ufb01nition, the higher relative fugacities of one set of compartments compared to another set in the same ecosystem allow for comparative analyses and estimates of sources and sinks (or \u201chot spots\u201d) of the contaminant, which is an important part of fate, transport, exposure, and risk assessments. Fugacity-based, multicompartmental environmental models take these relationships into account. The movement of a contaminant through the environment can be expressed with regard to how equilibrium is achieved in each compartment. The processes driving this movement III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND EQUILIBRIUM can be summarized into transfer coef\ufb01cients or compartmental rate constants, known as D values.2 So, by \ufb01rst calculating the Z values, as we did for toluene in the previous examples, and then equating inputs and outputs of the contaminant to each compartment, we can derive D value rate constants.", "The actual transport process rate (N) is the product of fugacity and the D value: N \u00bcD$f (18.28) And, since the contaminant concentration is Z$f,we can substitute and add a \ufb01rst-order rate constant k to give us a \ufb01rst-order rate D value (DR): N \u00bcV\u00bdck \u00bc\u00f0V$Z$k\u00de$f \u00bcDR$f (18.29) Although the concentrations are shown as molar concentrations (i.e. in brackets), they may also be represented as mass per volume concentrations.b Diffusive and nondiffusive transport processes follow Fick\u2019s laws, i.e. diffusive processes. They can also be expressed with their own D values (DD), which is related to the mass transfer coef\ufb01cient (K) applied to area A: N \u00bcKA\u00bdc \u00bc\u00f0K$A$Z\u00de$f \u00bcDD$f (18.30) Nondiffusive transport (bulk \ufb02ow or advection) within a compartment with a \ufb02ow rate (G) has a D value (DA) and is expressed as: N \u00bcG\u00bdc \u00bc\u00f0G$Z\u00de$f \u00bcDA$f (18.31) This means that a substance is moving through the environment, during its residence time in each phase, is affected by numerous physical transport and chemical degradation and transformation processes. The processes are addressed by models with the respective D values, so that the total rate of transport and transformation is expressed as: f\u00f0D1 \u00feD2 \u00fe Dn\u00de (18.32) Very fast processes have large D values, and these are usually the most important when considering the contaminant\u2019s behavior and change in the environment. Models, though imperfect, are important tools for estimating the movement of contaminants in the environment. They do not obviate the need for sound measurements. In fact measurements and models are highly complementary. Compartmental model assumptions must be veri\ufb01ed in the \ufb01eld. Likewise, measurements at a limited number of points depend on models to extend their meaningfulness. Having an understanding of the basic concepts of a contaminant transport model, we are better able to explore the principle mechanism for the movement of contaminants throughout the environment. 18.3.1 Fugacity Applied to Air Pollutant Exposure and Risk Fugacity models are an important part of ecological and human risk assessments and will be discussed in Chapter 27 with other air quality models. However, the explanation of fugacity is well-explained within the context of models; fugacity models are discussed here. Fugacity estimates calculated using models can be inserted into exposure and risk models. For example, the f and Z values ascertained above can be used in exposure models to estimate the amount of a contaminant a person may expect to contact in the various environmental media. Exposure models like the Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation (SHEDS) model now include fugacity modules. The model predicts chemical concentrations as functions of time, in various potential contact media (e.g. textured surfaces, smooth surfaces, and air) based on: a simple decay/dispersion model; time-speci\ufb01c distributions (<1 day, 1e7 days, 8e30 days, >31 days); or user-speci\ufb01ed time series from measurement studies or an external model. The SHEDS fugacity module divides a microenvironment (e.g. rooms within a house), e.g. rooms with vinyl \ufb02ooring, carpet, air, and wall compartments (Figure 18.10). Based on fugacity-based model inputs (Table 18.4), the module provides output concentrations of chemicals in time series for the different compartments and will be used as contacted concentrations for simulated persons in the microenvironments.3 18.4 INTEGRATING INHERENT PROPERTIES AND SUBSTRATE CHARACTERISTICS As discussed in Chapter 6, the measure of the amount of chemical that can dissolve in a liquid is called solubility. It is usually expressed in units of mass of solute (that which is dissolved) in the volume of solvent (that which dissolves). Solubility may also be expressed in mass per mass or volume per volume, represented as parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb), or parts per trillion (ppt). Occasionally, solubility is expressed as a percent or in parts per thousand; however, this is uncommon for contaminants, and is usually reserved for nutrients and essential gases (e.g. percent carbon dioxide in water or ppt water vapor in the air). b Throughout this text, bracketed values indicate molar concentrations, but these may always be converted to mass per volume concentration values.

The diversity of solubilities in various solvents is a fairly reliable indication of where one is likely to \ufb01nd the compound in the environment.

Research Triangle Park (North Carolina); 2007. one would expect TCDD to have a much greater af\ufb01nity for sediment, organic particles, and the organic fraction of soils. The low water solubilities indicate that dissolved TCDD in the water column should be at only extremely low concentrations. But, as will be seen in the discussion regarding cosolvation, for example, other processes may override any single process, e.g. dissolution, in an environmental system. Polarity is an important physicochemical characteristic of a substance that determines its solubility. The polarity of a molecule is its unevenness in charge. Since the water molecule\u2019s oxygen and two hydrogen atoms are aligned so that there is a slightly negative charge at the oxygen end and a slightly positive charge at the hydrogen ends, and since \u201clike dissolves like\u201d, polar substances have an af\ufb01nity to become dissolved in water, and nonpolar substances resist being dissolved in water. Increasing temperature, i.e. increasing kinetic energy, in a system increases the velocity of the molecules, so that intermolecular forces are weakened. With increasing temperature, the molecular velocity becomes suf\ufb01ciently large so as to overcome all intermolecular forces, so that the liquid boils (vaporizes). Intermolecular forces may be relatively weak or strong. The weak forces in liquids and gases are often called van der Waals forces. If a compound has high aqueous solubility, i.e. it is easily dissolved in water under normal environmental conditions of temperature and pressure, it is hydrophilic. If, conversely, a substance is not easily dissolved in water under these conditions, it is said to be hydrophobic. Since III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18.

(for all solvents except water). many contaminants are organic (i.e. consist of molecules containing carbon-to-carbon bonds and/or carbon-tohydrogen bonds), the solubility can be further differentiated as to whether under normal environmental conditions of temperature and pressure the substance is easily dissolved in organic solvents. If so the substance is said to be lipophilic (i.e. readily dissolved in lipids). If, conversely, a substance is not easily dissolved in organic solvents under these conditions, it is said to be lipophobic. Although many possible outcomes can occur after a substance is released into the environment, the possibilities can fall into three basic categories: 1. the chemical may remain where it is released and retain its physicochemical characteristics (at least within a speci\ufb01ed time); 2. the substance may be transported to another location; or 3.", "the substance may be changed chemically, known as the transformation of the chemical. This is a restatement of the conservation law. Every molecule of mass moving into and out of the control volume must be accounted for, as well as any chemical changes to the contaminant that take place within the control volume. A control volume may be a simple cube (Figure 18.11(A)) through which contaminant \ufb02uxes are calculated. However, a control volume can also be a cell within an organism, the organism itself (e.g. taking in substances, which it absorbs, metabolizes, distributes, and eliminates) or an entire ecosystem (Figure 18.11(B)). The \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics requires that any change in storage of a substance\u2019s mass in a control volume must equal the difference between the mass of the chemical transported into the system less the mass of the chemical transported out of the system. Given the transformations discussed in Chapter 17, the actual chemical species transported in may be different from what is transported. Thus, the mass balance equation may be written as: Accumulation or loss of contaminant A [ mass of A transported in L mass of A transported out reactions (18.33) The reactions may be either those that generate chemical A (i.e. sources), or those that destroy chemical A (i.e. sinks). The entering mass transported equals the in\ufb02ow to the system that includes pollutant discharges, transfer from other control volumes and other media (for example, if the control volume is soil, the water and air may contribute mass of chemical A), and formation of chemical A by abiotic chemistry and biological transformation. Conversely, the out\ufb02ow is the mass transported out of the control volume, which includes uptake by biota, transfer to other compartments (e.g. volatilization to the atmosphere) and abiotic and biological degradation of chemical A. The rate of change of mass in a control volume is equal to the rate of chemical A transported in less the rate of chemical A transported out, plus the rate of production from sources, and minus the rate of elimination by sinks. Stated as a differential equation, the rate of change contaminant A is d\u00bdA d\u00bdA dd\u00bdA \u00bc v$ \u00fe D$ \u00fe r (18.34) dt dx dx dx where: v \u00bc \ufb02uid velocity, d\u00bdA \u00bc concentration gradient of chemical A, and dx r \u00bc internal sinks and sources within the control volume. These rates operate at various scales. For example, Eqn (18.34) can be applied from the cell to the planet. It is even the basis for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling. Note that variable r is the focus of Chapter 17. A basic concept of air pollution is that substances tend to have af\ufb01nity for certain compartments in abiotic and biotic systems. Indeed, a symphony of mechanisms occurs. As mentioned, compound that is released into the atmosphere will remain there for some time. Thereafter, it III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION (A) Mass input Mass output Chemical and Fluid transport Fluid transport biological into control out of control reacons and volume volume physical change Input to atmosphere from aerosols may move to another compartment, remain unchanged for a designated time period, or it may move physically, or it may be transformed chemically into another substance. Partitioning occurs not only between an organism and the environmental compartments, but also within the organism. Air pollution and other health studies increasingly rely on biomarkers as indicators of concentrations that occur in control volumes where humans and organisms live. Physicians have used markers for decades, e.g. cholesterol, fat, and blood sugar. However, environmental toxicologists have adopted numerous chemicals to indicate pollution and its effect. Some of these chemicals are the parent substances to which the organism, including a person, has been exposed. A good example of this is the metal lead (Pb). The amount of lead in a child\u2019s blood or hair indicates the extent to which the child has been exposed to Pb. In this case, total mass of Pb is a reliable indicator of the time and activities of the child within various control volumes, e.g. microenvironments in the home (Figure 18.12). Given the r term in Eqn (18.34), however, the bio-markers are compounds other than the parent. Thus, biomarkers are often metabolites of the compounds. For example, smokers inhale nicotine, much of which is metabolized to cotinine (Figure 18.13). Thus, cotinine biomarkers can be measures of exposure to tobacco smoke. The four types of sorption take place at surfaces and are crucial to \ufb01lm and molecular exchanges.", "Biomolecules and xenobiotic compounds eventually establish a balance between the mass on the solid surfaces and the mass that is in solution. Molecules will migrate from one phase to another to maintain this III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18.

The properties of both the chemical and the soil (or other matrix) will determine how and at what rates the molecules partition into the solid and liquid phases. These physicochemical relationships, known as sorption isotherms, are found experimentally. Of principal interest in air pollution, after a chemical has moved through water, soil, sediment, or biota, it must move into the atmosphere. As discussed in Chapter 6, volatilization is a function of the concentration of a contaminant in solution and the contaminant\u2019s partial pressure. 18.5 MOVEMENT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor in a con\ufb01ned space. Similarly vaporization is the change of a liquid or solid to the vapor phase. So, if a substance vaporizes it can enter a plume. Thus, a principal means of a substance being released as a plume is volatilization, which is a function of the concentration of a contaminant in solution and the contaminant\u2019s partial pressure. That is, proportionality between solubility and vapor pressure can be established for any chemical. Such a proportionality is Henry\u2019s law, which states that the concentration of a dissolved gas is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution: pa \u00bc KH\u00bdc (18.35) where, KH \u00bc Henry\u2019s law constant, pa \u00bc Partial pressure of the gas, and [c] \u00bc Molar concentration of the gas. or, pa \u00bc KHCW (18.36) where, CW is the concentration of gas in water. Combining the concentration of a dissolved contaminant and its partial pressure in the headspace (including III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18.5 MOVEMENT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE the open atmosphere) at equilibrium is a reliable means of estimating the likelihood that a chemical will move into the atmosphere. A dimensionless version of KH partitioning is similar to that of sorption, except that instead of the partitioning between solid and water phases, it is between the air and water phases (KAW): CA KAW \u00bc (18.37) CW where CA is the concentration of gas A in the air. The relationship between the airewater partition coef\ufb01cient and Henry\u2019s law constant for a substance is: KH KAW \u00bc (18.38) RT 2 11 where, R is the gas constant (8.21 10 l atm mol K ) and T is the temperature ( K). Henry\u2019s law relationships work well for most environmental conditions, representing a limiting factor for systems where a substance\u2019s partial pressure is approaching zero. At very high partial pressures (e.g. 30 Pa) or at very high contaminant concentrations (e.g. >1000 ppm), Henry\u2019s law assumptions cannot be met. Such vapor pressures and concentrations are seldom seen in ambient environmental situations, but may be seen in industrial and other source situations. Thus, in modeling and estimating the tendency for a substance\u2019s release in vapor form, Henry\u2019s law is a good metric and is often used in compartmental transport models to indicate the fugacity from the water to the atmosphere. Henry\u2019s law constants are highly dependent upon temperature, since both vapor pressure and solubility are also temperature dependent. So, when using published KH values, one must compare them isothermically. Also, when combining different partitioning coef\ufb01cients in a model or study, it is important either to use only values derived at the same temperature (e.g. sorption, solubility, and volatilization all at 20 C), or to adjust them accordingly. A general adjustment is an increase of a factor of 2 in KH for each 8 C temperature increase. Any sorbed or otherwise bound fraction of the contaminant will not exert a partial pressure, so this fraction should not be included in calculations of partitioning from water to air. For example, it is important to differentiate between the mass of the contaminant in solution (available for the KAW calculation) and that in the suspended solids (unavailable for KAW calculation).", "This is crucial for many hydrophobic organic contaminants, where they are most likely not to be dissolved in the water column (except as cosolutes), with the largest mass fraction in the water column being sorbed persistence, as re\ufb02ected by the chemical half-life (t1/2) of a contaminant. However, many other variables determine the actual persistence of a compound after its release. Note in the table, for example, that benzene and chloroform have nearly identical values of KH and Kow, yet benzene is far less persistent in the environment. With these caveats in mind, however, relative af\ufb01nity for a substance to reside in air and water can be used to estimate the potential for the substance to partition not only between water and air, but more generally between the atmosphere and biosphere, especially when considering the long-range transport of contaminants (e.g. across continents and oceans). Such long-range transport estimates make use of both atmospheric t1/2 and KH.Also, therelationshipbetween octanolewater and airewater coef\ufb01cients can be an important part of predicting a contaminant\u2019s transport. As mentioned, Figure 18.2 provides some general classi\ufb01cations according various substances\u2019 KAW and Kow relationships. In general, chemicals in the upper left hand group have a great af\ufb01nity for the atmosphere, so unless there are contravening factors, this is where to look for them. Conversely, substances with relatively low KAW and Kow values are less likely to be transported long distance in the air. Since KAW is proportional to KH, these grouping also apply to Henry\u2019s law constants. In addition to the inherent properties of the compounds being degraded, the bioreactor processes take advantage of aerobic-heterotrophic-microbes\u2019 ability to use these substances as carbon and energy sources. Before this can happen, however, the contaminants and O2 must \ufb01rst move from the vapor phase to the aqueous phase where they can be metabolized by the microorganisms. Thus, even though these are volatile compounds they are actually exclusively treated in the aqueous phase. The volumetric mass transfer rate (mol m 3 s 1) of gaseous substrates (e.g. compounds to be treated, oxygen, and nutrients) to the aqueous phase is: ! SG K1aG=A SA (18.39) KG=A where, K1aG=A is the global volumetric mass transfer coef\ufb01cient (h 1), SG and SA are the substrate (e.g. benzene) concentrations (mol m 3) in the bulk gas and aqueous phases, respectively, and KG/A is the substrate partition coef\ufb01cient (dimensionless) between the gaseous and aqueous phases. KG/A is calculated as follows: to particles. The relationship between KH and Kow is also important. It is often used to estimate the environmental SGKG=A \u00bc SA (18.40) III.

In addition to the vapor phase and aqueous phase, there is also a nonaqueous (e.g. lipids) phase in the substrate (Figure 18.14).

This translates into a \ufb01lm pro\ufb01le, with sectors based on the octanolewater coef\ufb01cient (Kow) and KG/A. This partitioning can also occur between organisms and substrate, e.g. microbes, as depicted in Figure 18.15. The inherent properties of air pollutants discussed in Chapter 6 do not fully explain pollution. The vapor pressure and molecular weight, for example, will give clues to the behavior of an air pollutant, but are not de\ufb01nitive. The physicochemical properties must be combined with environmental conditions to characterize and estimate the fate of the pollutant.", "After entering the air, water, soil, and biota, a chemical compound will either remain in a compartment or move to another. Indeed, this is seldom an exclusive residence, as some of the chemicals remain and the rest will move to one or more other compartments. The propensity for this distribution is known as partitioning. Phase partitioning is also sometimes called \u201cphase distribution\u201d. Partitioning certainly is in\ufb02uenced by inherency. If a compound has high aqueous solubility, i.e. it is easily dissolved in water under normal environmental conditions of temperature and pressure, it is hydrophilic. That is, it is very likely to remain dissolved in water. If, conversely, a substance is not easily dissolved in water under these conditions, it is said to be hydrophobic, and many of its molecules will exit FIGURE 18.15 Gaseousenonaqueous hexane partition coef\ufb01cient (KG/NA) in organic solvents.

TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18.6 APPLICATION OF THE OCTANOLeWATER COEFFICIENT the water and enter compartments with substances of which the chemical has more af\ufb01nity, e.g. hydrophobic compounds in sediment or tissues in organisms. Thus, an inherent property, aqueous solubility is a factor of partitioning, yet does not fully predict the amount of a chemical that will be in each compartment. Such prediction is afforded by partitioning coef\ufb01cients. 18.6 APPLICATION OF THE OCTANOLeWATER COEFFICIENT The octanolewater partition coef\ufb01cient (Kow) is arguably the most commonly applied partitioning coef\ufb01cient for water systems, but it also has major applications in air and other media. Since many air toxics are organic compounds (i.e. consist of molecules containing carbon-to-carbon bonds and/or carbon-to-hydrogen bonds), the solubility can be further differentiated as to whether under normal environmental conditions of temperature and pressure the substance is easily dissolved in organic solvents. If so the substance is said to be lipophilic (i.e. readily dissolved in lipids). If, conversely, a substance is not easily dissolved in organic solvents under these conditions, it is said to be lipophobic. This af\ufb01nity for either water or lipids underpins an important indicator of environmental partitioning; i.e. the octanolewater partition coef\ufb01cient (Kow). The Kow is the ratio of a substance\u2019s concentration in octanol (C7H13CH2OH) to the substance\u2019s concentration in water at equilibrium (i.e. the reactions have all reached their \ufb01nal expected chemical composition in a control volume of the \ufb02uid). Octanol is a surrogate for lipophilic solvents in general because it has degrees of af\ufb01nity for both water and organic compounds, that is, octanol is amphibilic. Since the ratio forming the Kow is [C7H13CH2OH]: [H2O], then the larger the Kow value, the more lipophilic the substance. Values for solubility in water and Kow values of some important environmental compounds, along with their densities, are shown in Table 18.6. Table 18.6 elucidates some additional aspects of solubility and organic/aqueous phase distribution. Water solubility is somewhat inversely related to Kow, but the relationship is uneven. This results from the fact that various organic compounds are likely to have af\ufb01nities for neither, either, or both the organic and the aqueous phases. Most compounds are not completely associated with either phase; i.e. they have some amount of amphibilicity. The relationship between density and organic/ aqueous phase partitioning is very important to pollutant transport. For example a nonaqueous-phase liquid will partition at different rates in groundwater through the vadose (unsaturated) zone, depending on its density. A lighter compound may stay near the TABLE 18.6 Solubility, OctanoleWater Partitioning Coef\ufb01cient, and Density Values for Some Environmental Pollutants (at 22 C) Chemical Water Solubility L1(mg l) Kow Density L3(kg m ) Atrazine 33 724 Benzene 1780 135 879 Chlorobenzene 472 832 1110 Cyclohexane 60 2754 780 1,1-Dichloroethane 4960 62 1180 1,2-Dichloroethane 8426 30 1240 Ethanol Completely miscible 0.49 790 Toluene 515 490 870 Vinyl chloride Tetrachlorodibenzopara-dioxin (TCDD) 2790 1.9 10 4 4 6.3 106 910 Source: Hemond HF, Fechner-Levy EJ.

Also, what seem to be minor structural changes to a molecule can make quite a difference in phase partitioning and in density. Even the isomers (i.e. same chemical composition with a different arrangement) vary in their Kow values and densities (note the \u201c1,1\u201d vs \u201c1,2\u201d arrangements of chlorine atoms on 1,1-dichloroethane, and 1,2-dichloroethane, causes the former to have a slightly decreased density but twice the Kow value than the latter). The location of the chlorine atoms alone accounts for a signi\ufb01cant difference in water solubility in the two compounds. Movement in other environmental media often occurs prior to being released to the atmosphere. Most air pollution is emitted from stacks, vents, or ruptured containers above ground, but there are also sources that have their beginnings below ground. Leaking pipelines, underground tanks and contaminated soil, porous media, and water can be surreptitious sources of air pollutants. As mentioned, the relationship between density and organic/aqueous phase partitioning is very important to this type of pollutant transport, as shown in Figure 18.16. The transport of the lipophilic compounds through the vadose zone assumes that the compounds have extremely high Kow values and extremely low water solubility. That is, they have a greater af\ufb01nity for lipids than for water. As the aqueous solubility of a substance increases, its \ufb02ow will increasingly follow the water \ufb02ow lines. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND EQUILIBRIUM Source of dense, miscible fluid When a dense, miscible \ufb02uid seeps into the zone of saturation, the dense contaminants move downward. When these contaminants reach the bottom of the aquifer, the shape and slope of the underlying bedrock or relatively impervious layer dictates their continued movement of the contaminant plume, which will likely be in a direction other than the \ufb02ow of the groundwater in the aquifer. Solution and dispersion near the boundaries of the plume will induce the formation of a secondary plume that will generally follow the direction of groundwater \ufb02ow. The physics of this system points how predicting where the plume is heading will entail more than the \ufb02uid densities, and the need to know the characteristics of the contaminants in the plume, including their solubility and phase partitioning. So, monitoring wells will need to be installed upstream and downstream from the source. Another possibility is that the water may contain an amphiphilic compound (e.g. an alcohol) or a surfactant, which dissolves both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. As such, even a highly lipophilic compound may be dissolved by this solvent or surfactant which is carried with the water and ultimately is volatilized into the atmosphere. If a source consists entirely of a light, hydrophilic \ufb02uid, the plume may be characterized as shown in Figure 18.17. Low-density organic \ufb02uids, however, often are highly volatile; i.e. their vapor pressures are suf\ufb01ciently high to change phases from liquid to gas. So, another physicochemical property of environmental \ufb02uids, vapor pressure, must be considered along with density and solubility. An important process in plume migration is that of cosolvation, the process where a substance is \ufb01rst dissolved in one solvent and then the new solution is mixed with another solvent. As mentioned, with increasing aqueous solubility, a pollutant will travel along the \ufb02ow lines of the ground or surface water. Nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) are an important class of chemicals that contaminate aquifers. If heavier than water they are known as dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPs). By de\ufb01nition, such chemicals resist being dissolved in water. However, even a substance with low aqueous solubility can follow the \ufb02ow under certain conditions. As evidence, a hydrophobic compound like a chlorinated benzene (DNAPL), which has very low solubility in pure water, can migrate into and within water bodies if it is \ufb01rst dissolved in an alcohol or an organic solvent (e.g. toluene). So, a DNAPL will migrate downward because its density is less than that of water. Likewise, the ordinarily lipophilic and low density compound can be transported in the vadose zone or upper part of the zone of saturation if it has undergone cosolvation with a DNAPL.", "Thus, the cosolvation of a light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL), e.g. toluene, with a DNAPL in water could explain at least in part why a LNAPL is found in the lower part of an aquifer, as well as why a DNAPL is found in the upper part of the aquifer. Contaminants are often mixtures. The constituents in these mixtures will partition within an environmental compartment at different rates. For example, the dense substance that moves toward the bottom of the aquifer in Figure 18.17 with time may partition between lighter and denser constituents. The lighter constituents will be more likely to migrate upward and could become air III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION Source of light, miscible pollutants via volatilization than the denser constituents of the mixture, which will likely remain below the surface. However, this should be considered along with other inherent properties and environmental conditions. For example, even the denser constituents may migrate if they become sorbed to particles that migrate. In addition, some of the constituents may differentially migrate as a result of cosolvation. Others may resist dissolution and continue to migrate downwardly. The bottom line is that Kow must be applied to each constituent and that partitioning is highly speci\ufb01c to environmental conditions. 18.7 PARTITIONING BETWEEN AIR AND TISSUE The principal interest in partitioning between an organic substrate and water, i.e. the Kow, was mainly the need of water pollution. Air pollution also needs a means of characterizing this partitioning for organic air pollutants in terms of sources likely to release the organic air pollutants. However, organic solvent and water partitioning is not completely useful for understanding the movement of substances among organic substrates and the air, especially within the lungs. Although both systems derive O2 that is dissolved in a substrate (water or air), Kow is very useful for gills, but much less useful for lungs. Thus, the octanoleair partitioning coef\ufb01cient (Koa) was established. Models have been developed to combine Kow and the Henry\u2019s law constant (KH) to estimate the equilibrium between air and organic tissues. Henry\u2019s law constant and the Koa are physicalechemical properties that are often not measured but are needed to understand the environmental fate and transport of chemicals. As mentioned, Henry\u2019s law constant is the airewater partition coef\ufb01cient, which is the ratio of vapor pressure to solubility in water, corrected for molecular weight. It is commonly reported with units of atm m3 mol 1 or, if it is a unitless value, it is reported as the airewater partitioning coef\ufb01cient (KAW). The conventional Henry\u2019s law constant is calculated as: P MW KH \u00bc (18.41) 760 Csol where, P \u00bc vapor pressure (torr); MW \u00bc molecular weight (g mol 1); 760 \u00bc conversion factor (1 atm \u00bc 760 torr), and Csol \u00bc water solubility (mg l 1). The resulting units for KH are atm m3 mol 1. The units of mg and liter (l) cancel since there are 1000 mg in 1 g and 0.001 m3 in 1 l. Thus, if two compounds have the same vapor pressure and aqueous solubility, the heavier compound will have a greater resistance to movement, i.e. less fugacity, than the lighter compound. Similarly, if two compounds have the same vapor pressure, the one that is more soluble in water will have less fugacity. The unitless Henry\u2019s law constant (KAW) is calculated as: Cair KH KAW \u00bc\u00bc (18.42) Cwater R$T where R is the ideal gas constant of 8.205746 5 311 10 atmmK mol; T is absolute temperature III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND EQUILIBRIUM expressed in kelvin ( K); and KH is expressed in atm m3 mol 1. Use parameters measured or calculated for the same temperature (e.g. 25 C). 18.7.1 Calculating the OctanoleAir Partition Coeffcient For air pollutants, partitioning between organic compounds and water, i.e. Kow, is often insuf\ufb01cient to estimate transport and fate. Air is another \ufb02uid from which compounds partition. Thus, the potential air pollutant transport and bioaccumulation calls for another partitioning between air and the organic phase, analogous to the partitioning between the water and organic phase. This is the octanoleair coef\ufb01cient (Koa) for a chemical compound.7 The Koa is the ratio of the concentration of a compound in an organic phase (n-octanol) and air at Cair Coctanol equilibrium \u00bc ,where Coctanol and Cair Cwater Cair represent equilibrium concentrations in air and n-octanol with the same units.", "The Koa has been used to describe partitioning between air and aerosol particles, air and foliage, and air and soil.8,9 Handbook values are available, but measured Koa values may be substantially different than calculated values, so measured values are preferred.8 In the absence of data, Koa values calculated using a quantitative structural activity relationship (QSAR) calculator, such as EPI Suite&#1;9 and the following equations: Kow$R$T Koa \u00bc (18.43) KH where, Kow is the n-octanolewater partition coef\ufb01cient (unitless)10; R is the ideal gas constant \u00bc 8.205746 5 311 10 atmmK mol ; T is absolute temperature expressed in kelvin (K); and KH is the Henry\u2019s law constant expressed in atm m3 mol 1. The ideal gas law assumptions can simplify the equation to a relationship between water and air partitioning, i.e. Kow and Koa: Kow Koa \u00bc (18.44)KAW KAW is the airewater partition coef\ufb01cient (unitless). When a measured Koa is not available and long-range transport or terrestrial bioaccumulation may be a concern, the Koa can be calculated by using Eqn (18.35) when measured Kow and vapor pressure or Henry\u2019s law constant are available. If these are not available, a QSAR approach is recommended (e.g. EPI Suite&#1;). The published values for these key partitioning coef\ufb01cients are given in Table 18.7. Note that partitioning coef\ufb01cients in Table 18.7 are reported as log values. This is because the ranges are so large that logelog relationships are commonly used, including for comparing chemicals\u2019 af\ufb01nities. Thus, Eqn (18.44) can be restated as: log Koa \u00bc log Kow log KAW (18.45) The values in Table 18.7 demonstrate the variability of estimates depending on the method used. For example, the published log Koa for methyl isocyanate (MIC) is 2.112; so taking its antilog gives a Koa \u00bc 129. However, calculating Koa from Eqn (18.44) gives an estimated value: log Koa \u00bc log Kow log KAW \u00bc 0:79 \u00f0 1:4222\u00dez1:5: The calculated value is 0.7 less than the measured or published value. The difference means that the calculated Koa is underreported by about one-third. Thus, if the calculated value is used, the af\ufb01nity for tissue is understated. That is, the MIC is less likely to exit from tissue into air than the calculated value indicates. The published log Koa for formaldehyde is 2.77. Calculating an estimate for Koa from Eqn (18.44) gives: log Koa \u00bc log Kow log KAW \u00bc 0:35 \u00f0 4:861\u00dez4:81: This difference is a large discrepancy, i.e. two orders of magnitude between the two methods. As for MIC, the calculated method underestimates formaldehyde\u2019s af\ufb01nity for tissue and overestimates its likelihood to move into the air. These differences may be explained somewhat by the fact that the calculation is actually a rule of thumb. Each partitioning coef\ufb01cient is measured differently. For example, Kow is actually not usually calculated as partitioning between pure octanol and pure water; rather the measurement re\ufb02ects octanol saturated with water and water saturated with octanol.11 Whenever the inherent properties like solubility and vapor pressure are incorrect, derived properties like Kow, KAW, and Koa will propagate and amplify such error. These differences also appear in the organic carbon partitioning coef\ufb01cients (KOC), i.e. the two right columns in Table 18.7, with large discrepancies between QSAR and Kow-based KOC values. This is a reminder that octanol is merely a surrogate or indicator of the organic phase. This problem emphasizes that an actual, published Koa based on credible methods is preferred whenever possible. 18.8 DYNAMICS WITHIN AN ORGANISM Air pollutant transport and fate focus on the kinetics and equilibria of the processes leading to the III.

These same physical and chemical processes take place within an organism after uptake. The importance of the factors can be very different within the organism.

The reaction rates and equilibria differ, as do residence times and half-lives of chemical processes. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 18. AIR POLLUTANT KINETICS AND EQUILIBRIUM However, the laws of thermodynamics and motion apply at every level of interest to air pollution, from cells to the planet. QUESTIONS 1. Describe two conditions that would shift the following reaction to the kinetics region: 2HCl 4 H2 D Cl2 2. Why is it more appropriate to refer to equilibrium conditions in the atmosphere as being in \u201cdynamic equilibrium\u201d rather than simply in \u201cequilibrium\u201d? 3. Give an example of an air pollution scenario for each of the four sorption mechanisms. 4. Identify a chemical compound that has an af\ufb01nity for particle in both air and water. Support your choice. 5. Identify a chemical compound that has a high af\ufb01nity for atmospheric transport in its vapor phase. Support your choice. 6. Identify a chemical compound that is likely to be dissolved in water, so is more likely to be transported as an aerosol in the atmosphere than in its vapor phase. Support your choice. 7. Why are log values used so often for partitioning coef\ufb01cients? 8. Consider the choice of octanol to represent the lipophilic component of Kow. Why, for example, would it be used rather than a more hydrophobic halogenated organic compound, like hexachlorobenzene? 9. What happens to a compound\u2019s Kow value with increasing temperature? 10. At pH \u00bc 7 and 25 C, the concentration of compound A is found to be 15 mgl 1 sorbed by the solid phase and 0.015 mgl 1 and the concentration of compound B is found to be 150 mgkg 1 sorbed by the solid phase and 250 mgkg 1. What can you say about the sorption partitioning of these two compounds? What would help this statement to become more generalized? 11. An aerosol sample is analyzed and detects two organic compounds, one with log KD \u00bc 1.7lkg 1 and one with log KD \u00bc 2.5 l kg 1. The aerosol has a weight fraction of organic carbon equal to 0.014. What are the expected log KOC values for these two compounds? Which chemical has a stronger af\ufb01nity for the organic fraction of a particle? Explain. 12. Compare Henry\u2019s law to Raoult\u2019s law. How do they differ? 13. A laboratory synthesizes air for an experiment in a 750 torr hood. It consists of 78 mol N2, 20 mol O2 and 2 mol CO2. What is the partial pressure of the molecular oxygen? 14. The above experiment requires 2500 l of the synthesized air need to be produced and the hood temperature is 30 C, how many moles of molecular oxygen are needed? 15. Why does the calculation of KAW exclude the sorbed and bound fraction of a pollutant? 16. Explain the difference between A and B in Figure 18.14. Which is more likely to apply to hydrophobic compound? Which is more likely to apply to a short-chain alcohol? Which is more likely to apply to a long-chain alcohol, like octanol?", "What is the difference between this partitioning and that for KAW? 17. The Henry\u2019s law constant is often used as an indicator of fugacity. Consider the de\ufb01nition of fugacity and under which conditions KH may not be a good indicator. 18. The atmospheric concentration of atrazine is measured at 76 ng m 3. Find the partial pressure (pa) of atrazine in air at 27 C? Is this concentration at equilibrium? (Molar mass of atrazine z 216 g mol 1). Assume pa \u00bc RT(nzA/VA) \u00bc RT(MzA/ mz/VA) \u00bc RTCzA/MWz. Where, pa \u00bc partial pressure of organic compound z (atm), R \u00bc gas constant (0.0821 l atm mol 1 K 1), nzA \u00bc number of moles of compound z in air, T \u00bcambient temperature (K), MzA \u00bc mass of compound z in given volume of air (g), mz \u00bc molar mass of compound z (g mol 1), VA \u00bcvolume of air (l), and CzA \u00bc concentration of compound z in air (g l 1). 19. DDT and atrazine have very low vapor pressures 10 10 (P0 \u00bc 1.3 10 atm and 1.3 10 atm, respectively, at 25 C). However, atrazine\u2019s KH is nearly three orders of magnitude lower than DDT\u2019s KH. Explain why. 20. Download the Canadian Centre for Environmental Modelling and Chemistry\u2019s AirWater Model at: http://www.trentu.ca/academic/aminss/ envmodel/models/AW2D.html. Using the default settings for the test chemical, set the total concentrations of the test chemical at 250 ng l 1 in water and 33 ng m 3 in air. Select the diagram. What percentage of the chemical would be sorbed to aerosols in the atmosphere? Which compartment has the highest fugacity? 21. Using the same model as above, at the same air and water concentrations, change the chemical properties from the default setting to 25 C and to those of DDT: MW \u00bc 354.49, melting point \u00bc 109 C, log Kow \u00bc 6.91, vapor pressure \u00bc 2.5 10 5 Pa, and aqueous solubility \u00bc 0.025 mg l 1. How does the diagram change? What would happen if the PM III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION concentration were increased 10-fold from the default setting (raised to 1000 mgm 3)? What happens if the density of the airborne particles decreases from the default setting by 10-fold (from 2000 to 200 kg m 3)? 22. Using the same model and concentrations as above, change the chemical properties from the default setting to 20 C and to those of the solvent trichloroethylene: MW \u00bc 131.38, melting point \u00bc 84.8 C, log Kow \u00bc 2.53, vapor pressure \u00bc 7706 Pa, and aqueous solubility \u00bc 1100 mg l 1. How does the diagram change? 23. From these model runs, what seem to be the most important drivers of fugacity? What other variables and parameters would help increase the usefulness of fate and transport models? 24. Find a chemical compound that you know has been emitted in the atmosphere recently. Find published physical and chemical properties of this compound and run the AirWater Model for this compound at 250 ng l 1 in water and 33 ng m 3 in air. Change these ratios, as well as the environmental conditions to represent realistic scenarios. Describe your \ufb01ndings. 25. The fugacity capacity varies for different substrates. Explain why, assuming ideal gas conditions, that the fugacity capacity for a compound in air is the inverse of RT. 26. The published KH for atrazine is 6.2 10 6 atm l mol 1 at 25 C. Estimate its KAWat25 C. 27. Using the information above, will DDT be more or less likely to be transported atmospherically than atrazine? Which will be more likely to be transported in water? What other factors besides this partitioning need to be considered to give a more complete answer? 28. Bioconcentration and bioaccumulation tend to increase with increasing Kow, but the rates drop with very high values, e.g. log Kow > 7. Explain the reason(s) for this. 29. Mixtures are more representative of actual conditions than individual substances. What are some of the dif\ufb01culties of calculating partitioning coef\ufb01cients for substances in mixtures? 30. Give reasons that the atmospheric half-life of many organic compounds is proportional to log Koa and log Kow. What factors could make for variance from this proportionality? 31. Why might the log KOC values in a QSAR be different from those estimated from the Kow values (e.g. 4,40-methylenedianiline, p-phenylenediamine, phosphorus, propionaldehyde, and quinoline)? 32. Review the equations in Chapter 8 to estimate exposures to chemical compounds by inhaling vapors and aerosols. Compare these to the equations in this chapter.", "How can partitioning be incorporated into exposure estimates? 33. Give reasons why QSARs are often limited in partitioning information for metals.

However, it is important to note that these, like other partitioning coef\ufb01cients, are substrate dependent. Thus, when comparing values, the values must be for the same substrate (e.g. carbon source \u00bc anthracite) or otherwise normalized. 8. Harner T, Shoeib M.

Global Environment Facility; 2002. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 19 Temporal Aspects of Air Pollution 19.1 TIME AND AIR POLLUTION Time is a key aspect of air pollution. The focus of Part II is the harm that air pollutants can cause in human populations, in ecosystems, and to public welfare. This aspect of harm has to do with the severity and spatial extent of injury. Time certainly is a part of this harm. The longer the exposure, the greater will be the injury. Indeed, many equations important to air pollution include a time factor, beginning with the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics; i.e. the rate of change of mass of an air pollutant (i.e. change in mass with respect to time) within a control volume must equal the rate of the mass transported into the control volume minus the rate of mass transported out of the control volume: &#1; &#3; d\u00bdA d\u00bdA d d\u00bdA dt \u00bc v$dx \u00fe dx G$dx r (19.1) where, v \u00bc \ufb02uid velocity; G \u00bc a rate constant speci\ufb01c to the environmental medium; d[A]/dx \u00bc the concentration gradient of chemical A; and r \u00bc internal sinks and sources within the control volume. The r term is usually considered to be a loss term, i.e. the mass of the compound exiting the control volume is decreased by the amount of reactivity. Thus, even the loss term includes a time function, i.e. the reaction rate (recall that this is shown graphically in Figure 8.4 in Chapter 8). The hazardous aspects of an air pollutant include temporal factors. For example, animal studies are part of the process to construct and interpret the dosee response curves discussed in Chapter 7. A compound that causes cancer or noncancer outcomes in mammals, such as laboratory rats, would be suspected of doing the same in humans. However, models must be employed to extrapolate the rat-to-human relationship. Put simplistically, the process must compensate for the time difference (e.g. 6-month exposure to an animal versus lifetime exposure to a human); the animal dose must usually be much higher than the daily dose of the human for a chronic disease. That is, time is compensated mathematically by using dose. The most basic way to express exposure to an air pollutant must account for time. Chapter 8 introduced the simplest quantitative expression of exposure: 1 E \u00bc Dt (19.2) where, E \u00bc human exposure during the time period, D \u00bc mass of pollutant per body mass (dose), and t \u00bc exposure time.", "In other words, dose is meaningless without factoring in time, demonstrated by the average daily dose (ADD), which averages exposures and doses during exposure duration periods. The ADD is ascertained by averaging an intake dose according to body weight and an averaging time: I ADD \u00bc (19.3)Wtaveraging where, I is the intake dose; W is the body weight (kilograms); and taveraging is the averaging time (days). For inhalation, I equals the concentration of the air pollutant times the inhalation rate times the exposure duration. Thus, the temporal aspects of air pollution include exposure time and duration, reaction rates, and even partitioning within the environment, such as the time over which pollutants remain in the atmosphere, water, soil, sediment, and biota. These times are usually expressed as burdens and residence times, for which the most common metric is the half-life (t1/2), e.g. atmospheric t1/2, soil t1/2, or tissue t1/2. Another temporal aspect of air pollution is the resilience of the receptor or the reversibility of an impact (see Figures 4.2 and 4.3 in Chapter 4). The ability of receptors to withstand insults from air pollution drives decisions about how to address the pollution. For example, if the habitat of an endangered species is particularly vulnerable to deposition of acid aerosols leading to irreversible damage, the proper response would be to \ufb01nd ways to prevent the acidic deposition. However, if the habitat is vulnerable, but the system is able to recover in a few days, the response would likely be less aggressive. This is part of the thinking behind applying Fundamentals of Air Pollution 475 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00019-0 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 19. TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF AIR POLLUTION \u201cprecaution\u201d rather than \u201crisk-based evidence\u201d for potentially irreversible problems. If data indicate that an air pollutant\u2019s damage will require years or decades to recover, then the precautionary approach would be to eliminate the source of the problem, even with lower thresholds of certainty that would be required under an evidence-based decision (e.g. for problems in the upper right-hand quadrant of Figure 4.2 in Chapter 4). 19.2 PERSISTENCE The main concern about air pollution is its potential to cause harm to living things and their environments. The principal type of harm in organisms is toxicity. The pollutant is the toxic agent and the organism is the receptor of the toxicity. For the harm to result, then, the agent must be toxic when it reaches the receptor, or at least become toxic after it is taken up by the receptor. Thus, three of the most important characteristics of an air pollutant are its persistence, its potential to accumulate in organisms, and its toxicity. Indeed, the most worrisome pollutants are known as persistent, bioaccumlative, and toxic (PBT) substances. Persistence is related to the partitioning coef\ufb01cients discussed in Chapter 18. As mentioned, the environmental half-life (t1/2) is a common way to express a chemical substance\u2019s persistence, i.e. the amount of time it takes to degrade one-half of the mass of a compound. The relationship between two partitioning coef\ufb01cients and persistence is demonstrated in Table 19.1.

Source: Toro D, Hellweger F. Long-range transport and deposition: the role of Henry\u2019s law constant. Final report, International Council of Chemical Associations. 1999. Thus, t1/2 is a metric of persistence, i.e. the larger the t1/2, the more persistent the compound. Persistence is both an intrinsic and extrinsic property of a substance. It is dependent upon the molecular structure of the compound, such as the presence of aromatic rings, certain functional groups, isomeric structures, and especially the number and types of substitutions of hydrogen atoms with halogens (speci\ufb01cally chlorines and bromines). Persistence is directly related to bioconcentration. Generally, the larger the t1/2 of a substance in a compartment, the larger the bioconcentration factor (BCF). For example, the lower t1/2 unsubstituted aliphatic compounds also often have lower BCFs, e.g. acrolein\u2019s BCF is half that of the chlorinated aliphatic compound chloroform; and is four orders of magnitude lower than the BCF of the chlorinated aromatic compound, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin. Persistence potential also depends upon the contaminant\u2019s relationship to its media.", "Compound t1/2 values are commonly reported for each compartment, so it is possible for a compound to be highly persistent in one medium, yet relatively reactive in another. Persistence varies within each compartment and depends on many factors, such as temperature, pH, intensity of sunlight, presence and diversity of microbes, and chemistry (e.g. reactivity of the pollutant, as well as the concentrations of oxidizing agents, free radicals, and catalysts). The half-lives and rate constants (k) discussed in Chapter 17 represent identically ordered decay processes, and are inversely related to one another. For example, \ufb01rst-order decay can be expressed in terms of concentration versus time, concentration versus distance, and as abiotic (e.g. photochemical) and biotic (e.g. microbial) degradation rates. The relationships between t1/2 and k can be stated mathematically. The \ufb01rst-order rates are 0:693 k \u00bc t1=2 (19.4) and 0:693 t1=2 \u00bc k (19.5) Thus, a half-life of 2 years is the same as a \ufb01rst-order rate constant of 0.35 per year, and a half-life of 10 years is the same as a \ufb01rst-order rate constant of 0.0693 (i.e. a slower rate constant is inversely related to a longer half-life). This is an important consideration in estimating the rate at which a contaminant plume will be attenuated, and is commonly used in groundwater studies. Atmospheric plumes move at rates orders of magnitude faster III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION than groundwater plumes, so any appreciable degradation in air requires much shorter half-lives (i.e. much less persistence). Note that Table 19.1 contains no metals or metalloids, but only organic compounds. Obviously, outside of nuclear \ufb01ssion or fusion, elements do not undergo degradation. For example, the degradation of the listed organic compounds does not involve destruction of any element. The carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and other atoms remain intact. However, in degradation, bonds are broken or added, elements are substituted and new compounds produced. This always involves changes in oxidation states. Thus, even though a metal is an element that will not be changed by degradation (i.e. its elemental half-life is theoretically in\ufb01nite), particular metallic compounds will indeed change, just as the particular carbon compounds change in the organic degradation. Thus, even for inherently toxic compounds like mercury, t1/2 is a useful concept (e.g. to state the atmospheric conditions under which the methylmercury compounds degrade to elemental Hg0 and simpler inorganic compounds). The t1/2 is also an important part of endogenous kinetics within an organism, including adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of substances. The t1/2 of a compound is indirectly proportional to that compound\u2019s body burden. A large t1/2 increases the likelihood of accumulation over time. Thus, if substance A\u2019s t1/2 \u00bc 1 day, and substance B\u2019s t1/2 \u00bc 100 days, substance B would be expected to show a much larger body burden than substance A. A substance\u2019s t1/2 also indicates which aspects of the toxicokinetics are most important. For example, <15% of inorganic Hg is absorbed by the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract,1 whereas about 95% of methylated forms of Hg are absorbed.2 Thus, at the same intake rate, the actual uptake is more than six times larger for methylmercury than for inorganic Hg compounds. Concentration versus time constants are known as point decay rates (kpoint), which are derived from a single concentration value versus time plot, and can be used to estimate the length of time that a plume will persist. Bulk attenuation rates (k) are derived from concentration versus distance plots, and are used to see if the contaminant plume is expanding. Thus, they are most useful for groundwater contamination, but can be applied to other environmental media. Substances that remain in the environment long after their release and deposition are more likely to continue to cause problems or to be a threat to environmental quality. The US Environmental Protection Agency considers a compound to be persistent if it has a t1/2 in water, soil, or sediment of greater than 60 days, and very persistent if the t1/2 is greater than 180 days. In air, the compound is considered persistent if its t1/2 is greater than two days. Some of the most notoriously toxic chemicals are also very persistent, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and halogenated dioxins. 19.2.1 Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic Substances The worst combination of factors occurs when a compound is persistent in the environment, builds up in organic tissues, and is toxic. As mentioned, these compounds are referred to as PBTs.", "Each of these factors, i.e. the \u201cP\u201d, the \u201cB\u201d, and the \u201cT\u201d, is actually a function of both the contaminating agent (e.g. air pollutant) and the conditions of the environment wherein the agent resides. Recently, the United Nations Environmental Pro-gramme (UNEP) reported the concentrations of the persistent and toxic compounds. Each region of the world was evaluated for the presence of these compounds. The sources of PBTs are widely varied. Many are intentionally manufactured to serve some public need, such as the control of pests that destroy food and spread disease. Other PBTs are generated as unintended by-products, such as the products of incomplete combustion. In either case, measures and engineering controls to prevent PBT releases are preferable to having to deal with them after they have found their way into the various environmental compartments. One of the principal reasons for the concern about the plethora of organic chemicals and heavy metals in the environment has been the connection between exposures to these substances and the occurrence of cancer and other chronic diseases. Intrinsic properties of compounds render them more or less toxic. In addition, physical and chemical properties determine whether the compounds will resist degradation and persist for long time periods and build up in organisms. PBTs are composed of myriad compounds (see Discussion Box: Long-range Atmospheric Transport and the Inuit in Chapter 12). The concept of persistence elucidates the notion of trade-offs that frequently must be made when responding to environmental insults. It also underscores the importance of sound science and reliable data. For example, the pesticide DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-ethane (C14H9Cl5)] is relatively insoluble in water (1.2e5.5mgl 1at25 C)andis not very volatile (vapor pressure: 0.02 10 5 mmHg at 25 C).3 The water solubility and vapor pressures alone may erroneously indicate that people and wildlife are not likely to be exposed in the air or water. However, the compound is highly persistent in soils, with a t1/2 of about 1.1e3.4 years, so it may still end up in drinking water in the form of suspended particles or in the air III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 19. TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF AIR POLLUTION Male Female Age in years Age in years sorbed to \ufb01ne particles. DDT also exhibits high BCFs, i.e. approximately 50,000 for \ufb01sh and 500,000 for bivalves. This indicates that once organisms become exposed, they tend to increase body burdens of DDT over their lifetimes. In the environment, the parent DDT is metabolized mainly to DDD and DDE.a Each has its own PBT characteristics. Thus, the half-lives of the parent compound and all its degradation products must be known. There is a noteworthy exception to the continuous increase in body burden of highly persistent compounds over an organism\u2019s lifetime. During gestation, there can be in utero, cross-placental transfer of lipophilic compounds from the fat reserves of the mother to the baby (see Figure 19.1). The initial peaks in both the male and the female whale represent contaminant offloading via the mother\u2019s milk. Since PCBs and pesticides are typically found in fat (i.e. they are highly lipophilic) and because milk is the means by which the baby receives the necessary fat for nutrition, the neonate receives large doses of these contaminants during the weaning stage of development. When the rate of weaning diminishes, uptake by the calf declines. This is a detoxi\ufb01cation or depuration stage during which more mass of the contaminant is excreted than is absorbed. After this, for the rest of the male\u2019s life, the persistent compound body burden increases, whereas during the birthing stages of the female, there is an oscillation between contaminant off-loading to the calves and accumulation periods. The physicochemical properties of a substance determine how readily it will move among the environmental compartments, i.e. to and from sediment, surface water, soil, groundwater, air, and in the food web to be taken up by biota, including humans. So, if a substance is likely to leave the water, it is not persistent in water. However, if the compound moves from water to the sediment, where it persists for long periods of time, it must be considered environmentally persistent. This is an example of the difference in \u201cchemical persistence\u201d and \u201cenvironmental persistence\u201d. Persistence is indeed an intrinsic chemical property of a compound.b However, most environmental and biomedical scientists and engineers consider persistence to be both intrinsic and extrinsic (i.e. a function of the media, energy and mass balances, and equilibria).", "So, the environmental behavior of a compound must not only account for the molecular weight, functional groups, and ionic form of the compound, but also whether it is found in the air or water, and the condition of the media (e.g. pH, soil moisture, sorption potential, and microbial populations). The movement among phases and environmental compartments is known as partitioning. Many toxic compounds are semivolatile (i.e. at 20 C and 101 kPa atmospheric pressure, vapor pressures \u00bc 10 5 to 10 2 kPa), under typical environmental conditions. As discussed in Chapter 18, these low vapor pressures and low aqueous solubilities translate into low fugacities, i.e. they lack a strong propensity to \ufb02ee a compartment, e.g. to move from water to air. Thus, a multipathway perspective must be employed for air pollution, with a time aspect to each pathway. After release into the environment, the deposition of air pollutants onto soil, plants, and water is followed by the uptake of the chemicals by biota, and potential exposures by organisms via contact with the contaminated soils, waters, and foods. Such a human health multipathway is shown in Figure 19.2.Amultipathway analysis goes beyond the expected inhalation pathway to include other exposure pathways. Even low KH and KAW compounds, however, can be transported long distances in the atmosphere when sorbed to particles. Fine particles can behave as colloids and stay suspended for extended periods of time, a The two principal isomers of DDD are p,p0-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane and o,p0-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane. The principal isomer of DDE is p,p0-1,10-(2,2-dichloroethenylidene)-bis[4-chlorobenzene]. b However, in a recent conversation, Daniel Chang, a computational chemist with the US Environmental Protection Agency, mentioned that the term \u201cinherent\u201d is seldom an accurate depiction of a substance. Certainly, atomic mass is an inherent property, but solubility and vapor pressure, in the strictest terms are not inherent, but highly dependent on environmental conditions. Thus, computational chemists like Dr Chang, who seek to parameterize based on \ufb01rst principles, are challenged to \ufb01nd those that are actually inherent to a substance. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION explaining in part why low KH compounds can be found in the most remote locations relative to their sources, such as in the Arctic regions. This explains in part exposures to contaminants in the absence of a nearby source. If the substrate has suf\ufb01cient sorption sites, such as soil particles or carpet twill (see Figure 19.3), even a substance not expected to be persistent may become tightly bound and persistent. For example, once an air pollutant is transported and deposited on to highly sorbent clays and organic matter or onto carpet and other sorbent indoor surfaces, even a relatively reactive substance may become tightly bound and persistent. This type of substrate dependence is common in the environment and complicates t1/2 estimates. The properties of the compound and those of the water, soil, sediment, and other substrates determine the rate of sorption and other partitioning. Thus, care must be taken when considering the conditions under which published atmospheric t1/2 values were calculated. For example, if a substance has much af\ufb01nity for particulate matter in the atmosphere, its half-life may be diminished under conditions that lead to increased particle deposition. Conversely, the half-life may be increased if the compound sorbs to ultra\ufb01ne particles that remain suspended longer than the compound\u2019s gas-phase t1/2. Thus, air pollution involves both chemical persistence and environmental persistence. Henry\u2019s law, solubility, vapor pressure, and sorption and other properties of a compound may provide prima facie indications that the compound is not persistent. However, in real-world scenarios, this may not be the case. Indoor environments often lack conditions conducive to degradation, including less sunlight (i.e. lower photochemical degradation rates), microbial populations (i.e. lower biotic transformation rates), and moisture regimes (i.e. lower hydrolysis rates). Thus, an indoor air III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 19. TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF AIR POLLUTION pollutant, e.g. a pesticide, which is not very persistent outdoors (e.g. in the garden) may become persistent indoors, e.g. a reactive pesticide that is tracked into a home and becomes entrapped in carpet \ufb01bers. This is important if the pesticide label\u2019s expected half-life was calculated with the assumption the product would be applied outdoors, but the product was used (or misused) indoors. Another example of environmental versus inherent persistence is that of a steady state condition. For example, there may be a repository of a source of a FIGURE 19.4 Steady state period during which emissions equal rates of deposition and degradation.", "Sources dominate near the origin, and then steady state is reached and maintained so long as the sources and sinks are equal. Once deposition and transformation rates exceed source loading into the control volume, sinks begin to dominate, with a commensurate decline in pollutant concentration following the steady state conditions. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) nonpersistent compound that leads to a continuous, persistent exposure of a neighborhood population. That is, loading of the compound into the parcel of atmosphere is equal to the deposition and degradation of the pollutant within the parcel for a speci\ufb01c time period. A parcel of the air mass may be viewed as a thermodynamic control volume. Once a steady state is reached, so long as the speci\ufb01c contaminant input (e.g. total stack releases) equals the rate of deposition and rate of transformation, then even an inherently reactive, nonpersistent compound is environmentally persistent (see Figure 19.4). Time or distancefrom source III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 19.3 TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF TRANSFORMATION The situation depicted in Figure 19.4 is also known as a sourceesink scenario. In this case the source is the amount of contaminant exiting the stack and the sinks are the deposition and transformation processes. The steady state region exempli\ufb01es the spatiotemporal aspects of a plume. Note that distance from the source can be determined by the rate of movement of the plume. For example, if the contaminant in the plume is moving advectively, i.e. being carrying along with the air mass, at a velocity at 1 m s 1, then a measurement 600 m downwind from the stack is the same as a measurement taken 600 s (10 min) after the contaminant is released. Of course, spatial measurements are constant and time-related measurements are relative, i.e. 600 m is always the same distance, whereas the plume velocity is changing continuously. However, it is often important to average time of \ufb02ight for the contaminant, since the direction of wind will also change. Thus, the control volume in Figure 19.4 will move with the movement of the air mass, so measurements may have to track with this movement (e.g. a stationary monitor will miss the conditions in the control volume, but a mobile monitor can be adjusted to move with the control volume if plume velocity is known). Thus, on a day with a rapidly moving air mass, the measurement would be taken farther from the source (e.g. 1200 m at 2 m s 1); and on days of a slower moving air mass the measurement would be taken nearer the source (e.g. 300 m at 0.5 m s 1). Steady state concentration within a control volume V can be expressed as S s Css \u00bc (19.6) where, Css \u00bc steady state concentration in the control volume; S \u00bc source or sink rate (in steady state they are equal, so only one factor is needed); s \u00bc residence time; and V \u00bc control volume. For example, if S \u00bc 1000 mgh 1 of benzene; s \u00bc 10 h; and V \u00bc 100 m3, then Css \u00bc (1000 10)/100 \u00bc 100 mgm 3 in the control volume. The concentration increases with increasing s, i.e. the longer the time in the controlvolume, thegreater theconcentration of theair pollutant. Thus, if the residence time doubles to 20 h, the steady state concentration also doubles to 200 mgm 3. This illustrates the problem of temporal uncertainty. Overestimating the residence time can result in larger concentrations than would really occur, but underestimating the residence time would also give an incorrect estimate, e.g. that a control volume such as an urban airshed is meeting an air quality standard when it is not. The processes within the ambient plume shown in Figure 19.4 also occur in microenvironments. That is, there is in\ufb01ltration into the microenvironment, as well as deposition to surfaces and transformation within the microenvironment. Certainly, however, deposition does not mean the contaminant is gone. It has merely moved to another environmental compartment (e.g. atmosphere to soil in the ambient setting; air to walls and \ufb02oors in the indoor microenvironment). In some cases, this either is met with new transformations (e.g. soil bacteria degrading the pollutant), or merely different routes of exposure (settled particulate matter that is ingested or contacted dermally).", "The lower rate of photolysis (degradation by light energy) indoors versus outdoors and the sorptive characteristics of the carpet twill, as well as if the pesticide molecule is sorbed to a soil particle embedded in the twill, can lead to dramatically increased environmental half-lives of certain substances. For example, ionic charge can affect the sorption, e.g. even a neutral compound can be held tightly to a substrate if it is part of an aerosol that has an abundance of negatively charged sites that increases its sorption to a substrate with positively changed sites (see Figure 19.3). 19.3 TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF TRANSFORMATION The amount and form of any substance that is released into a system determines its pollution potential. Total emission data are not nearly as useful as speciation data. The total mass of nitrogen, for example, can be further quanti\ufb01ed, not only by the gross mass of the substance entering the atmosphere, but also by the response within compartment of the atmosphere and hydrosphere. Hence the relationship between a substance\u2019s entry and its impact begin even before release. The \ufb01rst major division of loading of pollutants into the environment is between point sources and nonpoint sources. This is actually a distinction of convenience, used often in water, wastewater, and ecosystem discussions. For air pollutants, the distinction is often between a stationary source and a mobile source. After and during an emission, an air pollutant or a precursor of an air pollutant will undergo change. The change depends on physical, chemical, and biological factors. For example, a nitrogen load of an ammonium compound may either by reduced (ammoni\ufb01cation) or oxidized (nitri\ufb01cation). Ammonification : NH\u00fe\u00fe OH 5NH3 \u00fe H2O (19.7) 4 Nitrification : NH\u00fe\u00fe 2O2/NO3 \u00fe 2H\u00fe\u00fe H2O 4 (19.8) Either of these reactions can occur abiotically, can be mediated by biota (e.g. microbes), and/or take place III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 19. TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF AIR POLLUTION within an organism. Other conditions in the stack and receiving atmosphere that affect loading include temperature, aerosols on which and in which sorption can occur, humidity, pH, and ionic strength. For example, under acidic conditions, most of the ammonia nitrogen will ionize to ammonium and under basic conditions the nonionized ammonia concentrations will increase in proportion to the ammonium. This is important since nonionized ammonia is very toxic to aquatic fauna, whereas ionized species are nutrients needed for \ufb02ora and algae. After deposition, the decomposition of organic matter makes for very complex and heterogeneous reactions: Organic nitrogen \u00fe O2/NH3 nitrogen \u00fe O2 /NO2 nitrogen \u00fe O2/NO3 nitrogen \u00fe O2 (19.9) Even this is a gross oversimpli\ufb01cation, since the oxidation and reduction depends on the types of bacteria present. For example, the O2 required for nitri\ufb01cation is theoretically 4.56 mg O2 mg 1 NH\u00fe4 , but this is an autotrophic reaction. Thus, O2 is being produced by the nitrifying bacteria, decreasing the amount needed. However, the growth rate of nitrifying microbes is far less than that of heterotrophic microbes decomposing organic wastes. Therefore, when large amounts of organic matter are being degraded, the nitri\ufb01ers\u2019 growth rate will be sharply limited by the heterotrophs, which means the rate of nitri\ufb01cation will commensurately be decreased.4 Furthermore, these same responses to conditions exist for all other nutrients in the system, e.g. organic phosphorus will be oxidized and oxidized phosphorous species reduced, etc. Thus, the kinetics of contaminant loading into a control volume and the transformations within that control volume are quite complex. 19.4 BIOACCUMULATION Another factor that affects the time that a contaminant exists is the extent to which it can be sequestered within biotic tissue. This is directly related to body burden, i.e. bioaccumulation is a type of biochemical residence time. If a substance enters an organism, its concentration may increase or decrease as a result of its inherent properties, e.g. persistence, and the biochemical processes that take place within an organism. Like other partitioning coef\ufb01cients discussed in Chapter 18, such as Henry\u2019s law constants and Kow, the partitioning that leads to bioaccumulation is often expressed as an equilibrium relationship between media. The two major partitioning coef\ufb01cients are the BCF and bioaccumulation factor (BAF). The BCF is an expression of the accumulation of a chemical into an organism\u2019s tissues entirely as a result of contact with the media (usually water): Corganism BCF \u00bc (19.10) Cmedia For example, after an air pollutant is deposited into surface waters, organisms will take up the pollutant directly from the water.", "If the BCF >1, then the concentration in the organism is greater than the concentration in the medium, i.e. there is bioconcentration of the chemical. Generally, the BCF is derived from laboratory measurements based on partition coef\ufb01cients (e.g. between lipids in tissue and water), whereas BAF is based on \ufb01eld studies in the environment. The BAF is more comprehensive and consistent with biological organization and trophic status. Like BCF, the BAF calculation includes the uptake from the media (in this case, water), but BAF also accounts for the uptake of the chemical from the organism\u2019s food. Thus, BAF is a ratio of net uptake of a chemical from the environment by all possible routes (e.g. inhalation, ingestion, and dermal) from all sources (water, sediment, soil, air, and other organisms). The calculation is the same as that for BCF. Corganism BAF \u00bc (19.11) Cmedia Although the calculations for BCF and BAF are the same, more factors go into Corganism for BAF. Thus, a published BAF for a chemical should be based on direct contact with water, plus the accumulation up the food chain to the organism. So, if a predator species receives 0.1 mg toluene directly from the medium, and has one food that includes increases of the toluene through three successive trophic levels that provide 1 mg toluene, and another food species in a lower trophic level that provides 0.15 mg, the BAF would consider all three sources of toluene: 0.1 \u00fe 1 \u00fe 0.15 \u00bc 1.25 mg toluene from media and food. Bioaccumulation can only occur after an exposure. Obviously, if there is no contact with the pollutant, it will not accumulate within an organism. Conversely, with increasing amounts of a pollutant in an environmental medium, the likelihood of bioaccumulation increases. However, this is not necessarily a linear relationship. Different genera of organisms readily accumulate certain compounds, but not others. Although a persistent compound often has a high potential for bio-accumulation, this is not always the case. For example, a compound that persists in the soil or water may not be easily taken up or may be ef\ufb01ciently metabolized and eliminated from the organism. A persistent compound, e.g. cyanide (CN ), may be so toxic that it destroys III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 19.4 BIOACCUMULATION animal cells to the extent that accumulation is offset. Also, trophic status and bioenergetics drive the extent of bioaccumulation. In food webs and food chains, even if an organism does bioaccumulate a chemical, but is not attractive as food for organisms in higher trophic states, these organisms will not bioaccumulate it. However, if it is attractive as a food source for another organism that happens to be a food source for that organism, then the chemical will likely accumulate. For example, a predator may not consume a \ufb01rst-level consumer that has accumulated a contaminant, but it may consume the predator of that \ufb01rst-level consumer. This is an important reason why top predators often have the highest concentrations of persistent contaminants. Upon entering an organism a chemical compound moves and changes as a result of several processes, especially accumulation, metabolism, and excretion. All organisms share the pharmacokinetic processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination or excretion. Bioaccumulation is a function of these processes. However, the type of chemicals able to be processed, the time that each mechanism takes, and the ultimate change to the compound after uptake vary signi\ufb01cantly among species, or even strains of the same species. Thus bioaccumulation is a \u201cspeciesdependent\u201d factor. As mentioned, the mass of the chemical substance that ultimately is accumulated by an organism is known as the organism\u2019s body burden. As shown in Figure 19.5, the pollutant uptake of a chemical can begin in utero, continuing throughout the toxicokinetic phase. If the rate of uptake is greater than the rate of elimination, then bioaccumulation occurs. Eventually, the accumulation reaches equilibrium with its surrounding environment. Thus, the body burden remains constant. If the concentration of the pollutant declines (e.g. treatment or with the elimination of the source) the pollutant will begin to be released from fatty tissues or other storage sites (e.g. the liver). This process, known as depuration, will result in a reduced body burden. Once a substance has been taken up by an organism, for an adverse effect, or any effect for that matter, to occur the substance must interact with its cells.", "The interaction sites may be on the cell\u2019s surface or within a cell, such as when carcinogenic contaminant enters a cell\u2019s nucleus and interferes with normal DNA sequencing. The contaminant may also interact within an organism\u2019s extracellular spaces. In \ufb02ora, for example, a chemical substance may interact with root cells, stomata, vascular tissue, and cuticle tissues. Animal interactive sites include skin and stomach tissue. The lung for land animals and the gills for \ufb01sh are also sites that interact with contaminants that have been taken up. If the doseeresponse and biological gradient relationships hold, and they usually do, the intensity of an adverse effect from exposure to an environmental contaminant must depend on the concentration of the contaminant. If a contaminant persists in an organism, it is more likely to elicit toxicity, particularly if the contaminant stays at the ultimate site of action. For example, if a neurotoxic contaminant is stored in fat reserves, but does not \ufb01nd its way to the central nervous system or any other nerve site, the organism will not exhibit neural dysfunction. However, once the neurotoxin is released and distributed to a nerve site, the neurotoxicity will be manifested. Thus, there may be a signi\ufb01cant lag after initial exposure before a chemical reaches tissue that will be adversely affected. Once the contaminant \ufb01nds its way to the site, e.g. a neurotoxic lead (Pb) or mercury (Hg) compound reaching a nerve cell, damage will likely increase the longer the compound remains at the vulnerable site. Often, adverse effects are the result of cellular responses and interaction with the pollutant and/or its metabolite. Since the endogenous target molecule in the cell is the site of action, a contaminant\u2019s potential to undergo chemical reactions with that molecule Concentration of contaminant (mg kg\u20131 body mass) 12 9 6 3 0 FIGURE 19.5 Bioaccumulation in an organism. During the toxicokinetic stage, uptake of the chemical substance is greater than elimination. At equilibrium, the uptake and elimination processes are equal. During detoxi\ufb01cation or depuration, elimination is greater than uptake, so the body burden of the organism will decrease until a new equilibrium is established. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 19. TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF AIR POLLUTION represents the initiation of toxicity in the organism. For example, a dioxin molecule may react with a receptor molecule on the cell\u2019s surface. As discussed in Chapter 12, this reaction may signal the feminine or masculine responses (e.g. hair growth, testis or ova development) much like a hormone would do. In other words, the endocrine-disrupting compound and the natural hormone both bind to the cell\u2019s receptor. They are both ligands, i.e. molecules that travel through the bloodstream as chemical messengers that will bind to a target cell\u2019s receptor. Or, the new polypeptide that is formed from this receptorecontaminant interaction may react with DNA in the nucleus. The former reaction is an example of an endocrine response, while the latter may lead to mutagenicity or cancer. The same chemical substance can elicit different responses. For example, halogenated dioxins have been shown to be endocrine disruptors by binding with or interfering with cellular receptors, and they are carcinogenic and mutagenic because of the reactions that they or their metabolites have with the DNA molecule. Contaminants may also react with a wide range of molecules besides receptors and DNA, including lipids and micro-\ufb01lament proteins. Contaminants may also enter into catalytic reactions, where enzymes are involved. Enzymes are important in the metabolism of cells, whether in a unicellular bacterium or a multicellular human being. 19.5 TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF TOXICOKINETICS After absorption, the pollutant moves from the site of exposure (e.g. the skin, lung tissue, or stomach) via the circulatory system. The principal mechanism for transferring the compound is diffusion, i.e. movement of the substance from high to low concentrations. Most substances travel across epithelial barriers to \ufb01nd their way to blood capillaries via diffusion.c So, if a chemical mass is high enough (i.e. suf\ufb01cient rate of exposure) and the chemical can be readily dissolved into the bloodstream, then absorption will occur. Absorption also depends on area of exposure, the type of epithelial layers, microcirculation intensity in the subepithelial regions, and the properties of the substance.6 As discussed in Part II, it is possible for some substances to be eliminated before being absorbed.", "This process is known as \u201cpresystemic elimination\u201d and can take place while the substance is being transferred from the exposure site (e.g. the outer layer of the skin or the GI tract). As a substance moves through the GI mucosal cells, lungs, or liver, much of the substance may be eliminated. The heavy metal manganese (Mn) can be eliminated during uptake by the liver, even before it is absorbed into the bloodstream. Presystemic elimination, however, does not necessarily mean that an organism experiences no adverse effect. In fact, in the example above, Mn exposure can damage the liver without ever being absorbed into the bloodstream. This is also one of the complications of biomarkers (to be discussed later), since the body is protected against Mn toxicity by low rates of absorption or by the liver\u2019s presystemic Mn elimination.7 Distribution is the step where substances move from the point of entry and/or absorption to other locationsinanorganism.8 The principal mechanism for distribution is circulation of \ufb02uids. The absorbed substance \ufb01rst moves through cell linings of the absorbing organ, e.g. the skin or GI tract. After this, the substance enters that organ\u2019s interstitial \ufb02uid, i.e. the \ufb02uid that surrounds cells. About 15% of the human body mass is interstitial \ufb02uids. The substance may continue to be distributed into intracellular \ufb02uids, which account for about 40% of body mass. The substance can move to more remote locations in blood plasma (about 8% of body mass). Interstitial and intracellular \ufb02uids are stationary, i.e. they remain in place, so while the substance resides in these \ufb02uids they are not mechanically transported. Only after entering the bloodstream does distribution become rapid. A substance can leave the interstitial \ufb02uids by entering cells of local tissue, by \ufb02owing into blood capillaries and the blood circulatory system, and by moving into the lymphatic system. A substance\u2019s distribution is largely in\ufb02uenced by its af\ufb01nity for binding to proteins, e.g. albumin, in the blood plasma. When a substance binds to these proteins it is no longer available for potential cell interactions. In the bloodstream, only the bound fraction of the substance is in equilibrium with the free substance. Only the free (unbound) fraction may pass through the capillary membranes. The portion of the substance that is bound to proteins, therefore, determines the substance\u2019s biological half-life and toxicity. Passive diffusion of the toxicant to and from \ufb02uids is the result of the chemical substance\u2019s concentration gradient. The processes follow Fick\u2019s laws of diffusion. Fick\u2019s \ufb01rst law states c This is an example of how the same mechanism, e.g. diffusion, differs in abiotic and biotic systems. Diffusion is not nearly as important in larger air pollution scenarios (plume leaving a stack), but is a major means by which the same pollutant may move within an organism. Larger scales depend principally on advective processes, whereas smaller, cellular scales depend very much on molecular diffusion. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 19.5 TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF TOXICOKINETICS that in a steady state, chemical \ufb02ux moves from regions of high concentration to low concentration: Dci vmi Ji \u00bc (19.12) RT vx where, J is the diffusion \ufb02ux; i is the ith chemical species; D is the diffusion coef\ufb01cient; m is the chemical potential; x is the position (i.e. distance); R is the universal gas constant; and T is the absolute temperature. Diffusion is also a temporal concept, as expressed in Fick\u2019s second law: vC Dv 2Ci \u00bc (19.13) 2 vt vx where, C is the concentration and t is time. Again, as in Figure 19.4, time and distance are correlated in contaminant transport (whether advective or, in this case, diffusive). The apparent volume of distribution (VD) is the total volume of \ufb02uids (liters) in the body to which the chemical substance has been distributed: m VD \u00bc (19.14) \u00bdC plasma where, m is the mass or toxicological dose (milligrams) of the chemical substance and [C]plasma is the concentration of the chemical substance in the plasma (milligrams per liter). Chemical substances distributed exclusively in the blood will have higher values of VD, while those distributed to several \ufb02uid types (blood and the interstitial and intracellular \ufb02uids) will be more diluted and would have lower VD values. These values can be in\ufb02uenced by a chemical substance\u2019s rates of sequestration, biotransformation, and elimination. The value is a good indication of just how widely a chemical substance is distributed within an organism. It is also a key factor in calculating the chemical substance\u2019s body burden (milligrams): Body burden \u00bc\u00bd $VD (19.15)", "C plasma For example, if a person is exposed to 30 mg contaminant A and has a blood plasma concentration of 3 mg l 1, the volume of distribution is the quotient of the dose and the concentration in the plasma. That person\u2019s VD \u00bc30/ 3 \u00bc10 l of contaminant A. If another person is exposed to 9 mg of contaminant B, but has a plasma concentration of 3 mg l 1, then that person\u2019s VD \u00bc9/3 \u00bc3 l of contaminant B. The body burden is the product of the plasma concentration and the volume of distribution, so the \ufb01rst person\u2019s body burden \u00bc3 10 \u00bc30 mg of contaminant A, and the second person\u2019s body burden \u00bc33 \u00bc9mg of contaminant B. Therefore, in this example, contaminant B is distributed to a lesser extent than A (only 30%). Also, this has caused the \ufb01rst person to have a greater body burden of A than the second person does of B. It is important to keep in mind, however, that numerous factors can affect distribution and body burden. For example, the sex and age of a person can in\ufb02uence how rapidly a chemical substance is distributed. In fact, if men on average distribute these chemical substances 17.3 times more rapidly than women, then A and B could be the same chemical substance (all other factors, such as age, being equal). The route of exposure is an important factor that can affect the concentration of the parent chemical substance or its metabolites within the blood or lymph regions. This can be important since the time and path taken by the chemical substance within the body can greatly increase the degree of biotransformation, storage, elimination, and, ultimately, toxicity. For example, if the contaminant goes directly to the liver before it travels to other parts of the body, most of the contaminant mass can be biotransformed rapidly. This means that \u201cdownstream\u201d blood concentrations will be muted or entirely eliminated, which obviates any toxic effects. This occurs when chemical substances become absorbed through the GI tract. The absorbed chemical substance mass that enters the vascular system of the GI tract is carried by the blood directly to the liver via the portal system. Blood from the liver subsequently travels to the heart and then on to the lung, before being distributed to other organs. Thus, contaminants that enter from the GI tract are immediately available to be bio-transformed or excreted by the liver and eliminated by the lungs. This is known as the \u201c\ufb01rst-pass effect\u201d. For example, if the \ufb01rst-pass biotransformation of a contaminant is 75% via the oral exposure route, the contaminant-blood concentration is only about 25% of that of a comparable dose administered intravenously. The routes of exposure follow the same principles discussed in earlier discussions. For example, respiratory exposures to contaminant gases are a function of gas diffusion. Fick\u2019s \ufb01rst law can be written as a concentration gradient: dC JDiffusion \u00bc D (19.16) dx This may be reordered for respiration, with values added for the contaminant and the lung: S A &#4; &#5; JDiffusion \u00bc D 1=2M:W: d pa pb (19.17) where, JDiffusion \u00bcdiffusion rate (mass per length2 per time) D \u00bcdiffusion coef\ufb01cient for the chemical substance (area per time) S \u00bcsolubility of the chemical substance gas in the blood (mass per volume) III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 19. TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF AIR POLLUTION M.W. \u00bc molecular weight of the chemical substance (dimensionless) A \u00bc surface area of membrane in contact with the chemical substance (length2) d \u00bc membrane thickness (length) pa \u00bc partial pressure of chemical substance gas in inhaled air (pressure units) pb \u00bc partial pressure of chemical substance gas in blood (pressure units) This Fickian relationship shows that so long as pa is larger than pb, the diffusion rate is positive and the chemical substance is taken up (i.e. is more likely to reach the target organ). As the partial pressure in the blood increases and becomes greater than that in the air, the gradient reverses and the chemical substance moves out of the lung. Also, note that for a highly soluble compound, the rate of diffusion is rapid. Obviously, the slowest processes (smallest variable in the numerators, largest variable in the denominators) will be rate limiting. Aerosols (particles) will effectively diffuse if the chemical substance is lipophilic. Particle size is a major limiting factor, and is inversely proportional to dose.", "Currently, particles with diameters 2.5 mm are considered to be most effective in passing by the nasopharyngeal region and penetrating to the tracheobronchial region and being deposited in alveoli. Larger particles are \ufb01ltered physically and are considered to be less problematic. Fundamental chemical principles apply to other routes besides inhalation. For example, the pH varies among the \ufb02uids found in different organs, lowest in the stomach (pH near 1.0) and highest in some urines (pH about 7.8). Blood is also basic, with a pH of 7.4, while the small intestines are slightly acidic (pH about 6.5). This means that the acidity/basicity is very important to toxicokinetics. For example, lipophilic organic acids and bases will be absorbed by passive diffusion only when they are not in an ionized form, so the HendersoneHasselbalch equation is a determinant in the amount of organic acids absorbed: \u00bdHA pK \u00bc pH \u00fe log (19.18) a \u00bdA Where, [HA] is the molar concentration of an undissociated weak acid and [A ] is the molar concentration of its conjugate base. This is a very important part of the blood\u2019s buffering, especially via the bicarbonate buffering system. This buffering allows for an optimal range of acid-base homeostasis. Chemical substances absorbed through the inhalation or dermal routes will enter the blood and go directly to the heart and systemic circulation. Therefore, the chemical substance is distributed to other organs of the body before it \ufb01nds its way to the liver, and is not subject to this \ufb01rst-pass effect. Also, a chemical substance entering the lymph of the intestinal tract will not \ufb01rst travel to the liver. Rather, the chemical substance will slowly enter the circulatory system. The proportion of a chemical substance that moves via lymph is much smaller than the amount carried in the blood. The chemical substance blood concentration also depends on the rate of biotransformation and excretion. Some chemical substances are rapidly biotransformed and excreted while others are slowly biotransformed and excreted. Disposition is the temporal mechanism that integrates the processes of distribution, biotransformation, and elimination. Disposition (kinetic) models describe how a chemical substance moves within the body with time. The disposition models are named for the number of compartments of the body where a chemical substance may be transported. Important compartments include blood, fat (adipose) tissue, bone, liver, kidneys, and brain. Kinetic models may be a one-compartment open model, a two-compartment open model, or a multiple-compartment model. The one-compartment open model describes the disposition of a substance that is introduced and distributed instantaneously and evenly in the body, and eliminated at a rate and amount that is Log concentration proportional to the amount left in the body (see Figure 19.6). This is known as a \u201c\ufb01rst-order\u201d rate, and represented as the logarithm of concentration in blood as a linear function of time. The t1/2 of a chemical that follows a one-compartment model is simply the time required for half the chemical to no longer be found in the plasma. Only a few contaminants adhere to simple, \ufb01rst-order conditions of the one-compartment model. For most chemicals, it is necessary to describe the kinetics in terms of at least a two-compartment model (see Figure 19.7). This model assumes that the chemical substance enters and distributes in the \ufb01rst compartment, usually the blood. From there, the chemical substance 10 1 0 Time &#1;&#3; dC of the chemical substance concentration is determined by a dt single \ufb01rst-order process, e.g. elimination. Thus, log C declines as a straight line on semilog paper. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 10 1 0 Time FIGURE 19.7 Two-compartment toxicokinetic model. A multi-compartmental model involves more than one endogenous process, e.g. elimination plus distribution. These multiple processes change the concentrations by moving the chemical substance away from the dC vascular space. Thus, depends upon more than one of the pro dt cesses, so the sum of more than one straight line, and is curvilinear when expressed semilogarithmically. is distributed to another compartment from which it can be eliminated or it may return to the \ufb01rst compartment. Concentration in the \ufb01rst compartment declines continuously over time. Concentration in the second compartment increases, peaks, and subsequently declines as the chemical substance is eliminated from the body. A t1/2 for a chemical whose kinetics \ufb01ts a two-compartment model is often referred to as the \u201cbiological half-life\u201d. This is the most commonly used measure of the kinetic behavior of a trace chemical substance.", "Frequently the kinetics of a chemical within the body cannot be adequately described by either of these models since there may be several peripheral body compartments to which the chemical may be transported, including long-term storage. In addition, biotransformation and elimination of a chemical may not be simple processes but subject to different rates as the blood levels change. 19.6 TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF AIR QUALITY MODELS Air quality models are used to estimate ambient concentrations and/or deposition rates for one or more substances in the atmosphere. These substances can be emitted from one or more sources. All air quality modeling systems have three major components, which used together, help in characterizing and predicting the environmental fate of air pollutants after emission. These components are (1) emissions; (2) meteorology; and (3) air quality.5 All three air modeling components are affected by time. Emissions are often expressed as rates (mass or volume per time). Meteorological parameters are time-dependent (e.g. wind speed, daily temperatures and changes in humidity). Air quality is also time-dependent, e.g. concentrations of pollutants are constantly changing. Time is truly of the essence in air pollution. It is a factor in every aspect, from the production and release of an air pollutant to residence times in the atmosphere and other environmental media to exposure in organisms to the kinetics and partitioning within the organism. QUESTIONS 1. What properties tend to increase a chemical compound\u2019s atmospheric half-life? 2. What environmental conditions tend to increase a chemical compound\u2019s half-life? 3.

The body burden before the exposure was 0 mg kg 1 body mass and peaked after 2 days at 5 mg kg 1 body mass, before immediately beginning depuration.

Equilibrium lasted for 3 days, which was followed by the depuration phase that lasted for 2 days. If a chemical compound\u2019s depuration rate is half that of the accumulation during the toxicokinetic phase, what would you expect the body burden to be after 10 days? 19.

TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 20 The Hydrologic Cycle 20.1 THE WATER PLANET In Chapters 1, 2, and 9, several \ufb02uid properties are introduced. These apply to all \ufb02uids at all macroscopic scales, including those important for air pollution, especially air and water. In Chapter 27, these and other physical properties are applied to the processes and mechanisms in the atmosphere to employ models to predict how air pollutants will move in the tropo sphere, i.e. the lowest layer in which humans and other biota live. 20.2 THE WATER MOLECULE Water is an amazing molecule (see Figure 20.1). Its features shape the earth\u2019s surface, e.g. the fact that due to its con\ufb01guration it expands substantially as it freezes or sublimates (i.e. change of state from gas to solid). This molecular con\ufb01guration also makes for the solvent characteristics of water.", "The water molecule\u2019s oxygen and two hydrogen atoms are aligned so that there is a slightly negative charge at the oxygen end and a slightly positive charge at the hydrogen end. Since in chemistry \u201clike dissolves like\u201d, polar substances have an af\ufb01nity to become dissolved in water, and nonpolar substances resist being dissolved in water. The hydrogen atoms form an angle of 105 with the oxygen atom. The asymmetry of the water molecule leads to a dipole moment (see the discussion in the next session) in the symmetry plane pointed toward the more positive hydrogen atoms. Thus, the highly polar H2O readily dissolves other polar compounds. The interactions of air and water occur throughout the hydrosphere, i.e. the discontinuous stratum that holds the earth\u2019s water, including groundwater beneath the surface, surface water, water in soil and biota, and moisture in the atmosphere. The \ufb02uid properties of air and water combine in the hydrosphere, not only to make weather, but also to move and transform air pollutants. The atmosphere holds about the same amount of water as the relatively small quantity of water in living organisms (0.0055% of total; 0.04% of freshwater) compared to the 96.5% in the oceans (see Table 20.1). However, the atmosphere accounts for much of water\u2019s activity on earth, from weather systems to nutrient cycling (see Chapter 22) to pollutant transformation (e.g. hydrolysis) and pollutant transport (e.g. wet and dry deposition). \u03b4 \u03b4+ Hydrogen bonds Fundamentals of Air Pollution 491 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00020-7 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Air pollution is impacted by and affects the water cycle. For example, air pollution is directly affected when hydrolysis occurs in water droplets suspended in the atmosphere, which is an important type of reaction that degrades air pollutants. In addition, air pollution changes the water cycle by adding particulate matter (PM) on which water condenses. The water droplet is the site for much of the physical and chemical activities in the atmosphere, given that the PM in the atmosphere can have cores of sulfates and nitrates, with aerodynamic diameters <1 mm. These aerosols can be removed from the atmosphere by several processes. \u201cRain out\u201d occurs when the particles serve as condensation nuclei that lead to the formation of clouds. The particles are then precipitated if the droplets grow to suf\ufb01cient size to fall as raindrops. Another mechanism, known as \u201cwashout\u201d, also involves rain, but the particles in air are captured by raindrops falling through the air. Both mechanisms contribute to \u201cacid rain\u201d, which results in the sulfate and nitrate particles reaching lakes and streams, and increasing their acidity. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions occur in the atmosphere. If the reaction only occurs in the gas phase, the reaction is homogeneous. If the reaction involves an interface with a surface of an aerosol or within a liquid droplet, it is heterogeneous. Certain chemical species of S and N have suf\ufb01cient aqueous solubility to be dissolved by the droplet. These liquid-phase compounds are already acidic (e.g. including concentrations of sulfuric acid [H2SO4], nitric acid [H2NO3], and IV.

Thus, the water droplet plays a key role in both dry and wet deposition of pollutants that lead to acidic conditions in soils and surface waters (see Figure 20.3). The ultimate change in pH in the hydrosphere brought on by acid rain is buffered to varying degrees by soils and surface waters, depending on the ionic strength of the soil water and surface water. These buffering processes are discussed in Chapter 21. Air pollution also indirectly affects the hydrosphere when it changes climate. Humans and other creatures live in a very small optimal range of water, which is a balance of precipitation, evaporation, and other sources and sinks of water (see Figure 20.4). Increases in ambient temperatures increase evaporation rates into the atmosphere. Warmer air holds more water than cooler air, so some areas will gain water, sometimes in excess (e.g. experience regional increases in \ufb02ooding). The increased evaporation rates can also increase desiccation of soils and biota in the water loss areas (see Figure 20.5). These and other changes threaten the delicate balances within the optimal ranges of the water regimes. The total amount of water in the hydrosphere will remain relatively the same, but the relative locations of the water could change substantially with changes in climate. For example, water may move from impounded surface waters to the atmosphere, which will change rain and other precipitation patterns, including hurricanes and other storm systems. a The asterisk (*) in H2CO3 indicates that this actually occurs as an equilibrium among the acid and ions, especially carbonate and bicarbonate. See Chapter 21. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 20. THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE 20.3.1 Air Pollution\u2019s Indirect Effects on the Hydrosphere A reasonable hypothesis is that any average global temperature increases due to increased atmospheric concentrations of global greenhouse gases will lead to some increase in the rate and amount of melting of polar ice and glaciers.2 The net effect of this change of state of water would be a rise in sea level, as well as other large water bodies, e.g. the Great Lakes in North America (see Figure 20.4). If the rise is substantial it could be associated with displacing human populations (e.g. islanders and coastal dwellers). It could also greatly impact coastal ecosystems with biota that is not completely submerged for at least part of the year. Another indirect result would be the contamination of many coastal and near-coastal water supplies by salt water (e.g. ground water recharged by tidal rivers and estuaries). The density difference between fresh and salt water is presenting a slowly unfolding public health problem for people living in coastal communities, as well as an environmental problem for marine and estuarine ecosystems. Salt water contains a signi\ufb01cantly greater mass of ions than does freshwater (see Table 20.2). The denser saline water can wedge beneath freshwaters and pollute surface waters and groundwater (see Figure 20.6). This phenomenon, known as saltwater intrusion, can signi\ufb01cantly alter an ecosystem\u2019s structure and function, and threaten freshwater organisms. It can also pose a huge challenge to coastal communities which depend on aquifers for their water supply. The freshwater Everglades, e.g. recharge the Biscayne aquifer, a natural underground layer that collects water.

Di rection of flow Salt water intrusion of freshwater river system FIGURE 20.6 Saltwater intrusion into a freshwater system. This denser salt water submerges under the lighter freshwater system. The same phenomenon can occur in coastal aquifers. The Biscayne aquifer is the primary water supply to the Florida Keys. The effect in South Florida could be doubly troublesome.", "In addition to the type of saltwater intrusion shown in Figure 20.6, the rising sea level could submerge low-lying areas of the Everglades (see Figure 20.7), increasing the salinity in portions of the aquifer. In addition, the rising sea water could force salty waters upstream into coastal areas, thus threatening surface water supplies. Similar problems could also occur in Northeastern US aquifers that are recharged by fresh portions of streams that are vulnerable to increased salinity during severe droughts.3 Indeed, similar groundwateresurface wateresea water interactions could be affected across the globe. Salinity of water is a relative term. The values in Table 20.2 are at best averages and target concentrations. Actually, salinity is the concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS). Indeed, in the United States, the drinking water standard for TDS is a \u201csecondary\u201d or nuisance standard, which is 500 mg l 1. Note that the classi\ufb01cations using two dominant ions, Na\u00fe and Cl , differ by three orders of magnitude between \u201cfresh\u201d and \u201csaline\u201d waters. Consider the hypothetical example in Figure 20.8 of these ionic strengths (indicated by TDS) before and after saltwater intrusion. Although the water near the water supply is not \u201csalt water\u201d, nor does it currently violate the secondary drinking water standard, the ionic concentrations are cause for concern and serve as a warning that the trend is likely to be toward even higher salinity. The foregoing discussion illustrates how an indirect air pollution effect (atmospheric warming from emissions of greenhouse gases) can have hydrospheric impacts (warming and sea level rise) that lead to another form of pollution (freshwater contamination). The interconnectedness of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere are complex and extensive (see Figure 20.9). A small change in one small part of the spheres can lead to unanticipated outcomes. Put within a chaos perspective, the hydrosphere has many features that are sensitive to initial conditions. IV.

For example, water quality may suffer as a result of climate change in areas experiencing increases in rainfall as a result of heavier and more frequent precipitation events. In addition to the damage and safety hazards of a \ufb02ood, more intensive precipitation events harm water infrastructures, e.g. sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants are not designed to handle the increased volumes of water, leading to greater numbers of pass-through of untreated sewage, and the concomitant health effects this brings. These events also overwhelm storm water sewers, increasing nutrient loadings to surface waters (see Chapter 22). This causes problems, such as eutrophication and \ufb01sh kills due to the oxygen demand of the organic material and nutrients.1 20.4 SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF WATER CYCLES Myriad processes are involved in environmental systems, with water playing vital roles in most of them. The previous discussion has focused on the planetary IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 20. THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE cycling of water, i.e. throughout the hydrosphere. However, water cycling takes place at all levels, each of which is important to air pollution. Water plays a large role in climate. Microclimatological changes can occur due to the release of heated plumes from combustion facilities and vehicles. Exchanges between the atmosphere and other media, e.g. soil and sediment, create sinks and sources of energy. Heat reservoirs in terrestrial and aquatic systems receive added heat, which is released in ways that can alter habitats (e.g. changes to freezeethaw cycles, seasonal variations, and selectivity of certain soil bacteria genera). Water cycling is closely tied to energy cycling and balances.", "Some of these watereenergy relationships are obvious and direct, e.g. the thermal inversions that lead to urban air pollution are the result of differences in heat energy in water vapor at various layers in the troposphere. Some of the watereenergy relationships are more subtle and indirect, such as the transfer of energy between trophic states in an ecosystem, which relies in part on energy and water exchanges among biotic tissue and abiotic substrates (e.g. photosynthesis using aqueous-phase phosphorous compounds to transfer energy). Watereenergy cycling is also important in anthropogenic systems and is part of a design of pollution control equipment selection and application. For example, at the facility scale, water and energy are often addressed together, such as the management of water and energy at a factory or power plant. Managing water is a simultaneous process with managing energy. Indeed, mismanagement of water systems at the facility level can involve trade-offs between types of pollution. The \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics requires, e.g. that allowing +\u2026. River 25 FIGURE 20.10 Difference in cumulative heat contribution to a river from electric generating plants using a once-through cooling system (A) versus the same plants using a cooling water return system (B). The cumulatively added heat is greatly reduced with the closed water return systems compared to the once-through cooling systems (hypothetical scenario). (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Ref. 4a. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 20.4 SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF WATER CYCLES heated water to be released in any amount, even the permitted level, would increase the overall temperature of the receiving stream. The watereenergy exchanges will also scale upwardly. That is, heat can initiate cumulative environmental impacts, such as the heat exchange and balances were changing conditions of receiving water bodies.4a,4b Up to the 1970s, every power plant along the major rivers of the United States was releasing heated water to a stream (see Figure 20.10). This meant that the incremental effect of all the permitted releases led to a cumulative increase in the temperature. In the late 1970s, once-through cooling, i.e. letting water pass through turbines and then discharging to adjacent streams, was no longer allowed in US waters (Figure 20.10(A)). Other cooling systems, e.g. cooling towers and cooling lakes, had to be installed and operated, which meant power plant water systems became more closed, both from a \ufb02uid dynamics and thermodynamic perspective (Figure 20.10(B)). The heat from boilers and other industry-scale operations is going to be exchanged. This is a consideration in both air pollution and water pollution control decisions. Facility design determines in large part where the energy goes (see Figure 20.11). In fact, an air pollution control and heat control design can directly affect dissolved oxygen (DO) content of the receiving water since temperature is directly proportional to DO content. The DO is a limiting factor of the type of \ufb01sh communities that can be supported by a water body (see Tables 20.3 and 20.4). The resulting net increase in heat may directly stress the biotic integrity of a surface water ecosystem, e.g. \ufb01sh species vary in their ability to tolerate higher temperatures, meaning that the less tolerant, higher value \ufb01sh will be inordinately threatened. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 20. THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE FIGURE 20.11 Adverse effects in the real world usually result from a combination of conditions. In this example, both energy and matter must be considered in the control of air pollution. The control of matter leaving the combustion unit (upper left-hand side) must be optimized with the transfer of energy (middle). The added heat results in an abiotic response (i.e. decreased dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the water), which leads to biotic processes that either increase or decrease DO and increase the toxic responses (e.g. low DO and increase in metal bioavailability). (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Adapted from: Ref. 4a. The increased temperature can also increase the aqueous solubility of substances that are toxic to organisms. For example, greater concentrations of mercury and other toxic metals will occur with elevated temperatures (see Chapter 23). The lower DO concentrations will lead to a reduced environment where the metals and compounds will form sul\ufb01des and other compounds that can be toxic to aquatic life.", "Thus, the change in temperature, the resulting decrease in DO and increasing metal concentrations, and the synergistic impact of combining the hypoxic water and reduced metal compounds are a cascade of harm to the stream\u2019s ecosystems (see Figure 20.3). Biota also plays a role in the heat-initiated effect. Combined abiotic and biotic responses occur. Notably, the growth and metabolism of the bacteria results in even more rapidly decreasing DO levels. Algae both consume DO for metabolism and produce DO by photosynthesis. The increase in temperature increases their aqueous solubility and the decrease in DO is accompanied by redox changes, e.g. formation of reduced metal species, such as metal sul\ufb01des. This is also being mediated by the bacteria, some of which will begin reducing the metals as the oxygen levels drop (reduced conditions in the water and sediment). However, the opposite is true in the more oxidized regions, i.e. the metals are forming oxides. The increase in the metal compounds combined with the reduced DO, combined with the increased temperatures can act synergistically to make the conditions toxic for higher animals, e.g. a \ufb01sh kill. The initiating abiotic effect (i.e. increased temperature) results in an increased microbial population. The associated decline in DO, however, is a net decline between photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic microbes. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 20.4 SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF WATER CYCLES The growth and metabolism of the bacteria result in decreasing the DO levels, but the growth of the algae both consume DO for metabolism and produce DO by photosynthesis. Meanwhile a combined abiotic and biotic response occurs with the metals. The increase in temperature increases their aqueous solubility and the decrease in DO is accompanied by redox changes, e.g. formation of reduced metal species, such as metal sul\ufb01des. These changes can increase the exposure of human populations to toxic substances. The increase in temperature in Figure 20.11, e.g. leads to increased solubility of metals. This is also being mediated by the bacteria, some of which will begin reducing the metals as the oxygen levels drop (reduced conditions in the water and sediment). However, the opposite is true in the TABLE 20.3 Relationship between Water Temperature and Maximum Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Concentration in Water (at 1 atm) Temperature Dissolved Temperature Dissolved ( C) Oxygen (mg lL1) ( C) Oxygen (mg lL1) 0 14.60 23 8.56 1 14.19 24 8.40 2 13.81 25 8.24 3 13.44 26 8.09 4 13.09 27 7.95 5 12.75 28 7.81 6 12.43 29 7.67 7 12.12 30 7.54 8 11.83 31 7.41 9 11.55 32 7.28 10 11.27 33 7.16 11 11.01 34 7.16 12 10.76 35 6.93 13 10.52 36 6.82 14 10.29 37 6.71 15 10.07 38 6.61 16 9.85 39 6.51 17 9.65 40 6.41 18 9.45 41 6.41 19 9.26 42 6.22 20 9.07 43 6.13 21 8.90 44 6.04 more oxidized regions, i.e. the metals are forming oxides. The increase in the metal compounds combined with the reduced DO, combined with the increased temperatures can act synergistically to make the conditions toxic for higher animals, e.g. a \ufb01sh kill.5 Predicting the likelihood of ecosystem change and adverse events like \ufb01sh kills can be quite complicated, with many factors that either mitigate or exacerbate the outcome (see Figure 20.12). The increase in metal concentrations in water not only increases the potential exposure to total metal mass, but may also transform the metals into chemical species with much higher bioavailability, which increases the dose and body burden of the metals (e.g. methyl mercury in \ufb01sh ingested by humans). At the cellular scale, numerous processes and exchanges occur among and within the environmental compartments (see Figure 20.13); as well as those at the interface between the organism and the environment. The gill-water exchanges by \ufb01sh, e.g. are analogous to the lung-air exchanges in air-breathing animals. Transfer of matter via \ufb02uids is a key part of the bio-accumulation process in a multiphase system (water, sediment, particles, and biota), as represented by the gill6 and the lung.

The direct and indirect impacts can be dramatic. The next chapters consider the cycling of important elements from a biogeochemical perspective. The cycling of these substances occurs predominantly via two \ufb02uids, water and air, at most scales, but predominately by three \ufb02uids at the organism scale, i.e. air, water, and blood. Organisms may be seen as microcosms of mass and energy cycling, regardless of scale. Indeed, cycling depends on the dynamics of water, air, and other \ufb02uids, whether among biomes or at the cellular level. QUESTIONS 1.

All living systems on earth consist of molecular arrangements of the elements: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and most contain nitrogen. These four so-called biophile elements have an af\ufb01nity for each other so as to form complex organic compounds.a All of the earth\u2019s creatures are carbon-based. Biological processes, especially photosynthesis and respiration, by which energy is stored and used by organisms requires the C cycle. Much of this has to do with atomic structure of C. The atomic number of C is six, with four electrons in its outermost shell. This electron con\ufb01guration is a tetrahedron and its oxidation state is often tetravalent. The C atom\u2019s theoretical tetrahedral shape minimizes the repulsion between pairs of electrons. For example, methane (CH4) assumes the molecular con\ufb01guration of four equidistant H atoms surrounding the C atom (i.e. four CeH bonds). This tetravalence means that C can bond as C4\u00fe or as C4 , i.e. it can either give four away or gain four electrons. However, the electronegativity of C is 2.55, which is too low for C to gain electrons from most elements to form C4 , but too high for C to lose electrons to form C4\u00fe . Thus, C seldom forms ionic bonds, readily forms covalent bonds, i.e. most of the molecules formed with C are covalently bonded. This is the main reason that so many organic compounds are possible, and are the vast majority of compounds important in the environmental and medical sciences. The negative and positive tetravalence are prevalent, but certainly are not C\u2019s only oxidation states. Indeed, C may have any oxidation state from \u00fe4to 4 (see Discussion Box: Finding Carbon\u2019s Oxidation States in Organic Compounds). Since most biochemicals and tissues consist of organic compounds, the carbon cycle plays numerous roles in air pollution, no matter the scale of the receptor. At the cellular scale, airborne organic toxicants interfere with cellular and genetic material, which leads to cancer and other diseases. At the personal scale, people inhale carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), organometallic compounds, and carbon-containing aerosols. At the regional scale, mobile sources and vegetation (e.g. coniferous forests) emit VOCs that are part of mix needed to generate photochemical oxidant smog and ground-level ozone. At the planetary scale, chloro\ufb02uorocarbons (CFCs) and other halogenated compounds contribute to stratospheric ozone degradation; and CFCs, methane, and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases. The four electrons in the outer shell means that living systems can both oxidize and reduce C. Oxidation is the act of losing electrons from the outermost shell; reduction is the act of gaining electrons. Carbon redox occurs abiotically, e.g. by photochemical and thermal processes and biotically. Biotic reduction often takes place in the absence of molecular oxygen (O2), such as in the rumen of cattle, in sludge at the bottom of a lagoon, or in buried detritus on the forest \ufb02oor. Anaerobic bacteria obtain energy by reduction, breaking down organic compounds into methane (CH4) and water. Conversely, aerobic microbes get their energy from oxidation, forming carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. Plants absorb CO2 for photosynthesis, the process whereby plants convert solar energy into biomass and release O2 as a by-product. Thus, the essential oxygen is actually the waste product of photosynthesis and is derived from carbon-based compounds.", "Respiration generates carbon dioxide as a waste product of oxidation that takes place in organisms, so there is a balance between a In fact, until less than two centuries ago, such organic compounds were thought only to be able to be produced within natural biological systems. Friedrich Wo\u00a8hler is credited with being the \ufb01rst to synthesize an organic compound outside of an organism when he reacted two inorganic compounds, i.e. silver isocyanate and ammonium chloride, to form the organic compound urea [(NH2)2CO] and silver chloride: AgNCO \u00fe NH4Cl / (NH2)2CO \u00fe AgCl.

THE CARBON CYCLE FINDING CARBON\u2019S OXIDATION STATES IN ORGANIC COMPOUNDS The sum of all oxidation states of inorganic compounds is zero; otherwise it is an ion. For KMnO4 the potassium oxidation state must be \u00fe1 and the oxidation state of each oxygen is 2 (i.e. total oxidation number of 8 for the four O atoms). Thus, the oxidation state of manganese must be \u00fe7. This is also the case for inorganic carbon compounds. For example, for CO2, carbon must have an oxidation state of \u00fe4, since the two O atoms have an oxidation state sum of 4. Conversely, since C atoms in organic compounds can have any oxidation state from 4to \u00fe4, when the C atoms exist in more than one location in a molecule, the oxidation state of each C must be calculated, and these may differ within the same molecule. For example, one C may have an oxidation state of 4 and another C may have an oxidation state of \u00fe1. That is, organic compounds may include several more unknown oxidation states than known oxidation states. Thus, for organic compounds, even though an absolute value for the oxidation state cannot be determined, identifying the amount and location of changes in oxidation state during a reaction is crucial. When a ketone is converted to an alcohol, the only change in oxidation state occurs at the carbon with the oxygen; the method is outlined and shows that the carbon\u2019s oxidation state is reduced from \u00fe2 to 0, equivalent to addition of two electrons. The C oxidation state changes may be found consistently by applying the following rules1: 1. Each element other than the carbons is assigned an expected oxidation state: H: \u00fe1; O: 2; halogens: 1; and as a consequence OH: 1. When these are not those expected from the outer shell, they follow general rules for various chemical classes, e.g. H has an oxidation state of 1 in hydrides such as LiAlH4; O has an oxidation state of 1 in peroxides such as H2O2, and the molecules consisting of a single elements, e.g. molecular nitrogen, chlorine, hydrogen, and oxygen (N2,Cl2,H2, and O2, respectively). This also applies to zero-valence or \u201celemental\u201d metals, e.g. elemental mercury (Hg0 and Pb0). 2. The algebraic sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule must be zero (however, for ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the constituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion). 3. All C atoms except the C that changes during the reaction are temporarily assigned an oxidation state of 0 to solve for each change. The oxidation state of this designated unknown C can then be calculated by the normal method for an inorganic (e.g. solving for Mn in KMnO4 above). Examples: Acetone: O CH3 C CH3 Carbon Position Number Attached Atoms Sum of Oxidation Numbers of Attached Atoms 1 3H; 1C 2 2C; 1O 3 3H; 1C 3(\u00fe1) \u00fe1(0) \u00bc\u00fe3 2(0) \u00fe1( 2) \u00bc 2 3(\u00fe1) \u00fe1(0) \u00bc\u00fe3 3 \u00fe2 3 2-Propanol: H H H H C C C O H H H H Carbon Sum of Oxidation C Position Attached Numbers of Oxidation Number Atoms Attached Atoms State C Oxidation State 1 3H; 1C 3(\u00fe1) \u00fe1(0) \u00bc\u00fe33 2 2C; 1H; 2(0) \u00fe1(\u00fe1) 0 1OH \u00fe1( 1) \u00bc0 3 3H; 1C 3(\u00fe1) \u00fe1(0) \u00bc\u00fe33 Incidentally, this procedure can be used for other multivalent elements, e.g. \ufb01nding the valence of N in organic and inorganic compounds, which varies from 3 (NH3) to \u00fe5 (HNO3). Like C, N exists in numerous oxidation states in organic compounds and undergoes reduction and oxidation. The oxidation state of an ionic compound can differ from the general rules. For example, for an ionic compound having a common element, e.g. ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), the oxidation states for each ion should be determined separately.", "If the formula of ammonium nitrate is considered as a combination of the two N atoms, it would be N2H4O3. Using the general rules would give IV.

This is inappro-The reduction of DDT to DDD involves no change in priate, since this is an ionic compound. Thus, it is best to any of the atoms in the molecule other than the C atom determine the oxidation state of each ion. The oxidation where the reaction occurs. At this attack site, the C is state of N in NH\u00fe must be 3 since the ammonium cation reduced from \u00fe3to \u00fe1, so the half-reactions are 4 has a charge of \u00fe1:( 3forN) \u00fe(\u00fe4 for the H atoms) \u00bc\u00fe1. The oxidation for N in NO3 must then be \u00fe5 since the nitrate anion has a charge of 1: (\u00fe5 for N) \u00fe(\u00fe6 for the O atoms). Often for reductioneoxidation reactions involving large organic molecules, such as organochlorine pesticides, the net charge of the C, as well as N and sulfur, are often used rather than the individual charges. The electronegativity is used to determine oxidation states. For each atom in the organic molecule, the oxidation state can be calculated as \u00fe1 for each bond with an atom having greater electronegativity (or for each positive charge), 1 for each bond with an atom having less electronegativity (or for each negative charge), and 0 for each bond with an atom having the same electronegativity. The pesticide DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethane (C14H9Cl5)) is reduced during metabolism toDDD (p,p0-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane or o,p0-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane). This is obviously reduction since one H\u00fe is gained and a total of two electrons are transferred from an electron donor. This is known as reductive dechlorination, i.e. the loss of the Cl atom reduces the oxidation state of the C atom. All the rules of half-reaction apply and the reactions balance.2 It is important to keep in mind that reactions other than redox are involved in air pollution. For example, the DDT molecule as a whole is degraded without being reduced, 0 when it is metabolized to DDE [p,p -1,10-(2,2-dichloroethenylidene)-bis(4-chlorobenzene) or dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene]. As in the examples for the simpler molecules of acetone and 2-propanol, the C atoms undergo oxidation state changes, but the net change for the entire molecule is 0. That is, one of the C atoms changes from \u00fe3to \u00fe2, but another C changes from 1 to 0. This reaction requires no electron transfer, as was needed for DDD. The DDT molecule is simply hydrolyzed to produce DDE plus water, releasing a chlorine ion (Cl ): green plants\u2019 uptake of CO2 and release of O2 in photosynthesis and the uptake of O2 and release of CO2 in respiration by animals, microbes, and other organisms. Hydrocarbons are formed when C reacts with hydrogen. In the strictest de\ufb01nition of organic chemistry, a hydrocarbon contains only C and H. A hydrocarbon molecule that contains the maximum number of H atoms is said to be saturated. Hydrocarbons can be direct air pollutants (e.g. VOCs), as well as indirect air pollutants when they contribute to the formation of other pollution (e.g. photochemical reactions to form ozone and smog). Combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon forms the biochemicals, including sugars, cellulose, lignin, chitins, alcohols, fats, and esters. Combined with nitrogen, carbon forms alkaloidsdnaturally occurring amines IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21.

Combined with sulfur, carbon is the source of antibiotics, proteins, and amino acids. Combined with phosphorus and a few other elements, carbon forms ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, the chemical codes of life. From a mass balance perspective, C-based compounds that are considered to be air pollutants comprise a very small fraction of the carbon cycle (see Table 21.1). Carbon compounds are at the center of technological, materials science, medical, and environmental breakthroughs. For example, many nanomaterials are carbon-based, such as carbon-60 (C60).", "Also, the functional groups attached to the outside of these nanospheres and tubes determine their usefulness (e.g. ways to keep them from aggregating into larger particles that do not possess the electromagnetic properties needed FIGURE 21.1 Global carbon cycle from 2000 to 2005.

Ref. 3 for medicinal and engineering purposes) and the potential hazards (e.g. increased toxicity and mobility in bio-systems, such as the human body or ecosystems). 21.2 CARBON SINKS AND SOURCES Carbon in its many inorganic and organic species is cycled continuously through the environment (see Figure 21.1). Figure 21.2 demonstrates the diversity of C sinks and sources. For example, if C can remain sequestered in the soil, roots, sediment, and other compartments, it is not released to the atmosphere. Thus, sequestering C is a means of ameliorating climate change by decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases released. Even relatively small amounts of methane and carbon dioxide can profoundly increase the atmosphere\u2019s greenhouse potential. As mentioned, an organic compound is a compound that includes at least one carbon-to-carbon or carbon-to-hydrogen bond. C bonds to itself and to other elements in a myriad of ways, forming single, double, and triple bonds with itself. This makes for millions of possible organic compounds. Even seemingly subtle changes to an organic molecule can profoundly affect its behavior in the atmosphere and the environment. For example, there are large ranges of solubility for organic compounds, depending upon the presence of polar groups in their structure. The addition of an alcohol group to the gas ethane to produce ethanol, e.g. by fermentation and other types of anaerobic digestion, changes the phase and increases aqueous solubility. This means that IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21.3 CARBON EQUILIBRIUM AND CYCLING FIGURE 21.2 Biogeochemistry of carbon Precipitation equilibrium. The processes that release carbonates CO2 are responsible for much of the buffering capacity of natural soils against the effects of acid rain. Topsoil (A Microbial CO2 horizon) degradation Subsoil horizons CO2+ H2O\u2192 O H2CO3 (B) Carbonic acid \u2192 Limestone and dolomite parent rock considerations for siting a factory that makes use of organic compounds must take into account the physical, chemical, and biological af\ufb01nities of all the substances, from the raw materials to intermediate compounds to the intended product. It also determines any pollution control devices. For example, if intermediate products have lower vapor pressures than raw materials, they will have to be addressed as air pollutants, whereas all the liquid phase compounds may be multiphase pollutants. Some may be released through leaks and conduits as liquids, but a portion will also partition to the gas phase (e.g. in the reactor headspace). Alkanes are hydrocarbons that form chains with each link comprising the carbon. A single link is CH4, methane. The carbon chain length increases with the addition of carbon atoms which not only increases molecular weight but many other physicochemical characteristics, such as decreasing aqueous solubility and vapor pressure. The aromatics are based upon the six-carbon con\ufb01guration of benzene (C6H6). The carbon-to-carbon bond in this con\ufb01guration shares more than one electron, so that the benzene molecule has alternating double and single bonds between the carbon atoms. The double and single bonds \ufb02ip; i.e. they resonate. The organic compounds can undergo substitutions of the hydrogen atoms. These substitutions render new properties to the compounds, including changes in solubility, vapor pressure, and toxicity. For example, halogenation often renders the substitution molecule less reactive, more lipophilic, and increase bioavailability and toxicity. By a vast majority, most carbon-based compounds are organic, but a number of inorganic compounds are also important to air pollution. Notably, CO2 is an inorganic compound given that its C is bonded with O atoms and not with other C or H atoms. Cyanide compounds (CN ) and carbon monoxide (CO) are also inorganic compounds. Others include inorganic acids, e.g. carbonic acid (H2CO3) and cyanic acid (HCNO) and compounds derived from reactions with the anions carbonate \u00f0CO2 \u00de and bicarbonate \u00f0HCO3", "\u00de. 3 21.3 CARBON EQUILIBRIUM AND CYCLING Many carbon-based molecules exist in equilibrium with one another. For example, Figure 21.2 demonstrates the equilibrium among carbonates, bicarbonates, organic compounds, carbonic acid, and carbon dioxide. On a global scale, uncontaminated rain\u2019s mean pH is about 5.6, owing to its dissolution of carbon dioxide, CO2. As the water droplets fall through the air, the CO2 in the atmosphere becomes dissolved in the water, setting up an equilibrium condition: CO2\u00f0gas in air\u00de4CO2\u00f0dissolved in the water\u00de (21.1) The CO2 in the water reacts to produce hydrogen ions, as CO2 \u00fe H2O4H2CO34H\u00fe\u00fe HCO3 (21.2) HCO3 4H\u00fe\u00fe CO2 (21.3) 3 Assuming the mean partial pressure CO2 in the air to be 3.0 10 4 atm, it is possible to calculate the pH of water in equilibrium. Such chemistry is always temperature dependent, so let us assume that the air is 25 C. The current mean concentration of CO2 in the troposphere is approximately 370 ppm, but this concentration is rising by some estimates at a rate of 1 ppm per year. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21. THE CARBON CYCLE Henry\u2019s law provides a way to explain C equilibrium. The law states that the concentration of a dissolved gas is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution: pa \u00bc KH\u00bdc (21.4) where, KH \u00bc Henry\u2019s law constant; pa \u00bc partial pressure of the gas; and [c] \u00bc molar concentration of the gas. Or, pa \u00bc KHCW (21.5) where, CW is the concentration of gas in water. Henry\u2019s law, as discussed in Chapter 18, is a function of a substance\u2019s solubility in water and its vapor pressure and expresses the proportionality between the concentration of a dissolved contaminant and its partial pressure in the open atmosphere at equilibrium. That is, the Henry\u2019s law constant is an example of an equilibrium constant, which is the ratio of concentrations when chemical equilibrium is reached in a reversible reaction, the time when the rate of the forward reaction is the same as the rate of the reverse reaction. The CO2 concentration of the water droplet at equilibrium with air is obtained from the partial pressure of Henry\u2019s law constant: pCO2 \u00bc KH\u00bdCO2 aq (21.6) The change from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to carbonate ions in water droplets follows a sequence of equilibrium reactions: KH Kr Ka1 Ka2 CO2\u00f0g\u00de4 CO2\u00f0aq\u00de4 H2CO3\u00f0aq\u00de4 HCO3\u00f0aq\u00de4 CO2 3\u00f0aq\u00de (21.7) The processes that release carbonates increase the buffering capacity of natural soils against the effects of acidic water (pH < 5). As discussed in Chapter 20, the ionic strength of the receiving soil or surface waters determines the actual change in pH. For example, the carbonate-rich soils like those central North America are able to withstand even elevated acid deposition compared to the thin soil areas, such as those in the Canadian Shield, the New York Finger Lakes region, and much of Scandinavia. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)isconstant, since the CO2 in solution is in equilibrium with the air that has a constant partial pressure of CO2. The two reactions and ionization constants for carbonic acid are: 7 H2CO3 \u00fe H2O4HCO3 \u00fe H3O\u00fe Ka1 \u00bc 4:3 10 (21.8) 2 11 HCO3 \u00fe H2O4CO3 \u00fe H3O\u00fe Ka2 \u00bc 4:7 10 (21.9) Ka1 is four orders of magnitude greater than Ka2,so the second reaction can be ignored for the purposes of C equilibrium. The solubility of gases in liquids can be described quantitatively by Henry\u2019s law. Thus, CO2 in the atmosphere at 25 C, the Henry\u2019s law constant, and the partial pressure can be applied to \ufb01nd the equilib 2 11 rium. The KH for CO2 \u00bc 3.4 10 moll atm . The partial pressure of CO2 is found by calculating the fraction of CO2 in the atmosphere. Assuming a mean concentration of CO2 in the earth\u2019s troposphere to be 370 ppm by volume in the atmosphere, the fraction of CO2 must be 370 divided by 1,000,000 or 3.7 10 4 atm. Thus, the carbon dioxide and carbonic acid molar concentration can now be found: \u00bdCO2 \u00bc \u00bdH2CO3 \u00bc 3:4 10 2mol l 1 atm 1 0:000370 atm \u00bc 1:3 10 5M The equilibrium is [H3O\u00fe] \u00bc [HCO ]. Taking this and the previously calculated CO2 molar concentration gives &#1; &#3;&#1;&#3;&#1;&#3;2 HCO3 H3O\u00fe H3O\u00fe 7 \u00bc CO2 1:3 105Ka1 \u00bc 4:3 10 \u00bc &#1;&#3;2 12 H3O\u00fe\u00bc 5:6 10 &#1;&#3; H3O\u00fe\u00bc 2:4 10 6M The log of 2.4 10 6 is 5.63, so the negative log is about 5.63.", "Or, the droplet pH is about 5.63. Carbon dioxide, with water, is the ultimate product of aerobic microbial respiration, but it is also an important greenhouse gas. From the preceding discussion, a global increase in CO2 concentrations must also change the mean acidity of precipitation. If the current trend continues, a rather constant increase in tropospheric CO2 concentrations is expected. For example, the increase from the present 370 to 400 ppm tropospheric CO2 concentrations would be accompanied by a proportional decrease in precipitation pH. The molar concentration can be adjusted using the previous equations: 3:4 10 2moll 1atm 1 0:000400 atm 7 \u00bc 1:4 10 5M; so 4:3 10 &#1;&#3;2 H3O\u00fe &#1;&#3;2 \u00bc and H3O\u00fe 5 1:4 10 &#1;&#3; 12 6 \u00bc 6:0 10 and H3O\u00fe\u00bc 2:4 10M: This is about 5.61, so the negative log is about 5.61. Or, the droplet pH is about 5.61. Thus, the worldwide average water droplet pH would be decreased only slightly, i.e. about 0.02. This means that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide can be expected to contribute to greater acidity in natural rainfall. The precipitation rates, i.e. the total amount of water released from the atmosphere and reaching the earth\u2019s surface, would also be affected if IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21.4 CARBON CYCLING AND CLIMATE greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase, so any changes in atmospheric precipitation rates would also, on average, be expected to be more acidic. This is an interestingexampleofhowthe earthisactuallyaverylarge reactor. Changing one variable can profoundly change the entire system; in this instance the release of one gas changes numerous physical (e.g. temperature) and chemical (e.g. precipitation pH) factors, which in turn evoke a biological response (biome and ecosystem diversity). 21.4 CARBON CYCLING AND CLIMATE The discussion in the previous section indicates that there are many drivers and constraints involved in climate (see Figure 21.3). The increased amounts of CO2 will likely affect global temperature, which affects biomes and the kinetics within individual ecosystems. Ecological structure, such as tree associations, canopies, and forest \ufb02oors, as well as wetland structures may change, so that conditions may become reduced, with an attendant increase in anaerobic microbial decomposition, meaning greater releases of CH4, which would mean increasing global temperatures, all other factors being held constant. However, if greater biological activity and increased photosynthesis is triggered by the increase in CO2, and wetland depth is decreased, CH4 global concentrations would fall, leading to less global temperature rise. Conversely, if this increased biological activity and photosynthesis leads to a decrease in forest \ufb02oor detritus mass, then less anaerobic activity may lead to lower releases of CH4. In actuality, there will be increases and decreases at various scales, so the net effects on a complex, planetary system is highly uncertain. It is important to note that much of the concern for acid rain has been rightly concerned about compounds other than CO2, notably oxides of two other biophile elements, sulfur and nitrogen, which are discussed in the next chapter. These compounds can dramatically decrease the pH of rain. However, the increase in CO2 means that the pH of rainfall, which is not neutral to begin with, can further adversely affect the \ufb01sh and wildlife in and around surface waters as a consequence of C-based acidic compounds being added to the concentrations of sulfur and nitrogen compounds. As mentioned, CH4 is the product of anaerobic decomposition and human food production. Methane also is emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels and cutting and clearing of forests. The concentration of CH4 in the atmosphere has been steady at about 0.75 for over a thousand years, and then increased to 0.85 ppm in 1900. Since then, in the span of only a hundred years, it has skyrocketed to 1.7 ppm. Methane is removed from the atmosphere by reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH) as CH4 \u00fe OH \u00fe 9O2/CO2 \u00fe 0:5H2 \u00fe 2H2O \u00fe 5O3 (21.10) This indicates that the reaction creates carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone, all which are greenhouse FIGURE 21.3 Systematic view of changes in tropospheric carbon dioxide. Thick arrows indicate whether this factor will increase (up arrow), decrease (down arrow), or vary depending on the speci\ufb01cs (e.g. some greenhouse gas releases have decreased, e.g. the chloro\ufb02uorocarbons, and some gases can cool the atmosphere, e.g. sulfate aerosols). Question mark indicates that the type and/or direction of change are unknown or mixed. Thin arrows connect the factors as drivers toward downstream effects. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21.", "THE CARBON CYCLE gases; so the effect of one molecule of methane is devastating to the production of the greenhouse effect. The difference in gas concentrations and the exchange coef\ufb01cients between the atmosphere and surface waters determines how quickly a molecule of gas can move across the oceaneatmosphere boundary. It takes about 1 year to equilibrate CO2 in the surface ocean with atmospheric CO2, thus large atmosphereeocean differences in CO2 concentrations are common. Biota and ocean circulation account for the majority of the difference. The oceans contain vast C reservoirs. The atmosphere exchanges CO2 with these reservoirs, wherein CO2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid and its dissociation products. With the increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the interaction with the ocean surface alters the chemistry of the seawater resulting in ocean acidi\ufb01cation.3 Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is primarily a physical response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Increasing the partial pressure of a gas in the atmosphere directly above the body of water causes the gas to diffuse into that water until the partial pressures across the airewater interface are equilibrated. The effects are complex, e.g. increasing CO2 also modi\ufb01es the climate, which in turn may change ocean circulation, which changes the rate of ocean CO2 uptake. Marine ecosystem changes also alter the uptake.3 The earth acts as a re\ufb02ector to the sun\u2019s rays, receiving the radiation from the sun, re\ufb02ecting some of it into space (i.e. albedo), and adsorbing the rest, only to reradiate this into space as heat. Carbon cycling directly affects albedo by affecting the vegetative cover. In effect the earth acts as a wave converter, receiving the high-energy high-frequency radiation from the sun and converting most of it into low-energy low-frequency heat to be radiated back into space. In this manner, the earth maintains a balance of temperature. Green plants ameliorate the effects of these lighteheat exchanges. The light energy and the heat energy have to be de\ufb01ned in terms of their radiation patterns, as shown in Figure 21.4. The incoming radiation (light) wavelength has a maximum at around 0.5 nm and almost all of it is less than 3 nm. The heat energy spectrum, or that energy re\ufb02ected back into space, has a maximum at about 10 nm and almost all of it at a wavelength higher than 3 nm. As both light and heat energy pass through the earth\u2019s atmosphere they encounter the aerosols and gases surrounding the earth. These can either allow the energy to pass through, or they can interrupt it by scattering or absorption. If the atoms in the gas molecules vibrate at the same frequency as the light energy, they will absorb the energy and not allow it to pass through. Aerosols will scatter the light and provide a \u201cshade\u201d for the earth. The incoming radiation is impeded by water vapor and oxygen and ozone, as discussed in the preceding section. Most of the light energy comes through unimpeded. The heat energy, however, encounters several potential impediments. As it is trying to reach outer space, it \ufb01nds that water vapor, CO2,CH4,O3, and N2O. These compounds all have absorptive wavelengths in the middle of the heat spectrum. Quite obviously, an increase in the concentration of any of these will greatly limit the amount of heat transmitted into space. These gases are appropriately called greenhouse gases because their presence will limit the heat escaping into space, much like the glass of a greenhouse or even the glass in your car limits the amount of heat that can escape, thus building up the temperature under the glass cover. The effectiveness of a particular gas to promote global warming (or cooling, as is the case with aerosols) is known as forcing. The gases of most importance in forcing are listed in Table 21.2. The effectiveness of CO2 as a global warming gas has been known for over 100 years, but the \ufb01rst useful measurements of atmospheric CO2 were not taken until 1957. The data from Mauna Loa in Hawaii are exceptionally useful since they show that even in the 1950s the TABLE 21.2 Relative Forcing of Increased Global Temperature (Excluding Water Vapor) Percentage of Relative Greenhouse Gas Radiative Forcing Carbon dioxide, CO2 64 Methane, CH4 19 Halocarbons (mostly CFCs) 11 Nitrous oxide, N2O 6 IV.", "BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21.4 CARBON CYCLING AND CLIMATE CO2 concentration had increased from the baseline 280 ppm to 315 ppm, and this has continued to climb over the last 50 years at a constant rate of about 1.6 ppm per year. Arguably, the most serious problem with CO2 is that the effects on global temperature due to its greenhouse effect are delayed. The CO2 that is already in the troposphere will, even if combustion sources stopped emitting any new CO2 into the atmosphere, increase concentrations of CO2 from our present 370 ppm to possibly higher than 600 ppm. That is, if every combustion source immediately stopped emitting CO2 today, we have already contaminated the global atmosphere to where we will have doubled the CO2 concentration. The effect of this is discussed below. Methane is the product of anaerobic decomposition and human food production. One of the highest producers of methane in the world is New Zealand, which boasts 80 million sheep. Methane also is emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels and cutting and clearing of forests. The concentration of CH4 in the atmosphere has been steady at about 0.75 ppm for over a thousand years, and then increased to 0.85 ppm in 1900. Since then, in the space of only a hundred years, it has skyrocketed to 1.7 ppm. Methane is removed from the atmosphere by reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH) as CH4 \u00fe OH \u00fe 9O2/CO2 \u00fe 0:5H2 \u00fe 2H2O \u00fe 5O3 (21.11) But in so doing, it creates carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone, all of which are greenhouse gases, so the effect of one molecule of methane is devastating to the production of the greenhouse effect. Halocarbons are the same classes of compounds involved in the destruction of atmospheric ozone, and are also at work in promoting global warming. The most effective global warming gases are CFC-11 and CFC-12, both of which are no longer manufactured, and the banning of these substances has shown a leveling off in the stratosphere. Certainly, not all greenhouse gases are C-based. Nitrous oxide is emitted to the atmosphere predominantly as a result of human activities, especially the cutting and clearing of tropical forests (which, as mentioned, also has deleterious albedo consequences). The greatest problem with nitrous oxide is that there appear to be no natural removal processes for this gas and so its residence time in the stratosphere is quite long. This is another example of the interrelationships and interdependencies between the C and N cycles. The net effect of these global pollutants is still being debated. Various atmospheric models used to predict temperature change over the next 100 years vary widely. They nevertheless agree that some positive change will occur. By the year 2100, even if we do not increase our production of greenhouse gases and international agreements are reached and subsequently followed, the global temperature is likely to be between 0.5 and 1.5 C warmer than at present. This effect of this on natural systems and dynamics in the oceans and atmosphere could be devastating. The cycling of C indicates the numerous complexities in addressing air pollution science and engineering. For example, pollution control ef\ufb01ciency and success have often been based on CO2 production rates, i.e. the greater the amount of CO2 leaving a stack, the better air pollution control equipment is operating. This is because complete combustion results in the production of CO2 and H2O. Likewise, the production of CH4 has been an indication of complete anaerobic digestion of organic compounds. Both these indicators of pollution control success are greenhouse gases. Air pollution decisions are often made among competing interests and perspectives. These involve trade-offs. For example, remediating a contaminated site may call for excavation of soil, which is then incinerated. The complete incineration will result in generating and emitting greenhouse gases. Determining whether this approach is successful and appropriate depends on the extent and quality of options from which these emissions occur. For example, if dioxin-laden soil is incinerated, this may have been the only viable approach to detoxify a very toxic and persistent compound. Releasing CO2 in this case is truly a measure of success. Another lesson that can be drawn from C cycling is that of feedback systems. For example, scienti\ufb01c principles can be put to work at various points in the event cascade in Figure 21.3 to weight the factors in terms of their contribution to climate change and to begin to address these factors with engineering and other interventions.", "As evidence, several steps in the causal chain occur before a biome is adversely affected. Therefore, preventing the impact will require the elimination of an action that leads to other actions that ultimately affect the biome. This is preferable to allowing the biome impact to occur and then to remediate the problems that it brings. One of the biggest engineering challenges is how to select and operate control technologies in a manner fully cognizant and deferential of the biogeochemical cycles. This view would likely bring valuable information to the current debates on the projected impact of global climate change; especially, in light of the seeming paucity of ways to deal with the problem. The National Academy of Engineering has identi\ufb01ed the most important challenges to the future of engineering. Both the nitrogen and carbon biogeochemical cycles are explicitly identi\ufb01ed among the most pressing engineering needs. The biogeochemical cycle that extracts nitrogen from the air for its incorporation into plantsdand hence IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21. THE CARBON CYCLE fooddhas become altered by human activity. With widespread use of fertilizers and high-temperature industrial combustion, humans have doubled the rate at which nitrogen is removed from the air relative to preindustrial times, contributing to smog and acid rain, polluting drinking water, and even worsening global warming. Engineers must design countermeasures for the nitrogen cycle problems discussed in the next chapter, while maintaining the ability of agriculture to produce adequate food supplies.4 The C cycle and nutrient cycles are inextricably linked. Like C, chemical species of N and the other nutrient elements are essential and toxic, depending on its dose and form. The Academy articulates this challenge: The biogeochemical cycle that extracts nitrogen from the air for its incorporation into plantsdand hence fooddhas become altered by human activity. With widespread use of fertilizers and high-temperature industrial combustion, humans have doubled the rate at which nitrogen is removed from the air relative to preindustrial times, contributing to smog and acid rain, polluting drinking water, and even worsening global warming. Engineers must design countermeasures for nitrogen cycle problems, while maintaining the ability of agriculture to produce adequate food supplies.4 Engineers can expect to be increasingly asked to recommend improvements to the biogeochemical cycling of C, such as enhancements to the food life cycles (e.g. animal feeding operations, farmlands, rangelands, and groceries). How can engineering innovation improve the ef\ufb01ciency of various human activities related to nitrogen, from making fertilizer to recycling food wastes? Currently, less than half of the \ufb01xed nitrogen generated by farming practices actually ends up in harvested crops. And less than half of the nitrogen in those crops actually ends up in the foods that humans consume. In other words, \ufb01xed nitrogen leaks out of the system at various stages in the processdfrom the farm \ufb01eld to the feedlot to the sewage treatment plant. Engineers not only need to identify the leakage points and to devise systems to plug them, i.e. the structural and mechanical solutions, but also must engage biological solutions, such as understanding the processes that lead to increased C and nutrient emissions, and applying this understanding to modify the processes accordingly.5 21.5 CARBON GEOENGINEERING Recently, some engineers and scientists have suggested that it would be prudent to consider engaging in planetary-scale interventions, so-called geoengineering, to mitigate global climate change and global warming in particular. Geoengineering differs from other methods for mitigating global warming because it involves a deliberate effort to affect the climate at a global scale. Although geoengineering is not a new idea, it has taken on added signi\ufb01cance as a result of dif\ufb01culties with implementing other proposals to mitigate climate change. While proponents of geoengineering admit that these measures can be associated with signi\ufb01cant risks to the environment and public health, they maintain that they are well worth pursuing, given the failure to date of means of mitigating global warming. Conversely, some environmental groups have voiced strong opposition to all forms of geoengineering. Carbon sequestration is one type of geoengineering that has received considerable attention. Actually, sequestration is an ongoing, geophysical process. Carbon compounds, especially CO2 and CH4, \ufb01nd their way to the ocean, forests, and other carbon sinks.b Like many geobiochemical processes, sequestration is one that can be in\ufb02uenced by human activity. Thus, there is a conservation aspect to protecting these mechanisms that are working to our bene\ufb01t. The second approach is one that is most familiar to the engineer, that is, application of scienti\ufb01c principles to enhance sequestration.", "These sequestration technologies include new ways either to sequester carbon or to enhance or expedite processes that already exist. Conservation is an example of a more \u201cpassive\u201d approach. There are currently enormous releases of carbon that, if eliminated, would greatly reduce the loading to the troposphere. For example, anything we can do to protect the loss of forest, woodlands, wetlands, and other ecosystems is a way of preventing future problems. In fact, much of the terrestrial \ufb02uxes and sinks of carbon involves the soil. Keeping the soil in place must be part of the overall global strategy to reduce greenhouse gases. Anticipating the continued use of fossil fuels, engineers have explored technological methods of capturing the carbon dioxide produced from fuel burning and sequestering it underground.6 Sequestration is a biosystematic solution since it is an ongoing process on planet earth, with myriad interactions between biotic and abiotic factors. The arrows in Figure 21.1 show that carbon compounds, especially CO2 and CH4, \ufb01nd their way to the ocean, forests, and other carbon sinks. Like many biogeochemical processes, sequestration can be in\ufb02uenced by human action. b This is a common theme of environmental engineering, i.e. to borrow a naturally occurring process, but to speed it up and otherwise enhance it to address pollution. Wastewater treatment, and biological (e.g. bio\ufb01lters) air pollution control systems, for example, mimic soil and water microbial systems. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21.5 CARBON GEOENGINEERING 21.5.1 Carbon Sequestration in Soil The soil is home to Pseudomonas and numerous other species that have been used to treat wastes for decades. The very essence of a soil\u2019s \u201cvalue\u201d has been its capacity to support plant life, especially crops. At a minimum, air pollution prevention strategies must include an understanding of soil properties such as their texture or grain size (see Table 21.3), ion exchange capacities, ionic strength, pH, microbial populations, and soil organic matter content. Soil is a matrix made up of various components, including organic matter and unconsolidated material. The matrix contains liquids (i.e. \u201csubstrate\u201d to the chemist and bioengineer) within its interstices. Much of the substrate in this matrix is water with varying amounts of solutes. Under most environmental conditions, air and water are solutions of very dilute amounts of compounds. For example, air\u2019s solutes represent small percentages of the solution at the highest (e.g. water vapor) and most other solutes represent parts per million (recall that there is about 370 ppm carbon dioxide). Soil is a conglomeration of all states of matter. Soil is predominantly solid, but frequently has large fractions of liquid (soil water) and gas (soil air, methane, and carbon dioxide) that make up the matrix. The composition of each fraction is highly variable. For example, soil gas concentrations are different from those in the atmosphere and change profoundly with depth from the surface. Table 21.4 illustrates the inverse relationship between carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen. Sediment can be envisioned as an underwater soil. It is a collection of particles that have settled on the bottom of water bodies. Ecosystems are combinations of these media. For example, a wetland system consists of plants that grow in soil, sediment, and water.

Microbial populations live in the surface water, with aerobic species congregating near the water surface and anaerobic microbes increasing with depth due to the decrease in oxygen levels, due to the reduced conditions.", "Air is not only important at the water and soil interfaces, but it is a vehicle for nutrients and contaminants delivered to the wetland. The groundwater is fed by the surface water during high water conditions, and feeds the wetland during low water conditions. These environmental media are compartments, each with boundary conditions, kinetics, and partitioning relationships within a compartment or among other compartments. Chemicals, whether nutrients or contaminants, change as a result of the time spent in each compartment. The bioengineering challenge is to describe, characterize, and predict the behaviors of various chemical species as they move through the media. When something is amiss, the cause and cure lie within the physics, chemistry, and biology of the system. Soil conservation is an important part of sustainable agriculture and food production, since it entails keeping soil from becoming a pollutant in the surface waters, and its ability to sieve and \ufb01lter pollutants that would otherwise end up in drinking water. Another perhaps less obvious bene\ufb01t is that soil is a vast a sink for carbon. Soil is lost when land is degraded by deforestation and as a result of inadequate land use and management in sensitive soil systems, especially those in the tropics and subtropics, such as slash and burn and other aggressive practices. As is often the case in ecosystems, some of the most valuable ecosystems in terms of the amount of carbon sequestered and oxygen generated are also the most sensitive. Tropical systems, e.g., often have some of the thinnest soils due to the rapid oxidation processes that take place in humid, oxidized environments. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21. THE CARBON CYCLE Sensitive systems are given value by society for a single purpose. Bauxite, e.g., is present in tropical soils due to the physical and chemical conditions of the tropics (aluminum in parent rock material, oxidation, humidity, and ion exchange processes). However, from a life cycle and resource planning perspective, such single-mindedness is folly. The decision to extract bauxite, iron, or other materials from sensitive tropical rain forests must be seen in terms of local, regional, and global impacts. With this in mind, international organizations are promoting improved land use systems and land management practices, which give both economic and environmental bene\ufb01ts. Keeping soil intact protects biological diversity, improves ecosystem conditions, and increases carbon sequestration. This last-mentioned bene\ufb01t includes numerous forms of carbon in all physical phases. Soil gases include CO2 and CH4. Plant root systems, fungi, and other organisms that are composed of amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and other organic compounds live in the soil. Even inorganic forms of carbon are held in soil, such as the carbonate, bicarbonate, and carbonic acid chemical species that are in soils as a result of chemical reactions with parent rock material, especially limestone and dolomite. When the soils are lost, all these carbon compounds become available to be released to the atmosphere. Thus, soil conservation is a passive process that can be enhanced to sequester carbon. 21.5.2 Active Carbon Sequestration Active sequestration is the application of technologies to send carbon to the sinks, including deep rock formations and the oceans. Such technology can be applied directly to sources. Such technology can be applied directly to sources. For example, \ufb01res from China\u2019s coal mines presently release about 1 billion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. Estimates put FIGURE 21.5 Section view of cross-measure methane-drainage holes in a coal mine ventilation system. Ref. 7; and McKensey BR, Longwall JWR. Ventilation with methane and spontaneous combustion-Pacifc Colliery. Paper in fourth international mine ventilation congress (Brisbane, Australia, July 3e6, 1988). Melbourne (Australia): Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy; 1988. p. 617e24. India\u2019s coal mine \ufb01re releases to be about 50 million tons. This accounts for as much as 1% of all carbon greenhouse releases. This is about the same as the CO2 released by all of the gasoline-fuel automobiles in the United States. Engineering solutions that reduce these emissions would actively improve the net greenhouse gas global \ufb02ux. The United States has a checkered history when it comes to coal mine \ufb01res. Some underground mines have burned for more than a century. Intuitively, putting out such \ufb01res may seem straightforward. For example, we know that combustion depends on three components:a fuel,aheat source,and oxygen. Allthree are needed, so a coal \ufb01re can be eliminated if just one of these essential ingredients is removed. Unfortunately, since the \ufb01re is in an underground vein, fuel is plentiful.", "Actually, the solid-phase coal is less of a factor than theavailableCH4, which is ubiquitous in coal mines. And like the \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d game, the avenues of access to the\ufb01re mean that theheatsourceisavailable in different channels. When one is closed off, another appears. So, the only remaining option is to deprive the \ufb01re of O2. In fact, most attempts have been outright failures in this regard. Flooding the mines has been ineffective, since the \ufb01re simply \ufb01nds alternative pathways in the leaky underground strata. Excavation has to almost be 100% to be effective. Flushing with slurries has the same problems. In fact, miner safety and postignition \ufb01re suppression can be seen as competing factors in mining. To ensure suf\ufb01cient oxygen levels and low toxic gas concentrations the mine\u2019s ventilation systems require methane-drainage holes to control methane at the face. In many abandoned mines, cross-measure holes (see Figure 21.5) were the most common types. These systems are one reason that oxygen remains available to the \ufb01re.7 Recent studies have shown that certain foams can deprive \ufb01res of O2 over extensive areas. For example, a IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21.5 CARBON GEOENGINEERING study sanctioned by the US National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) showed preliminary success in sealing a coal mine from oxygen in\ufb02ow, and suppression of the \ufb01re with liquid nitrogen and gas-enhanced foam.8 The technology needs to be advanced to address the very large \ufb01res. The \ufb01re studied by NIOSH (see Figure 21.6) was caught in the early stages and suppressed within 2 weeks. But, like many engineering prototypes, showing that it can work is only the \ufb01rst step to ensure it will work. Another active geoengineering approach is an enhancement of existing processes. For example, in addition to conserving present levels of carbon sequestration, technologies can be adapted to increase the rates of sequestration. The scale of such technology can range from an individual source, such as a fossil fuel burning electricity generation station that returns its stack gases to an underground rock stratum, to an extensive system of collection and injection systems that include a whole network of facilities. The combination of disincentives, like carbon taxes, and application of emerging technologies can decrease the carbon \ufb02ux to the atmosphere. Thus, green engineering is part of the overall, comprehensive geopolitical strategy. Even a system as large as the ocean has its limits in greenhouse gas sequestration. For starters, most of the CO2 generated by human activities (i.e. anthropogenic) resides in the upper layers of the ocean (see Figure 21.7). Carbon compounds move into and out of oceans predominantly as a function of the solubility of the compound and water temperature. For CO2, this means that more of the compound will remain in the ocean water with decreasing temperature. Ocean mixing is very slow. Thus, the anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere is predominantly con\ufb01ned to the very top layers. Virtually half of the anthropogenic CO2 taken up by the ocean for the previous two centuries has stayed in the upper 10% of the ocean. The ocean has removed 48% of the CO2 released to the troposphere from burning fossil fuels and cement manufacturing.9 Sequestration not only requires moving C to a sink, but also holding the C for long time periods. Thus, to keep CO2 sequestered, it must move to the cooler, deeper parts of the ocean. Otherwise, when CO2 resides near the warmer surface, it is more likely to be released to the atmosphere. The actual mass of C can be increased by management. For example, certain species of plankton are often limited in growth by metals, especially iron. Thus, increasing the iron concentrations in certain ocean layers could dramatically increase the ability of these organisms to take up and store C. In addition, even if the technological means of moving C to the ocean reservoirs is workable, the sequestration may lead to large-scale and virtually irreversible consequences. In particular, there is already troubling evidence of ocean acidi\ufb01cation due to increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, notwithstanding the effects of intentional sequestration (see Discussion Box in Chapter 5: Ocean Acidi\ufb01cation). Obviously, any large-scale endeavor like geoengineering must be approached with an appropriate amount of caution. The best decisions are ones that account for all possible outcomes, certainly not exclusively the ones hoped for. Such an approach would likely include IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21.

BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21.5 CARBON GEOENGINEERING tests in laboratories, stepped up to prototypes on as many possible scenarios and species possible, before actual implementation. With these caveats, C sequestration is promising. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identi\ufb01ed four basic systems for capturing CO2 from use of fossil fuels and/or biomass processes: 1. Capture from industrial process streams 2. Postcombustion capture 3. Oxyfuel combustion capture 4. Precombustion capture10 The likely critical paths of these technologies are shown in Figure 21.8 and general con\ufb01gurations of the technologies are depicted in Figure 21.9. Thus, at numerous points in the C biogeochemical cycle, there are numerous ways of conserving and adding to natural sequestration processes that could signi\ufb01cantly decrease the net greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The sequestration can take place at numerous locations in the C cycles. For example, a promising approach is to deploy the biotic portion of the C cycle. Organisms have very effective means of sequestering CO2 during respiration. Technologies can be developed to take advantage of metabolic reactions involving CO2 in living organisms, particularly enzymatic processes. In one enzyme-based system,11 CO2 is captured and released by emulating the mammalian respiratory system (see Figure 21.10). The process employs carbonic anhydrase (CA) contained in a hollow \ufb01ber liquid membrane. The CA developing membrane is used to separate CO2 from the \ufb02ue gas. Modifying the membrane allows for enhanced diffusion of CO2 due to the strong interactions between the permeating CO2 molecules and the amine functional membrane pores should enhance selective diffusion of CO2. Movement of other gases, such as O2, N2, and SO2 is blocked, which increases selective sequestration of CO2. Carbon cycling must be considered along with the biogeochemical cycling of other substances. The cycling IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 21.

However, from an air pollution perspective, N and S compounds deserve special attention. Many N and S compounds are air pollutants. Two of the six National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) pollutants are oxides of these elements, i.e. sulfur dioxide (SO4) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In addition, the oxides of nitrogen (NOx), made up of NO2 and nitric oxide (NO), are major precursors of another NAAQS pollutant, i.e. ozone. Even more N and S compounds are constituents in the cells of the living receptors affected by pollutants, including amines, proteins, and genetic molecules. The good news is that, in the Western hemisphere, the tropospheric concentrations of N and S pollutants have generally fallen in recent decades (Figure 22.1). The bad news is that these improvements are not being experienced in many parts of the world. 22.1 THE NITROGEN CYCLE Nitrogen is part of the abiotic (nonliving) and biotic (living) parts of earth. The element exists in myriad chemical forms that move at varying rates in the nitrogen cycle. Like carbon discussed in the previous chapter, N is stored in reservoirs such as the atmosphere, living organisms, soils, and oceans. 4 From these sinks, N cycles between the biosphere and the atmosphere. The N cycles among ecosystems and the organisms, including humans, within these ecosystems. Most of the earth\u2019s mass of N resides in the atmosphere. Approximately 79% of the molecules in Earth\u2019s atmosphere are molecular nitrogen (N2). All organisms must metabolize N into larger molecules; notably amino acids, proteins, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Amino acids contain the functional group amine (NH2) and are the building blocks of proteins. DNA consists of adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, which consist of rings of carbon and nitrogen atoms, with various side chains. The N2 is not directly available to most organisms (a major exception being the N-fxing bacteria found in legume roots).", "The atmospheric N2 is converted to bioavailable N species (e.g. nitrates; NO3 ) abiotically (e.g. lightning strikes or fres) and biotically (e.g. by the N-fxing bacteria known as diazotrophs). Energy exchange in many ecosystems is largely controlled by available N as a result of N-limits of the fora and microorganisms living within these systems. Indeed, along with P, the amount of N is the major limiting factor on the rate of net primary production of biomass in most ecosystems. That is, an increase in bioavailable N is associated with an increase in production of biomass of these organisms in an ecosystem. For example, increasing the amount of carbon in a lake system will have little effect on the production of biomass since most systems have ample mass of bioavailable C. Conversely, increasing bioavailable N in most lake systems increases total biomass. Similar limits are placed on terrestrial biota. Thus, N is a limiting factor for plant growth. The N-cycle mirrors the trophic state and energy cycles in ecosystems. Producers convert mineral forms of N to N-containing molecules, e.g. amino acids and DNA. Consumers then receive N by consuming producers and forming even larger N-containing molecules, e.g. proteins (built from amino acids). Higher trophic state consumers receive N from consuming lower level organisms, i.e. both consumers and producers. Decomposers convert N in the opposite direction, i.e. mineralization, converting the N-containing, organic molecules of dead organisms to inorganic \u00fe\u00fe compounds, e.g. ammonium (NH4 )salts. The NH4 salts have high aqueous solubility and readily absorb to soil particles. At these sites, bacteria and other mi- \u00fe crobes can oxidize the NH4 into nitrite (NO2 )compounds and in turn to nitrate (NO3 ) compounds. This oxidation process is known as nitri\ufb01cation.

These dissolved oxidized forms of N are reduced (i.e. denitrifed) by bacteria known as denitri\ufb01ers. This is a major process by which N is returned to the atmosphere. Ionization is an important part of N and S cycling, as it is for all nutrient cycling. This is due to the confguration of electrons in an atom. The arrangement of the electrons in the atom\u2019s outermost shell, i.e. valence, determines the ultimate chemical behavior of the atom. The outer electrons become involved in the transfer to and the sharing with shells in other atoms, i.e. forming new compounds and ions. An atom will gain or lose valence electrons to form a stable ion that has the same number of electrons as the noble gas nearest the atom\u2019s atomic number. As mentioned, the N cycle includes three principal forms that are soluble in water under environmental conditions: the cation (positively charged \u00fe ion) ammonium (NH4 ) and the anions (negatively charged ions) nitrate (NO3 ) and nitrite (NO2 ). Nitrates and nitrites combine with various organic and inorganic compounds. Following entry into the body, NO3 is converted to NO2 . Since NO3 is soluble and readily available as a nitrogen source for plants (e.g. to form plant tissue such as amino acids and proteins), farmers are the biggest users of NO3 compounds in commercial fertilizers (although even manure can contain high levels of NO3 ). Nitrogen in several forms fnds its way from the atmosphere to the soil through abiotic and biotic processes. As mentioned, NO3 compounds are formed from lightning and by nitrogen-fxing bacteria in legumes\u2019 root nodules. The Rhizobia (genera Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, and Bradyrhizobium) are Gram-negative motile, rod-shaped, aerobic soil bacteria that infect legume roots (Figure 22.2) in a symbiotic relationship with legumes, e.g. Medicago, Melilotus, and Trigonella. The symbiotic relationship results from the bacteria fxing atmospheric nitrogen, providing ammonium for protein production in the plant. In exchange, the bacteria obtain energy from the plant.5 Nitrate compounds are also formed by microbial (fungal and bacterial) degradation of detritus by aerobes and anaerobes on the forest foor.", "With moisture, numerous simultaneous chemical reactions occur, making for a balance among various chemical forms of N (as well as those of S, P, K, C, and other nutrients). The chemical reactions in the N cycle, as in any nutrient cycle, require various energy sources, especially light, heat, and metabolic energy. Some biochemical processes within an organism fx molecular nitrogen (N2) from the atmosphere to form simple N-compounds (e.g. diazotrophs in root nodules), which in turn form amino acids in the tissues of plants and animals.

Vallero DA. Environmental contaminants: assessment and control. Burlington (MA): Elsevier Academic Press; 2004. Dentrification (anaerobic processes) The mineralization and denitrifcation occurs by numerous processes, in addition to microbial degradation, including photolysis, hydrolysis, and reduction or oxidation. The result is a wide array of conversions of nitrogen-containing organic compounds (e.g. proteins and amino acids) to inorganic (mineral) forms, such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, nitrite, and nitrate. Note that the gases at the top of Figure 22.3 include those that are important in air pollution. For example, NO is one of the compounds involved in the photochemistry that leads to the formation of the pollutant ozone (O3) in the troposphere. Note also that the relationship between microbes and macrophytes is central in the fgure. Much of the chemistry occurs on the foor in the detritus where microbes degrade complex molecules. Nutrients in the soil are transported by the roots capillary action to plant cells. Gases are transpired through leaves back to the atmosphere. The atmospheric speciation at the top of Figure 22.3 is an oversimplifcation, with many competing processes. For example, NO2 compounds in the soil can release nitrous acid (HONO) directly to the atmosphere. When soil contains elevated amounts of nitrates due to fertilization, HONO is released to the atmosphere. The more acidic the soil, the greater will be the release of HONO. In the troposphere, HONO leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which both degrade and increase the deposition of air pollutants. Large volumes of acids are released from soil continuously to the atmosphere. Soils with high N concentrations form the acids from NO2 ions. These anions are frst released into the soil by microbes that have transformed ammonium and nitrate ions into nitrite ions. Increasing soil acidity produces high nitrite concentrations, leading to greater concentrations of HONO emitted to the troposphere.6 About 30% of the primary OH radical production is attributed to the photolysis of HONO. Thus, what may at frst appear as a soilewater interaction (fertilizer added to increase crop yield) is indeed a soilewaterebiota (microbial) process, followed by an airewater interaction (chemical transformation of air pollutants, followed by precipitation). In this instance, the air pollutants are decreased by increasing concentrations of water pollutants (nitrates and ammonium). Figure 22.3 also shows that when organic compounds are degraded by microbes, especially nitrifying bacteria, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are released to the atmosphere. Thus, the fux of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the soil to the lower troposphere is inversely related to the rate of degradation of organic compounds in the soil. Ion exchange is actually an example of sorption; i.e., movement of a chemical species from the liquid or gas phase to the solid phase.a Plants grow as a function of available nutrients that they are able to sorb, which is affected by available N and other cycles within the forest ecosystem.7 With this growth, compounds of N and other nutrients fnd their way to the atmosphere. Nitrogen has three common oxidation states, \u00fe3, \u00fe4, and \u00fe5. Thus, like carbon, the multiple oxidation states mean that N can form many compounds, even with a single, other element. For example, it can combine a Movement of a chemical species from solid to liquid phase is dissolution. Movement from the solid phase to gas phase is volatilization. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 22. THE NITROGEN AND SULFUR CYCLES with oxygen to form N2O, NO, NO2,orN2O5, all important air pollutants or precursors to air pollutants. Nitrite is an intermediate compound in both nitrifcation and denitrifcation. The N in the nitrate anion (NO3 ) has an oxidation state of \u00fe5 (i.e. three O atoms each with 2 charge plus 5 yields the nitrate charge of 1).", "The nitrite anion has a trivalent N, i.e. N3\u00fe (i.e. two O atoms each with 2 charge plus 3 yields the nitrite charge of 1). The major mechanism for producing N3\u00fe in soil is by biological nitrifcation and denitrifcation processes. Nitrifying microbes produce nitrite ions from ammonium. Denitrifying microbes produce nitrite from nitrate.6 The N compounds enter the troposphere by several mechanisms. In addition to the ordinary concentrations of molecular N, various nitrogen compounds are formed from reactions ranging from very fast (especially combustion) to quite slow, multistage (microbial) reaction rates. The two principal air pollutants regulated throughout the world are nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide. Nitric oxide (NO) is a colorless, odorless gas and is essentially insoluble in water. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has a pungent acid odor and is somewhat soluble in water. Air pollution experts now refer to NO and NO2 collectively as NOx. This is in part because the NO lifetime after emission is quite short (>minute <hour).8 The simple oxidation of molecular N at high temperature is D N2 \u00fe O2/2NO (22.1) The emitted NO rapidly undergoes photochemical transformation to NO2: 2NO D O2 / 2NO2 (22.2) Indeed, NO and NO2 can interconvert, depending on redox and photochemical conditions in the troposphere and stratosphere. For example, in sunlight, ultraviolet radiation splits NO2 into NO and O. So, it is often preferred to consider the dynamic relationship of the two molecules rather than to ascribe a single speciation, especially for characterizing the atmosphere. However, the two compounds must be distinguished in risk assessments given their very different health effects. Mobile sources (i.e. cars, trucks, trains, boats, and aircraft) comprise the largest contributor to NOx emissions in the Untied States (59%; 12.7 Mt in 2002). The US\u2019s largest contributing stationary source category is electric generation (22%; 4.6 Mt in 2002), followed by industrial factories (11%; 2.4 Mt in 2002). The eastern and midwestern US regions had the highest emissions (Figure 22.4). Europe has similar emission profles for NOx (Figure 22.5), with the largest percentage coming from mobile sources (road and nonroad transport), and the largest stationary source being energy production and distribution. Although both NO and NO2 can be harmful to humans and ecosystems, NO is also actually essential to metabolism, so is harmful at much higher concentrations than that of NO2. On the other hand, NO2 is inherently toxic, causing respiratory problems. Both compounds are precursors to tropospheric ozone IV.

Nitrogen species important to air quality include many compounds in addition to NOx. Atmospheric N reactions can be more complicated than may be inferred from Reactions (22.1) and (22.2). For example, the NOx reaction from NO to NO2 likely involves water and an intermediate, i.e. nitrous acid (HONO): 4NO D O2 D 2H2O / 4HONO (22.3) The larger suite of N air pollution compounds is known as total reactive nitrogen, which is denoted as NOy. This suite includes NO and NO2, plus their oxidation products.10 The major vapor phase and particulate constituents of NOy include NO, NO2, nitric acid (HNO3), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), HONO, organic nitrates, and particulate nitrates: NOy [ NO2 D NO D HNO3 D PAN (22.4) D 2N2O5 D HONO D NO3 D NOL compounds D NOL aerosols 33 Every NOy compound is derived directly from NOx emissions or through transformations in the troposphere.9 Most of the compounds originate from combustion processes. As noted, the atmosphere itself is the source of much of the nitrogen leading to the formation of nitrogen compounds. Molecular nitrogen (N2) makes up the largest share of gaseous content of the earth\u2019s atmosphere (79% by volume). Because N2 is relatively nonreactive under most atmospheric conditions, it seldom enters into chemical reactions, but under pressure and at very high temperatures, such as in an internal combustion engine or industrial boiler, the molecular N will react with O2, i.e. Reaction (22.1).", "This N2 precursor is known as \u201cthermal NOx \u201d since the oxides form at high temperatures, such as near burner fames in combustion chambers. Approximately 90e95% of the nitrogen oxides generated in combustion processes are in the form of NO. Other nitrogen oxides can also form at high heat and pressure, especially NO2. Most motor vehicles around the world still employ temperature/high-pressure internal combustion engines. Thus, such mobile sources contribute largely to the tropospheric concentrations of NOx, making it a major mobile source air pollutant in terms of human health directly (e.g. respiratory toxicity of NO2) and indirectly (i.e. NOx as the key components in tropospheric ozone production). These conditions of high temperature and pressure can also exist in boilers such as those in power plants, so NOx is also commonly found in high concentrations leaving fossil fuel power generating stations. In addition to the atmospheric molecular nitrogen as a precursor of nitrogen air pollutants of combustion, fossil fuels themselves contain varying concentrations of N. Nitrogen oxides that form from the fuel or feedstock are called \u201cfuel NOx\u201d. Unlike the sulfur compounds, which mainly exit stationary source stacks as vapor phase compounds (e.g. SO2 and other oxides of sulfur), a signifcant fraction of the fuel nitrogen burned in power plants and other stationary sources remains in the bottom ash or in unburned aerosols in the gases leaving the combustion chamber, i.e. the fy ash. Nitrogen oxides can also be released from nitric acid plants and other types of industrial processes involving the generation and/or use of nitric acid (HNO3). At temperatures far below combustion, such as those often present in the ambient atmosphere, NO2 can form the molecule NO2eO2N or simply N2O4 that consists of two identical simpler NO2 molecules. This molecular confguration is known as a dimer. The dimer N2O4 is distinctly reddish brown and contributes to the brown IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 22. THE NITROGEN AND SULFUR CYCLES haze that is often associated with photochemical smog incidents. In addition to the health effects associated with NO2 exposure, much of the concern for regulating emissions of nitrogen compounds is to suppress the reactions in the atmosphere that generate the highly reactive molecule ozone (O3). Nitrogen oxides play key roles in O3 formation. Ozone forms photochemically (i.e. the reaction is caused or accelerated by light energy) in the lowest level of the atmosphere, known as the troposphere, where people and other biota live. Nitrogen dioxide is the principal gas responsible for absorbing sunlight needed for these photochemical reactions. So, in the presence of sunlight, the NO2 that forms from the NO incrementally stimulates the photochemical smog-forming reactions because nitrogen dioxide is very effcient at absorbing sunlight in the ultraviolet portion of its spectrum. This is why ozone episodes are more common in the summer and in areas with ample sunlight. Other chemical ingredients, i.e. ozone precursors, in O3 formation include volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide (CO). Governments regulate the emissions of precursor compounds to diminish the rate at which O3 forms. Cyanide (CN ) is another N anion that is important to air pollution. Cyanide in the bloodstream impairs oxidative phosphorylation, a process by which oxygen is taken up for the production of essential cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process transfers electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to form water from H\u00fe and O2, through a series of reactions catalyzed by enzymes. With less O2 available to react with the cytochrome C and hence complete the electron transport process, ATP production is diminished. The high binding affnity of CN to the ferric ion in hemoglobin is responsible for the decrease in O2 carried in the blood. Thus, CN binds preferentially to hemoglobin and prohibits oxygen binding. Methemoglobinemia is a particularly troublesome outcome resulting from endogenous production of the CN anion, such as from the exposure of infants to nitrates in drinking water. Ingesting high concentrations of nitrates can cause serious short-term illness and even death in infants of 6 months or younger. The serious illness in infants is due to the conversion of microbial NO3 to NO2 in the gastrointestinal tract. Small children\u2019s lower stomach acidity (greater pH) allows for more prolifc bacterial growth than do adult stomachs. Also, NO3 is more easily converted to NO2 than in adult hemoglobin and circulatory system, which are too immature in small children to return to normal hemoglobin. As a result, the increased NO2 concentrations interfere with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.", "Especially in small children, when nitrates compete successfully against molecular oxygen, the blood carries methemoglobin (as opposed to healthy hemoglobin), giving rise to clinical symptoms. At 15e20% methemoglobin, children can experience shortness of breath and blueness of the skin (i.e. clinical cyanosis). At 20e40% methemoglobin, hypoxia will result. This acute condition can deteriorate a child\u2019s health rapidly over a period of days, especially if the water source continues to be used. Long-term, elevated exposures of nitrates and nitrites can cause an increase in the kidneys\u2019 production of urine (diuresis), increased starchy deposits, and hemorrhaging of the spleen.11 A few animal studies suggest that elevated NO3 and NO2 in exposures may also elicit other effects, e.g. increased miscarriage rates and anencephaly. Nitrate exposure may also cause hypothyroidism (i.e. by mimicking and blocking iodide compounds from reaching the thyroid).12 22.2 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SULFUR AND NITROGEN From the standpoint of air pollution, the biogeochemical cycles must not be limited to single elements. As shown in Figure 22.6, after a compound is emitted, it reacts with numerous other compounds and changes physically and chemically. It is transported advectively, is dispersed, and fnally deposited to the earth\u2019s surface, where it continues to undergo physical, chemical, and biological changes. This is demonstrated by the interactions of N and S in acid deposition, as well as by the integration of myriad atmospheric chemical species that infuence and are infuenced by N and S.9 This includes both the formation of conventional NAAQS pollutants, like ozone and particulate matter (PM), as well as the transformation and changes in bioavailability of toxic air pollutants, e.g. mercury (Hg) and semivolatile organic compounds like dioxins and organochlorine pesticides. The atmospheric movement of N and S compounds and other pollutants from sources to receptors is only one form of translocation. The second one involves the attempt to control air pollutants at the source. For example, the control of SO2 and PM by wet or dry scrubbing techniques yields large quantities of waste materialsdoften toxicdwhich are subsequently stored onsite at the facility or taken to landflls and other long-term disposal sites. If these wastes are not properly stored, they can be released to soil or water systems, e.g. from runoff of acids or spills into nearby surface water, resulting in acidic, as well as heavy metal and metalloid contamination. The prime examples involve the disposal of toxic materials in dump sites or landflls. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 and subsequent revisions are examples of legislation to ensure proper management of solid waste IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 22.2 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SULFUR AND NITROGEN disposal and to minimize damage to areas near landflls.13 However, given the massive volume of wastes generated by energy production, especially ash from coal-fred power plants, such solid waste laws are limited in their ability to ensure proper storage in ash piles and pits, putting adjacent surface water and groundwater at risk. The oxidized chemical species of sulfur and nitrogen, e.g. sulfur dioxide (SO2)and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), form acids when they react with water. This can occur in any media, e.g. the atmosphere (i.e. acid deposition), and in mining waste and ash runoff to surface waters and groundwater. The lowered pH is responsible for numerous environmental problems. Many compounds contain both N and S along with the typical organic elements (C, H, and O). The reaction for the combustion of such compounds, in general form, is \u00f0CaHbOcNdSe \u00fe 4a\u00fe b 2c\u00de &#1;&#3; &#1;&#3; bd /aCO2 \u00fe H2O \u00fe N2 \u00fe eS (22.5) 22 Reaction (22.5) demonstrates the incremental complexity as additional elements enter the reaction. In the real world, pure reactions are rare. The environment is flled with mixtures and heterogeneous reactions. Reactions can occur in sequence, parallel, or both. For example, a feedstock to a municipal incinerator contains myriad types of wastes, from garbage to household chemicals to commercial wastes, and even small FIGURE 22.6 Interactions between nitrogen and sulfur compounds, and among S and N compounds and other air pollutants. SVOC, semi-volatile organic compound; VOC, volatile organic compound; RO2, radical consisting of a chain of organic compounds with H substituted with O2 (e.g. propane, C3H8, reacts with OH to form the radical, C3H7O2); Hg, mercury.

The N-content of typical cow manure is about 5 kg (metric ton) 1 (about 0.5%).", "If the fuel used to burn the waste also contains S along with the organic matter, then the fve elements will react according to the stoichiometry of Reaction (22.5). Certainly, combustion specifcally and oxidation generally are very important processes that lead to N and S pollutants. But they are certainly not the only ones. As mentioned, oxidation and reduction of N and S occur in ecosystems as represented by trophic state and energy levels. The formation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitric oxide (NO) by acidifying molecular sulfur is a redox reaction: S\u00f0s\u00de D NOL \u00f0aq\u00de / SO2\u00f0g\u00de D NO\u00f0g\u00de (22.6 ) 3 The designations in parentheses give the physical phase of each reactant and product: \u201cs\u201d for solid; \u201caq\u201d for aqueous; and \u201cg\u201d for gas. The oxidation half-reactions for this reaction are the following: S / SO2 (22.7) L S D 2H2O / SO2 D 4HDD 4e (22.8) The reduction half-reactions for this reaction are as follows: NOL / NO (22.9) 3 IV.

Both forms include air pollutants. Hydrogen sulfde is oxidized to sulfur dioxide in a three-step process. Note that the hydroxyl radical initiates the transformation from hydrogen sulfde to sulfur dioxide: H2S \u00fe HO,/HS, \u00fe H2O (22.13) HS, \u00fe O2/HO, \u00fe SO, (22.14) SO, \u00fe O2/SO2 \u00fe O, (22.15) The atmospheric reactions of SO2 are very complex, and proceed through at least three different pathways to the sulfate ion (SO42 ). Sulfur dioxide can react with the hydroxyl radical to form the HSO3 radical, which then can react with another hydroxyl radical to form water and SO3 or H2SO4. Sulfur dioxide has suffcient aqueous solubility to dissolve in water droplets where it can react with oxygen gas to form SO42 . The third pathway to sulfate occurs when sulfur dioxide reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form sulfuric acid: HO,\u00fe SO2/HOSO, (22.16) 2 HOSO, 2 \u00fe HO,/H2SO4 (22.17) (22.18) SO2\u00f0aqueous\u00de D fOg\u00f0aqueous\u00de / H2SO4 SO2 D H2O2 / H2SO4 (22.19) With suffcient residence time in the atmosphere, S will be oxidized to the sulfate ion, usually forming sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Ammonia (NH3), the most common base in the atmosphere, reacts with H2SO4 to form ammonium bisulfate (NH4HSO4) and ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4). The compounds H2SO4,NH4HSO4, and (NH4)2SO4 all are hydroscopic substances, i.e. readily dissolved in water. Thus, they wash out of the atmosphere during precipitation events.15 Arguably, the most common reduced form of sulfur that is the highly toxic and important pollutant, hydrogen sulfde (H2S). Certain microbes, especially bacteria, reduce nitrogen and sulfur, using the N or S as energy sources through the acceptance of electrons. For example, sulfur-reducing bacteria can produce H2S by chemically changing oxidized forms of sulfur, especially sulfates (compounds containing the ion, SO4 ). To do so, the bacteria must have access to the sulfur, i.e. it must be in the water, which can be in surface or groundwater, or the water in soil and sediment. These sulfur-reducers are often anaerobes, i.e. bacteria that live in water where concentrations of molecular oxygen (O2) are defcient. The bacteria remove the O2 molecule from the sulfate leaving only the S, which in turn combines with hydrogen (H) to form gaseous H2S. In groundwater, sediment water, and soil water, H2S is formed from the anaerobic or nearly anaerobic decomposition of deposits of organic matter, e.g. plant residues. Thus, redox principles can be used to treat H2S contamination, i.e. the compound can be oxidized using a number of different oxidants (Table 22.1). Strong oxidizers, like molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, IV.

Sulfur is also an important component of PM (Table 22.2). For example, diesel PM is formed by a number of simultaneous physical processes during cooling and dilution of exhaust, i.e. nucleation, coagulation, condensation, and adsorption. The core of the particles is formed by nucleation and coagulation from primary spherical particles consisting of solid carbonaceous matter, known as elemental carbon (EC) and ash (metals and other elements). By coagulation, adsorption, and condensation, various organic and S compounds (e.g. sulfates) are added and combined with other condensed material (Figure 22.8).16 The small diameter of diesel PM (<0.5 mm) makes for very large surface areas. Less than 0.5 mm, these particles have a very large surface area per gram of mass, which allows them to adsorb large quantities of ash, organic compounds, and sulfate. The specifc surface area of the EC core is approximately 30e50m2g 1. The organic constituents originate from unburned fuel, engine lubrication oil, and small quantities of partial combustion and pyrolysis products. During combustion, S compounds in the fuel are oxidized to sulfur dioxide (SO2). From 1% to 4% of fuel S is oxidized to form H2SO4. Upon cooling, this sulfuric acid and water condense into an aerosol that is nonvolatile under ambient conditions.16 Thus, N and S compounds are ubiquitous in the atmosphere and the environment. They are constituents of both essential and detrimental compounds. As such, their complete biogeochemical cycles must be understood to explain the formation and fate of air pollutants. 22.4 OTHER NUTRIENT CYCLES Numerous other nutrients besides N and S also form compounds that are air pollutants or are otherwise important to air quality. Indeed, the cycling of other nonmetals is crucial to complete understanding of most air pollutants. In fact, P molecules are essential parts of energy transfer during photosynthesis. Phosphorous fertilizer manufacturing and the application of P-containing compounds in agriculture, on the other hand, are major sources of air and water pollution. When P compounds deposit onto surface waters, the increased P concentrations accelerate eutrophication and, along with increasing N concentrations, contribute to the so-called dead zones in large water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay. Actually, P and K are intricately woven into the N and S cycles. P is a component of atmospheric deposition, along with N and S compounds. The P component is IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 22. THE NITROGEN AND SULFUR CYCLES usually higher when the amount of wet deposition exceeds dry deposition, since P is usually bound to aerosols. Thus, in areas where large amounts of P are applied as a fertilizer to land or in arid regions with strong winds to transport soils, airborne P concentrations can be substantial, albeit still less than airborne N concentrations.1 Most of the total P in the atmosphere exists in mineral form as aerosols, but there are also large global sources of P from biomass burning, and a lesser amount from energy and industrial combustion 2 sources. Phosphate fertilizer production is an important source of fuoride compounds. The movement of fuoride through the atmosphere and into a food chain illustrates an airewater interaction at the local scale (<100 km).3 Other industrial sources of fuoride include aluminum processing and glass manufacturing plants. Domestic livestock in the vicinity of substantial fuoride sources are exposed to fuoride by ingestion of forage crops. Fluoride released into the air by industry is deposited and accumulated in vegetation. Its concentration has been found in some areas to be suffcient to cause damage to the teeth and bone structure of the animals that consume the crops. Potassium is also a part of the biogeochemistry of N and S. For example, when base cations like K deposited on soil and other surfaces, they increase the surface\u2019s pH.", "This alkalinity buffers the acidity generated by N and S acidic compounds (e.g. H2NO3 and H2SO4, respectively).

BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 23 Metal and Metalloid Cycles The atmosphere is an important compartment in the cycling of toxic metals and metalloids and their compounds. A number of metals have received much attention as air pollutants. For example, the list of 187 hazardous air pollutants (see Table 7.2) subject to US regulations under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act Amendments includes a number of metals and two metalloids: \u0081 Beryllium \u0081 Cadmium \u0081 Chromium \u0081 Cobalt \u0081 Lead \u0081 Manganese \u0081 Mercury \u0081 Nickel \u0081 Selenium \u0081 Antimony (metalloid) \u0081 Arsenic (metalloid) As discussed in Chapter 13, one of the key adverse outcomes of certain metals is damage to the central nervous systems (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), especially lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg). Other metals, such as manganese (Mn), have also been associated with chronic, neurological disorders. Metals and their inorganic and organometallic compounds are well known for major contamination events and exposures to large numbers of susceptible populations, such as small children. The chemical species of metals and metalloids vary considerably depending on their oxidation states and the elements with which they combine. For example, mercury\u2019s mobility in the environment and its toxicity to humans and animals is determined by its chemical form. Dimethylmercury is highly toxic, accumulates in the food chain, and has high affnity for organic tissues, but elemental (zero valence) mercury is much less toxic and is slower to bioaccumulate. With the exception of the noble gases, all elements exist in the environment in a number of oxidation or valence states. Unlike organic compounds, which can be treated by destruction (actually conversion to simpler compounds, and fnally to carbon dioxide and water), metals are not treated by destruction, but by changing valence, i.e. oxidation states. As mentioned for mercury, each form of any metal has its own toxicity and dictates its fate in the environment. Chromium, e.g. in its trivalent state (Cr\u00fe3) is an essential form of the metal. Although toxic at suffciently high concentrations, Cr\u00fe3 is less inherently hazardous than the hexavalent form Cr\u00fe6, which is highly toxic to aquatic fauna and is a suspected human carcinogen. Toxicity, persistence, and fate are also determined by the metal\u2019s equilibrium chemistry, especially the amount in ionic forms and the amount that forms salts with nonmetals. Atmospheric deposition is an important source of many metals, including cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc, but less important for other metals (e.g. iron, aluminum, and manganese).1 Dust is a major source of metal-laden particles that can be transferred to the atmosphere,as wellasto numerouscompartmentsin the biosphere and hydrosphere. The actual metal loads vary seasonally, depending on rainfall and prevailing winds, as well as spatially. For example, particulate matter transport to oceans is highest in waters downwind of deserts.2 Other metal sinks include melt from glaciers and icebergs, seasonal sea ice melting, island wakes, volcanism, and hydrothermal activity.3 Metal cycling is infuenced by other cycles. For example, acidifcation of the oceans and acid deposition onto terrestrial systems will change the rates and types of metal cycling. Metal cycling is intricately linked to organisms in the biosphere. The concentrations, transformation, and cycling are driven by thegrowthrates, biomasssequestration, species diversity, and trophic interactions of biota. Indeed, many metals are micronutrients, without which plants and microbes suffer defciencies. Above these levels, organisms suffer toxic effects. In forests, metals may become stable and immobile on the foor due to adsorption onto detritus. Ontheotherhand, organicacids in the vegetation (e.g. leaf leachate) and bacterial decomposition in soil organic matter (i.e. mineralization) may increase solubility and otherwise mobilize the metals.1 Fundamentals of Air Pollution 531 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00023-2 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Ref. 1. precipitation Dissolution Assimilation Release Assimilation weak complexes Metal mobility in the biosphere and bioavailability vary among genera of organisms and their affnities for the various metals.", "Generally, metals can be assimilated into environmental compartments by two processes (Figure 23.1). One mechanism depends on ionic species forming surface complexes with carrier proteins during active transport, allowing metal cations to be transported across cellular membranes. The second mechanism is nonionic. Metal species may be transported across biological membranes by concentration gradients, i.e. molecular or passive diffusion.1 A liganda is a functional group (either a molecule or ion) that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex. The bonding between the metal and ligand generally involves formal donation of one or more of the ligand\u2019s electron pairs. The metaleligand bonding can be covalent or ionic. Metals associate with a range of ligands to form the complexes shown in the center of Figure 23.1. These include metal aquo complexes, i.e. coordination compounds containing metal (Me) ions with water serving as the only ligand; general ] z\u00fe stoichiometry is [Me(H2O)n . The aquo complexes are the predominant metal species in aqueous solutions of many metal salts, e.g. metal nitrates, sulfates, and perchlorates. Metal complexes also include those with the OH functional group (i.e. hydroxo complexes), other inorganic ligands (e.g. Cl ,SO42 , and HCO3 ), and organic ligands.1 Trace metals can be mobilized and immobilized from the solid phase (i.e. following the behavior of sorption and desorption, as discussed in Chapter 18). The solid phase may include suspended particles, soil, and sediments. Solidesolution interactions of trace metals occur through adsorption/desorption reactions on organic and inorganic functional groups. They may also occur directly as precipitation/dissolution reactions. In the solid phase, metals associate with surface functional groups, hydroxide, carbonate, sulphide minerals (in amorphous or crystalline forms), or organic matter. Finally, biota may alter the cycling of trace metals through uptake by assimilation or surface interactions.1 The ocean is a vast sink for metals. For example, zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and copper (Cu) have residence times ranging from 3000 to 100,000 years, given mean deep ocean ventilation time of about 1000 years. Generally, metal concentrations increase with depth (Figure 23.2). Concentrations of most heavy metals exist at low concentrations in the ocean (ranging from 0.002 nanomolar (nM) for cadmium (Cd) and manganese (Mn) to 0.1 nM for iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn)). In the ocean, as well as other environmental compartments, metals can be taken up incidentally with essential metals. For example, Cd is a nutrient analog for Zn in surface waters.4 Surfcial metal concentrations often increase by orders of magnitude moving from open ocean water to coastal and estuarine a The term ligand has at least two different environmental and biomedical meanings. In addition to the one defned here, a ligand is also a molecule that travels through the bloodstream, serving as a chemical messenger that will bind to a target cell\u2019s receptor (see Chapter 12). IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 23. METAL AND METALLOID CYCLES 66.1 W, July 1979). Manganese concentrations in the Pacifc were analyzed in acidifed, unfltered seawater samples. Ref. 1; and Sunda WG. Feedback interactions between trace metals and phytoplankton in the ocean.

Most iron in freshwater streams exists as colloidal suspensions (0.02e0.4 mm diameter). These colloids degrade rapidly when they contact high salinity, which induces coagulation and settling. Reported gradient concentrations for cobalt (Co) in the coastal waters of Baja California ranged from 0.93 to as much as 3.6 nM.7 That is about 4 times more concentrated at the coast, near the source than in more oceanic waters. In other parts of the world, a similar pattern has been identifed. Therefore, the freshwateresaltwater boundary effectively serves to precipitate many metals to the sediment.8 On the other hand, anoxic and reduced environments, such as in high-organic content sediments, may remobilize a portion of the metals that have settled, via reduction of particulate metals to more soluble species.9 Chemical and physical processes work together to link metals found in sedimentary materials to the atmosphere and other environmental compartments. Weathering breaks down the rocks into smaller materials such as clays and silts.", "With the increase in the surface area as the particle size decreases, the materials becoming capable of trapping larger loads of charged molecules and ions, as well as incorporating lipophilic organic molecules. Due to their characteristic hydrophobicity and their tendency to be excluded from the water phase (i.e. decreased polarity), these organic molecules sorb to these particles as well. Thus, the receiving areas will often contain larger quantities of fne sediments, and with attendant, higher metal concentrations, and higher organic content.10 Another important factor in the metal cycle is temperature. Increasing concentrations of metals will occur in water with increasing temperatures. Temperature change also alters biomass and metal exchanges with organisms. Increasing temperature decreases dissolved molecular oxygen (DO) concentrations, which in turn leads to a reduced environment where the metals and compounds will form sulfdes and other compounds that can be toxic to the fsh and other higher order aquatic organisms, but advantageous to anaerobes, including metal-reducing bacteria. Thus, the change in temperature, the resulting decrease in DO and increasing metal concentrations, and the synergistic impact of the combining the hypoxic water and reduced metal compounds is a cascade of harm to the stream\u2019s ecosystems. Combined abiotic and biotic processes are affected by and affect metal geochemical cycling. Notably, the growth and metabolism of the bacteria results in even more rapidly decreasing DO levels. Algae both consume DO for metabolism and produce DO by photosynthesis. The increase in temperature concomitantly increases the aqueous solubility of metals, and the decrease in DO is accompanied by redox changes, e.g. formation of reduced metal species, such as metal sulfdes. This is also being mediated by the bacteria, some of which will begin to reduce the metals as the molecular oxygen levels decline, leading to overall reduced conditions in the water and sediment. The opposite process occurs with increasing oxidation. In the more oxidized regions, the metals form metal oxides. The increase in the metal compounds combines with the changing concentrations of DO, and with the increased temperatures to act synergistically to change the metal cycles toward a more aerobic system.11 The biotaemetal cycling relationship is not entirely linear and continuous in space and time. For example, the initiating abiotic effect discussed above, i.e. increased temperature, results in an increased microbial population. As mentioned, the growth and metabolism of the bacteria decrease DO levels, but the IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 23. METAL AND METALLOID CYCLES growth of the algae both consume DO for metabolism and produce DO by photosynthesis. Meanwhile a combined abiotic and biotic response occurs with the metals. At higher temperatures, the aqueous solubility of metals increases. As mentioned, the decrease in DO concentrations is accompanied by redox changes, e.g. formation of reduced metal species, such as metal sulfdes; but in the environment this is also being mediated by the bacteria, some of which will begin reducing the metals as the oxygen levels drop (reduced conditions in the water and sediment). However, the opposite is true in the more oxidized regions, i.e. the metals are forming oxides. The net increase or decrease in the metal concentrations, the speciation of metal compounds, and the changes in redox, combined with the increased temperatures may or may not act synergistically to make the conditions toxic for higher animals, e.g. a fsh kill.12 The extent and severity of metal-induced or metal-mediated ecosystem damage depends on species diversity, e.g. the balance of algae and bacteria, as well as on the types of metallic compounds formed and any catalysts that may increase metal chemistry. Of course, metals are not the only, nor usually the most prominent cause of fsh kills and otherecosystemeffects. Indeed,theyareusually merely contributing causes unless the metal concentrations are extremely high. Conversely, some damage can be mediated by increasing the concentrations of certainmetals. Giventhatanumberofmetalsaremicronutrients, if metal concentrations are decreased or the chemical forms are completely not bioavailable, this could be a contributing factor in ecosystem damage (i.e. a metal-defcient species could adversely affect predatoreprey, biomass production, etc.). Human activities change the geochemistry of metals. After extraction, the processes used to refne and manufacture products from the ores exposes human populations and ecosystems to metal concentrations well above natural norms. In addition, metal compounds end up in products or otherwise come into contact with people and the environment. Extraction of metals isan example of how humans have changed the biogeochemical cycling throughout the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere.", "Human activities can greatly accelerate the mobilization of metals, severalfold over natural releases from weathering and natural fuxes, i.e. degassing from the earth\u2019s crust and mantle, which is the sum of volcanic emissions to the atmosphere and net hydrothermal fux to the sea (Table 23.1).13 For both metals and nonmetals, the activities by humans greatly increase the amount of potentially toxic substances released to the environment. For example, the human-to-natural weathering ratio for copper (Cu) is 14.2, meaning that all of the weathering processes around the globe account for 14 times less than the extraction and processing of Cu by humans. Put another way, mercury\u2019s (Hg) ratio of 3.3 means that without human extractions and manufacturing, only one-third of the Hg would be released into the environment. Thus, since the total Hg loading to the environment drives the amount of toxic forms (e.g. methylmercury) reaching and accumulating in the food chain, this means that human activities are substantially increasing the amount of toxic Hg in the food being ingested and air being inhaled by humans. Considering that weathering takes place over most of the earth\u2019s surface, including land and water, this indicates the extent of anthropogenic activities in mobilizing TABLE 23.1 Estimates of the Global Flux in the Biogeochemical Cycles of Certain Elements (1012 g per year) Biospheric Human-to- Juvenile Chemical Natural Recycling Ratio Human Natural Ratio Element Flux1 (1) Weathering (2) Cycle2 (3) 3/(1 D 2) Mobilization3 (4) 4/(1 D 2) Boron 0.02 0.19 8.8 42 0.58 2.8 Carbon 30 210 107,000 446 8700 36.3 Nitrogen 5 20 9200 368 221 8.8 Phosphorous w0 2 1000 500 25 12.5 Sulfur 10 70 450 5.6 130 1.6 Chlorine 2 260 120 0.46 170 0.65 Calcium 120 500 2300 3.7 65 0.10 Iron 6 1.5 40 5.3 1.1 0.14 Copper 0.05 0.056 2.5 23.6 1.5 14.2 Mercury 0.0005 0.0002 0.003 4.3 0.0023 3.3 1Emission from the earth\u2019s crust and mantle; i.e. sum of volcanic emissions to the atmosphere and net hydrothermal fux to the sea. 2Annual biogeochemical cycle to/from the earth\u2019s biota on land and in the oceans, in the absence of humans. 3Direct and indirect mobilization by extraction and mining from the earth\u2019s crust or (for N) industrial fxation.

As such, the composition of the atmosphere has been changing substantially and relatively rapidly in recent centuries and decades compared to the previous millennia. 23.1 HEAVY METAL CYCLING So-called \u201cheavy metals\u201d dominate the list of \u201ctoxic metals\u201d. The designation of \u201cheavy\u201d is any metal with the atomic mass greater than or equal to that of iron. These include the transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides.14 This chapter addresses the metals often associated with air pollution and environmental damage, as well the most notorious metalloid, arsenic. Most toxic metals exist naturally in very small concentrations but for some, the toxic levels can be just above the background concentration. In many cases small amounts are essential. The doseeresponse curve for these metals would be U-shaped, with defciencies at low doses, toxicity at high doses, and an optimal dose range between defciency and toxicity (see Chapter 7). Many texts refer to this group of metals and metalloids as trace metals. However, \u201ctrace\u201d is not so much a descriptive term as an adjective for low concentrations. In most parts of the world, metal toxicity is a relatively uncommon medical condition. Poisonings, e.g. lead and arsenic poisoning, are often meant to be acute effects, including death, at high doses. Such doses are unusual in general air pollution scenarios, except in and near specialized industrial environments. Generally, atmospheric concentrations are much lower than those that induce acute effects, so the principal air pollution concern about metals is longer-term, low concentration exposures. Following are brief discussions of mercury, cadmium, and lead. These metals are discussed throughout this book, but are highlighted here given their importance to air pollution. 23.1.1 Mercury The metal mercury (Hg) has been of interest to scientists and the general public of late. For example, there has been much concern as to whether a preservative used in vaccines might be part of the cause for the apparent increase in autism in recent decades. The metal has also been central to the debate about the safety of seafood and tradeoffs of hazards to unborn and nursing babies and the benefts of breast feeding.", "Actually, mercury is a natural component of the earth, with an average abundance of approximately 0.05 mg kg 1 in the earth\u2019s crust, with signifcant local variations. It is an unusual metal in that it is a liquid at room temperature (it melts at 38.9 C and boils at 303 C) and is heavy, with a density of 13.5 g cm 3 at 25 C. Studies have indicated that Hg can be a toxic substance and that one of its compounds, methylmercury chloride is a highly toxic substance. Mercury persists in the environment, but is also readily transformed. When reduced and alkylated, Hg becomes more toxic, e.g. methylmercury biomagnifes up the food chain, and reaches a wide variety of species and ecosystems. Thus both human and ecosystems may be exposed to excessive levels of mercury in the environment.15 Not only is the exposure to total Hg problematic, the conditions of many systems make for the most toxic forms of Hg, e.g. reduced and low oxygen environments and metabolic processes within organisms. Mercury ores that are mined generally contain about 1% mercury but at the Almaden mine in Spain, they are mining an ore which contains about 12% mercury. Although about 25 mercury minerals are known, virtually the only deposits that are being mined contain cinnabar (HgS), a bright red substance which is also used to produce the color vermillion. Despite a decline in global mercury consumption, competing sources of mercury and low prices, the mining of mercury continues in a number of countries. Spain, China, Kyrgyzstan, and Algeria have dominated this activity in recent years. The last US mine was closed in 1982. There are reports of small mines in China, Russia (Siberia), Outer Mongolia, Peru, and Mexico. In the early 1980s, the annual production from mining HgS was 7000 tons, today it is less than half of that and is about 2000 tons.16 Mercury is also obtained: as a by-product of mining or refning of other metals (such as zinc, gold, and silver) or minerals and even from natural gas; from recycling spent products; and reprocessing mine tailings containing Hg. In the United States, this recovery of mercury as a by-product of other metal mining (primarily gold) from recycling and from the decommissioning of chloralkali plants amounts to about 250 tons per year. 16 Concentrations of total mercury in the atmosphere of the northern hemisphere have recently been estimated at 2 ng m 3, whereas those in the southern hemisphere being half this value. Values in urban areas are usually higher (e.g. 10 ng m 3). Mercury has an appreciable vapor pressure (2 10 3 mm Hg or 0.3 Pa at 25 C) which is the reason for it being in the atmosphere.17,18 It has been estimated that each year 2000e3000 tons19 enter the atmosphere from natural and anthropogenic sources. Natural sources, such as volcanoes, are responsible for approximately half of atmospheric mercury emissions. The anthropogenic half can be divided into the following estimated percentages which excludes biomass burning, an important source in some regions.20,21 (See Discussion Box: Metal Contamination Cases in Japan). IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 23. METAL AND METALLOID CYCLES METAL CONTAMINATION CASES IN JAPAN Minamata, a small factory town on Japan\u2019s Shiranui Sea, was the site of chronic Hg exposure. Minamata is \u201cnitrogen\u201d in Japanese, owing to the town\u2019s production of commercial fertilizer by the Chisso Corporation for decades, beginning in 1907.22 Beginning in 1932, the company produced pharmaceutical products, perfumes, and plastics and processed petrochemicals. Chisso became highly proftable, notably because it became the only Japanese source of a high-demand primary chemical, dioctyl phthalate, a plasticizing agent. These processes needed the reactive organic compound, acetaldehyde, which is produced using mercury. The residents of Minamata played a huge price for this industrial heritage. Records indicate that from 1932 to 1968, the company released approximately 27 tons of mercury compounds into the adjacent Minamata Bay. This directly affected the dietary intake of the toxic mercury of fsherman, farmers and their families in Kumamoto, a small village about 900 km from Tokyo. The consumed fsh contained extremely elevated concentrations of a number of mercury compounds, including the highly toxic methylated forms (i.e. monomethylmercury and dimethylmercury), leading to classic symptoms of methyl mercury poisoning. In fact, the symptoms were so pronounced the syndrome of these effects came to be known as the \u201cMinamata Disease\u201d.", "In mid-1950s, residents began to report what they called the \u201cstrange disease\u201d, including the classic form of mercury toxicity, i.e. disorders of the PNS and CNS, respectively. Diagnoses included numbness in lips and limbs, slurred speech, and constrict vision. The physician from the Chisso Corporation Hospital, reported in 1956 that \u201can unclarifed disease of the central nervous system has broken out\u201d. The physician correctly associated the fsh dietary exposure to the health effects. Soon after this initial public health declaration, government investigators linked the dietary exposures to the bay water. The company continued the chemical production, but within 2 years, moved their chemical releases upstream from Minamata Bay to the Minamata River. The Hg pollution became more widespread, leading to a partial ban by the Kumamoto Prefecture government responded allowing fsherman to catch, but not to sell, fsh from Minamata Bay. However, the ban did not reduce the local people\u2019s primary exposure since they depended on the bay\u2019s fsh for sustenance. The ban did acquit the government from further liability. In 1959, Kumamoto University researchers determined that the organic forms of mercury were the cause of the \u201cMinamata Disease\u201d.a In 1968, the Chisso Corporation stopped releasing mercury compounds into the Minamata River and Bay since the mercury production method had become antiquated. About 4000 people have either been offcially recognized as having \u201cMinamata Disease\u201d or are in the queue for verifcation from the board of physicians in Kumamoto Prefecture. Fish consumption from the bay has never stopped, but Hg concentrations in fsh appear to have decreased. Elsewhere, the mines of central Japan located near the Toyama Prefecture have been removing metals from the surrounding mountains as early as 710. Gold was the frst metal to be mined from the area, followed by silver in 1589, and shortly thereafter, lead, copper, and zinc. At the start of the twentieth century, the Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co., Ltd controlled the production of these mines. As a result of the Russo-Japanese War, World War I, and World War II, a surge in the demand for metals in the use of weapons caused mass increases in the mines\u2019 production aided with the advent of new European technologies in mining.23 Along with the huge increase in mining production, came a signifcant increase in pollution produced from the mines. Liquid and solid wastes were dumped into the surrounding waters, including the Jinzu River which fows into the Sea of Japan, and the fve major tributaries that fow into the Jinzu River. The Jinzu River water system supplies the water to the surrounding city of Toyama, 30 km downstream from the main mining operations. This water was primarily used by the surrounding areas in irrigation for the rice paddies. In addition, the water provided a source of water used for drinking, washing, and fshing. In addition, large amounts of cadmium were released into the Jinzu River Basin from 1910 until 1945. Cadmium was extracted from the earth\u2019s crust during the production of other metals like zinc, lead, and copper that were being mined near the Toyama area. Cadmium is a naturally occurring element that does not corrode easily, enters the air during mining, can travel long distances, and then falls into the ground or water only to be taken up by fsh, plants, animals, or humans from the environment.24 The cadmium from the mines deposited in the river and land of the Jinzu River Basin were absorbed by surrounding plants and animals causing fsh to die and the rice to grow poorly. Furthermore, humans living in the area consumed the poisoned water and rice. As a result of the ingestion of cadmium, a new disease specifc to the Toyama Prefecture appeared in 1912. Initially, the disease was not well understood and was suspected to be either a regional or bacterial disease or the result of lead poisoning. However, in 1955, Ogino and his colleagues suspected cadmium as the cause of the disease and named the disease Itai Itai. In 1961, the Kamioka IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 23.1 HEAVY METAL CYCLING METAL CONTAMINATION CASES IN JAPAN (cont\u2019d) Mining Station of Mitsui Mining and Smelting company was linked as the direct source of the cadmium poisoning, and the Toyama Prefecture, 30 km downstream, was designated the worst cadmium contaminated area (Figure 23.3). The concentrations of cadmium in this prefecture were orders of magnitude higher than that found in background levels and were well above even other industrialized locations (Table 23.2).", "Cadmium exposure results in two major health-related problems of Itai Itai disease, irreversible kidney damage and bone disease (Itai Itai is Japanese for \u201cOuch Ouch\u201d). After exposure to high levels of cadmium, the kidneys have decreased ability to remove acids from the blood due to proximal tubular dysfunction resulting in hypophosphatemia (low phosphate blood levels); gout (arthritic disease); hyperuricemia (elevated uric acid levels in the blood); hyperchloremia (elevated chloride blood levels); and kidney atrophy (as much as 30%). Following kidney dysfunction, victims of the disease develop osteomalacia (soft bones), loss of bone mass, and osteoporosis leading to severe joint and back pains and increase risk of fractures. a This is an all too common professional ethics problem, i.e. lack of full disclosure. It is often, in retrospect, a very costly decision to withhold information about a product, even if the consequences of releasing the information would adversely affect the \u201cbottom line\u201d. Ultimately, as has been seen in numerous environmental and other damage cases, the costs of not disclosing are severe, such as bankruptcy and massive class action lawsuits, let alone the fact that a company\u2019s decision may have led to the death and disease of the very people they claim to be serving, i.e. their customers and workers. Kanazawa Medicine, 1998. The concerns about Hg now largely include the atmosphere. As mentioned in Chapters 13 and 14, Hg in stack emissions from coal-fred power plants is the major source of Hg deposition in North America. Thus, atmospheric transport and deposition of Hg contributes to the buildup of Hg in the food chain. As a result, airborne Hg is a substantial source of Hg exposure, not only by inhalation but also by ingestion. The cycling of all chemical species of Hg is shown in Figure 23.4. The exchanges with the atmosphere occur between both land and surface waters. Indeed, most of the exchanges occur between water and air, with sediments as a large global Hg sink. The natural sources include volcanoes and biogenic (especially fora) emissions. The mercury cycle depicted in Figure 14.8 and discussed in Chapter 14 includes numerous compartments and cycling at various scales. The chemical speciation of Hg is quite complex, consisting of numerous chemical and physical forms with very different properties. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 23.

However, airborne Hg mercury takes three fundamental physicochemical forms: 1. Elemental or zero-valence mercury (Hg0), which is the uncombined chemical element. 2. Divalent mercury (Hg2\u00fe), which is chemically reactive and under most environmental conditions is found to be combined with other substances into mercury salts (e.g. HgCl2). 3. Particulate-phase mercury [Hg(p)], most of which is actually the chemical species Hg(II) but is only slightly reactive because it is mixed with solid-phase material in the atmosphere. These three forms of Hg vary in their affnities for tissue, their persistence, and their bioavailability. Mercury compounds may remain in the atmosphere for extended periods depending on the oxidation state. For example, Hg0 has an atmospheric residence time of about 1 year, but Hg2\u00fe for just a few weeks.25 This is in part because the Hg0 is oxidized to Hg2\u00fe, which is the major chemical species in both wet and dry Hg deposition to the earth\u2019s surface.26 Extraction activities, not just of Hg but also of other ores and by combustion of fossil fuels (especially coal), adds Hg to the atmosphere. During biogeochemical cycling, Hg is readily interconverted among Hg0, Hg2\u00fe, and Hg(p).", "When the Hg is deposited, especially in detritus in forest and other ecosystems, it is reduced. The Hg0 is then reemitted in the vapor phase.27 The remaining nonvolatilized Hg fraction accumulates in soil organic matter28 or binds to organic compounds suspended in surface waters.29 In oceans, part of the Hg2\u00fe that is deposited onto the surface is reduced photochemically to Hg0. This Hg0 fraction is then reemitted to the atmosphere advectively by winds and by partitioning as a dissolved gas to the atmosphere30 (see discussion of Henry\u2019s Law and airewater equilibrium constants in Chapter 18). Mercury accumulates with increasing latitude. In polar regions, oxidation to Hg2\u00fe is likely mediated by bromine (Br) in the atmosphere.13 The transformation chemistry of Hg, therefore, determines not only how Hg will speciate in the atmosphere and other parts of the environment, but also the likely exposure scenarios that will result. The food chain characteristics of Hg are very important. IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 23.1 HEAVY METAL CYCLING For example, Hg increases in bioavailability when it resides in sediment, i.e. decreased dissolved O2 allows for reduction and methylation of other forms of Hg. Thus, the form of Hg in atmospheric deposition is likely to be changed as it moves among compartments and as it is taken up and metabolized by organisms. For example, sulfate-reducing bacteria convert oxidized forms of Hg to methylmercury (CH3Hg), which is much more bioavailable and toxic than the oxidized precursors. Indeed, the same amount of atmospheric deposition onto a surface water body may yield dramatically different tissue concentrations in fsh than in another water body nearby if the two systems have varying depths of organic sediment. The system with deeper organic sediments is likely to have fsh with higher CH3Hg concentrations due to the bacterial sulfate reduction. There also appears to be a direct relationship between acid deposition and methylation of Hg if the acid is H2SO4.13 23.1.2 Cadmium Cadmium (Cd) occurs in the earth\u2019s crust at a concentration of 0.1e0.5 ppm and is commonly associated with other metal ores (e.g. zinc, lead, and copper). Ocean water Cd concentrations range between <5 and 110 ng l 1, with higher levels reported near coastal areas and in marine phosphates and phosphorites. Surface waters and groundwater generally contain <1 mgl 1 Cd. Soil Cd concentrations are dependent on several factors, e.g. the specifc Cd compound\u2019s mobility, natural geochemistry, and Cd loading from agricultural chemicals and atmospheric deposition. Volcanoes, forest fres, sea salt aerosols, and other natural phenomena also load Cd into the atmosphere.31 In recent years, cadmium (Cd) is most prominent as an element in nickelecadmium (NiCd) batteries, but Cd has been used extensively in metal plating and other industries (see Discussion Box: Metal Contamination Cases in Japan). Exposure to Cd has been associated with kidney damage (proteinuria) and respiratory effects, e.g. reduction in forced vital capacity and reduction in peak expiratory fow rate.32 The molecular weight of Cd is 112.41 g mol 1. Other physicochemical properties are density \u00bc 8.642g cm 3 at 20 C; boiling point \u00bc 765 C; melting point \u00bc 320.9 C; and vapor pressure \u00bc 0.13 kPa at 394 C. Thus, under most environmental conditions, Cd0 is nonvolatile and would likely need to be sorbed to aerosols to reach the atmosphere. However, Cd exists in various chemical species. Two chemicals that are particularly toxic are cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and cadmium oxide (CdO). The aqueous solubility of CdCl2 is rather high (about 100 mg ml 1 at 20 C). Its vapor pressure is higher than Cd0, although it is nonvolatile under environmental conditions (0 kPa at 20 C). The aqueous solubility of CdO is low (<1mgml 1). CdO is nonvolatile under environmental conditions (0 kPa at 20 C). Cadmium carbonate (CdCO3) is also insoluble in water. Cadmium sulfate (CdSO4) and cadmium sulfde (CdS) are soluble in water (e.g. CdS aqueous solubility \u00bc 1.3mgl 1at18 C). Given the low solubilities and vapor pressures of most Cd compounds, dissolution and volatilization must be assisted by other mechanisms to mobilize Cd. For example, when Cd is ground to powder it burns and vaporizes. Thus, a major mechanism for entry into the atmosphere is combustion. Concentrations of Cd in fossil fuels, e.g. coal and crude oil, and incineration of municipal wastes (e.g. batteries in the waste stream) are the largest sources of airborne Cd. The oxidation state of Cd is most often \u00fe2, but also occurs as \u00fe1. The \u00fe1 state is reached in a manner similar to that of Hg.", "That is, Cd must frst exist as a divalent cation, before conversion to Cd\u00fe. For example, dissolving elemental Cd in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminum chloride (wherein Al has a \u00fe3 oxidation state) yields a compound wherein Cd has \u00fe1 oxidation state: Cd \u00fe CdCl2 \u00fe 2AlCl3/2AlCl3 \u00fe Cd2\u00f0AlCl4\u00de2 (23.1) This reaction is unlikely to occur often in nature, so the \u00fe1 oxidation state is more likely to be found in industrial and laboratory settings. 23.1.3 Lead The US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) in 1999 ranked lead (Pb) second in the list of prioritized hazardous substances. The noxious effects of lead have been known for a long timedwe are aware of the Romans inadvertently poisoning themselves by drinking and eating out of lead vessels. The World Health Organization has guidelines for lead in the air and in water of 0.5 mgm 3 and 0.1 mg l 1, respectively. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US state that a blood level of 11 1 10 mgdl (100 mgl or 0.48 mmol l ) in children is a cause for concern. Lead poisoning occurs through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact, with inhalation perhaps, the most common exposure route. Factory workers dealing with lead and lead products and people living near such factories are the most likely to be affected. In countries where lead tetraethyl is still added to gasoline, the general public is exposed to signifcant lead levels through vehicles exhausts, and even lead containing dust in the air.33 The toxicity of Pb is discussed in Chapter 13. Generally, exposures to lead can result in anemia; IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 23. METAL AND METALLOID CYCLES nervous system dysfunction; impaired cognitive, motor, and language skills; learning diffculties; nervousness and emotional instability; insomnia; nausea; lethargy; weakness, hypertension, kidney problems, decreased fertility, and increased level of miscarriages, and low birth weight and premature deliveries. Children are at particular risk to Pb toxicity, including neurological impairment, growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, and impaired vitamin D metabolism. Children are very much more susceptible to damage from lead than adults, and neurological impairment can occur in children with blood lead levels <10 mgdl 1.34 The biogeochemical cycling of Pb appears to be similar to that of other divalent metals. As evidence, uptake by plant life increases with increasing concentrations in soil and water. For example, studies have shown the most infuential factor in biotic Pb concentrations (also Zn, Cu, and Ni) is the distance from the ocean shore. For example, in arctic willow growing a few meters from the tide line, the Pb content was higher than that of the same plant species growing about 1 km from the coast line and sheltered from the sea. 35 A major transport mechanism for Pb is by aerosols. In continental climates with dry and hot summer and severe winter, strong winds can transport particulates fort short and long distance, depending on the consistency of wind speed and inversely proportional to aerosol size. The sources are often anthropogenic. For example, the atmospheric transport of soil particles with sorbed organic compounds, heavy metals, and metalloids (e.g.Ni, Cd,Co, Zn, Pb, As)haveorigins from both industrial emissions into the atmosphere and waste landfll sites.35 Lead and other metals vary by ecosystem type, depending on deposition rates, uptake by organisms and sequestration within abiotic and biotic sinks. For example, averaged Pb fuxes in biological cycling of boreal and subboreal forest ecosystems vary considerably among types. The fux in subboreal northern taiga coniferous forests had a turnover fux of 1.9 g Pb per hectare per year (g Pb ha 1 per year); subboreal coniferous and small-leaved forests had 4.2 g Pb ha 1 per year; subboreal broad-leaved forests had 7.9 Pb ha 1 per year; and sphagnum forest swamps had 12.0 Pb ha 1 per year. 35 23.2 METALLOID CYCLING Arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) are the two metalloids of principal concern in air pollution. Both As and Sb belong to Group 15 of the period table. 23.2.1 Arsenic Arsenic has been known for centuries and its compounds have been used in all sorts of preparations, including cosmetics; paints; artist\u2019s colors and dyes; alloys of lead, copper, and brass; pesticides; wood preservatives; tonics; glass production (it removes the green tint from the iron impurities); and even medicines. There is a theory that the once-popular arsenic-based wallpaper pigment, Paris green [copper (II) acetoarsenite], was the cause of Napoleon\u2019s mysterious death in 1821.", "In the late nineteenth century, arsenic compounds were linked to the deaths of more than 1000 children through inhaling arsenic vapors from moldy green wallpaperdprobably the Paris green type. About the same time, arsenic-based medications for syphilis, asthma, and psoriasis were considered the cause of skin cancer. Paris green [copper (II) acetoarsenite] is a highly toxic emerald-green crystalline powder that has been used as a rodenticide and insecticide, and also as a pigment, despite its toxicity. It is also used as a blue colorant in freworks. The color is apparently vivid, blue green when very fnely ground, and a deeper true green when coarsely ground.36e38 Today, in the US, the main use of arsenic is wood preservatives for outdoor and industrial environments. The use of arsenic compounds have dropped dramatically over the past 10 years. In 2001, the US imported 25,000 tons of arsenic compounds but in 2009 only 3600 tons was imported.39 Almost 90% of the imports are being used in chromated copper arsenate (CCA) wood preservative for \u201cpressure-treated\u201d decking, landscaping, walkways, and industrial usage. The rest is used in semiconductors, specialized metal, a few remaining pesticides and treatments for acute leukemia and other cancers. Arsenic ores (arsenic sulfdes, orpiment, and realgar) have been mined and used since ancient times. It is very probable that its toxic nature has been known for a verylongtime.40 Arsenic and many As compounds are very toxic to humans. Arsenic disrupts the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) reactions in the body and is very toxic to all animal life. Arsenic and its compounds, notably As3\u00fe, have in the past been used in the production of pesticides (e.g. in treated wood products), herbicides, and insecticides. In 1980, the US National Toxicology Program listed inorganic arsenic compounds as known human carcinogen. Subsequently, in 1981, inorganic arsenic-based pesticides were banned, and by 1985 the US had stopped producing arsenic. The applications of arsenic have declined considerably since that time but in many parts of the world arsenic compounds are used in wood preservatives for industrial applications. Developed IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 23.2 METALLOID CYCLING nations and the US continue to import As for this and other specialized purposes. The main route for human poisoning by arsenic is from drinking groundwater that contained high concentrations of arsenic. This has been the cause of a number of tragic disasters around the world (see later). A 2007 study found that over 137 million people in more than 70 countries are probably affected by arsenic poisoning of drinking water.41 Arsenic is toxic to aquatic life, birds, and land animals and in soils, where arsenic content is high, plant growth and crop yields may be poor. Aquatic life is particularly sensitive to arsenic compounds and moderately toxic to birds and land animals. Arsenic is very persistent in the environment and is expected to bioaccumulate in fsh and shellfsh. In spite of this, there are some microorganisms that have evolved to tolerate relatively high concentrationsofAsand some even thrive on it,using As for an energy source. The energy generation is based on the redox chemistry of arsenic. Arsenic has four main oxidation states: e3, 0, \u00fe3, and \u00fe5withthe predominant inorganic forms being arsenates (\u00fe5) and arsenites (\u00fe3). Under aerobic conditions, some microorganisms obtain energy by the oxidation of As3\u00fe to As5\u00fe, with the resultant electrons being transferred to electron acceptors such as nitrate ions or oxygen and the ATP pump. Under anaerobic conditions, energy for growth is obtained by the microbial reduction of As5\u00fe to As3\u00fe coupled to the oxidation of organic matter or inorganic electron donors such as hydrogen or sulphide ions. These microbial processes together with inorganic and physical processes make up the global arsenic cycle.42,43 Because arsenic is in the same column of the periodic table as is phosphorus, its compounds resemble those of phosphorus. The trivalent form is the most common; and is the basis for the arsenates and most organoarsenic compounds. Both As2S3 (orpiment) and As4S4 (realgar) are composed of trivalent arsenic. The As4S4 species is made possible by AseAs bonds in the molecule. An advocacy nongovernmental organization in 2001 in the US, wanting to ban arsenic in all consumer products, found that pressure treated wood leached more than 1 mg of arsenic onto a moistened hand wipe the size of a 4-year-old\u2019s hand. This is 100 times the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s 10 mgl 1 \u201callowable daily exposure level\u201d for drinking water, assuming the child has a liter a day.", "Likely due in part to these fndings, the wood processing industry agreed to stop using arsenic-based wood preservatives for household use as of December 2003. However, organic arsenic herbicides (not as toxic as their inorganic compounds) are still in use on cotton and turf, including golf courses, lawns, school yards, athletic felds, and rights-of-way. In Europe, the Directive 2003/2/EC44 restricts the marketing and use of arsenic, including CCA wood treatment. Treated CCA wood is not permitted to be used in residential or domestic constructions but is permitted for use in various industrial and public works, such as bridges, highway safety fencing, electric power transmission, and telecommunications poles. This directive is not unlike the ruling in the US. In many other parts of the world, the same type of ruling exists: in Australia, the use of CCA preservative for treatment of timber was restricted to certain applications from March 2006 and CCA may no longer be used to treat wood used in \u201cintimate human contact\u201d applications and that includes children\u2019s play equipment, furniture, residential decking, and hand railing. Use for low contact residential, commercial, and industrial applications remains unrestricted, as does its use in all other situations. Similarly to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, the Australian authorities did not recommend dismantling or the removal of existing CCA treated wood structures. In many parts of the world (parts of SE Asia, Chile, Argentine, parts of Western USA, Taiwan, Thailand, Mainland China, Bangladesh, and West Bengal), the arsenic concentration in groundwater is high enough to cause serious arsenic poisoning to people drinking the water. However, nowhere in the world is the problem greater than in the Ganges delta (Bangladesh and to a lesser extent West Bengal).45,46 Bangladesh, in the 1970s, had one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. This was largely due to ineffective water purifcation and sewage systems. Most drinking water used to be collected from open dug wells and ponds with little or no arsenic, but contaminated with water transmitting diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis. At that time, the UNICEF and the World Bank aided workers worked out a solution; they decided to drill tube wells (boreholes) deep underground to tap into the groundwater.47 As a result, 8 million tube wells were constructed to provide \u201csafe\u201d drinking water and in a short time, the infant mortality and diarrheal illness were reduced by 50%. Most of the wells were augured to depths between 20 and 100 m. Unfortunately one in fve of these wells was contaminated with arsenic which was above the government\u2019s drinking water standard set at 0.05 mg l 1; this being fve times the World Health Organization\u2019s acceptable maximum concentrations of arsenic in safe drinking water which was 0.01 mg l 1. The crisis came to the attention of international organizations in 1995 and the resultant study involved the analysis of thousandsofwater samplesaswellas hair, nail, and urine samples.48e50 Indeed, 61 out of 64 provinces in Bangladesh (900 villages) and in West IV. BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 23. METAL AND METALLOID CYCLES Bengal 17 provinces, were found with arsenic water levels above the government limit. Results showed that many of the wells which had been dug more than 20 m and less than 100 m were contaminated, whereas groundwater and well water from depths greater than 100 m were free of arsenic. The explanation was that groundwater closer to the surface had spent a shorter time in the ground, therefore had not dissolved signifcant amounts of arsenic from the soil, and furthermore, the water from the wells deeper than 100 m was exposed to older sediments which have already been depleted of arsenic.51 The total number of people using arsenic-rich water (levels >0.1 mg l 1) was 1.4 million in West Bengal and a staggering 46e57 million in Bangladesh.52,53 The biogeochemistry of As is similar to that of the heavy metals. Microbes play a key role in As cycling and toxicity. Anaerobic bacteria can reduce As5\u00fe during cometabolism.b When an As undergoes cometabolism, the reactions are catalyzed by an enzyme that is fortuitously produced by the organisms for other purposes. The microbe does not directly beneft from the degradation of the compound. The biotransformation of the As compound could actually be harmful or can inhibit growth and metabolism a microbe. In addition, aerobic microorganisms can oxidize As3\u00fe. Thus, both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms can cycle and transform As in the environment.", "Microbes degrade soil-borne contaminants, but these microbial mechanisms are enhanced by the biochemodynamics of the root zone (the rhizosphere see Figure 17.10 in Chapter 17). This process is slower usually than phytodegradation. This process can enhance As cometabolism because plant roots release natural substances, e.g. sugars, alcohols, and acid, that are food for soil microorganisms. The fxation and release of nutrients are also a natural type of bio-stimulation for the microbes. In addition, the roots provide conduits and physical loosening of soil, improving microbial contact with oxygen and nutrients. 23.2.2 Antimony Antimony (Sb) exists in fossil fuels, especially in coal. Fossil fuel combustion is likely the largest source of anthropogenic Sb emissions to the atmosphere. Abundant in sulfde minerals and co-occurring with heavy metals, Sb emissions likely result from the mining and metallurgy of nonferrous metals, especially Pb, Cu, and Zn. Their identical outer orbital electron confguration means that Sb and As have the same range of oxidation states in environmental systems (i.e. 3to \u00fe5). The major chemical forms of both are the oxides, hydroxides, or oxoanions, in the \u00fe5 state in oxidized environments (i.e. antimonates and arsenates) or in the \u00fe3 state in more reduce environments (i.e. antimonites and arsenites). Like As, the toxicity of Sb depends upon speciation. The organoantimonials (e.g. methylated Sb species) are less toxic than the antimonates (Sb5\u00fe), which are less toxic than the antimonites (Sb3\u00fe).54 Metalloids seem to behave similarly to heavy metals regarding biogeochemistry. However, this cannot be assumed in all environments, given the lack of relevant and specifc data. These data are particularly lacking for Sb.54 QUESTIONS 1. Consider the metals listed as air toxics. Why is each designated as the metal and its compounds? 2. What are the major ways that metals fnd their way to the atmosphere? 3. Numerous genera of bacteria reduce metals during metabolism.

For example, engineers have used soil bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas spp.) to degrade persistent compounds like tetrachloroethylene (PERC). Most microbes would not be able to attack the PERC molecule, but producing an enzyme (e.g. methane monooxygenase) in the process of degrading short chain alkanes or sugar compounds, some of the PERC is also degraded.

BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF AIR POLLUTANTS 24 Source Sampling and Emission Measurement 24.1 SOURCES OF POLLUTION The sources of air pollution are nearly as numerous as the grains of sand. In fact, the grains of sand themselves are air pollutants when the wind entrains them and they become airborne. We would class them as a natural air pollutant, which implies that such pollution has always been with us. Natural sources of air pollution are de\ufb01ned as sources not caused by people in their activities. Consider the case in which someone has removed the ground cover and left a layer of exposed soil. Later the wind picks up some of this soil and transports it a considerable distance to deposit it at another point, where it affects other people. Would this be classed as a natural pollutant or an anthropogenic pollutant? We might call it natural pollution if the time span between when the ground cover was removed and when the material became airborne was long enough. But, how long would be long enough? The answers to such questions are not as simple as they may \ufb01rst appear. One question leads to another, each answered within its own context and adding uncertainty. This is one of the reasons why pollution problems require careful study and analysis before a decision to control them at a certain level can be made. If the amount of a pollutant emitted can be decreased, then the atmospheric concentrations can also be decreased. If these concentrations decrease in the breathing zone, then the exposure to the contaminant also lessens. If the exposure declines, the adverse effects become ameliorated or eliminated. So, addressing air pollution starts at the source. 24.1.1 Natural Sources An erupting volcano emits particulate matter. Pollutant gases such as SO2,H2S, and methane are also emitted. The emission from an eruption may be of such a magnitude as to harm the environment for a considerable distance from the volcanic source. Clouds of volcanic particulate matter and gases have remained airborne for very long periods of time. The 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens in the state of Washington is a classic example of volcanic activity that can releases many tons of pollutants into the winds aloft; allowing for widespread and long-range pollutant transport. This included not only the ash from the volcano, but the emission of organic pollutants from the burning of vegetation that ensued. Accidental \ufb01res in forests and on the prairies are usually classi\ufb01ed as natural sources even though they may have been originally ignited by human activities. In many cases foresters intentionally set \ufb01res in forestlands to burn off the residue, but lightning setting off a \ufb01re in a large section of forestland could only be classed as natural. A large uncontrolled forest \ufb01re is a frightening thing to behold. Such a \ufb01re emits large quantities of pollutants in the form of smoke, unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and ash. Forest \ufb01res in the Paci\ufb01c Northwest of the United States have been observed to emit a plume which caused reduction in visibility and sunlight as far away as 350 km from the actual \ufb01re. Dust storms that entrain large amounts of particulate matter are a common natural source of air pollution in many parts of the world.", "Even a relatively small dust storm can result in suspended particulate matter readings one or two orders of magnitude above ambient air quality standards. Visibility reduction during major dust storms is frequently the cause of severe highway accidents and can even affect air travel. The particulate matter transferred by dust storms from thedeserttourban areascausesproblemstohouseholders, industry, and automobiles. The materials removed by the air cleaner of an automobile are primarily natural pollutants such as road dust and similar entrained material. The oceans of the world are an important natural source of pollutant material. The ocean is continually emitting aerosols to the atmosphere, in the form of salt particles, which are corrosive to metals and paints. The action of waves on rocks reduces them to sand, which may eventually become airborne. Even the shells Fundamentals of Air Pollution 559 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00024-4 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 24. SOURCE SAMPLING AND EMISSION MEASUREMENT washed up on the beach are eroded by wave and tidal action until they are reduced to such a small size that they too may become airborne. An extensive source of natural pollutants is the trees and other plant life of the earth. Even though these green plants play a large part in the conversion of carbon dioxide to oxygen through photosynthesis, they are still the major sources of hydrocarbons on the planet. The familiar blue haze over forested areas, including urban areas with large amounts of tree cover, is nearly all from the atmospheric reactions of the volatile organics given off by the trees of the forest.1 This section\u2019s objective is not to \u201cblame\u201d nature for pollution, but to ensure that natural sources are properly considered. For example, the anthropogenic sources of a pollutant may be relatively small, but it may be suf\ufb01cient to cause damage when added to the biogenic or other natural sources of that same pollutant in a particular area during a speci\ufb01c period of time. Indeed, the Clean Air Act has provisions to account for exceptional events that may include \ufb01res and other natural and/or extraordinary sources. An area that may otherwise have to take actions (e.g. traf\ufb01c pattern changes, reductions in stationary source emissions, etc.), may not have to do so if the contribution from natural sources were found to be the cause of not attaining the air quality standards. 24.1.2 Bioaerosols Another air pollutant problem, which can be attributed to plant life, is the pollens which cause respiratory distress and allergic reactions in humans. Pollen is a type of bioaerosol, which can be a living or formerly living organism (e.g. mold and other fungi), a release of part of an organism (e.g. a spore, cyst, or pollen) or residue from an organism (feces from insects or dander from animals).2 These particles are increasingly associated with diseases, such as asthma, especially when exposures are combined with other air pollutants and genetic factors (see Figure 24.1).3 Particularly troublesome products of bioaerosols are a\ufb02atoxins, the toxic metabolites of mold (Aspergillus \ufb02avus and Aspergillus parasiticus). Engineering and food supply controls have greatly reduced potential expo-sures,4 but a\ufb02atoxins remain an important class of biogenic air pollutants. The general population is exposed through food ingestion, but a\ufb02atoxins are also air pollutants, especially from inhalation of dust emitted when workers handle crops and feeds on which Aspergillus has been growing. Agricultural workers and farmers are obviously at highest risk of airborne a\ufb02atoxins. For example, a\ufb02atoxins have been measured at concentrations of 0.02e0.8 ng m 3 in respirable dust samples collected at rice and corn processing plants in India5 and 0.04e4800 ng m 3 during U.S. bin cleaning and other operations.6 Other natural sources, such as alkaline and saltwater lakes, are usually quite local in their effect on the environment. Sulfurous gases from hot springs also fall into this category in that the odor is extremely strong when close to the source but disappears a few kilometers away. In terms of human health effects from natural air pollutants, radon (Rn), asbestos, ozone (O3) emissions by vegetation and particulate and products of incomplete combustion emissions from wild\ufb01res can be substantial. 24.1.3 Radon When radium decays, it releases radon.", "Since it is in Group 18 (noble gases), like helium and argon, it is chemically inert, i.e. its outermost electron shell is \ufb01lled V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 24.1 SOURCES OF POLLUTION FIGURE 24.2 Zones of potential exposure to radon in the U.S. Zone 1 has the highest and Zone 3 has the lowest potential, based on the Radon Index Matrix, a quantitative assessment of radon potential derived from \ufb01ve factors to determine radon potentialeeindoor radon measurements; geology; aerial radioactivity; soil permeability; and foundation type. Zone 1 counties have a predicted average indoor radon screening level greater than4pCil 1. Zone 2 counties have a predicted average indoor radon screening level between 2 and 4 pCi l 1. Zone 3 counties have a predicted average indoor radon screening level less than 2 pCi l 1. The radon potential assessment is based on geologic provinces. It should be noted that these are very broad geographic provinces and that high radon readings have been found in all zones, including Zone 3. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. EPA map of radon zones. http://www.epa.gov/ radon/zonemap.html; 2013 [accessed 29.08.13]. so that it does not react with other chemicals. Ordinarily, this is a desirable property in terms of toxicity and hazard, since the substance does not react biochemically and, thus, does not damage cells. However, the radioactivity of Rn does indeed damage tissues. With an atomic weight of 222, radon is the heaviest mononuclear gas. Thus, when it migrates into buildings, it tends to accumulate in lower levels, especially crawl spaces and basements. It is odorless, colorless, and tasteless, so it can only be detected with a sensitive equipment. The amount of radon in rock and soil is highly variable, but even at low concentrations, the gas will move from interstices in porous media and through \ufb01ssures between particles into the ambient air. Ambient radon concentrations are about 0.4 picocuries per liter of air (pCi l 1). More importantly, radon may seep through foundations, \ufb02oors, and walls of buildings and increase indoor concentrations. The mean U.S. indoor radon concentration is higher than ambient, i.e. about 1.3 pCi l 1 of air. However, it is not uncommon to measure indoor radon in the range of 5e50 pCi l 1, with maximums of 2.0 103 pCi l 1 (see Figure 24.2). Local geological, soil, and weather conditions affect the migration rate of radon into buildings. In addition, since radon\u2019s decay products are metals, they may be sorbed by aerosols, increasing the likelihood of inhalation exposure. 7 24.1.4 Naturally Occurring Asbestos Asbestos is a unique type of air pollutant. It is a particle with a large aspect ratio (length:width), i.e. a \ufb01ber. Asbestos comprises a group of highly \ufb01brous minerals with separable, long, and thin \ufb01bers. It is known to be highly toxic and, when inhaled, can cause asbestosis, mesothelioma, and lung cancer. Exposures in schools, industry, mechanical operations, mining, and other human enterprises are the most notorious. However, so-called \u201cnaturally occurring asbestos\u201d (NOA) also presents threats to public health. The term is in quotes because all asbestos occurs naturally. It is not manufactured as such, as the \ufb01bers are separated from ore and V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 24. SOURCE SAMPLING AND EMISSION MEASUREMENT used in products and building materials. NOA may have nothing to do with mining or manufacturing. For example, people may be exposed to asbestos \ufb01bers when foundations are dug for homes and other buildings, overburden is removed in building roads, rock is weathered naturally, and from other seemingly innocuous activities that usually do not involve hazardous substances. Globally, collected samples from Antarctic ice indicate chrysotile asbestos has been a ubiquitous contaminant of the environment for at least 10,000 years. Snow samples in Japan have shown ambient background levels are one to two orders of magnitude higher in urban than in rural areas. Higher concentrations of airborne asbestos \ufb01bers are reported in urban areas where there are more asbestos containing materials and mechanisms of release (vehicles braking and weathering of asbestos cement materials); concentrations in the range of 1e20 ng m 3 have been reported. Fibers longer than 5 mm are rarely found in rural areas.8 The size and shape of any aerosol, including a \ufb01ber, greatly in\ufb02uences its toxicity. As discussed in Chapter 7, smaller particles (diameter < 2.5 mm) can in\ufb01ltrate the lungs more deeply and deposit with greater ef\ufb01ciency than larger particles.", "Fibers are de\ufb01ned by regulatory agencies like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency9 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration10 to have aspect ratios equal to or greater than 3:1. Asbestos exists in nature in two mineral forms, amphibole (Figure 24.3) and serpentine. Chrysotile (Figure 24.4) is the only asbestos member of serpentine group. Some studies11 show that amphibole \ufb01bers stay in the lungs longer than chrysotile, and this tendency may account for their increased toxicity. Chrysotile \ufb01bers are long and \ufb02exible, which explains their wide use in commercial products. Amphiboles are brittle, rod or needle-shaped \ufb01bers. Exposure to either type can lead to respiratory diseases, but amphibole \ufb01bers are more persistent after deposition in the lung.12 24.1.5 Biogenic Emissions Natural sources such as volcanic eruptions and forest \ufb01res can combine with anthropogenic sources to worsen air pollution episodes, such as inversions and ground-level ozone episodes.13 Natural emissions can be from abiotic or biotic origin. The NOA is an example of an abiotic source. A person\u2019s lifetime exposure to asbestos must add all sources, including NOA. Biotic sources that release substances as part of their life cycle are known as biogenic emissions. These emissions can be by any type of organism during its life cycle, i.e. animal, plant, and microbe. For example, an animal may release CO2 and methane during its life stages as it respires. After its death, microbes will release CH4 and H2S as they respire anaerobically. Later, plants will release O2 as they photosynthesize the mineralized nutrients left behind in the detritus and soil by the microbes. This oversimpli\ufb01cation of the respiration and photosynthesis processes illustrates the biogenic emission of three air pollutants, CO2,CH4, and H2S. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 24.2 ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES Indeed the contributions can be large in certain areas. As mentioned in Chapter 7, a recent study in South Queensland, Australia, found that 61.2% of the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in that region came from biogenic sources (e.g. vegetative transpiration) and another 5.7% from bush \ufb01res and biomass burning.14 Such emissions need to be accounted for, even if the sources are not controllable. For example, biogenic source measurements may be used to decide about any additional controls that are needed during times of large VOC contributions to an ozone event. The logical decision sequence is: 1. What is the air quality standard for a speci\ufb01c pollutant? 2. What is the biogenic contribution to the ambient air (ambient measurement or model)? 3. What is the anthropogenic contribution by category (ambient measurement, source-apportionment, and receptor models)? 4. What quantity (\ufb02ux) of the pollutant is combining from a particular biogenic source (e.g. forest emission measurement)? 5. How can this addition be compensated for with reductions of anthropogenic sources of this pollutant? 6. How long will these biogenic sources continue (continuous biogenic source measurements and modeling)? 7. What is a feasible and effective way to compensate for these biogenic emissions in the future (e.g. is this a very rare and extreme event, or is it likely to continue or recur given biological and meteorological conditions)? The bottom line for public health agencies is to keep exposures to hazardous substances below an adverse effect concentration. For example, if sound science has shown that children should not breathe air containing more than 10 ppm of a compound, and the uncontrollable emissions contribute concentrations that would be 5 ppm in the ambient air, the controllable sources would have to be controlled so that they would lead to less than 5 ppm concentrations in the ambient air (and with uncertainty, possibly much less to provide an ample margin of safety). If the biogenic emissions contribute enough of the pollutant to translate into 7 ppm, the controllable emissions from stationary and mobile sources would have contribute concentrations that would lead to ambient concentrations less than 3 ppm (again with an ample margin of safety, even less than 3 ppm). The latter case of higher natural emission rates is known as an exceptional and/or extreme event. Air pollution regulatory agencies often take into consideration of such extreme events. In the United States, a request exceptional event \ufb02ag15 must be accompanied by a demonstration that: 1. The event satis\ufb01es all of the criteria set forth in 40 CFR x50.1(j). It affects air quality; is not reasonably controllable or preventable; and is caused by human activity that is unlikely to recur at a particular location, or is a natural event. 2.", "There is a clear causal relationship between the measurement under consideration and the event that is claimed to have affected the air quality in the area. 3. The event is associated with a measured concentration in excess of normal historical \ufb02uctuations, including background. 4. There would have been no exceedance or violation but for the event. 24.2 ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES Most of the emphasis of air pollution regulations is associated with human-induced pollution. This is for a number of reasons. If humans cause pollution, then they understand the events that lead to the pollution, which is the \ufb01rst step to reverse-engineer the pollution process. Thus, if they are willing, humans may stop the pollution by either preventing the activities that contribute to the formation, release, and exposure of the pollutants; and/or they may design interventions to reduce or eliminate the pollution or prevent exposure. Thus, emissions at various points along the pollution-generation pathway need to be measured to recommend appropriate prevention (e.g. substitution of pollution-generating substances with more innocuous substances) and control technologies (e.g. removing gases and aerosols from the waste stream before emissions). Without accurate and representative measurements, such prevention and intervention may well be incorrect or poorly designed. To comply with emission standards often requires source measurements. For example, an incinerator may not only be required to measure pollutants that are exiting the stack but also demonstrate removal ef\ufb01ciencies. Other source measurements are indicators of contribution to overall ambient air quality (see Chapters 26 and 28). That is, source measurements can help to demonstrate the individual\u2019s contribution to the ambient concentrations of a particular pollutant as designated in an air quality plan, such as a State Implementation Plan in the United States. Measurements of anthropogenic sources are also necessary to support modeling (see Chapter 27). Measurements are needed to provide ground truth or to evaluate pollutant dispersion models. They are also V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 24. SOURCE SAMPLING AND EMISSION MEASUREMENT needed for receptor and source-apportionment models, e.g. to determine the amount of a tracer that exits a stack compared to measurements at various points downwind. From these measurements, the model can be constructed to estimate back-trajectories from ambient measurements to potential sources. 24.2.1 Source Sampling and Monitoring Air pollutants released to the atmosphere may be characterized by qualitative descriptions or quantitative analysis. For example, a plume may be characterized as brown, dense smoke, or 60% opacity. The \ufb01rst two descriptors are qualitative; the third quantitative. It may also be described as containing certain concentration of particulate matter (e.g. 100 mg m 3 PM2.5). These are quantitative descriptions made by observing the ef\ufb02uent as it entered the atmosphere.a Arguably, quantitative data are the best way to characterize the emission and air quality, and the best way to answer the following questions. How many parts per million of a criteria or toxic pollutant are being released from all sources in Toledo, Torino, and Toronto today? How many kilograms per hour are being emitted by this power plant? How many kilograms per year are emitted by this same plant? To obtain these numbers, it becomes necessary to sample or to monitor the emission. Sampling and monitoring, therefore, are necessary for air pollution evaluation and control. In any situation concerning atmospheric emission of pollutants, source sampling or monitoring is necessary to a obtain accurate data. Figure 24.5 shows a simple source test being conducted. 24.2.2 Source Sampling The purpose of source sampling is to obtain as representative, precise, and accurate a sample as possible of the material entering the atmosphere at a minimum cost. This statement needs to be examined in light of each source test conducted. The following questions should continually be answered during the sampling period: (1) The sample must be representative of the emission. Is the sampling and collecting of the material representative of what is actually being released? Is this the material entering the atmosphere? Sampling at the base of a tall stack may be much easier than sampling at the top, but the fact that a pollutant exists in the breeching does not mean that it will eventually be emitted to the atmosphere. Molecules can also undergo both physical and chemical changes before leaving the stack. (2) Maximum accuracy in sampling is desirable. Is maximum accuracy attainable? Decisions regarding the total ef\ufb02uent will be based on what was found from a relatively small sample. Only if the sample accurately represents the total will the extrapolation to the entire ef\ufb02uent be valid.", "(3) Collecting a sample is a costly and time-consuming process. Are \ufb01nancial considerations being properly factored into the decision-making process and are the costs being minimized consistent with other objectives? It makes little sense to spend $5000 on an extensive stack testing analysis to decide whether to purchase a $10,000 scrubber of 95% ef\ufb01ciency or to try to get by with a $7000 scrubber of 90% ef\ufb01ciency. The test results would be of little value, since they can only be compared to scrubber speci\ufb01cations for the higher ef\ufb01ciency system. And, the difference in costs is nominal compared to the test costs. The reasons for performing a source test differ. The test might be necessary for one or more reasons: (1) To obtain data concerning the emissions for an emission inventory or to identify a predominant source in the area. An example of this would be determination of the hydrocarbon release from a new type of organic solvent used in a degreasing tank. (2) To determine compliance with regulations. If authorization is obtained to construct an incinerator and the permit states that the maximum allowable particulate emission is 230 mg per standard cubic meter corrected to 12% CO2, a source Another characterization often applied in air pollution is \u201csemi-quantitative\u201d. The meaning is less clear than qualitative or quantitative; only that it has elements of both. An example may be that a concentration is increasing or decreasing over a time period, but the amount of the increase or decrease is not known (only that the problem is worsening or improving). This is also an example of different types of values; if the data include ratio and interval values, the description is likely to be quantitative. If the values are ordinal (i.e. the rank is known, but not the absolute value), this can be considered semiquantitative. If the values are nominal, the description is, at best, qualitative (e.g. brown smoke, white smoke, no smoke). V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 24.2 ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES test must be made to determine compliance with the permit. (3) To gather information that will enable selection of appropriate control equipment. If a source test determines that the emission is 3000 mg of particulate per cubic meter and that it has a weight mean size of 5 mm, a control device must be chosen which will collect enough particulate to meet some required standard, such as 200 mg per cubic meter. (4) To determine the ef\ufb01ciency of control equipment installed to reduce emissions. If a manufacturer supplies a device guaranteed to be 95% ef\ufb01cient for removal of particulate with a weight mean size of 5 mm, the ef\ufb02uent stream must be sampled at the inlet and outlet of the device to determine if the guarantee has been met (see Chapter 32 for a discussion of how to calculate ef\ufb01ciency). 24.2.3 Statistics of Sampling Recall that most statistics are inferential. That is, we must infer the conditions of a larger population from a much smaller sample. Thus, we must be careful in how we interpret the meaning of a sample. A sample collected at the rate of 0.3 l min 1 from a stack discharging 2000 m3 min 1 to the atmosphere is likely to include substantially large error. Another term for bias is systematic error. If the sample is truly representative, it is said to be both accurate and unbiased. If the sample is not representative, it may be biased because of some consistent phenomenon (some of the hydrocarbons condense in the tubing ahead of the trap) or in error because of some uncontrolled variation (only 1.23 g of sample was collected, and the analytical technique is accurate to 0.5 g).16 For practical purposes, source testing can be considered as simple random sampling.17 The source may be considered to be composed of such a large population of samples that the population N is in\ufb01nite. From this population, n units are selected in such a manner that each unit of the population has an equal chance of being chosen. For the sample, we can determine the sample mean, y: y1 \u00fey2 \u00fe/ \u00feyn y \u00bc (24.1) n If the sample is unbiased we can estimate the source mean (Y), so that: Y \u00bcy (24.2) For example, if we were to take six samples of carbon monoxide from the exhaust of an idling automobile and obtain the CO percentages as shown in Table 24.1.", "The sample mean is: 1:8 \u00fe1:6 \u00fe1:8 \u00fe1:9 \u00fe1:7 \u00fe1:8 y \u00bc\u00bc1:767 6 TABLE 24.1 Idling Internal Combustion Engine, CO Percentages Test Number CO (%) 1 1.8 2 1.6 3 1.8 4 1.9 5 1.7 6 1.8 The source mean is assumed to be the same if the sample is unbiased, as seen by: Y \u00bcy \u00bc1:767 (24.3) The variance of the sample and the population (source) may also be assumed equal if the sample is unbiased. The variance is S2, de\ufb01ned as: P n 2 1 S2 \u00bc yi y (24.4) n 1 The variance of the source is usually calculated by the formula: \"# P X 2 1 \u00f0 y\u00de 2 s 2 \u00bc y (24.5) i n 1 n For the preceding example, this is found as follows: PP 2 y \u00bc18:78; yi \u00bc10:6; n \u00bc6 i \"# 2 1 \u00f010:6\u00de s2 \u00bc 18:78 \u00bc0:01067 61 6 The standard deviation of the sample is de\ufb01ned as the square root of the variance. For the example, the standard deviation is: 1=2 21=2 s \u00bc s \u00bc\u00f00:01067\u00de\u00bc0:103 1.767% V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 24. SOURCE SAMPLING AND EMISSION MEASUREMENT The sample represents a population (source) which, if normally distributed, has a mean of 1.767% and a standard deviation of 0.103%. This can be illustrated as shown in Figure 24.6. If there is reason to believe that the distribution is not normal, other nonparametric statistical methods may be used. The inference from the statistical calculations is that the true mean value of the carbon monoxide from the idling automobile has a 66.7% chance of being between 1.664% and 1.870%. The best single number for the carbon monoxide emission would be 1.767% (the mean value). Further statistical procedures can be applied to determine the con\ufb01dence limits of the results. Generally, only the values for the mean and standard deviation would be reported. The reader is referred to any good statistical text to expand on the brief analysis presented here. 24.2.4 The Source Test 24.2.4.1 Test Preliminaries The \ufb01rst thing that must be done for a successful source test is a complete review of all relevant background material. The test request may come in either verbal or written form. If it is verbal, it should be put into writing for the permanent record. The request may contain much or little information, but it is important to verify that it is complete and understood. Questions to ask are: (1) Why should the test be made? Is it to measure a speci\ufb01c pollutant such as SO2, or is it to determine less speci\ufb01c goal, such as identifying where a loss of a compound is occurring (e.g. between a reactor and stack) or what is causing the odor problem in the new residential area? (2) What will the test results be used for? Will it be necessary to go to court, or are the results for general information only? This may make a difference regarding the test method selected or of the necessary precision and accuracy of a given test. (3) What equipment or process is to be tested? (4) What are its operational requirements? (5) What methods would be preferred by the analytical group? (6) Are the analytical methods standard or unique? (7) Can all contaminants be sampled in a single test or will a series of test be needed (or separate tests for different target analytes)? A literature search regarding the process and test should be conducted unless the test crew is thoroughly familiar with the source and all possible test methods. It is important to check the regulations regarding the process and speci\ufb01c test procedures as a part of the search.18 When all the background material has been reviewed, it is time to inspect the source to be tested. The inspector should be accompanied by the plant manager, engineer, or someone who knows the process in detail. It is also important that any technicians or mechanics be contacted at this time regarding necessary test holes, platforms, scaffolding, power requirements, and other logistical and facilities-related information. During this inspection, checks should be made for environmental conditions and space requirements at the sampling site. Every visitor to the site, whether an employee of the organization or a third-party inspector, should be thoroughly familiar with all safety requirements and possible hazards. In fact, safety materials should be obtained and reviewed before setting foot on the premises. A number of companies require any visitor to complete safety training for certain installations.", "Even if the company or other site does not require this training, anyone visiting should contact the appropriate health and safety agency (e.g. city, county, state, or federal) to ensure they are properly prepared, including any personal protective equipment needed. All appropriate safety training should be completed prior to entry. Testing in a noisy or dusty place at elevated temperatures is certainly uncomfortable and possibly hazardous. In particular, hazardous situations must be avoided, such as entry into enclosed and con\ufb01ned areas and handling of hazardous materials. Evacuation and warning systems must be known, e.g. what to do in the event of a steam leak. Rough estimates of several important factors should be made at this time. These estimates can be noted in writing during the inspection. A simple check sheet, such as the one shown in Figure 24.7, should be a great aid. The information obtained during the background search and from the source inspection will enable selection of the test procedure to be used. The choice will be based on the answers to several questions: (1) What are the legal requirements? For speci\ufb01c sources there may be only one acceptable method. (2) What range of accuracy is desirable? Should the sample be collected by a procedure that is 5% accurate, or should a statistical technique be used on data from eight tests at 10% accuracy? The same is true for acceptable precision. Costs of different test methods will certainly be a consideration here. (3) Which sampling and analytical methods are available that will give the required accuracy for the estimated concentration? An Orsat gas analyzer with a sensitivity limit of 0.02% would not be chosen to sample carbon monoxide at 50e100 ppm. Conversely, an infrared gas analyzer with a full-scale de\ufb02ection of 1000 ppm would not be chosen to sample CO2 from a power boiler. (4) Is a continuous record required over many cycles of source operation, or will one or more grab samples suf\ufb01ce? If a source emits for only a short period of time, a method would not be selected which requires hours to gather the required sample. The test must be scheduled well in advance for the bene\ufb01t of all concerned. The plant personnel, as well as the test crew, should be given the intended date and time of the test. It is also a good idea to let the chemist or analytical service know when the testing will be V.

It may be necessary to schedule or rent equipment in advance, such as boom trucks or scaffolding. When scheduling the test, make sure that the source will be operating in its normal manner. A boiler may be operating at only one-third load on weekends because the plant steam load is off the line and only a small heating load is being carried. 24.2.4.2 Gas Flow Measurement The volume of gaseous ef\ufb02uent from a source must be determined to obtain the mass loading to the atmosphere. Flow measurement through the sampling train is necessary to determine the volume of gas containing the pollutant of interest. Many of the sampling devices used for source testing have associated gas \ufb02ow indicators which must be continually checked and calibrated. Gas \ufb02ows are often determined by measuring the associated pressures. Figure 24.8 illustrates several different pressure measurements commonly made on systems carrying gases. Static pressure measurements are made to adjust the absolute pressure to standard conditions speci\ufb01ed in the test procedure. The quantity of gaseous ef\ufb02uent leaving a process is usually calculated from the continuity equation, which for this use is written as Q \u00bc AV (24.6) where Q is the \ufb02ow at the speci\ufb01ed conditions of temperature, pressure, and humidity; A is the area through Source test checklist. which the gas \ufb02ows; and V is the velocity of the ef\ufb02uent gas averaged over the area.", "A is commonly measured, and V determined, to calculate Q. The velocity V is determined at several points, in the center of equal duct areas, and averaged. Table 24.2 shows one commonly accepted method of dividing stacks or ducts into equal areas for velocity determinations. For rectangular ducts, the area is evenly divided into the necessary number of measurement points. For circular ducts, Table 24.3 can be used to determine the location of the traverse points. In using this table, realize that traverses are made along two diameters at right angles to each other, as shown in Figure 24.9. In most source tests, the measurement of velocity is made with a pitot-static tube, usually referred to simply as a pitot tube. Figure 24.10 illustrates the two types of pitot tubes in common use. The standard type of pitot tube shown in this \ufb01gure does not need to be calibrated, but it may be easily plugged in some high-ef\ufb02uent loading streams. The type S pitot tube shown in Figure 24.10 does not plug as easily, but it does need calibration to assure its accuracy. The type S pitot tube is also more sensitive to alignment with the gas \ufb02ow to obtain the correct reading. The velocity pressure of the \ufb02owing gas is read at each point of the traverse, and the associated gas velocity is calculated from the formula: hi V \u00bc 420:5 \u00f0Pn =r\u00de1=2 (24.7) V.

Annual Book of Standards. 18 Note: English units were used by the American Society for Testing and Materials. observations such as the velocity of smoke puffs, or from mass balance data (knowing the fuel consumption rate, air/fuel ratio, and stack diameter). In the sampling train itself, the gas \ufb02ow must be measured to determine the sample volume. Particulates and gases are measured as micrograms per cubic meter. In either case, determination of the fraction requires that the gas volume be measured for the term in the denominator. Some sample trains contain built-in \ufb02ow-indicating devices such as ori\ufb01ce meters, rotometers, or Temperature gas meters. These devices require calibration to assure that they read accurately at the time of the test and under test conditions. To determine the volume through the sampling train, a positive displacement system can be used. A known volume of water is displaced by gas containing the sample.", "Another inexpensive procedure that works well consists of measuring the time needed for the gas to \ufb01ll a plastic bag to a certain static pressure. The volume of the bag can be accurately measured under the same conditions and hence the \ufb02ow determined by dividing the bag volume by the time required to \ufb01ll it. 24.2.4.3 Collection of the Source Sample A typical sample train is shown in Figure 24.11. This shows the minimum number of components, but in some systems the components may be combined. Extreme care must be exercised to assure that no leaks occur in the train and that the components of the train are identical for both calibration and sampling. The pump shown in Figure 24.11 must be both oil-less and leakproof. If the pump and volume measurement devices are interchanged, the pump no longer needs to be oil-less and leakproof, but the volume measurement will be in error unless it is adjusted for the change in static pressure. Some sampling trains become very complex as additional stages with controls and instruments are added. Many times the addition of components to a sampling train makes it so bulky and complicated that it becomes nearly impossible to use. A sampling train developed in an air-conditioned laboratory can be useless on a shaky platform in a snowstorm. Standard sampling trains are speci\ufb01ed for some tests. One of these standards is the system speci\ufb01ed for large, stationary combustion sources.19 This train was designed for sampling combustion sources and should not be selected over a simpler sampling train when sampling noncombustion sources such as low-temperature ef\ufb02uents from cyclones, baghouses, \ufb01lters, etc.20 Before taking the sample train to the test site, it is wise to prepare the operating curves for the particular job. With most factory-assembled trains, these curves are a part of the package. If a sampling train is assembled from components, the curves must be developed. The type of curves will vary from source to source and FIGURE 24.11 Sampling train. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 24. SOURCE SAMPLING AND EMISSION MEASUREMENT from train to train. Examples of useful operating curves include (1) velocity vs velocity pressure at various temperatures,21 (2) probe tip velocity vs \ufb02owmeter readings at various temperatures, and (3) \ufb02owmeter calibration curves of \ufb02ow vs pressure drop. It is much easier to take an operating point from a previously prepared curve than to take out a calculator and pad to make the calculations at the moment of the test. Remember, too, that time may be a factor and that settings must be made as rapidly as possible to obtain the necessary samples. For sampling particulate matter, one is dealing with pollutants that have very different inertial and other characteristics from the carrying gas stream. It becomes important, therefore, to sample so that the same velocity is maintained in the probe tip as exists in the adjacent gas stream. Such sampling is called isokinetic. Isokinetic sampling, as well as anisokinetic sampling, is illustrated in Figure 25.26 in Chapter 25. If the probe velocity is less than the stack velocity, particles will be picked up by the probe, which should have been carried past it by the gas streamlines. The inertia of the particles allows them to continue on their path and be intercepted. If the probe velocity exceeds the stack velocity, the inertia of the particles carries them around the probe tip even though the carrying gases are collected. Adjustment of particulate samples taken anisokinetically to the correct stack values is possible if all of the variables of the stack gas and particulate can be accounted for in the appropriate mathematical equations. Modern transducers and microprocessors have been used successfully to automate particulate sampling trains in order to eliminate the operating curves and manual adjustments.22 The automated samplers adjust continuously to maintain isokinetic conditions. In addition, the microprocessor continuously calculates and displays both instantaneous sampling conditions and the total sample volume collected at any given moment. The use of the automated system with the microprocessor, therefore, eliminates both operator and calculation errors. Several separating systems are used for particulate sampling. All rely on some principle of separating the aerosol from the gas stream. Many of the actual systems use more than one type of particulate collection device in series. If a size analysis is to be made on the collected material, it must be remembered that multiple collection devices in series will collect different size fractions.", "Therefore, size analyses must be made at each device and mathematically combined to obtain the size of the actual particulate in the ef\ufb02uent stream. In any system the probe itself removes some particulate before the carrying gas reaches the \ufb01rst separating device, so the probe must be cleaned and the weight of material added to that collected in the remainder of the train. Care should be exercised when sampling for aerosols that are condensable. Some separating systems, such as wet impingers, may remove the condensables from the gas stream, whereas others, such as electrostatic precipitators, will not. Of equal concern should be possible reactions in the sampling system to form precipitates or aerosols which are not normally found when the stack gases are exhausted directly to the atmosphere. SO3 plus other gaseous products may react in a water-\ufb01lled impinger to form particulate matter not truly representative of normal SO3 release. When sampling particulate matter from combustion processes, it is necessary to take corresponding CO2 readings of the ef\ufb02uent. Emission standards usually require combustion stack gases to be reported relative to either 12% CO2 or 50% excess air. Adjusting to a standard CO2 or excess air value normalizes the emission base. Also, emission standards require that the loadings be based on weight per standard cubic volume of air (usually at 20 C and 760 mmHg). In most regulations, the agency requires that the standard volume be dry, but this is not always speci\ufb01ed. For sampling of gases, the sample can be collected by any of several devices. Some commonly used manual methods include Orsat analyzers, absorption systems, adsorption systems, bubblers, reagent tubes, condensers, and traps. Continuous analyzers are now more widely used than manual methods. Some types of continuous analyzers include infrared and ultraviolet instruments; \ufb02ame ionization detectors; mass spectrometers; calorimetric systems; gas, liquid, and solid chromatography; coulometric and potentiometric systems; chemiluminescence; and solid-state electronic systems. Since gases undergoing analysis do not need to be sampled isokinetically, it is only necessary to insert a probe and withdraw the sample. Usually, the gas sample should be \ufb01ltered to remove any accompanying particulate matter which could damage the analytical instrumentation. For the detection and intensity of odorous substances, the nose is still the instrument usually relied upon. Since odors are gaseous, they may be sampled by simply collecting a known volume of ef\ufb02uent and performing some manipulation to dilute the odorous gas with known volumes of \u201cpure\u201d air. The odor is detected by an observer or a panel of observers. The odor-free air for dilution can be obtained by passing air through activated carbon or any other substance that removes all odors while not affecting the other gases that constitute normal air. The odor-free air is then treated by adding more and more of the odorous gas until the observer just detects the odor. The concentration is then recorded as the odor threshold as noted by that observer. The test is not truly quantitative, as much variation between observers and samples is common. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 24.2 ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES If the compound causing the odor is known and can be chemically analyzed, it may be possible to get valid quantitative data by direct gas sampling. An example would be a plant producing formaldehyde. If the ef\ufb02uent were sampled for formaldehyde vapor, this could be related, through proper dispersion formulas, to indicate whether the odor would cause any problems in residential neighborhoods adjacent to the plant. Extreme care should be taken in transporting and storing the samples between the time of collection and the time of analysis. Some condensable hydrocarbon samples have been lost because the collection device was subjected to elevated temperatures during shipment. Equally disastrous is placing the sample in an oven at 105 C to drive off the moisture, only to discover that the particles of interest had a very low vapor pressure and also departed the sample. At such times, source sampling can be very frustrating. A very important analytical tool that is overlooked by many source-testing personnel is the microscope. Microscopic analysis of a particulate sample can tell a great deal about the type of material collected as well as its size distribution. This analysis is necessary if the sample was collected to aid in the selection of a piece of control equipment. All of the ef\ufb01ciency curves for particulate control devices are based on fractional sizes.", "One would not try to remove a submicron-size aerosol with a cyclone collector, but unless a size analysis is made on the sampled material, one is merely guessing at the actual size range. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) may be used for the analysis of particles in air (see Figure 1.4 in Chapter 1 and Figure 24.12). Air samples are collected on \ufb01lters and prepared for analysis. Filters are carbon or gold-coated and mounted so that an electron beam is directed at the sample, and emissions are measured by a detector at an angle to the electron beam. An image of the surface features on the \ufb01lter can then be observed at magni\ufb01cations commonly up to 20,000 and higher, when needed. Many SEM systems also include energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to complement the morphology from SEM with the elemental composition of the particle. However, EDS will not provide individual chemical species. For example, the EDS spectrum may show that the particle consists of 20% iron and V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 24.

(A24.7) is an empirically derived equation that has appeared in the three most recent editions of this book, but the conditions were not fully documented. Therefore, another derivation based on \ufb01rst principles is in order.25 The Bernoulli equation states the following: 1 2 2Pv V \u00bc (A24.1) r where V is the velocity in meters per second (m s 1); Pv is \ufb02uid velocity pressure in Newton per square meter (Nm 2);and r is density in kilograms per cubic meter (kg m 3). To check the equation to determine whether the 420.5 coef\ufb01cient is correct, 2 can be factored out and the units converted as follows: 1Nm 2 \u00bc 0.10197 mm H2Oor 1mmH2O \u00bc 9.8064 N m 2 at 4 C (standard). 1 min \u00bc 60 s. 1N \u00bc kg-m s 2. Therefore: 1 23 2 2PvmmH2O 9:8064 Nm 2 60s 6 mmH2O kg-m7 V \u00bc 45 (A24.2) min Ns 3 rkgm 2 V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION Units cancel to m min 1, which means velocity in me ters per minutes is as follows: 1 V \u00bc 265:72 Pv 2 (A24.3) r Using an example in the fundamental equation with Pv \u00bc 15N m 2and r \u00bc 1.4kg m 3: 1 22 2Pv 2 15N m kg-m V \u00bc\u00bc 32 r 1:4kgm Ns . 1 \u00bc 4 629ms 1 \u00bc 277:7 m min (A24.4) So, Pv \u00bc 15N m 2 \u00bc 1.5296 mm H2Oat4 C; and r \u00bc 1.4kg m 3. To con\ufb01rm further that the coef\ufb01cient needs to be corrected, let us insert the 420.5 as the coef\ufb01cient: 11 2Pv 21:5296 mm H2O 2 V \u00bc 420:5 \u00bc 3 r 1:4kgm 1 \u00bc 439:5 m min (A24.5) This does not agree with the fundamental equation. Converting units in the fundamental equation to mm H2O, m min 1 and inputting the same values as above, i.e., Pv \u00bc 15N m 2 \u00bc 1.5296 mm H2O, 4 C, and r \u00bc 1.4kg m 3: 11 2Pv 21:5296 mmH2O 2 V \u00bc 265:72 \u00bc 3 r 1:4kgm 1 \u00bc 277:7 m min : (A24.6) This is the same velocity as the fundamental equation. Furthermore, checking against another commonly used Eq. (A24.2): 1 Pv 2 V \u00bc 1096:7 r where V is feet per minute; Pv is in inches H2O; and r is in pounds per cubic feet. Converting units to: Pv \u00bc 15N m 2 \u00bc 1.5296 mm H2Oat4 C \u00bc 0.06022 inches H2O r \u00bc 1.4kg m 3 \u00bc 0.087399 lb ft 3 0:06022 in H2O V \u00bc 1096:7 0; 087399 lb ft 3 1 \u00bc 910:3ftmin 1 \u00bc 277:5 m min (A24.7) This also agrees with the fundamental equation. Thus, the coef\ufb01cient of 265.7 agrees with the fundamental equation much better than 420.5 coef\ufb01cient in Eq. (A24.7). Therefore, readers are recommended to use Eq. (A24.3) instead of Eq. (A24.7). References 1.", "Tombach I. A critical review of methods for determining visual range in pristine and near-pristine areas.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25 Methods for Measuring Air Pollutants 25.1 INTRODUCTION Air pollution results from myriad sources and impacts very complex systems ranging in scale from the cell to the planet. Chapter 24 begins with a distinction between natural and anthropogenic sources of air pollution. This chapter describes approaches for measuring air pollutants and other characteristics of the ambient atmosphere or, more precisely, the ambient troposphere. These measurements give general information about the quality of air, not a particular source, whether natural or human-induced. The primary focus of ambient monitoring is to identify and to quantify pollutants at various scales in the atmosphere, ranging from planetary (e.g. greenhouse gases) to neighborhood. Chapter 24 applies the methods and approaches to air monitoring at various scales. Between neighborhood and global scales are various size air pollution compartments, from regional to urban to community to indoor. Within these environmental compartments are matrices of nonliving (i.e. abiotic) and living (biotic) components. To determine the condition of such systems, various means of measurement are needed. The measurements may be direct or indirect.", "Direct physical and chemical measurements include the concentrations and sizes of particles captured on \ufb01lters, concentrations of gases and vapors collected in traps, temperature, humidity, and pH of water droplets. Others are indirect, such as light scattering as indication of the number of aerosols in the atmosphere. This chapter provides an overview of some of the most important measurement methods in use today. In addition, the chapter introduces some of the techniques available for sampling, analysis, and extrapolation and interpolation (e.g. models) of measured results, although air quality modeling is treated in much greater detail in Chapter 27. Air pollutants must be known throughout their life cycles (Figure V.7). Thus, they must be measured or at least estimated at their sources, after being emitted, during their time in the atmosphere and hydrosphere, after humans and ecosystems are exposed and following uptake by humans and organisms. The representativeness and usefulness of air quality monitoring depend on the quality of each step from sample collection to sample preparation to analysis. Sampling is a statistical term, i.e. a sample is a subset of a population or domain from which information can be inferred about the entire population or domain. Thus, care must be taken to ensure the quality of every interdependent step in air quality measurements. Since a sample represents a very small fraction of the larger population or airshed from which the sample was drawn, it requires a model to provide an estimate of the air quality. The model may be represented mathematically or spatially. For example, a sample of air may consist of a canister or bag that holds a de\ufb01ned quantity or air collected during a particular time period at a speci\ufb01c location. The air must be subsequently analyzed and these analytic results can be used to extrapolate air quality from that location and time to larger spatial areas and longer time frames. The sample is representative of a portion of an air mass or, more likely, a part of an air mass, such as zones around a source with isopleths of the concentration of an air pollutant. All of the samples must be collected and their results aggregated to ascertain with de\ufb01ned certainty the quality of an air mass. More samples will be needed for a large urban airshed than for that of a small town. Intensive sampling is often needed for highly toxic contaminants and for sites that may be particularly critical, e.g. near a hazardous waste site or in an \u201cat risk\u201d neighborhood (such as one near a manufacturing facility that uses large quantities of potentially toxic materials). Similar to other statistical measures, environmental samples allow for statistical inference. In case, inferences are made regarding the condition of an ecosystem and the extent and severity of exposure of a human population. Sampling regimes follow the life cycle of an air pollutant. Chapter 24 addresses the pollutant at its source. The measurements at the point of a pollutant\u2019s Fundamentals of Air Pollution 579 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00025-6 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS release into the environment usually represent the highest concentrations of an air pollutant during its life cycle, excluding measurements within the reactor. A reactor may be speci\ufb01cally designed to produce a compound, e.g. a pesticide or household chemical, with releases to the environment through stacks and vents. The next steps in the chemical\u2019s life cycle involve dilution of concentrations until the substance is again concentrated by organisms (Figure 25.1). The measurement locations shown in Figure 25.1 are at the emission level for a particular facility. Ambient concentrations of these same pollutants are the result of all facilities and other sources. Thus, ambient measurements need to represent a type of mixed average for a region or for a particular population. An example of the former is ground-level ozone for the entire region (e.g. the airshed for St. Louis would include several counties in Missouri and Illinois, and the airshed of London, England would include the city and suburbs). An example of the latter would be the concentrations of benzene or carbon monoxide for several city blocks in downtown St. Louis and London. Thus, the type of measurement depends on the mixing and dispersion of a pollutant and the population expected to be exposed to that pollutant. The method, then, varies according to the accuracy, precision, and representativeness needed. \u201cGrab\u201d samples provide straightforward and quick means of measuring air pollution.", "A grab sample is a single sample taken to represent an entire system. Such a sample is limited in location vertically and horizontally, so there is much uncertainty. However, the representativeness is improved with greater sampling density. For example, if 10 samples are taken at 10 spatially distributed sites, the inferences are improved. Furthermore, if the samples were taken in each season, then there would be some improvement to understanding of intra-annual variability. If the sampling is continued for several years, the interannual variability is better characterized. Grab samples of particulate matter and gases can be taken at any location in Figure 25.1. They may be taken in a stack or vent for an emissions snapshot. They are often taken to estimate concentrations in the ambient air impacted by a particular source, such as a high-traf\ufb01c roadway and an industrial facility. For example, to estimate the amount of a toxic chemical compound in the atmosphere surrounding a chemical plant, an engineer collects air samples in canisters downwind from (B) Sampling locations to determine effectiveness of pollution control equipment. Ideally, sampling is needed at the entrance and exit of each pollution control device to determine pollution control ef\ufb01ciency. (C) Sampling locations to determine effectiveness of changes to reactor, e.g. green chemistry and substitution of reagents to decrease or eliminate pollution, such as the substitution of a chlorinated compound with a nonchlorinated solvent, thereby eliminating organochlorine emissions. The scenario shown in (C) has completed eliminated stack and vent emissions, and decreased fugitive emissions from the reactor (Figure 25.2), as well as decreased the pollutant concentrations in the ef\ufb02uent being released into surface and groundwater. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Pollutant concentration Pollutant measurement Pollution controls V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION the plant (see Discussion Box: Sampling Gases and Vapors). Sampling at only one point, i.e. \ufb01lling one canister, may not reveal much about the presence of the compound. If the sample is taken at the stack outlet, this is a grab sample of emission. If the sample is taken properly, it may accurately represent a snapshot of the emission, but it will not represent the actual emission. For example, if it is taken during a short period of time when the chemical plant is operating near capacity, the compound concentrations will overestimate longer time periods. That is, it cannot be used to estimate weekly, daily, or even an hourly emission. It is mere an instantaneous measurement of the compound being emitted. Likewise, if the sample is taken when the plant is idle or at very low operating conditions, the instantaneous measurement will underestimate the emission. In addition to grab samples, numerous other means of collecting samples are routinely used to assess ambient air quality, including continuous sampling with stationary measurement apparatus and periodic sampling with portable devices (e.g. canisters and bags). The sampling can be active, i.e. with pumps to deliver air at a constant rate, or passive, taking advantage of diffusion characteristics of the pollutants and other compounds. These and other methods differ as to whether the pollutant is a gas or an aerosol. Air pollutant concentrations can be ascertained through various other types of sampling, depending on the pollutant of concern. The sampling may be real-time, where measurements including simultaneous sampling and analysis, or more typically for most pollutants, may follow a protocol for a series of various steps between the sampling site and the laboratory: 1. Sampling preparation (e.g. canister cleaning, \ufb01lter weighing, on-site setup, and chain-of-custody); 2. Sample collection in the \ufb01eld; 3. Sample transportation to laboratory; 4. Extraction of collection media (e.g. removal of analyte from foam traps and sorbent using solvents, pressurization, etc. such as Soxhlet, supercritical \ufb02uid, and other extraction technologies); 5. Collection of extract in solvent; 6. Concentration of solvent (if concentrations are extremely low, to raise concentrations above detection limits of equipment); 7. Separation (e.g. gas or liquid chromatography); and 8. Laboratory analysis (e.g. mass spectroscopy). These steps are described in detail in Chapter 26. Once the decision has been made as to the type of sampling and analysis, the representativeness of the samples needs to be considered. Thus, all sampling of ambient air quality needs to follow a sampling protocol.", "Following are some of the most common approaches to ascertain pollution concentrations for a designated airshed or its subdivisions: Random sampling: The major value of random sampling is statistical representativeness, with a suf\ufb01cient number of samples for the de\ufb01ned con\ufb01dence levels (e.g. X samples needed for 95% con\ufb01dence, random sampling may lead to large areas missed for sampling because due to chance distribution of results). It also neglects prior knowledge of the site. Consider a search for possible sources of benzene and toluene in the air of a neighborhood in which old maps show that a gasoline station was previously located in the study area. A purely random sample of a large area does not employ prior knowledge regarding the possible source if samples near the station, even though there may be a buried tank releasing benzeneetolueneeethylbenzeneexylenes (BTEX) into the groundwater which may migrate through the vadose zone and reach the atmosphere. Strati\ufb01ed random sampling: Dividing an area into subareas and randomly sampling within each subarea could avoid the omission problems of random sampling alone. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS Strati\ufb01ed sampling: In this design, speci\ufb01c air pollutants or other parameters are targeted. The areas are subdivided and sampling patterns and densities varied in different areas. Strati\ufb01ed sampling can be used for complex and large sources, such as mining and agriculture fugitive emissions. Grid or systematic sampling: In this design, the entire area is covered. Sampling locations are readily identi\ufb01able, which is valuable for follow-on sampling, if necessary. Judgmental sampling: Samples are collected based upon knowledge of the site. This overcomes the problem of ignoring sources or sensitive areas, but is vulnerable to bias of both inclusion and exclusion. Obviously, this would not be used for spatial representation, but for pollutant transport, plume characterization, or monitoring near a sensitive site (e.g. a day care center). At every stage of monitoring from sample collection through analysis and archiving, only quali\ufb01ed and authorized persons should be in possession of the samples. This is usually assured by requiring chain-ofcustody manifests. Sample handling includes speci\ufb01cations on the temperature range needed to preserve the sample, the maximum amount of time the sample can be held before analysis, special storage provisions (e.g. some samples need to be stored in certain solvents), and chain-of-custody provisions (only certain, authorized persons should be in possession of samples after collection). Each person in possession of the samples must require that recipient sign and date the chain-ofcustody form before transferring the samples. This is because samples have evidentiary and forensic content, so any compromising of the sample integrity must be avoided. Emission estimates are different from exposure estimates. Even a well-designed emission measurement cannot representative of ambient conditions. Thus emission estimates are quite different form ambient measurements. Ambient samples do not accurately represent indoor concentrations. Indoor measurements do not necessarily represent concentrations near a person\u2019s breathing zone. Thus, grab samples are often taken, only give a crude estimate of concentrations at a speci\ufb01c place and time. They do not give a precise or accurate estimate of the actual or potential exposure to an air pollutant, but they may be a valuable \ufb01rst step. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) frequently updates the methods for measuring the criteria air pollutants (http://www.epa. gov/ttnamti1/\ufb01les/ambient/criteria/reference-equivalent methods-list.pdf). The methods for measuring ambient concentrations of speci\ufb01ed air pollutants are referred to as \u201creference methods\u201d or \u201cequivalent methods\u201d.2 Each method listed is considered to be an acceptable approach, subject to limitations (e.g. operating range or temperature range) speci\ufb01ed in the applicable designation to be used by state and local air quality surveillance systems, unless the applicable designation is subsequently canceled. Automated methods for pollutants other than PM10 are acceptable only if sheltered at temperatures between 20 and 30 C, with line voltages between 105 and 125 V unless otherwise are speci\ufb01ed in the method description. New analyzers or PM10 samplers that are sold as reference or equivalent methods must carry a label or sticker identifying them as designated methods.", "For analyzers or PM10 or samplers sold prior to the designation of a method with the same or similar model number, the model number does not necessarily identify an analyzer or sampler as a designated method.3 25.1.1 Ambient Sampling System Con\ufb01guration The principal requirement of an ambient air sampling system is to obtain a sample that is representative of the atmosphere at a particular place and time and that can be evaluated as a mass or volume concentration.4 The sampling system must minimize its intrusiveness, i.e. the sampling process itself must avoid introducing error and sampling apparatus should not alter the chemical or physical characteristics of the sample in an undesirable manner. The major components of most sampling systems are an inlet manifold, an air mover, a collection medium, and a \ufb02ow measurement device. The inlet manifold transports material from the ambient atmosphere to the collection medium or analytical device, preferably in an unaltered condition. The inlet opening may be designed for a speci\ufb01c purpose. All inlets for ambient sampling must be rainproof. Inlet manifolds are made out of glass, Te\ufb02on, stainless steel, or other relatively unreactive materials and permit the remaining components of the system to be located at a distance from the sample manifold inlet. The air mover provides the force to create a vacuum or lower pressure at the end of the sampling system. In most instances, air movers are pumps. The collection medium for a sampling system may be a liquid or solid sorbent for dissolving gases, a \ufb01lter surface for collecting particles, or a chamber to contain an aliquot of air for analysis. The \ufb02ow device measures the volume of air associated with the sampling system. Examples of \ufb02ow devices are mass \ufb02ow meters, rotameters, and critical ori\ufb01ces. Air sampling systems can take several forms and may not necessarily have all four components (Figure 25.3). Figure 25.3(A) is typical of many extractive sampling techniques in practice, e.g. SO2 in liquid sorbents and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons on solid sorbents. Figure 25.3(B) is used for \u201copen-face\u201d \ufb01lter collection, V.

Figure 25.3(C) is an evacuated container used to collect an aliquot of air or gas to be transported to the laboratory for chemical analysis; e.g. polished stainless steel canisters are used to collect ambient hydrocarbons for air toxic analysis. Figure 25.3(D) is the basis for many of the automated continuous analyzers, which combine the sampling and analytical processes in one piece of equipment, e.g. continuous ambient air monitors for SO2,O3, and NOx. For any of any sampling system con\ufb01guration or the speci\ufb01c material sampled, several characteristics are important for all ambient air sampling systems. These are collection ef\ufb01ciency, sample stability, recovery, minimal interference, and an understanding of the mechanism of collection. Ideally, the \ufb01rst three would be 100% and there would be no interference or change in the material when collected. One example of these factors is demonstrated when sampling for sulfur dioxide (SO2). Liquid sorbents for SO2 depend on the solubility of SO2 in the liquid collection medium. Certain liquids at the correct pH are capable of removing ambient concentrations of SO2 with 100% ef\ufb01ciency until the characteristics of the solution are altered so that no more SO2 may be dissolved in the volume of liquid provided. Under these circumstances, sampling is 100% ef\ufb01cient for a limited total mass of SO2 transferred to the solution, and the techniqueisacceptableaslong assampling does not continue beyond the time that the sampling solution is saturated.4 A second example is the use of solid sorbents such as Tenax for volatile hydrocarbons by the physical adsorption of the individual hydrocarbon molecules on active sites of the sorbent.5 Collection ef\ufb01ciency drops drastically when the active sites become saturated. Sample stability becomes increasingly important with increasing length of time between sampling and analysis (see Discussion Box: Air Quality Sampling in the Gulf of Mexico). Effects of temperature, trace contaminants, and chemical reactions can cause the collected species to be lost from the collection medium or to undergo a transformation that will prevent its recovery. Nearly 100% recovery is also required because a variable recovery rate will prevent quanti\ufb01cation of the analysis. Interference should be minimal and, if present, well understood.", "AIR SAMPLING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO The Deepwater Horizon incident oil spill occurred about 52 mi southeast of Venice, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana (28.73667 N, 88.38722 W).6 The source was a leaking production well and a release of diesel fuel caused by damage from the sinking of the Transocean Deepwater Horizon drill rig at British Petroleum (BP) Canyon 252. Oil leaked from the spill was transported by wind and wave action. Although most of the publicity and concern following the Deepwater Horizon Incident off the coast of Louisiana had to do with water and beach contamination, the risks from airborne pollutants also had to be addressed. The Dallas Regional Of\ufb01ce of the U.S. EPA conducted air sampling and air monitoring following the near Venice, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. The airborne spectral photometric environmental collection technology (ASPECT) airborne monitoring system be prepared to deploy to collect data regarding emissions and release tracking. The goal of this mission is to collect data over (Continued ) V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS AIR SAMPLING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO (cont\u2019d) the source area (sunken rig) to establish a chemical \ufb01ngerprint of the release source, collect data over the site of an in situ burn of contained oil to provide information on burn effectiveness, and a higher altitude photo reconnaissance to cover a broader area of the oil release. The air monitoring and sampling were needed to con\ufb01rm the presence of \ufb01ne particulates (2.5 mm and smaller) and vapors, i.e. volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hydrogen sul\ufb01de (H2S) and carbon monoxide (CO) in air resulting from the off shore oil release and the in situ burning of the oil on the Gulf of Mexico. The data were needed to evaluate the potential impact from inhalation by people responding to the spill and citizens living in the area affected by air quality impacts from the spill. Given the chemical makeup of crude oil, aromatic organic compounds would likely make up the chemical plume in the atmosphere. The plume can be represented by a simple substituted benzene, i.e. toluene, benzene with a single methyl group (C7H8). The Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR) recommendedtheAcuteExposureGuidanceLevelof200 partsper million (ppm) toluene for an 8-h average to be a conservative, public health action level. As a screening level for occupancy, the ATSDR recommended using EPA\u2019s Reference Concentration of (RFC) equivalent, i.e. 1 ppm toluene. The RFC is based on a subchronic human occupational study that matches the projected exposure duration.7 Exposure duration is very dif\ufb01cult to predict in a disaster, especially one like the Gulf spill, where numerous efforts at capping the spill were unsuccessful and with each failure, the prospects of longer exposures increased. Aromatic organic compounds are present as both aerosols and vapor phase. Given the characteristic of the crude oil (e.g. no polyaromatic hydrocarbons and no paraf\ufb01ns), most of the constituents would be expected to be alkanes. Thus, ATSDR recommended using the Department of Energy\u2019s Temporary Emergency Exposure Limit (TEEL-0) of 50 ppm for a 1-h average as an action level for considering protective measures for VOCs in air. As a screening level for occupancy, ATSDR recommended the chronic inhalation minimum risk level (MRL) of 0.6 ppm for n-hexane. The MRL is based on human occupational studies with an uncertainty factor of 100. The actual plume was likely a ASPECT \u00bcairborne spectral photometric environmental collection technology; EDD \u00bc electronic data delivery; GIS \u00bc geographic information system; RAT \u00bcrapid assessment tool; TAGA \u00bc trace atmospheric gas analyzer.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION AIR SAMPLING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO (cont\u2019d) mixture, so the most representative sampling method could be considered to be a broad spectrum real-time air monitoring device for total organic compounds. A reading above 50 ppm was deemed to indicate the need for protective 8 measures. One of the options for handling spilled crude oil involved combustion in place, i.e. in situ burning. When burning, the ATSDR recommended using of the action levels of PM2.5 and PM10 under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), i.e. 35 and 150 mgm3, respectively, would be considered safe. Concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 approaching the Clean Air Act (CAA) Signi\ufb01cant Harm Level of 350 and 600 mgm3, respectively, warranted the potential needed for protective measures to reduce exposure.", "8 The U.S. EPA obtained atmospheric measurements using the ASPECT, which provides photographic and infrared imagery, along with chemical, geospatial and radiological data at nearly real-time.9 The air pollutant suite of sensors is mounted in a twin engine aircraft and uses the principles of remote passive infrared detection to image, map, identify, and quantify chemical vapors and plumes. The one-half mile wide infrared imager coupled high-speed spectrometry allowed plume measurements to be taken at a rate of about two square miles per minute.9 The data gathered from the air pollutant sensor suite were processed according to the work\ufb02ow in Figure 25.4. This consisted of real-time monitoring; sampling and analytical data gathering; trace atmospheric gas analyzer (TAGA) results; geographic information system (GIS) data; and aerial photography. In addition to the aircraft sensors, atmospheric pollution from the spill was measured at stationary monitoring sites (Figure 25.5). Air quality samples were collected using portable high-level screening monitors and from portable particle pollution monitors for total VOCs, hydrogen sul\ufb01de (H2S), and PM10. In addition canisters and cartridges were used to collect air samples. These samples provided measurements of VOCs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .10 Near the spill site, the lower layer of the atmosphere (from the surface to about 600 m) effectively trapped most of the air pollutants emitted from the surface. Thus, organic compounds from the spill and the products of their atmospheric chemical processing were present in the atmosphere (Table 25.1). Directly downwind from the spill site, aromatic compounds increasedcomparedtoupwindreadings(benzeneand toluene) measurements were twice those for a polluted city (e.g. maximum observed concentrations in Los Angeles). Most of the results for organic compounds were below 20 ppb (by volume). The chemical constituency of these particles was mainly organic compounds (similar to U.S. cities with large emissions from motor vehicles). These types of comparisons are common in environmental sciences and are known as benchmarks. The highest concentrations of PM10 were approximately 25 mgm 3. The highest concentrations of ozone were about 80 ppb (by volume). Most of the organic contamination was con\ufb01ned to a relatively narrow plume (<20 km wide) emitted by the spill site.11 V.

Source: Ref. 11. 25.2 GASES AND VAPORS Airborne contaminants may be found either in the gas phase or as components of a particle. The gas phase air pollutants include both the criteria pollutants and air toxics. The two major goals of testing for air pollutants are identi\ufb01cation and quanti\ufb01cation of a sample of ambient air. Air pollution measurement techniques generally pass through evolutionary stages. The \ufb01rst is the qualitative identi\ufb01cation stage.", "This is followed by separate collection and quanti\ufb01cation stages. The last stage is the concurrent collection and quanti\ufb01cation of a given pollutant. For example, the early procedures detected the presence of SO2 in ambient air by exposing a lead peroxide candle for a period of time and then measuring the amount of lead sulfate formed. Because the volume of air in contact with the candle was not measured, the technique could not quantify the amount of SO2 per unit volume of air. The next stage in the evolution of SO2 measurement was to pass a known volume of ambient air through an absorbing solution in a container in the \ufb01eld and then returning this container to the laboratory for a quantitative determination of the amount of absorbed SO2.The United Nations Environmental ProgrameWorld Health Organization\u2019s worldwide air sampling and analysis network used this method for SO2,the only gaseous pollutant measured by the network. The \ufb01nal evolutionary step has been the concurrent collection and quanti\ufb01cation of SO2. An example of this is the \ufb02ame photometric SO2 analyzer, in which SO2-laden air is fed into an H2 \ufb02ame, and light emissions from electronically excited combustion products are detected by a photomultiplier tube. Prior calibration of the analyzer permits the rapid determination of SO2. This is but one of the many methods available for the measurement of SO2. In the United States, the reference method for detecting SO2 in the ambient air is known as the pararosaniline method, which is describedindetailinSection 25.2.1.6.4 of this chapter.

V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS 25.2.1 Gas and Vapor Phase Measurement Methods Gaseous pollutants are generally collected by the sampling systems shown in Figure 25.3. The sampling manifold\u2019s only function is to transport the gas from the manifold inlet to the collection medium in an unaltered state. The manifold must be made of nonreactive material. Tests of material for manifold construction can be made for speci\ufb01c gases to be sampled.", "In most cases, glass or Te\ufb02on will not adsorb or react with the gases. No condensation should be allowed to occur in t0 Length of sampling tube the sampling manifold. The volume of the manifold and the sampling \ufb02ow rate determine the time required for the gas to move from the inlet to the collection medium. This residence time can be minimized to decrease the loss of reactive species in the manifold by keeping the manifold as short as possible. The collection medium for gases can be liquid or solid sorbents, an evacuated \ufb02ask, or a cryogenic trap. Liquid collection systems take the form of bubblers which are designed to maximize the gaseliquid interface. Each design is an attempt to optimize gas \ufb02ow rate and collection ef\ufb01ciency. Higher \ufb02ow rates permit shorter sampling times. However, excessive \ufb02ow rates cause the collection ef\ufb01ciency to drop below 100%. 25.2.1.1 Extractive Sampling When bubbler systems are used for collection, the gaseous species generally undergoes hydration or reaction with water to form anions or cations. For example, when SO2 and NH3 are absorbed in bubblers they form HSO3 and NHO\u00fe4 , and the analytical techniques for measurement actually detect these ions. Table 25.3 gives examples of gases which may be sampled with bubbler systems. Bubblers are more often utilized for sampling programs that do not require a large number of samples or frequent sampling. The advantages of these types of sampling systems are low cost and portability. The disadvantages are the high degree of skill and careful handling needed to ensure quality results. Solid sorbents such as Tenax, XAD, and activated carbon (charcoal) are used to sample hydrocarbon gases by trapping the species on the active sites of the surface of the sorbent. Figure 25.6 illustrates the loading of active sites with increasing sample time. It is critical that the breakthrough sampling volume, the amount of air passing through the tube that saturates its absorptive capacity, not be exceeded. The breakthrough volume is dependent on the concentration of the gas being sampled and the absorptive capacity of the sorbent. This means that the user must have an estimate of the upper limit of concentration for the gas being sampled. After the sample has been collected on the solid sorbent, the tube is sealed and transported to the analytical laboratory. To recover the sorbed gas, two techniques may be used. The tube may be heated while an inert gas is \ufb02owing through it. At a suf\ufb01ciently high temperature, the absorbed molecules are desorbed and carried out of the tube with the inert gas stream. The gas stream may then be passed through a preconcentration trap for injection into a gas chromatograph for chemical analysis. The second technique is liquid extraction of the sorbent and subsequent liquid chromatography. Sometimes a derivatization step is necessary to convert the collected material chemically into compounds which will pass through the column more easily, e.g. conversion of carboxylic acids to methyl esters. Solid sorbents have increased our ability to measure hydrocarbon species under a variety of \ufb01eld conditions. However, this technique requires great skill and sophisticated equipment to obtain accurate results. Care must be taken to minimize problems of contamination of the collection medium, sample instability on the sorbent and incomplete recovery of the sorbed gases. Special techniques are employed to sample for gases and particulate matter simultaneously.12 Sampling systems have been developed which permit the removal of gas-phase molecules from a moving airstream by diffusion to a coated surface and permit the passage of particulate matter downstream for collection on a \ufb01lter or other medium. These diffusion denuders are used to sample for SO2 or acid gases in the presence of particulate matter. This type of sampling has been developed to minimize the interference of gases in particulate sampling and vice versa. The third technique, shown in Figure 25.3(C),involves collection of an aliquot of air in its gaseous state for transport back to the analytical laboratory. Use of a pre-evacuated \ufb02ask permits the collection of a gas V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.2 GASES AND VAPORS V.

By use of pressureevolume relationships, it is possible to remove a known volume from the tank for subsequent chemical analysis. Another means of collecting gaseous samples is the collapsible bag. Bags made of polymer \ufb01lms can be used for collection and transport of samples. The air may be pumped into the bag by an inert pump such as one using \ufb02exible metal bellows, or the air may be sucked into the bag by placing the bag in an airtight container which is then evacuated. This forces the bag to expand, drawing in the ambient air sample. Most air pollutants are sampled by obtaining a known amount of air in a container. For vapor-phase compounds, the containers are either a canister or bag. Depending on how long it takes to \ufb01ll the container, this technique provides a prolonged snapshot of an air pollutant\u2019s concentration. That is, the sample is not a point, but is a time interval. For example, if a valve allows air to enter on a 6-l canister at a rate of 0.5 l min 1, the canister will be full in 12 min. Thus, if the sample begins at 5:00 p.m. on Monday, it will be full at 5:12 p.m. that day. If the concentration of 1-3-butadiene is found to be 10 mg m 3, that is the concentration at that location integrated over that 12 min period during rush hour. If only a few cans are available, but a longer time is needed, e.g. 1 h during the highest traf\ufb01c, the valve may be adjusted to a lower \ufb02ow rate, so that the canister \ufb01lls 5 times more slowly, i.e. 0.1 l min 1, and the concentration is integrated over the entire hour.", "If the concentrations in the 12-min canister are 10 mg m 3, but the 1-h canister is found to be 25 mg m 3 for the same compound at the same location, this could indicate that traf\ufb01c is higher after 5:12 p.m., or that a particular source (e.g. poorly maintained trucks) may appear later. Then again, this could be an anomalous event (one large source happened to pass by the sampler). For example, if three other similar sites \ufb01nd little difference between the 12-min and 1-h integration times, the site with the difference would probably need a few more comparisons. Finding the optimal sampling interval and the appropriate sampling locations depends on comparisons such as these. Canisters and bags can be \ufb01lled two ways. In the example above, the air in the canister had been removed and the empty canister\u2019s vacuum, pulled in the air, since \ufb02uids \ufb02ow from higher to lower pressure. The canister or bag can then be returned to the laboratory whereupon the analyst removes small amounts of the contents into detectors. Air pollution studies make wide use of evacuated stainless steel canisters with electropolished inner surfaces,13 knownasSumma canisters(Figure 25.7). The electropolishing and chemical deactivation yields an internal surface with very low chemical reactivity. These canisters are employed to sample for vapors, especially VOCs.14 The VOCs sampled with Summa canisters consist of both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, including halogenated forms.15 Several of these are shown in Table 25.4. This technique has also been applied to a variety of practical applications, such as indoor air quality problems. Canisters are cleaned and evacuated, so that the lower pressure inside the canister allows air to enter without the need for a sampling pump. Many air pollutants are chemically reactive and may combine with chemicals on the surfaces inside of collection systems. Thus, stainless steel canisters are now often coated with relatively inert substances, especially fused silica, which allows them to be stored longer prior to chemical analysis.a When the canister is delivered to a The same considerations need to be made for other air pollutant container, e.g. selecting a collection bag must consider the rate of degradation induced by the compounds that will be stored in the bag.

Several canisters can be used to provide a map of air pollution. The number of canisters per unit area is known as the sampling density. Highly reactive contaminants with short half-lives may require greater sampling density than less reactive pollutants, since the former may breakdown in relatively short distances from their sources. The amount of time that a sample can be stored in a container varies by the type of compounds and the container. For example, the U.S. EPA recommends that VOCs not be held in a Summa canister for more than 14 days from collection and 12 days from the receipt at the laboratory. In tedlar bags, the holding times are much shorter, i.e. 40 h form collection and 36 h from receipt by the laboratory. Also, the conditions of storage are usually speci\ufb01ed. For VOCs, both bags and canisters can be preserved at ambient temperatures and near atmospheric pressure. However, for some highly reactive compounds, refrigeration, and other preservation techniques will be required. 25.2.1.2 In Situ Sampling and Analysis The fourth sampling technique involves a combination of sampling and analysis. The analytical technique is incorporated in a continuous monitoring instrument placed at the sampling location.", "Most often, the monitoring equipment is located inside a shelter such as a trailer or a small building, with the ambient air drawn to the monitor through a sampling manifold. The monitor then extracts a small fraction of air from the manifold for analysis by an automated technique, which may be continuous or discrete. Instrument manufacturers have developed automated in situ monitors for several air pollutants, including SO2, NO, NO2,O3, and CO. This approach is also being increasingly applied for organic pollutants. For example, real-time GC-MS are being used to monitoring a wide range of organic compounds, including air toxics. Continuous emission monitoring (CEM) is an important type of combined real-time sampling. Indeed, it is increasingly used in the source applications discussed in Chapter 24. Regulatory agencies are increasingly requiring enhanced and periodic measurements to ensure compliance with emission standards for speci\ufb01c pollutants. In the United States, these are known as the \u201ccompliance assurance monitoring (CAM) rule\u201d. The rule is designed to ensure proper operation of air pollution control equipment. The CAM rule has two general means of compliance: direct and indirect. Direct compliance assurance can be accomplished using CEM. Indirect compliance assurance is based on measurements of key parameters related to how well the equipment V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.2 GASES AND VAPORS is operating (e.g. temperature, \ufb02ow, pressure drop, voltage changes).16 The CAA requires CEM for large sources and sources that must be monitoring under New Source Review (see Chapter 3). The CEM is an integrated system that collects samples directly from the stack or other air pollutant conveyance to the atmosphere. The system consists of the equipment needed to determine a pollutant\u2019s concentration or emission rate. The system components shown in Figure 25.8 are: (1) the sampling and conditioning system; (2) chemical analyzers; (3) the data acquisition system (DAS); and (4) the controller system. In addition to measuring various gas and particulate phase pollutant, CEM also is used for opacity, and volumetric \ufb02ow rates. There are two basic types of CEMS: extractive and in situ. The monitor and analyzers of an in situ CEM are located within the stack. Extractive CEM systems capture a sample from within a stack, condition the sample (e.g. remove moisture and impurities) and move the sample to the analyzer. As shown in Figure 25.8, point measurements measure pollutant concentrations at a single precise point where the sampling cell is located, whereas path measurements are taken across a given path in the emissions stream. Path readings are often from a signal across the stack and re\ufb02ecting it back to a detector near the source of the signal. The measured concentrations crossing that path are averaged over a given period of time. Numerous gaseous compounds are being sampled with CEM, including NOx,SO2, CO, CO2,O2, total hydrocarbons, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This concept also applied outside of the stack. For example, several open-path, continuous monitoring methods are being used successfully for a wide range of pollutants in the ambient air. These are discussed later in this chapter. 25.2.1.3 Passive Sampling Systems Passive or static sampling systems are those that do not have an active air-moving component, such as the pump, to pull a sample to the collection medium. This type of sampling system has been used for over 100 years. Examples include the lead peroxide candle used to detect the presence of SO2 in the atmosphere and the dust fall bucket and trays or slides coated with a viscous material used to detect particulate matter. This type of system suffers from inability to quantify the amount of pollutant present over a short period of time, i.e. less than 1 week. The potentially desirable characteristics of a static sampling system have led to further developments in this type of technology to provide quantitative information on pollutant concentrations over a \ufb01xed period of time. Static sampling systems have been developed for use in the occupational environment and are also used to measure the exposure levels in the general community, e.g. radon gas in residences. Generally, passive systems apply to gases and vapors, since particles are assumed not to diffuse. The advantages of static sampling systems are their portability, convenience, reliability, and low cost. The systems are lightweight and can be attached directly to individuals. Nonstatic sampling systems can, of course, also be attached to individuals, but are less convenient because the person must carry a battery-powered pump and its batteries. Static sampling systems are very reliable, and the materials used limit the costs to acceptable levels.", "Two principles are utilized in the design of static samplers: diffusion and permeation.17,18 Since most of the atmosphere consists of molecular nitrogen and oxygen, samplers applying the diffusion principle depend on the molecular interactions of N2,O2, and the trace pollutant gases of interest. If a concentration gradient can be established for the trace pollutant gas, under certain conditions the movement of the gas will be proportional to the concentration gradient (Fick\u2019s law of diffusion), and a sampler can be designed to take advantage of this technique. Figure 25.9 illustrates this principle. The sampler has a well-de\ufb01ned inlet, generally with a cylindrical shape, through which the pollutant gas must diffuse. At the end of the tube, a collection medium Solid sorbent (charcoal) Well-defined diffusion tube V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS removes the pollutant gas for subsequent analysis and maintains a concentration gradient between the inlet of the tube and the collection medium. The mathematical relationship (Fick\u2019s law) describing this type of passive sampler is given by: &#1; &#3; dC R \u00bc DA dx (25.1) where, R is the rate of transport by diffusion in moles per second, D is the diffusion coef\ufb01cient in square centimeters per second, A is the cross-sectional area of the diffusion path in square centimeters, C is the concentration of species in moles per cubic centimeter, and x is the path length in centimeters. The ability of gases to permeate through various polymers at a \ufb01xed rate depending on a concentration gradient has been used to create static samplers. This principle was originally developed to provide a standard calibration source of trace gas by putting that gas in a polymer tube under pressure and letting the material diffuse or permeate through the wall to the open atmosphere. Permeation samplers operate in the reverse direction. Figure 25.10 illustrates this type of system. A thin \ufb01lm membrane is open to the atmosphere on one side and to a collection medium on the other. A pollutant gas in the atmosphere diffuses through the membrane and is collected in the medium. The mathematical relationship for a permeation sampler is given by: &#1;&#3; Ct k \u00bc (25.2) m where k is the permeation constant, C is the concentration of gas in parts per million, t is the time of exposure, and m is the amount of gas absorbed in micrograms. Permeation systems (Figure 25.10) can be calibrated in the laboratory and then used in the \ufb01eld for sample Solid sorbent Thin membrane collection for a \ufb01xed period of time, e.g. 8 h or 7 days. The sampler is returned to the laboratory for analysis. These systems can be made for speci\ufb01c compounds by selecting the appropriate collection medium and the polymer membrane (Table 25.5). 25.2.1.4 Open-Path Technologies for Gas-Phase Air Pollutants A number of open-path technologies are being used to detect and quantify air pollution in the ambient air. These include tunable lasers, differential absorption techniques, and Fourier transform approaches. The tunable diode laser (TDL) provides real-time concentration measurements for several air pollutants (Table 25.6). The TDL requires only minimal maintenance and no consumables, and is user friendly (e.g. not sensitive to common vibration levels, minimal drift, frequent calibration unnecessary, immune to ambient relative humidity and temperature changes and laser intensity \ufb02uctuations, no sample preconditioning or treatment required before analysis, simple \ufb01eld deployment TABLE 25.5 Permeation Samplers for Selected Gases Gas Membrane Sorber Sensitivity Chlorine Dimethyl silicone (DMS) Buffered (pH 7) \ufb02uorescein, 0.013 ppm (8-h exposure) (single-backed) 0.005% NaBr (0.31%) Sulfur dioxide DMS (single-backed) Tetrachloromercurate (II) 0.01 ppm (8-h exposure) Vinyl chloride DMS (single-backed) Activated charcoal (CS2 desorption) 0.02 ppm (Linear to 50 ppm \u00fe) Alkyl lead DMS (unbacked) Silica gel (ICl desorption) 0.2 mg Benzene Silicon polycarbonate Activated charcoal (CS2 0.02 ppm (8-h exposure) desorption) Ammonia Vinyl silicone 0.6% Boric acid 0.4 ppm (8-h exposure) Hydrogen sul\ufb01de DMS (single-backed) 0.02 N NaOH, 0.003 M EDTA 0.01 ppm Hydrogen cyanide DMS (single-backed) 0.01 N NaOH 0.01 ppm (8-h exposure) Source: Ref. 18.

The system can handle long open paths and provides high temporal resolution, and includes a stable multipass optical cell, which is highly sensitive. Temperature and pressure controls are internal. The drawbacks of TDL are that it can only detect a single compound per laser. It is limited in the number of detectable compounds. Indeed, sensitivity is limited to those compounds with overtone absorbencies in the near-to mid-infrared range. Particulate matter and airborne objects interfere with the path.19 Differential absorption lidar (DIAL) is used to detect concentrations of gases within a transect in the atmosphere. Lidar is an acronym for light detection and ranging, and the technique is used for measuring physical characteristics of the atmosphere.20 DIAL measurements consist of probing the atmosphere with pulsed laser radiation at two wavelengths. One wavelength is ef\ufb01ciently absorbed by the trace gas, and the other wavelength is less ef\ufb01ciently absorbed. The radiation source projects packets of energy through the atmosphere, which interact with the trace gas. The optical receiver collects radiation backscattered from the target. By controlling the timing of source pulses and processing of the optical receiver signal, one can determine the concentration of the trace gas over various distances from the analyzer. This capability permits three-dimensional mapping of pollutant concentrations. Applications are plume dispersion patterns and three-dimensional gaseous pollutant pro\ufb01les in urban areas. The DIAL system provides spatially resolved pollutant concentration in two dimensions, in a relatively short period of time. They are deployable in many different applications and con\ufb01gurations, and are quite portable. The path lengths are generally between 1 and 3 km, but can be of varying lengths. For example, near a facility\u2019s fence line, the paths may be shorter to determine differences in concentrations at various directions from the source and under different wind directions. Numerous air pollutants are detected with DIAL. SO2 and O3 are detected by an ultraviolet DIAL system operating at wavelengths near 300 nm.21 Tunable infrared CO2 lasers are used in applications of IR-DIAL systems (Figure 25.11) which are capable of measuring a number of gases, 22 including SO2, CO, hydrochloric acid (HCl), methane (CH4), CO2,H2O, nitrous oxide (N2O), ammonia (NH3), and hydrogen sul\ufb01de (H2S). The number of air toxics measured by DIAL is increasing (see Table 25.7).19 The components of this type of system are shown in Figure 25.12. The laser source is TABLE 25.7 Air Toxics Detected Using Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) Species Measured by Concentration Maximum DIAL Sensitivity Range Benzene 10 ppb 800 m Sulfur dioxide 10 ppb 3 km Toluene 10 ppb 800 m Ethane 20 ppb 800 m Ethylene 10 ppb 800 m Methane 50 ppb 1 km General hydrocarbons 40 ppb 800 m Hydrogen chloride 20 ppb 1 km Methanol 200 ppb 500 m Notes: Concentration sensitivities for measurements of a 50 m wide plume at a range of 200 m, under typical meteorological conditions (from National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Middlesex, UK).

Ographic arget Scattered radiation switched between the low-absorption and high-absorption frequencies for the trace gas to be detected.23 The system is pointed toward a target, and focusing lenses are used to collect the returning signal. The beam splitter diverts a portion of the transmitted beam to a detector. The backscattered and transmitted pulses are integrated to yield direct current electrical signals. Examples of lidar readings for toluene and SO2 are shown in Figures 25.12 and 25.13, respectively. The DIAL system is limited to those chemical species with the unique chemical properties required to be detected.", "For example, only a few wavelengths are FIGURE 25.12 Screenshot from lidar system, showing the backscatter signal of a pair of wavelengths used to measure toluene.

Often, spectral artifacts appear at the same energy spectrum as the pollutant of concern, but the speci\ufb01c chemical causing the interference cannot be identi\ufb01ed.19 This could lead to positive bias (i.e. the peak will be higher than the peak that would have been present if only the pollutant of concern were present). The reported concentration is the maximum concentration detected in a cell in the measurement plane. The path is one-dimensional, but the measurement plane is two dimensional. Thus, the resolution of the planes can be calculated from the DIAL system resolution. For example, if the path is 3.75 m, each cell is 3.75 m square. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.2 GASES AND VAPORS 2.1200702.1096. Figure 25.14 shows how the emission rate can be calculated from DIAL readings. The concentration assigned to each cell is multiplied by the perpendicular wind \ufb01eld determined for that cell. The individual emission rates are summed to give the total emission rate through the plane. This \ufb01gure shows two hypothetical plume calculations, i.e. the one to the left has a small plume cross-section, and therefore a small integrated emission rate, and one to the right has a larger plume cross-section, and therefore represents a larger emissions rate. Note that the peak concentration in both is similar, and indeed may even be higher in the small plume then the large plume, but the angle of the path dilutes the concentration. Other widely used open-path technologies are the open-path infrared (IR) and differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS). Open-path technologies take advantage of energyemolecule relationships. For example, the vibrational frequencies of all the IR absorbing molecules in the IR beam path are captured in the IR spectrum. Likewise, vibrational frequencies Wind direction Plume FIGURE 25.14 Two hypothetical plume cross-sections used for concentration calculations, i.e. the one to the left has a small plume cross-section, and therefore a small integrated emission rate, and one to the right has a larger plume cross-section, and therefore represents a larger emissions rate.

METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS of all the ultraviolet (UV) absorbing molecules in the UV beam path are captured in the UV spectrum, and so on. When a molecule absorbs light, the energy of the molecule is increased and the molecule is promoted from its lowest energy state (ground state) to an excited state. Light energy in a speci\ufb01c wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum stimulates molecular vibrations. Molecular species display their own characteristic vibrational structure when stimulated by that speci\ufb01c wavelength region of radiation. Figure 25.15 provides an example of the IR absorption spectra for nitrous oxide, CO2, CO, NO, NO2, and NH3. Vibrational frequency is represented by wave number, and the wave number and vibrational structure identify a particular molecule. The open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy is quite versatile in that it is able to quantify many chemicals in air simultaneously, whereas most open-path systems must be tuned to a speci\ufb01c compound (Figure 25.16). OP-FTIR detects numerous compounds in the low ppb range. FTIR provides mean concentrations over designated path lengths. TDLs have similar detection limits as FTIR, but are an example of a compound-speci\ufb01c open-path approach, or at least are restricted to detecting chemicals that respond to the small frequency range they operate in. Like FTIR, open-path Raman spectroscopy can quantify many chemicals and may achieve low detection limits; however, its weak signal diminishes resolution.", "However, relative humidity is a major interference of FTIR but not for Raman, so Raman is likely preferred in high moisture conditions.24 The BeereLambert Law states that for a constant path length, the intensity of the incident, i.e. direct, light energy traversing an absorbing medium diminishes exponentially with concentration, i.e. energy absorption is proportional to chemical concentration: A \u00bc eb\u00bdC (25.3) where, A is the absorbency of the molecule, e is the molar absorptivity (proportionality constant for the molecule), b is the light\u2019s path length, and [C] is the chemical concentration of the molecule. Thus, the concentration of the chemical can be ascertained by measuring the light V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.2 GASES AND VAPORS FIGURE 25.17 Schematic of an open-path air measurement device: differential optical adsorption spectrometer (DOAS), which measures the absorption through an atmospheric path (typically 0.5e1.5 km) of two closely spaced wavelengths of light from an arti\ufb01cial source. One wavelength is chosen to match an absorption line of the speci\ufb01c compound of interest, and the other is near that line to account for atmospheric effects (EPA/600/P-93/004 aF, pp. 3e98). The term absorption line is used to mean a wavelength that a given atom or molecule absorbs more than it does other wavelengths. For example, if ozone is the compound of interest, a wavelength would be identi\ufb01ed which ozone absorbs more than other wavelengths. As in other open-path systems (e.g. FTIR) a beam of electromagnetic radiation (in this case, visible or ultraviolet light) containing this particular wavelength is directed at a segment (open path) of the atmosphere, and the amount of the wavelength absorbed would be measured and calibrated against a known concentration of the compound of interest.

The FTIR instrument measures intensity in the IR spectrum; and applies the intensity signature of the returning incident spectrum, along with Beer\u2019s law, to identify and quantify compounds. Like other open-path systems, FTIR measurements can be made actively or passively, i.e. respectively, providing its own energy or receiving it externally. In the active mode, an instrument focuses a light beam before passing it through an interferometer, which converts the light beam into a modulated signal as a function of optical path difference. When the beams are recombined, certain wavelengths recombine constructively and some destructively, which creates an interference pattern, which is called an interferogram.1 The recombined IR beam then passes from the beam-splitter into the open path where a portion of the IR energy is absorbed by the gaseous compounds to be measured. The resulting IR beam reaches the IR detector where the interference pattern is detected, digitized, and transformed mathematically into a standard single beam infrared frequency spectrum using a mathematical algorithm known as a Fourier transform. The encoded light beam passes from the sending optics across the transect being measured for contaminants (i.e. the open path), then back to receiving optics and onto a detector. The detector then records the signal and mathematically derives the concentration using a Fourier transform technique. This produces a spectrum, such as the one depicted in Figure 25.15, which can be used to identify speci\ufb01c contaminants and their concentrations. The passive mode works in the same manner as the active mode, but uses no sending unit. Rather, the instrument uses an external energy source (e.g. the sun or combustion gases) to provide the infrared light. Receiving optics focus the light into the interferometer that encodes them into an interferogram format. This is then directed onto a detector for recording. As with the active approach, the detector then records the signal and mathematically derives the concentration using a Fourier transform technique to quantify the concentrations of the pollutants. The DOAS system (Figure 25.17) quanti\ufb01es concentrations of gaseous compounds by measuring the absorption of light by chemical compounds in the air, again, by applying the BeereLambert law. However, the wavelength is in the higher frequency wavelengths, i.e. the visible, and often in the ultraviolet (UV) range, i.e. UV-DOAS. A positive attribute of the UV-DOAS is its extremely long path-length capabilitydtypically 500 m with some research applications up to 10 km.25 The UV-DOAS is most frequently used to measure or monitor criteria and smog-related air pollutants, and for pollutants that do not produce ideal IR absorption bands. However, because the absorption bands for V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS UV-DOAS are very wide, its speci\ufb01city is limited, i.e. many compounds cannot be accurately quanti\ufb01ed by UV-DOAS.", "In addition, N2 and O2 molecules in the air cause broad spectral scattering and interfere with many of the compounds that can be measured. The UV-DOAS has detection limits in the low (ppb) range, and has reached parts per trillion (ppt) in some research applications when used with optimum measurement path lengths.25 Generally at the UV, visible, and near-IR wavelengths (approximately180e780 nm) changes occur in the energy between the bonding electrons in molecules that absorb the light. The wavelength ranges produced by UV-DOAS include the rotational and vibrational transitions caused by near-IR light, so the typical application of UV-DOAS restricts the UV light to a wavelength range of 245e380 nm. Due to the range of excitations measured, molecular absorption bands tend to be far broader than that of the FTIR systems. Compounds that can be accurately detected and measured with the UV-DOAS must have speci\ufb01c chemical structure characteristics that allow for unique absorption bands. This limits the number of compounds that can be monitored.25 25.2.1.5 Remote-Portable Technologies for Gas-Phase Air Pollutants Generally, the approaches discussed in this section have been and continue to be used effectively to measure numerous gas-phase pollutants. However, the state-of-the-science in measurement continues to grow. Sensors, open-path detectors and other real-time detection systems, e.g. transform infrared, DOAS and tuned lasers, are being used with much success. Also, new materials, particularly nanomaterials, are being applied to environmental sampling and analysis. Remote sensing involves monitoring in which the analyzer is physically removed from the volume of air being analyzed. Satellites have been used to monitor light-scattering aerosol over large areas. 26 Large point sources such as volcanic activity and forest \ufb01res can be tracked by satellite. The development and movement of hazy air masses have been observed by satellite imagery. Remote sensing methods are available for determining the physical structure of the atmosphere with respect to turbulence and temperature pro\ufb01les. Mobile monitoring is accomplished from a movable platform, i.e. a motor vehicle or an aircraft (see Discussion Box: Air Quality Sampling in the Gulf of Mexico). Emissions are measured by source monitoring techniques (Chapter 24). Atmospheric transport and chemical transformation processes occur in the region between the source and the receptor, so mobile forms of air pollution measurement are needed to show variability of pollution concentrations in time and space. By using mobile platforms containing air pollution instrumentation, one can obtain data to help understand the formation and transport of photochemical smog, acidic deposition, and the dispersion of air pollutants from sources. Mobile monitoring platforms may also be moved to \u201chot spots\u201d, i.e. areas suspected of having high concentrations of speci\ufb01c air pollutants. These areas may be nearby locations downwind of a large source or a particular location that is an unfavorable receptor due to meteorological conditions. Vehicular and aircraft monitoring systems can also be moved to locations where hazardous chemical spills, nuclear and chemical plant accidents, or volcanoes or earthquakes have occurred. The major advantage of a mobile monitoring system is its ability to obtain air quality information in the intermediate region between source monitors and stationary \ufb01xed monitors. The major disadvantage is the paucity of suitable instrumentation that operates properly in the mobile platform environment. Limitations of existing instrumentation for the use on movable platforms are inadequate temperature and pressure compensation; incompatible power, size, and weight requirements; and excessive response time. Most movable platforms are helicopters, airplanes, trucks, or vans. These platforms do not provide the relatively constant-temperature environment required by most air quality instrumentation. Equipment mounted in aircraft is subject to large pressure variations with changing altitude. Most instrumentation is designed to operate with alternating current electrical power, whereas relatively low amounts of direct current power are available in aircraft or vans. Space is at a premium, and response times are often too slow to permit observation of rapid changes in concentration as aircraft move in and out of a plume. Despite these limitations, mobile monitoring systems have been used for decades to obtain useful information, such as the veri\ufb01cation and tracking of the St. Louis, Missouri, urban plume. The measurement of a well-de\ufb01ned urban plume spreading northeastward from St. Louis30 is shown in Figure 25.18. These data were collected by a combination of instrumented aircraft and mobile vans. Cross-sectional paths were \ufb02own by the aircraft at increasing distances downwind. Meteorological conditions of low wind speed in the same direction helped to maintain this urban plume in a well-de\ufb01ned condition for several hundred kilometers downwind.", "The presence of large point sources of NO and SO2 was observed by the changes in the O3 and bscat pro\ufb01les. Sharp decreases in ozone concentration occurred when large amounts of NO were present, and rapid increases in bscat were caused by the primary and secondary particulate matter from power plant plumes embedded in the V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.2 GASES AND VAPORS 601 5 FIGURE 25.18 A St. Louis, Missouri, urban plume in the 1970s. Ozone and bscat pro\ufb01les at four 0.15 0.12 4 distances downwind of St. Louis track a detectable 200 urban plume for 150 km. Ref. 27. 3 2 150 100 50 0 Scale (kilometers) larger urban plume. The overall increasing level of ozone and bscat at greater downwind distances was caused by the photochemical reactions as the urban plume was transported farther away from St. Louis. This type of plume mapping can be accomplished only by mobile monitoring systems. Recently, the mobile technologies have improved. For example, the trace ambient gas analyzer includes a portable gas chromatography system. The system has been used to measure various organic compounds in the air, e.g. chlorine dioxide (ClO2) in the ambient air near residences adjacent to a Congressional building in Washington, DC.28 The ClO2 detection limits for this system were 900 ppqv (parts per quadrillion by volume) in real time.b 25.2.1.6 Speci\ufb01c Monitoring Methods for Gas-Phase Criteria Pollutants Although the previous methods for measuring gaseous pollutants are many and varied, regulatory agencies require speci\ufb01c methods to ensure that ambient air quality standards are being met. As mentioned, in many countries there are legal rules designating the type of method. Thus, even if the scienti\ufb01c evidence strongly supports a method, it will not meet regulatory requirements unless it is considered to be a reference b These low detection limits were needed since the action levels for ClO2 are also quite low, i.e. 25 ppbv for 15 min at a location. The action limits must be higher than detection limits to ensure safety, e.g. whether to evacuate a building. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS or equivalent method. Following is a discussion of these methods, but the reader is advised to refer to the regulatory agency rules in a speci\ufb01c jurisdiction prior to citing and using these methods to ensure the method is currently equivalent to the rules of that jurisdiction. The methods listed below are merely the scienti\ufb01c explanation of how the systems under reference and equivalent methods work. The reference methods for countries change as the state of the science of measurement technologies change. However, the use of open path and other continuous systems are also useful for air pollutant detection for criteria pollutants and air toxics. For example, the 1-h SO2 NAAQS was changed in 2010, with the intention of increased protection of public health by reducing exposure to high, short-term SO2 concentrations. This will increase the need for exploratory monitoring conducted with highly time resolved data (i.e. frequency in minutes to hours). As mentioned, continuous methods can show short-term peak SO2 concentrations because of the high time resolution. These peaks would be missed by longer time averaging. Unfortunately, continuous methods have not been very economically or logistically feasible for many situations. However, like many other aspects of society, e.g. smart phones, recent technological advances in sensor and sampling technology are providing more compact and less costly continuous methods. These sensors are not reference or equivalent methods, but will likely be valuable in increasing sampling density in time and space, including exploratory monitoring. Most new sensors use proprietary methods, but are generally electrochemical devices. The accuracy and precision of these sensors will be evaluated, likely be colocation and comparison with reference and equivalent methods in the \ufb01eld.29 In addition, passive methods commonly used in the past for saturation studies are commercially available, easy to use, and are relatively inexpensive. However, passive methods do not resolve the temporal need to see the peaks, since they are integrated samples collected over days to weeks. They can certainly improve the sampling spatial density, e.g. to determine long-term concentration trends, but they do not offer the same insight into where the short-term peak concentrations may be occurring in an area around or otherwise impacted by an air pollutant source.", "Thus, passive methods are not the recommended method of choice for conducting exploratory monitoring to aid in determining where to place source oriented monitors and should be considered as only a complementary or back-up strategy to other methods and approaches to identify criteria and air toxics monitoring sites.30 The length of any exploratory monitoring is determined by 25.2.1.6.1 CARBON MONOXIDE Like all other criteria pollutants, measurement apparatus to detect and quantify carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations consists of three basic systems: pneumatic, analytical, and electronic. The pneumatic system consists of pumps, valves, lines, conduits, \ufb01lters, \ufb02ow meter, and other components to bring the air to the analytical system, which detects physical response (e.g. IR absorbance). The electronic system converts this basic physical and chemical information, e.g. absorbance of light energy, to concentrations for a particular pollutant. The primary reference method used for measuring carbon monoxide in the United States is based on nondispersive infrared (NDIR) photometry.31 The principle involved is the preferential absorption of infrared radiation by carbon monoxide. Figure 25.19 is a schematic representation of an NDIR analyzer. Like the FTIR methods addressed previously, NDIR is based on IR absorption and concentration relationships according to the BeereLambert Law. The analyzer has a hot \ufb01lament source of infrared radiation, a chopper, a sample cell, reference cell, and a detector. The reference cell is \ufb01lled with a noninfrared-absorbing gas, and the sample cell is continuously \ufb02ushed with ambient air containing an unknown amount of CO. The detector cell is divided into two compartments by a \ufb02exible membrane, with each compartment \ufb01lled with CO. Movement of the membrane causes a change in electrical capacitance in a control circuit whose signal is processed and fed to a recorder. Reference Sample source source Chopper Sample Sample Reference cell cell Detector Absorbing molecule Signal the source (e.g. does the facility have peak operating pe- FIGURE 25.19 Nondispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer.

III. New York (NY) Academic Press; 1976. p. 375. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.2 GASES AND VAPORS The chopper intermittently exposes the two cells to infrared radiation. The reference cell is exposed to a constant amount of infrared energy which is transmitted to one compartment of the detector cell. The sample cell, which contains varying amounts of infrared-absorbing CO, transmits to the detector cell a reduced amount of infrared energy that is inversely proportional to the CO concentration in the air sample. The unequal amounts of energy received by the two compartments in the detector cell cause the membrane to move, producing an alternating current (AC) electrical signal whose frequency is established by the chopper spacing and the speed of chopper rotation. The signal is sent to a DAS. The CO instrument needs to be calibrated often, i.e. injecting air with known concentrations of CO into the system and comparing readings. Water vapor absorbs IR, so it is a serious interfering substance in this technique. A moisture trap such as a drying agent or a water vapor condenser is required to remove water vapor from the air to be analyzed. Instruments based on other techniques are available which meet the performance speci\ufb01cations, such as those listed in Table 25.2. Equivalent methods for CO and the other criteria pollutants are published online and updated as new methods are approved.3 25.2.1.6.2 OZONE The principal method used for measuring ozone is based on chemiluminescence.32 When ozone and ethylene react chemically, products are formed which are in an excited electronic state. These products \ufb02uoresce, releasing light. The principal components are a constant source of ethylene, an inlet sample line for ambient air, a reaction chamber, a photomultiplier tube, and signal-processing circuitry. The rate at which light is received by the photomultiplier tube is dependent on the concentrations of O3 and ethylene. If the concentration of ethylene is made much higher than the ozone concentration to be measured, the light emitted is proportional only to the ozone concentration. Instruments based on this principle may be calibrated by a two-step process shown in Figure 25.20.33 A test atmosphere with a known source of ozone is produced by an ozone generator, a device capable of generating stable levels of O3. Step 1 involves establishing the concentration of ozone in the test atmosphere by ultraviolet (UV) photometry.", "This is followed by step 2, calibration of the instrument\u2019s response to the known concentration of ozone in the test atmosphere. The O3 method is presently being investigated for possible improved detection, i.e. the nitric oxide (NO)chemiluminescence ozone analyzer.34 This method is Output manifold Zero air Exhaust Step 1 Step 2 FIGURE 25.20 Two-step calibration apparatus for an ultraviolet (UV) ozone analyzer. based on the dry, gas-phase reaction between NO and O3 generates nitrogen dioxide in an activated state \u00f0NO2\u00de, and molecular oxygen (O2). As the unstable, activated nitrogen dioxide \u00f0NO2\u00de returns to a lower energy state (NO2), it emits a photon (hn) while it luminesces in a broadband spectrum from visible light to infrared light (approximately 590e2800 nm). The two-step gas-phase reaction proceeds as follows: NO \u00fe O3/NO2 \u00fe O2 (25.4) Then, the activated nitrogen dioxide breaks down to nitrogen dioxide and a photon: NO2/NO2 \u00fe hv (25.5) The number of photons emitted during the reaction is directly proportional to the O concentration in the sample. As the gas phase reaction proceeds in the analyzer mixing chamber/reaction cell, the emitted photons are counted by a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The electronics of the analyzer converts the hn count is converted to O concentration, using a mathematical algorithm. In the United States, the NO-chemiluminescence method has been designated as a federal equivalent method (FEM) for ozone, i.e. it meets all of the same performance speci\ufb01cations as the existing federal reference method (FRM), and is comparable to the existing FRM from a measurement perspective. As of 2014, the NO-chemiluminescence devices are becoming increasingly available from vendors. The NO-chemiluminescence method behaves in the same manner as the ethylene (C2H4) chemiluminescence FRM when exposed to the same interferentsc found in ambient air that may have an effect on the response of the widely used ultraviolet-spectrophotometric ozone methods. Also, care must be taken with this method in that NO is toxic in high concentrations, including the concentrations of NO found in an NO cylinder source (asphyxiant). For practical purposes, the US EPA recommends two FRMs for ozone measurement, i.e. both NO-chemiluminescene method and ethylene chemiluminescence. c These interferents are listed, in 40 CFR Part 53, Table B-3 (e.g. H2S, CO2, and H2O). V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS This NO-chemiluminescence method is quite similar to the NO2 method discussed below. 25.2.1.6.3 NITROGEN DIOXIDE The principal method used for measuring NO2 is also based on chemiluminescence (Figure 25.21).35 NO2 concentrations are determined indirectly from the difference between the NO and NOx (NO \u00fe NO2) concentrations in the atmosphere. These concentrations are determined by measuring the light emitted from the chemiluminescent reaction of NO with O3 (similar to the reaction of O3 with ethylene noted for the measurement of O3), except that O3 is supplied at a high constant concentration, and the light output is proportional to the concentration of NO present in the ambient airstream. Figure 25.22 illustrates the analytical technique based on this principle. To determine the NO2 concentration, the NO and NOx (NO \u00fe NO2) concentrations are measured. The block diagram shows a dual pathway through the instrument, one to measure NO and the other to measure NOx. The NO pathway has an ambient airstream containing NO (as well as NO2), an ozone stream from the ozone generator, a reaction chamber, a photomultiplier tube, and signal-processing circuitry. The NOx pathway has the same components, plus a converter for quantitatively reducing NO2 to NO. The instrument can also electronically subtract the NO from NOx and yield as output the resultant NO2. Chemiluminescent NO O3 NO2 * O2 reaction NO2 h (photo) Signal is proportional to [NO] d (photons) dt [O3] [NO] FIGURE 25.21 NO2 chemiluminescent detection chemistry and physics based on the reaction of NO and O2. PMT: photomultiplier tube. NO2 Ambient air Air passing through the NO pathway enters the reaction chamber, where the NO present reacts with the O3. The photons produced are measured by the photomultiplier tube and converted to an NO concentration. The NO2 in the airstream in this pathway is unchanged. In the NOx pathway, the NO-and NO2-laden air enters the converter, where the NO2 is reduced to form NO; all of the NOx exits the converter as NO and enters the reaction chamber. The NO reacts with O3 and the output signal is the total NOx concentration. The NO2 concentration in the original airstream is the difference between NOx and NO.", "Calibration techniques use gas-phase titration of an NO standard with O3 or an NO2 permeation device. 25.2.1.6.4 SULFUR DIOXIDE Several manual and continuous analytical techniques are used to measure SO2 in the atmosphere. Methods for determining levels in the air include ion chromatography, titration, calorimetry, mass spectrometry, conductimetry, amperometric detection, \ufb02ame photometric detection, and turbidimetry. Of these methods, ion chromatography generally has the lowest detection limit for SO2.36 The manual techniques involve two-stage sample collection and measurement. Samples are collected by bubbling a known volume of gas through a liquid collection medium. Collection ef\ufb01ciency is dependent on the gaseliquid contact time, bubble size, SO2 concentration, and SO2 solubility in the collection medium. The liquid medium contains chemicals which stabilize SO2 in solution by either complexation or oxidation to a more stable form. Field samples must be handled carefully to prevent losses from exposure to high temperatures. Samples are analyzed at a central laboratory by an appropriate method. The WesteGaeke manual method, which has been modi\ufb01ed since its inception, had been the basis for the NO signal NO [NO] NO Exhaust [NO2] [NOx] [NO] NO NO 2 \u201cNOx \u201d NOx signal [NOx]Converter as NO V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.2 GASES AND VAPORS U.S. EPA reference method for measurement of SO2.37 The method uses the colorimetric principle; i.e. the amount of SO2 collected is proportional to the amount of light absorbed by a solution. The collection medium is an aqueous solution of sodium or potassium tetrachloromercurate (TCM). Absorbed SO2 forms a stable complex with TCM. This enhanced stability permits the collection, transport, and short-term storage of samples at a central laboratory. The analysis proceeds by adding bleached pararosaniline dye and formaldehyde to form red-purple pararosaniline methylsulfonic acid. Optical absorption at 548 nm is linearly proportional to the SO2 concentration. Procedures are followed to minimize interference by O3, oxides of nitrogen, and heavy metals. In the United States, the current SO2 reference method employs ultraviolet \ufb02uorescence (UVF). The UVF system depicted in Figure 25.23 includes a measurement cell, a UV light source of appropriate wavelength, a UV detector system with appropriate wavelength sensitivity, a pump and \ufb02ow control system for sampling the ambient air and moving it into the measurement cell, as well as \ufb01lters and other conditioning components needed to minimize measurement interferences, suitable control, and measurement processing capability. The SO2 concentrations are derived from on an automated measurement of the intensity of \ufb02uorescence released by SO2 in an ambient air sample contained in a measurement cell of an analyzer when the air sample is irradiated by UV light passed through the cell. The \ufb02uorescent light released by the SO2 is also in the ultraviolet region, but at longer wavelengths than the excitation light. Typically, optimum instrumental measurement of SO2 concentrations is obtained with an excitation wavelength in a band between approximately 190e230 nm, and measurement of the SO2 \ufb02uorescence in a broadband around 320 nm. Interferents include aromatic hydrocarbon species, and possibly other compounds.38 The continuous methods combine sample collection and the measurement technique in one automated process. The measurement methods used for continuous analyzers include conductometric, colorimetric, coulometric, and amperometric techniques for the determination of SO2 collected in a liquid medium.39 Other continuous methods utilize physicochemical techniques for detection of SO2 in a gas stream. These include \ufb02ame photometric detection (described earlier) and \ufb02uorescence spectroscopy.40 Instruments based on all of these principles are available which meet standard performance speci\ufb01cations. 25.2.1.6.5 NONMETHANE VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS The large number of individual hydrocarbons in the atmosphere and the many different hydrocarbon classes make ambient air monitoring a very dif\ufb01cult task. The ambient atmosphere contains a ubiquitous concentration of methane (CH4) at approximately 1.6 ppm worldwide [9]. The concentration of all other hydrocarbons in ambient air can range from 100 times less to 10 times V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS greater than the methane concentration for a rural versus an urban location. The terminology of the concentration of hydrocarbon compounds is potentially confusing. Hydrocarbon concentrations are referred to by two unitsdparts per million by volume (ppmv) and parts per million by carbon (ppmC). Thus, 1 mlof gas in 1 l of air is 1 ppmv, so the following is true:", "Mixing Ratio ppmv ppmC 1 mlofO3 \u00bc1 l of air 1 ppm ozone e 1 mlofSO2 \u00bc1 l of air 1 ppmv SO2 e 1 mlofCH4 \u00bc1 l of air 1 ppmv CH4 1 ppmC CH4 1 mlofC2 H6 \u00bc1 l of air 1 ppmv C2H6 2 ppmC C2H6 FIGURE 25.24 Schematic diagram of hydrocarbon detection by gas chromatography. NMVOC \u00bc nonmethane volatile organic carbon. The unit ppmC takes into account the number of carbonatoms containedinaspeci\ufb01c hydrocarbonand is the generally accepted way to report ambient hydrocarbons. This unit is used for three reasons: (1) the number of carbon atoms is a very crude indicator of the total reactivity of a group of hydrocarbon compounds; (2) historically, analytical techniques have expressed results in this unit; and (3) considerable information has been developed on the role of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere in terms of concentrations determined as ppmC. With decreasing detection limits the units are also expressed as parts per billion by volume (ppbv) and ppbC. Historically, measurements have classi\ufb01ed ambient hydrocarbons into two classes: methane (CH4) and all other NMVOCs. Analyzing hydrocarbons in the atmosphere involves a three-step process: collection, separation, and quanti\ufb01cation. Collection involves obtaining an aliquot of air, e.g. with an evacuated canister. The principal separation process is gas chromatography (GC), and the principal quanti\ufb01cation technique is with a calibrated \ufb02ame ionization detector (FID). Mass spectroscopy (MS) is used along with GC to identify individual hydrocarbon compounds. Since the NMVOCs are in the gas phase, they are evacuated from the container directly to the GC. A simple schematic diagram of the GC/FID principle is shown in Figure 25.24. Air containing CH4 and other hydrocarbons classi\ufb01ed as NMVOCs pass through a GC column and the air, CH4, and NMVOC molecules are clustered into groups because of different absorption/desorption rates. As CH4 and NMVOC groups exit the column, they are \u201ccounted\u201d by the FID. The signal output of the detector is proportional to the two groups and may be quanti\ufb01ed when compared with standard concentrations of gases. This simpli\ufb01ed procedure has been used extensively to collect hydrocarbon concentration data for the ambient atmosphere. A major Air Sample Gas chromatographic column Air CH4 NMVOC CH4 Signal Time disadvantage of this technique is the grouping of all hydrocarbons other than CH4 into one class. Hydrocarbon compounds with similar structures are detected by an FID in a proportional manner, but for compounds with signi\ufb01cantly different structures the response may be different. This difference in sensitivity results in errors in measurements of NMVOC mixtures. More sophisticated GC columns and techniques perform more detailed separations of mixtures of hydrocarbons into discrete groups. The equipment and supplies are constantly improving sensitivity and speci\ufb01city to particular compounds. As such, some time is needed to explore the best columns and mobile phase mixtures to optimize the analysis. Other types of detectors include the \ufb02ame photometric detector (FPD) and the electron capture detector (ECD). The FID is composed of an H2 \ufb02ame through which the hydrocarbon gases are burned, forming charged carbon atoms, and an electrometer grid which generates a signal current proportional to the number of carbon atoms in the \ufb02ame. The example of 1 ppmv methane (CH4) and 1 ppmv (but 2 ppmC) ethane (C2H6) is related to this detection principle. One ppmv of CH4 and 1 ppmv of C2H6 in air have the same number of molecules of hydrocarbon in a given volume of air, but if an aliquot of each mixture were run through an FID, the signal for ethane would be nearly twice the methane signal: 2 ppmC ethane compared to 1 ppmC methane. The FPD is also used to measure sulfur-containing compounds and therefore is useful for measurement of sulfur-containing hydrocarbons such as dimethylsul\ufb01de or furan. The FPD has an H2 \ufb02ame in which sulfur-containing gases are burned. In the combustion process, electronically excited S is formed. A photomultiplier 2 tube detects light emitted from the excited sulfur at w395 nm. The ECD is preferred for measuring nitrogen-containing compounds such as peroxyacyl nitrate and other oxidized species of nitrogen. The ECD contains a radioactive source which establishes a stable ion \ufb01eld. Nitrogen-containing compounds capture V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.3 PARTICULATE MATTER electrons in passing through the \ufb01eld. Alterations in the electronic signal are related to the concentration of the nitrogen species. 25.3 PARTICULATE MATTER Particulate matter (PM) includes any airborne substances that are not in the gas phase, either liquid or solid.", "They are generally classi\ufb01ed according to the particle\u2019s diameter, e.g. total suspended particulates (TSP) includes all aerosols in the atmosphere, but smaller particles are of most concern because they remain suspended and they cause the most health effects. These are usually classi\ufb01ed as the coarse fraction, i.e. aerodynamic diameter, i.e. 2.5e10 mm diameters (PM10) and the \ufb01ne fraction and 2.5 mm diameters (PM2.5). The three major characteristics of particulate pollutants in the ambient atmosphere are total mass concentration, size distribution, and chemical composition. In the United States, the PM2.5 concentration, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mm, is the quantity measured for an air quality standard to protect human health from effects caused by inhalation of suspended particulate matter. However, there remains a strong interest in the course fraction (PM10) because it may be linked with certain diseases (e.g. asthma) and because it often has toxic components (e.g. sorbed metals and semivolatile organic compounds like dioxin). The size distribution of particulate pollutants is very important in understanding the transport and removal of particles in the atmosphere and their deposition behavior in the human respiratory system. Their chemical composition may determine the type of effects caused by particulate matter on humans, vegetation, and materials. More recently, particles have been classi\ufb01ed even further; with ultra\ufb01nes have diameter of about 0.1 mm, i.e. 100 nm. Interestingly, this is the same size as that of nanoparticles. However, a distinction between nanoparticles and ultra\ufb01nes are that nanoparticles are considered to be made intentionally, whereas ultra\ufb01nes are considered to be unintentional byproducts from other activities (e.g. diesel combustion). Another distinction is that the 100 nm length is a single dimension, i.e. a nanoparticle has at least one dimension that is 100 nm, whereas an ultra\ufb01ne particle has an aerodynamic diameter of 100 nm. Thus, a long chain of carbon-60 spheres would still be considered a nanoparticle because its width is less than 100 nm, but an aggregate of ultra\ufb01ne particle may be considered larger than an ultra\ufb01ne particle because its Stokes diameter is greater than 100 nm. Recall from Chapter 6 that the Stokes particle diameter (Dps) is the diameter of a sphere with the same density and settling velocity as the particle. The diameter is derived from the aerodynamic drag force caused by the difference in velocity of the particle and the surrounding \ufb02uid. For spherical particles, Dps is identical to the physical or actual diameter, but for aggregates and other nonspherical aerosols they can differ. A hollow particle is obviously different from a solid particle, so density also comes into play. For example, for particles with dimensions >500 nm, the aerodynamic diameter is approximatedd as the product of the Dps and the square root of the particle density. Particles can be directly emitted into the atmosphere (primary aerosols) or form from gas-phase constituents after emission (secondary aerosol). The secondary source of \ufb01ne particles in the atmosphere is gas-toparticle conversion processes, considered to be the more important source of particles contributing to atmospheric haze. In gas-to-particle conversion, gaseous molecules become transformed to liquid or solid particles. This phase transformation can occur by three processes: absorption, nucleation, and condensation. Absorption is the process by which a gas goes into solution in a liquid phase. Absorption of a speci\ufb01c gas is dependent on the solubility of the gas in a particular liquid, e.g. SO2 in liquid H2O droplets. Nucleation and condensation are terms associated with aerosol dynamics. Nucleation is the growth of clusters of molecules that become a thermodynamically stable nucleus. This process is dependent on the vapor pressure of the condensable species. The molecular clusters undergo growth when the saturation ratio, S, is greater than 1, where saturation ratio is de\ufb01ned as the actual pressure of the gas divided by its equilibrium vapor pressure. The condition when S > 1 is referred to as a supersaturated condition. The size at which a cluster may be thermodynamically stable is in\ufb02uenced by the Kelvin effect. The equilibrium vapor pressure of a component increases as the droplet size decreases. Vapor pressure is determined by the energy necessary to separate a single molecule from the surrounding molecules in the liquid. As the curvature of the droplet\u2019s surface increases, fewer neighboring molecules will be able to bind a particular molecule to the liquid phase, thus increasing the probability of a molecule escaping the liquid\u2019s surface. Thus, smaller droplets will have a higher equilibrium vapor d Aerosol textbooks provide methods to determine the aerodynamic diameter of particles less than 0.5 mm.", "For larger particles gravitational settling is often used for sizing that is expressed as mass of ranges of aerodynamic diameter, e.g. mass of PM2.5 and mass of PM10. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS pressure. This would affect the minimum size necessary for a thermodynamically stable cluster, suggesting that components with lower equilibrium saturation vapor pressures will form stable clusters at smaller diameters. Condensation is the result of collisions between a gaseous molecule and an existing aerosol droplet when supersaturation exists. Condensation occurs at much lower values of supersaturation than nucleation. Thus, when particles already exist in suf\ufb01cient quantities, condensation will be the dominant process occurring to relieve the supersaturated condition of the vapor-phase material. A simple model for the formation and growth of an aerosol at ambient conditions involves the formation of a gas product by the appropriate chemical oxidation reactions in the gas phase. This product must have a suf\ufb01ciently low vapor pressure for the gas-phase concentration of the oxidized product to exceed its saturation vapor pressure. When this condition occurs, nucleation and condensation may proceed, relieving supersaturation. These processes result in the transfer of mass to the condensed phase. Aerosol growth in size occurs while condensation is proceeding. Coagulation is the process by which discrete particles come into contact with each other in the air and remain joined together by surface forces. Coagulation represents another way in which aerosol diameter will increase. However, it does not alter the mass of material in the coagulated particle. The clearest example of this working model of homogeneous gas-to-particle conversion is sulfuric acid aerosol formation. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) has an extremely low saturation vapor pressure. Oxidation of relatively small amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) can result in a gas-phase concentration of H2SO4 that exceeds its equilibrium vapor pressure in the ambient atmosphere, with the subsequent formation of sulfuric acid aerosol. In contrast, nitric acid (HNO3) has a much higher saturation vapor pressure. Therefore, the gas-phase concentration of HNO3 is not high enough to permit nucleation of nitric acid aerosol in typical atmospheric systems. 25.3.1 Sampling Particulates The complexity and diversity of particulate composition, size, mass and concentrations in the atmosphere dictate the need for accurate and representative PM monitoring. The major purpose of ambient particulate sampling is to obtain mass concentration and chemical composition data, preferably as a function of particle diameter. This information is valuable for a variety of problems: effects on human health, identi\ufb01cation of particulate matter sources, understanding of atmospheric haze, and particle removal processes. The primary approach is to separate the particles from a known volume of air and subject them to weight determination and chemical analysis. The principal methods for extracting particles from an airstream are \ufb01ltration and impaction. All sampling techniques must be concerned with the behavior of particles in a moving airstream. The difference between sampling for gases and sampling for particles begins at the inlet of the sampling manifold and is due to the discrete mass associated with individual particles. Particulate matter is collected using equipment that separates out the size fraction of concern. This separation predominantly occurs by four mechanical processes: (1) diffusion; (2) interception; (3) inertial impaction; and (4) electrostatics (Figure 6.33 in Chapter 6). Diffusion applies exclusively to the extremely small particles ( 0.1 mm diameter), i.e. those that experience Brownian motion and undergo a \u201crandom walk\u201d away from the airstream. Interception captures PM with diameters between 0.1 and 1 mm. The particle remains in the airstream but contacts the \ufb01lter medium. Inertial impaction collects PM with large enough diameters and mass to exit the airstream via inertia (diameters 1 mm). Electrostatics consist of electrical interactions between the atoms in the \ufb01lter and those in the particle at the point of contact (van der Waal\u2019s forces), as well as electrostatic attraction (charge differences between particle and \ufb01lter medium). Other important factors include the thickness and pore diameter or the \ufb01lter, the uniformity of particle diameters and pore sizes, the solid volume fraction, the rate of particle loading onto the \ufb01lter (e.g. affecting particle \u201cbounce\u201d), the particle phase (liquid or solid), capillarity and surface tension (if either the particle or the \ufb01lter media are coated with a liquid), and atmospheric and stack conditions, e.g. velocity, temperature, pressure, and viscosity. Commonly, the both PM and gaseous pollutant concentration units for ambient measurements are mass (mg) per unit volume (m3). However, for PM, the concentration is reported according to the mass fraction for different PM size ranges.", "Size classi\ufb01cation involves the use of specially designed inlet con\ufb01gurations, e.g. PM2.5 sampling. To determine mass concentration, all the particles are removed from a known volume of air and their total mass is measured. This removal is accomplished by two techniques, \ufb01ltration and impaction. Mass measurements are made by pre-and post-weighing of \ufb01lters or impaction surfaces. To account for the absorption of water vapor, the \ufb01lters are generally equilibrated at standard or other conditions speci\ufb01ed in the PM method (e.g. T \u00bc 20 C and 50% relative humidity). Filters vary in pore size, strand diameter, chemical composition and quality. Vendors document the important physical properties of the commonly used \ufb01lter V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.3 PARTICULATE MATTER materials and the expected \ufb01lter ef\ufb01ciencies (Table 25.8). In airborne PM purposes, most \ufb01brous \ufb01lters consist of glass \ufb01bers, cellulose, quartz, polystyrene, and polycarbonate materials. Membrane \ufb01lters are made of cellulose esters, polytetra\ufb02uoroethylene (PTFE), polyethylene, polycarbonate, silver and other materials. If physical properties dictate the \ufb01lter choice, then glass \ufb01ber \ufb01lters would be used. However, these inorganic silicate materials can become highly radioactive during certain analyzes and are therefore not useful during a nondestructive activation technique is applied. Similarly, carbon-based \ufb01lters would not generally be used in a destructive technique, since the carbon in cellulose, PFTE, etc. would show up in the analysis and produce a positive C bias (e.g. for an organic C to elemental C ratio calculation). If the analysis will include \ufb01bers, especially asbestos, it mixed cellulose would be preferred for transmissive electron microscopy (TEM), since the \ufb01lter material can be destroyed during etching (i.e. the cellulose is dissolved leaving the \ufb01bers more visible to TEM). However, the pore size would vary according to the type of investigation (e.g. if longer \ufb01bers are of major interest, an 8 mm pore size would be used, whereas if \ufb01bers of interest are shorter, the 4.5 mm pore size \ufb01lter would be the best choice).42 Thus, subsequent elemental analysis after collection is an important selection criterion for PM \ufb01lters.41 Size distributions are determined by classifying airborne particles by aerodynamic diameter, electrical mobility, or light-scattering properties. The most common technique is the use of multistage impactors, each stage of which removes particles of progressively smaller diameter. Figure 25.25 shows a four-stage impactor. The particulate matter collected on each stage is weighed to yield a mass size distribution or is subjected to chemical analysis to obtain data on its chemical size distribution. Impactors are used to determine size distributions for particle diameters of 0.1 mm and larger. Electrical mobility is utilized to obtain size distribution information in the 0.01e1.0 mm diameter range. This measurement method requires unipolar charging of particles and their separation by passage through an electrical \ufb01eld.43 By incrementally increasing the electrical \ufb01eld strength progressively, larger charged particles may be removed from a \ufb02owing airstream. The change in the amount of charge collected by an electrometer grid is then related to the number of particles present in a particular size increment. Instruments based on this principle yield a number size distribution. Light-scattering properties of particles are also utilized to determine a number-size distributions.44 Individual particles interact with a light beam and scatter light at an angle to the original direction of the beam. The intensity of the scattered light is a function of the diameter and the refractive index of the particle.

Source: Ref. 41. systems are designed to dilute a particle-laden airstream suf\ufb01ciently to permit only one particle in the beam at a time. The intensity of the scattered light, as measured by a photomultiplier tube, is proportional to particle size. The number of electrical pulses of each magnitude is accumulated in a multichannel analyzer. By sampling at a known \ufb02ow rate, the number of particles of different diameters is counted with this type of instrument. This principle is also used in nephelometers, i.e. portable PM detectors. The chemical composition of particulate pollutants is determined in two forms: speci\ufb01c elements, or speci\ufb01c compounds or ions. Knowledge of their chemical composition is useful in determining the sources of airborne particles and in understanding the fate of particles in the atmosphere. Elemental analysis yields results in terms of the individual elements present in a sample such as a given quantity of sulfur, S. From V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS Cover slip Vacuum pump elemental analysis techniques we do not obtain direct information about the chemical form of S in a sample such as sulfate \u00f0SO2 \u00de or sul\ufb01de. Two nondestructive tech 4 niques used for direct elemental analysis of particulate samples are X-ray \ufb02uorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and neutron activation analysis (NAA). XRF is a technique in which a sample is bombarded by X-rays.45 Inner shell electrons are excited to higher energy levels. As these excited electrons return to their original state, energy with wavelengths characteristic of each element present in the sample is emitted. These high-energy photons are detected and analyzed to give the type and quantity of the elements present in the sample. The technique is applicable to all elements with an atomic number of 11 (sodium) or higher. In principle, complex mixtures may be analyzed with this technique. Dif\ufb01culties arise from a matrix effect, so that care must be taken to use appropriate standards containing a similar matrix of elements. This technique requires relatively expensive equipment and highly trained personnel. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) involves the bombardment of the sample with neutrons, which interact with the sample to form different isotopes of the elements in the air sample.46 Many of these isotopes are radioactive and may be identi\ufb01ed by comparing their radioactivity with standards. The NAA technique is not quite as versatile as XRF and requires a neutron source. Pretreatment of the collected particulate matter may be required for chemical analysis. Pretreatment generally involves extraction of the particulate matter into a liquid. The solution may be further treated to transform the material into a form suitable for analysis. Trace metals may be determined by AA spectroscopy, emission spectroscopy, polarography, and anodic stripping voltammetry. Analysis of anions is possible by colorimetric techniques and ion chromatography. Sulfate \u00f0SO2 \u00de, sul\ufb01te \u00f0SO2 \u00de,nitrate \u00f0NO3 \u00de,chloride 43 (Cl ), and \ufb02uoride (F ) may be determined by ion chromatography.47 Analytical methods available to laboratories with only general-purpose analytical equipment may be found in the suggested reading materials and references at the end of this chapter. 25.3.2 Behavior of Particles at Sampling Inlets Recall from Chapter 6 that the sampling inlet is very important for PM measurements. An inlet of the PM2.5 sampler is often designed to extract ambient aerosols from the surrounding airstream, remove particles with aerodynamic diameters >10 mm, and move the remaining smaller particles to the next stage. An impactor and \ufb01lter assembly can remove particles with diameters <10 mm and >2.5 mm in diameter but will allow particles of 2.5 mm in diameter to pass and be collected on a \ufb01lter surface. Particles <10 mm but <2.5 mm are removed downstream from the inlet by a single-stage, single-\ufb02ow, single-jet impactor assembly. Aerosols are collected on \ufb01lters which are weighed before and after sampling, e.g. 37 mm diameter glass \ufb01lters immersed in low volatility, low viscosity diffusion oil. The oil is added to reduce the impact of \u201cbounce\u201d, i.e. particle hit the \ufb01lter and are not reliably collected.", "Sampling errors may occur at the inlet, and particles may be lost in the sampling manifold while being transported to the collection surface. Figure 25.26 illustrates the \ufb02ow patterns around a sampling inlet in a uniform \ufb02ow \ufb01eld. Figure 25.26(A) shows that when no air is permitted to \ufb02ow into the inlet, the streamline \ufb02ow moves around the edges of the inlet. As the \ufb02ow rate through the inlet increases, more and more of the streamlines are attracted to the inlet. Figure 25.26(B) is known as the isokinetic condition, i.e. the sampling \ufb02ow rate is equal to the \ufb02ow \ufb01eld rate. An example of an isokinetic condition is an inlet with its opening into the wind pulling air at the wind speed. When one is sampling for gases, this is not a serious constraint because the composition of the gas will be the same under all inlet \ufb02ow rates; i.e. there is no fractionation of the air sample by different gaseous molecules.48 Although the isokinetic condition may be assumed often for gas-phase pollutants, particle-containing air-streams present a different situation. Figure 25.26(B), the isokinetic case, is the ideal case. The ideal sample inlet would always face into the wind and sample at the same rate as the instantaneous wind velocity (extremely improbable). Under isokinetic sampling conditions, parallel airstreams \ufb02ow into the sample inlet, V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.3 PARTICULATE MATTER (A) (B) (C) (D) FIGURE 25.26 Four streamline \ufb02ow patterns around a sampling inlet in a uniform \ufb02ow \ufb01eld. carrying with them particles of all diameters capable of being carried by the stream \ufb02ow. When the sampling rate is lower than the \ufb02ow \ufb01eld (Figure 25.26(C)), the streamlines start to diverge around the edges of the inlet and the larger particles with more inertia are unable to follow the streamlines and are captured by the sampling inlet. The opposite happens when the sampling rate is higher than the \ufb02ow \ufb01eld. The inlet captures more streamlines, but the larger particles near the edges of the inlet may be unable to follow the streamline \ufb02ow and escape collection by the inlet. The inlet may be designed for particle size fractionation; e.g. a PM2.5 inlet will exclude particles larger than 2.5 mm aerodynamic diameter (Figures 3.2 and 3.3). These inertial effects become less important for particles with diameters less than 5 mm and for low wind velocities, but for samplers attempting to collect particles above 5 mm, the inlet design and \ufb02ow rates become important parameters. In addition, the wind speed has a much greater impact on sampling errors associated with particles more than 5 mm in diameter. After the great effort taken to get a representative sample into the sampling manifold inlet, care must be taken to move the particles to the collection medium in an unaltered form. Potential problems arise from too long or too twisted manifold systems. Gravitational settling in the manifold will remove a fraction of the very large particles. Larger particles are also subject to loss by impaction on walls at bends in a manifold. Particles may also be subject to electrostatic forces which will cause them to migrate to the walls of nonconducting manifolds. Other problems include condensation or agglomeration during transit time in the manifold. These constraints require sampling manifoldsfor particlestobeasshort andhaveasfew bends as possible. The collection technique involves the removal of particles from the airstream. The two principal methods are \ufb01ltration and impaction. Filtration consists of collecting particles on a \ufb01lter surface by three processes: direct interception, inertial impaction, and diffusion.49 Filtration attempts to remove a very high percentage of the mass and number of particles by these three processes. Any size classi\ufb01cation is done by a preclassi\ufb01er, such as an impactor, before the particle stream reaches the surface of the \ufb01lter. 25.3.3 Indirect PM Measurements In addition to collecting, weighing and analyzing PM by mass and size, various indirect methods are employed. As discussed in Chapter 6, PM concentrations by size can be estimated by light scattering. The amount of scattering is calibrated against known PM concentrations, e.g. collocating one of the direct measurement instruments with the nephelometer and comparing results. The concentration of particulates is directly proportionate to the amount of scattering detected, so an optical device can provide an indirect measure of PM2.5 concentration can be determined by a ratio of scattering to PM2.5 concentrations compared at several sites and over time. Of course, since this is an indirect method, interferences can be substantial, including changes in environmental conditions, especially relative humidity.", "Since nephelometers do not collect PM, no analysis of particles for chemical composition is possible. In addition, extremely small particles in the air may be missed by an optical microscope, individually weighing so little that their presence is masked in gravimetric analysis by the presence of a few large particles (see Discussion in Chapter 6). The open-path technologies discussed earlier for gas-phase pollutants can sometimes be used for PM. Recent studies indicate a relationship between PM size and plume light extinction. Each plume has unique features in speci\ufb01c regions of the open-path extinction spectra. The extinction measurements a PM plume can be combined with algorithms to retrieve an estimate of mean mass distribution. Larger PM (1e20 mm diameter) has V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS interferences in IR extinction spectra, whereas smaller PM will affects the visible and UV wavelength region.50 The DIAL, OP-FTIR and other open-path systems are being evaluated to address aerosols. This is challenging in that aerosol cloud is much more complex than a gaseous cloud given the many physical properties of the speci\ufb01c material, meaning that radiation interactions between particles and the atmosphere add variability beyond that of gas-phase pollutants. This will include new algorithms for analyzing the open-path signals.51 25.4 MEASURING GAS AND PARTICULATE PHASES TOGETHER Ambient air always contains particulate matter, which can interfere with the measurement of gases. For example, if one is trying to determine the amount of NO2 in the air, but any solid-phase nitrate particles and nitric acid vapor will interfere with the results. Thus, there are two basic reasons to know the phase distribution of an air sample, i.e. to know and decrease interference and to account for the total amount of a contaminant in both phases. 25.4.1 Denuders One way to ascertain both particulate and gas phases is the use of the diffusion denuders mentioned above. Actually, the term diffusion denuder tells only half of the denuder story. The denuder is also a particle-gas phase separation device. In a denuder, air is pulled through a hollow tube that is coated with sorbing media. The \ufb02ow is kept laminar by modulating the \ufb02ow rate to the tube diameter. This increases diffusion several orders of magnitude greater than Brownian molecular diffusivity of the particulate matter, allowing the gas to move into the sorbing media in the interior walls of the tubes much faster than under normal, turbulent conditions. The tube length is chosen to ensure that all, or at least a known and consistent amount, of the gas moves into the walls before the air exits the tube. However, most of the particles remain suspended in the air\ufb02ow and can be captured, e.g. with \ufb01lters. Annual denuders are a speci\ufb01c type that employs two concentric tubes, with inner surface of the outer tube and the outer surface of the inner tube coated with the sorbing media. This doubles the surface area into which the gas will move, thus improving collection ef\ufb01ciency, shortening overall tube length, shortening sampling time and/or allowing for higher \ufb02ow rates. These and other denuders are often used in sampling airborne semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs). These substances are often found in both vapor and particulate phases, so the separation of the denuder is ideal (see Discussion Box: \u201cMeasuring SVOCs in the Air\u201d in Chapter 11). 25.5 ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT OF ODORS Odors are an important, yet not well understood, aspect of air pollution. Human smell is initiated by sniffing, which transports air with concentrations of odorant molecules past curved bony structures, i.e. turbinates, in the nose. The turbinates generate turbulent air\ufb02ow that mixes volatile compounds and particles and carries them to thin mucus layer that coats the olfactory epithelium (Figure 25.27). Smell connects to other senses. For example, the smell from the burning plastics, oxidizing metal, semivolatile and VOCs, and particulate matter is physiologically linked to memory centers. Odors have often been associated with air pollution episodes and disasters. In addition to the link between memory and olfactory centers. Indeed, the nasal pathway is a means by which air pollutants are taken up by humans. This goes beyond nuisance and is an indication of potential adverse health effects. For example, nitric oxide (NO) is a neurotoxic gas released from many sources, such as con\ufb01ned animal feeding operations, breakdown of fertilizers after they are applied to the soil and crops, and emissions from vehicles. Besides being inhaled into the lungs, NO can reach 2. Nostril t 5.", "Brain (hypothalamus) FIGURE 25.27 Human smell is initiated by snif\ufb01ng, which transports air with concentrations of odorant molecules past curved bony structures, i.e. turbinates, in the nose.

The olfactory epithelium contains odor sensing cells. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Vallero DA, Vesilind PA.

The how and why of electronic noses. IEEE Spectrum. 35(9): 22e34. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.5 ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT OF ODORS the brain directly. The gas can pass through a thin membrane via the nose to the brain. The nasal exposure is a different paradigm from that usually used to calculate exposure. In fact, most sources do not have a means for calculating exposures other than dermal, inhalation, and ingestion. Research has linked people\u2019s emotional states to odors, e.g. near con\ufb01ned animal feeding operations in North Carolina.52 People who live near swine facilities are negatively affected when they smell odors from the facility. This is consistent with other research that has found that people experience adverse health symptoms more frequently when exposed to livestock odors. These symptoms include eye, nose, and throat irritation, headache, nausea, diarrhea, hoarseness, sore throat, cough, chest tightness, nasal congestion, palpitations, shortness of breath, stress, and drowsiness. There is quite a bit of diversity in response, with some people being highly sensitive to even low concentrations of odorant compounds while others are relatively unfazed even at much higher concentrations. Actually, response to odors can be triggered by three different mechanisms. In the \ufb01rst mechanism, symptoms can be induced by exposure to odorant compounds at suf\ufb01ciently high concentrations to cause irritation or other toxicological effects. The irritation, not the odor, evokes the health symptoms. The odor sensation is merely as an exposure indicator. In the second mechanism, symptoms of adverse effects result from odorants concentrations lower than those eliciting irritation. This can be owing to genetic predisposition or conditioned aversion. In the third mechanism, symptoms can result from a coexisting pollutant, e.g. an endotoxin, which is a component of the odorant mixture. Technologies are advancing, including the development of \u201carti\ufb01cial noses\u201d.53 Odorants are chemical compounds such as H2S, which smells like rotten eggs, and may be measured by chemical or organoleptic methods. Organoleptic methods are those which rely on the response to odor of the human nose. Although chemical methods may be useful in identifying and quantifying speci\ufb01c odor-ants, human response is the only way to assess the degree of acceptability of odorants in the atmosphere. This is due to several factors: the nonlinear relationship between odorant concentration and human response, the variability of individual responses to a given odorant concentration, and the sensory attributes of odor. Four characteristics of odor are subject to measurement by sensory techniques: intensity, detectability, character (quality), and hedonic tone ( pleasantnesseunpleasantness).54 Odor intensity is the magnitude of the perceived sensation and is classi\ufb01ed by a descriptive scale, e.g. faintemoderateestrong, or a 1e10 numerical scale. The detectability of an odor or threshold limit is not an absolute level but depends on how the odorant is present, e.g. alone or in a mixture. Odor character or quality is the characteristic which permits its description or classi\ufb01cation by comparison to other odors, i.e. sweet or sour, or like that of a skunk. The last characteristic is the hedonic type, which refers to the acceptability of an odorant. For the infrequent visitor, the smell of a large commercial bread bakery may be of high intensity but pleasant. For the nearby resident, the smell may be less acceptable. The sensory technique used for assessing human perception of odors is called olfactometry. The basic technique is to present odorants at different concentrations to a panel of subjects and assess their response. The process favored by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences is dynamic olfactometry.55 This technique involves a sample dilution method in which a \ufb02ow of clean, nonodorous air is mixed with the odorant under dynamic or constant \ufb02ow conditions. With this type of apparatus and standard operating conditions, it is possible to determine the detection threshold and the recognition threshold. At high dilution, the panel will be able to tell only whether an odorant is present or absent.", "Only at higher concentrations, typically by a factor of 2e10, will the subjects be able to identify the odorant. The olfactometric procedure contains the following elements: 1. Dynamic dilution. 2. Delivery of diluted odorant for smelling through a mask or port. 3. Schedule of presentation of various dilutions and blanks. 4. Obtaining responses from the panelists. 5. Calculation of a panel threshold from experimental data. 6. Panelist selection criteria. The \ufb01rst element, dynamic dilution, provides a reproducible sample for each panelist. The system must minimize the loss of the odorant to the walls of the delivery apparatus, provide clean dilution air of odor-free quality, maintain a constant dilution ratio for the duration of a given test, and have no memory effect when going from high to low concentrations or switching between odorants of different characters. The type of mask or port and the delivery \ufb02ow rate have been found to in\ufb02uence the response of panelists in determining odor threshold and intensity. The schedule of presentation may in\ufb02uence the results. The sensory effects are judgment criterion, anticipation, and adaptation. The judgment criterion determines how the panelist will respond when asked whether or not an odor is sensed. Individuals differ in V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS their readiness to be positive or negative. The anticipa-20 tion effect is a tendency to expect an odor over a given series of trials. Subjects show some positive response 10 when no odorant is present. The adaptation effect is the temporary desensitization after smelling an odorant. This is also called olfactory fatigue and often occurs in occupational settings. Because of olfactory fatigue, investigators evaluating odor concentration in the \ufb01eld must breathe air deodorized by passage through an acti- Concentration (ppb) 5 vated carbon canister before and after snif\ufb01ng the ambient air being evaluated. Individuals differ in their sensitivity to odor. Figure 25.28 shows a typical distribution of sensitivities to ethylsul\ufb01de vapor. There are currently no guidelines on inclusion or exclusion of individuals with abnormally high or low sensitivity. This variability of response complicates the data treatment procedure. In many instances, the goal is to determine some mean value for the threshold representative of the panel as a whole. The small size of panels (generally fewer than 10 people) and the distribution of individual sensitivities require sophisticated statistical procedures to \ufb01nd the threshold from the responses. Thresholds may also be determined by extrapolation of doseeresponse plots. In this approach, the perceived odor intensity is measured at several dilutions using some intensity rating method (Figure 25.28). The threshold value may be selected at some value (e.g. zero intensity) and the concentration determined with the dilution ratio.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.6 ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT OF VISIBILITY location can take two approaches: human observations and optical measurements. In pristine locations such as national parks, use of human observers has permitted us to gain an understanding of the public\u2019s concept of visibility impairment.", "Although it is dif\ufb01cult to quantify the elements of human observations, this type of research, when coupled with optical measurements, provides a better measure of visibility at a given location.56ae56c To see an object, an observer must be able to detect the contrast between the object and its surroundings. If this contrast decreases, it is more dif\ufb01cult to observe the object. In the atmosphere, visibility can decrease for a number of reasons. For example, we may be farther away from the object (e.g. an airplane can move away from us); the sun\u2019s angle may change with the time of day; and if air pollution increases, the contrast may decrease, reducing our ability to see the object. Objects close to us are easily perceived, but this diminishes as a function of distance. The lowest limit of contrast for human observers is called the threshold contrast and is important because this value in\ufb02uences the maximum distance at which we can see various objects. Thus, it is closely related to our understanding of good vs bad visibility for a particular set of environmental conditions. Threshold contrast is illustrated in Figure 25.30. I is the intensity of light received by the eye from the object, and I \u00feDI represents the intensity coming from the surroundings. The threshold contrast can be as low as 0.018e0.03 and the object can still be perceptible. Other factors, such as the physical size of the visual image on the retina of the eye and the brain\u2019s response to the color of the object, in\ufb02uence the perception of contrast. Reduction in visibility is caused by the following interactions in the atmosphere: light scattering by gaseous II (sky) I Threshold contrast II I II Pulses per second FIGURE 25.30 Threshold contrast in distinguishing an object from its surroundings. The eye responds to an increment in light intensity by increasing the number of signals (pulses) sent to the brain. The detection of threshold contrast involves the ability to discriminate between the target (I) and the brighter background (I \u00feDI). Gregory RL. Eye and brain: the psychology of seeing. London (UK): Weidenfeld and Nicolson; 1977. molecules and particles, and light absorption by gases and particles.57 Light-scattering processes involve the interaction of light with gases or particles in such a manner that the direction or frequency of the light is altered. Absorption processes occur when the electromagnetic radiation interacts with gases or particles and is transferred internally to the gas or particle. Light scattering by gaseous molecules is wavelength dependent and is the reason why the sky is blue. This process is dominant in atmospheres that are relatively free of aerosols or light-absorbing gases. Light scattering by particles is the most important cause of visibility reduction. This phenomenon is dependent on the size of the particles suspended in the atmosphere. Light absorption by gases in the lower troposphere is limited to the absorption characteristics of nitrogen dioxide. This compound absorbs the shorter, or blue, wavelengths of visible light, causing us to observe the red wavelengths. We therefore perceive a yellow to reddish-brown tint in atmospheres containing quantities of NO2. Light absorption by particles is related principally to carbonaceous or black soot in the atmosphere. Other types of \ufb01ne particles such as sulfates, although not good light absorbers, are very ef\ufb01cient at scattering light. The interaction of light in the atmosphere is described mathematically as: dI \u00bcbextI$dx (25.6) where dI is the decrease in intensity, bext is the extinction coef\ufb01cient, I is the original intensity of the beam of light, and dx is the length of the path traveled by the beam of light. Figure 25.31(A) shows a beam of light transmitted through the atmosphere. The intensity of the beam I(x) decreases with the distance from the illumination source as the light is absorbed or scattered out of the beam. For a short period, this decrease is proportional to the intensity of the beam and the length of the interval at that point. Here bext is the extinction or attenuation coef\ufb01cient and is a function of the degree of scattering and absorption of the particles and gases which are present in the beam path. Figure 25.31(B) illustrates a slightly more complicated case, but one more applicable to atmospheric visibility. In this example, the observer still depends on the ability to perceive light rays emanating from the target object and on the scattering and absorption of those rays out of the beam.", "In addition, however, the observer must contend with additional light scattered into the line of sight from other angles. This extraneous light is sometimes called air light. Equation (23.7) is modi\ufb01ed to account for this phenomenon by adding a term to represent this background intensity. dI \u00bcdI\u00f0extinction\u00de\u00fedI\u00f0air light\u00de (25.7) V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS The extinction coef\ufb01cient bext is dependent on the presence of gases and molecules that scatter and absorb light in the atmosphere. The extinction coef\ufb01cient may be considered as the sum of the air and pollutant scattering and absorption interactions, as shown in the following equation: bext \u00bc brg \u00fe bag \u00fe bscat \u00fe bap (25.9) where, brg is scattering by gaseous molecules (Rayleigh scattering), bag is absorption by NO2 gas, bscat is scattering by particles, and bap is absorption by particles. These various extinction components are a function of wavelength. As extinction increases, visibility decreases. The Rayleigh scattering extinction coef\ufb01cient for particle-free air is 0.012 km 1 for \u201cgreen\u201d light (g \u00bc 0.05 mm) at sea level.60 This permits a visual range of w320 km.

US Environmental Protection Agency. Of\ufb01ce of Air Quality Planning and Standards. Research Triangle Park (North Carolina): Protecting Visibility; 1979. Report No. EPA-450/5-79-008. This air light term contributes to the reduced visibility we call atmospheric haze. A simpli\ufb01ed relationship developed by Koschmieder58 which relates the visual range and the extinction coef\ufb01cient is given by 392 Lv \u00bc (25.8) bext where, Lv is the distance at which a black object is just barely visible.59 Equation (23.8) is based on the following assumptions: 1. The background behind the target is uniform. 2. The object is black. 3. An observer can detect a contrast of 0.02. 4. The ratio of air light to extinction is constant over the path of sight. While the Koschmieder relationship is useful as a \ufb01rst approximation for determining visual range, many situations exist in which the results are only qualitative. strong absorber in the blue region, NO2 can color plumes red, brown, or yellow. Figure 25.33 shows a comparison of extinction coef\ufb01cients of 0.1 ppm NO2 and Rayleigh scattering by air.62 In urban areas, some discoloration can be due to area-wide NO2 pollution. In rural areas, the biggest problem with NO2 is that in coherent plumes from power plants, it contributes to the discoloration of the plume. Suspended particles are the most important factor in visibility reduction. In most instances, the visual quality of air is controlled by particle scattering and is characterized by the extinction coef\ufb01cient bscat. The size of particles plays a crucial role in their interaction with light. Other factors are the refractive index and shape of the particles, although their effect is harder to measure and is less well understood. If we could establish these properties, we could calculate the amount of light scattering and absorption. Alternatively, the extinction coef\ufb01cient associated with an aerosol can be measured directly. Aerosol chemical composition determines the amount of light absorbed and scattered. For example, plumes will appear to be darker or lighter as a result of incoming light and the chemical makeup of the particles in the plume. In Figure 25.34, the two plumes on the left are contain large amounts of PM, whereas the two nitrogen dioxide. Ref. 61.

The plume on the far right, which is illuminated by direct sunlight, appears to be white. The second identical water droplet plume, which is shaded, is much darker.

With particles of larger and smaller diameters, scattering decreases. Absorption generally contributes less to the extinction coef\ufb01cient than does the scattering processes. Atmospheric particles of different chemical composition have different refractive indices, resulting in different scattering ef\ufb01ciencies.

Visibility is also affected by alteration of particle size due to hydroscopic particle growth, which is a function of relative humidity. In Los Angeles, California, the air, principally of marine origin, has numerous sea salt particles. Visibility is noticeably reduced when humidity exceeds about 67%. Relative humidity and origin of air (maritime or continental) also affect visibility; presumably due to numerous hygroscopic aerosols from 2 Scattering/Mass ( m pg\u22121) 10\u22121 100 10 air pollution sources. Some materials, such as sulfuric acid mist, exhibit hygroscopic growth at humidity as low as 30%. The ratio of the incident solar transmissivity to the extraterrestrial solar intensity can be as high as 0.5 in clean atmospheres but can drop to 0.2e0.3 in polluted areas, indicating a decrease of 50% in ground-level solar intensity. The turbidity coef\ufb01cient can also be derived from these measurements and used to approximate the aerosol loading of the atmosphere. By assuming a particle size distribution in the size range 0.1e10.0 mm and a particle density, the total number of particles can be estimated. The mass loading per cubic meter can also be approximated. Because of the reasonable cost and simplicity of the sun photometer, i comparative measurements can now be made around the world. Atmospheric haze is the condition of reduced visibility caused by the presence of \ufb01ne particles or NO2 in the atmosphere, which can be uniform or layered (Figure 25.38). The particles must be 0.1e1.0 mm in diameter, the size range in which light scattering occurs. The source of these particles may be natural or anthropogenic. Atmospheric haze has been observed in both the western and eastern portions of the United States. Typical visual ranges in the East are <15 mi and in the Southwest >50 mi. The desire to protect visual air quality in the United States is focused on the national parks in the West. The ability to see vistas over 50e100 km in these locations makes them particularly vulnerable to atmospheric haze. This phenomenon is generally V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25.7 ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT OF ACIDIC DEPOSITION associated with diffuse or widespread atmospheric degradation as opposed to individual plumes.", "The major component of atmospheric haze is sulfate particulate matter (particularly ammonium sulfate), along with varying amounts of nitrate particulate matter, which in some areas can equal the sulfate. Other components include graphitic material, \ufb01ne \ufb02y ash, and organic aerosols. The haze-inducing PM can be primary, i.e. directly injected into the atmosphere, or secondary, formed in the atmosphere by gas-to-particle conversion processes. Optical measurements permit the quanti\ufb01cation of visibility degradation under different conditions. Several instruments are capable of measuring visual air quality, e.g. cameras, photometers, telephotometers, transmissometers, and scattering instruments. Photography can provide a permanent record of visibility conditions at a particular place and time. This type of record can preserve a scene in a photograph in a form similar to the way it is seen. Photometers measure light intensity by converting brightness to representative electric signals with a photodetector. Different lenses and \ufb01lters may be used to determine color and other optical properties. When used in combination with long-range lenses, photometers become telephotometers. This type of instrument may view distant objects with a much smaller viewing angle. The output of the photodetector is closely related to the perceived optical properties of distant targets. Telephotometers are often used to measure the contrast between a distant object and its surroundings, a measurement much closer to the human observer\u2019s perception of objects. A transmissometer is similar to a telephotometer except that the target is a known light source. If we know the characteristics of the source, the average extinction coef\ufb01cient over the path of the beam may be calculated. Transmissometers are not very portable in terms of looking at a scene from several directions. They are also very sensitive to atmospheric turbulence, which limits the length of the light beam. Scattering instruments are also used to measure visibility degradation. The most common instrument is the integrating nephelometer, which measures the light scattered over a range of angles. The physical design of the instrument, as shown in Figure 25.39, permits a point determination of the scattering coef\ufb01cient of extinction, bext.65 In clean areas, bext is dominated by scattering, so that the integrating nephelometer yields a measure of the extinction coef\ufb01cient. The bext can be related to visual range through the Koschmieder relationship, described above. Other measurements important to visual air quality are pollutant related, i.e. the size distribution, mass concentration, and number concentration of airborne particles and their chemical composition. From the size distribution, the Mie theory of light scattering can be used to calculate the scattering coef\ufb01cient. Table 25.9 summarizes the different types of visual monitoring methods. 25.7 ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT OF ACIDIC DEPOSITION The two components of acidic deposition are wet deposition and dry deposition. The collection and subsequent analysis of wet deposition are intuitively straightforward. A sample collector opens to collect rainwater at the beginning of a rainstorm and closes when the rain stops. The water is then analyzed for pH, anions (negative ions), and cations (positive ions). The situation for dry deposition is much more dif\ufb01cult.66 Collection of particles settling from the air is very dependent on the surface material and con\ufb01guration. The surfaces of trees, plants, and grasses are considerably different from that of the round, open-top canister often used to collect dry deposited particles. After collection, the material must be suspended or dissolved in pure water for subsequent analysis.", "V.

Report No. EPA-450/5-79-008. 25.7 ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT OF ACIDIC DEPOSITION An overview of acid rain monitoring activities in North America shows several national and regional programs in operation in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.67 The National Atmospheric Deposition Program has established the nationwide sampling network of w100 stations in the United States. The sampler is shown in Figure 25.40, including a wet deposition collection container. The wet collection bucket is covered with a lid when it is not raining. A sensor for rain moves the lid to open the wet collector bucket and cover the dry bucket at the beginning of a rainstorm. This process is reversed when the precipitation ends. The primary constituents to be measured are the pH of precipitation, sulfates, nitrates, ammonia, chloride ions, metal ions, phosphates, and speci\ufb01c conductivity. The pH measurements help to establish reliable longterm trends in patterns of acidic precipitation. The sulfate and nitrate information is related to anthropogenic sources where possible. The measurements of chloride ions, metal ions, and phosphates are related to sea spray and wind-blown dust sources. Speci\ufb01c conductivity is related to the level of dissolved salts in precipitation. The \ufb02owchart for analysis of wet and dry precipitation shown in Figure 25.40 includes the weight \u2212 Ca, Mg, Na, K 3\u2212 +", "Cl, PO4 , NH4 V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 25. METHODS FOR MEASURING AIR POLLUTANTS determinations, followed by pH and conductivity measurements and \ufb01nally chemical analysis for anions and cations. The pH measurements are made with a well-calibrated pH meter, with extreme care taken to avoid contaminating the sample. The metal ions Ca21,Mg21, Na1,and K1 are determined by \ufb02ame photometry, which involves absorption of radiation by metal ions in a hot \ufb02ame. Ammonia and the anions Cl ,SO2 ,NO3 4 and PO3 are measured by automated colorimetric 4 techniques. 25.8 MEASURING AIR TOXICS In addition to the criteria pollutants, there are numerous hazardous air pollutants that must also be measured. The characteristics of these pollutants vary considerably in inherent properties, including vapor pressure, ranging from entirely gas-phase to highly volatile to semivolatile to nonvolatile (e.g. sorbed to aerosols). The methods for the gas-phase fraction mirror those of the gas phase pollutants if they possess the key physical and chemical similarities, e.g. absorbance and \ufb02uorescence by UV, visible, or IR wavelengths. The compounds bound to particles may be analyzed by PM chemical constituent determinations, such as X-ray \ufb02uorescence. However, such methods do not provide the actual chemical forms (i.e. speciation), but merely give elemental composition. To ascertain speci\ufb01c compounds of concern will require wet chemistry and other more laborious approaches. Given the diversity of air toxics, individual methods of collection, handling, storage, extraction, separation and detection must be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of these compounds. To this end, air quality regulation agencies have developed compendia of methods. For example, the U.S. EPA maintains a set of 17 methods in a standardized format with a variety of applicable sampling methods, as well as several analytical techniques, for speci\ufb01c classes of organic pollutants, as appropriate to the speci\ufb01c pollutant compound, its level, and potential interferences. Consequently, this treatment allows the user \ufb02exibility in selecting alternatives to complement his or her background and laboratory capability. These methods may be modi\ufb01ed from time to time as advancements are made.68 The visual guide to the organization of the compendium for speci\ufb01c methods covering a variety of organic compounds is shown in Figure 25.41.

V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26 Applying and Interpreting Air Quality Monitoring Data 26.1 INTRODUCTION The methods described in Chapter 25 can be applied at various scales, from regional measurements of ozone to urban airsheds to neighborhoods to property adjacent to sources to microenvironments to personal. The representativeness and usefulness of air quality monitoring depend on the quality of each step from sample collection to sample preparation to analysis. Sampling is a statistical term, i.e. a sample is a subset of a population or domain from which information can be inferred about the entire population or domain. Thus, care must be taken to ensure the quality of every interdependent step in air quality measurements. Since the sample taken represents a very small fraction of the larger population or airshed from which the sample was taken, it requires a model to provide an estimate of the air quality (see Chapter 27). The model may be represented mathematically or spatially. For example, a sample of air may consist of a canister or bag that holds a de\ufb01ned quantity or air that will be subsequently analyzed. The sample is representative of an air mass or, more likely, a part of an air mass, such as zones around a source with isopleths of the concentration of an air pollutant. A number of samples must be collected and their results aggregated to ascertain with de\ufb01ned certainty the quality of an air mass. More samples will be needed for a large urban air shed than for that of a small town. Intensive sampling is often needed for highly toxic contaminants and for sites that may be particularly critical, e.g. near a hazardous waste site or in an \u201cat risk\u201d neighborhood (such as one near a manufacturing facility that uses large quantities of potentially toxic materials and that has asthmatic children living there). Similar to other statistical measures, environmental samples allow for statistical inference. In this case, inferences are made regarding the condition of an ecosystem and the extent and severity to which a human population is exposed to air pollutants. 26.2 STATIONARY MONITORING NETWORKS For most countries, the largest geographic scale of air quality monitoring is ambient monitoring with relatively low sampling density, e.g. one sampling site for every 100 km 1, depending on the pollutant and on the resources available.", "For example, monitors are sited to indicate the extent and severity of pollution for a county or an urban area. The coverage is determined by the particular pollutant of interest, combined with meteorological and terrain conditions. Some pollutants, like ozone and greenhouse gases, cover large areas, whereas other more reactive or highly toxic pollutants may only be detectable within a few meters of their source. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect human health and welfare. Perhaps the best introduction to large-scale ambient monitoring is to discuss each stationary site network separately. The networks have increased in sampling density and in the number of the compounds being measured. They have also been continuously enhanced as new technologies have become more reliable. The US standards are de\ufb01ned in terms of concentration and time span for a speci\ufb01c pollutant; for example, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for carbon monoxide is 9 parts per million by volume (ppmv) for 8 h, not to be exceeded more than once per year. For a state or local government to establish compliance with the NAAQS, measurements of the actual air quality must be made. To obtain these measurements, state and local governments have established stationary monitoring networks with instrumentation complying with federal speci\ufb01cations. From these measurements, regulating agencies determine whether a given location is attaining the air quality standard. If so, the area is said Fundamentals of Air Pollution 627 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00026-8 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 26. APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA FIGURE 26.1 Counties that have been designated nonattainment for National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) health standards, as of July 31, 2013. The largest areas are those not attaining one or two standards. The standards shown are for carbon monoxide, lead (both the original 1978 standard and the more stringent, revised standard of 2008), nitrogen dioxide, ozone (both the original 1997 8-h standard and the more stringent, revised 8-h standard of 2008), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10dboth the 1997 standards and the more stringent 2006 standard), and sulfur dioxide.

If not, the area is designated to be a nonattainment area. Figure 26.1 shows the US counties that are deemed to be nonattainment areas for any of the six of the NAAQS, i.e. particulates, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and lead (Pb). The county designations in Figure 26.1 are based on data from stationary monitoring networks. The stationary monitoring sites in these areas also operated to determine the impact of new sources of emissions. As part of the environmental impact statement and prevention of signi\ufb01cant deterioration processes, the projected impact of a new source on existing air quality must be assessed. Air quality monitoring is one means of making this type of assessment. A monitoring network is established at least 12 months before construction to determine prior air quality. Once the facility is completed and in operation, the network data determine the actual impact of the new source. The trends in atmospheric pollutants, such as O3,SO2, methane (CH4), nitric oxide (NO), NO2, and CO are measured in rural as well as urban locations. Atmospheric budgets of various gases are developed to allow estimation of whether sources are anthropogenic or natural. In addition, certain pollutants, such as Pb, are measured more intensively near known sources, such as smelters. A stationary monitoring network should yield the following information: (1) background concentration levels, (2) highest concentration levels, (3) representative concentration levels in high-density areas, (4) the impact of local sources, (5) the impact of remote sources, and (6) the relative impact of natural and anthropogenic sources. The spatial scale of an air quality monitoring network is determined by monitoring objectives. Spatial scales include personal (<1 m, one person), microscale (1e100 m), middle scale (100 me0.5 km), neighborhood scale (0.5e4.0 km), urban scale (4e50 km), and regional scale (tens to hundreds of km).", "Table 26.1 shows the relationship between spatial scale and monitoring objectives.1 Sampler siting within a network must meet the limitations of any individual sampling site and the relationship of sampling sites with each other.2 The overall approach for selection of sampling sites is (1) to de\ufb01ne the purpose of the collected data, (2) to assemble site selection aids, (3) to de\ufb01ne the general areas for samplers V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.2 STATIONARY MONITORING NETWORKS TABLE 26.1 Relationship of the Scale of Representativeness and Monitoring Objectives Siting Scales Monitoring Objectives Personal Personal cloud Personal, micro, middle, Highest concentration neighborhood (sometimes urban) affecting people Neighborhood, urban High-density population exposure Micro, middle, neighborhood Source impact Neighborhood, region General/background concentration based on chemical and meteorological constraints, and (4) to determine the \ufb01nal sites based on sampling requirements and surrounding objects.3 Several purposes of air quality monitoring were mentioned earlier, such as air quality standard compliance, long-term trends, and new facility siting. The tools available for site selection include climatological data, topography, population data, emission inventory data, and diffusion modeling. Climatological data are useful in relating meteorology to emission patterns. For example, elevated levels of photochemical oxidant are generally related to stagnant meteorological conditions and warm temperatures. Seasonal climatological patterns of prevailing winds and frequency of inversions will in\ufb02uence the location of sampling stations. Various types of maps are useful for establishing topography, population density, and location of sources of various pollutants. Wind roses overlaid with emission sources and population densities help to locate the general areas for location of samplers. Various types of dispersion models are available that can use as input emission patterns, climatological data, and population data to rank sampling locations by concentration threshold, resolution of peak concentrations, and frequency of exposure 4 or to rank sampling locations for maximum sensitivity to source emission changes, to provide coverage of as many sources or to cover as large a geographic area as possible.5 The last step in selecting speci\ufb01c sites is based on the following: availability of land and electrical power, security from vandalism, absence of nearby structures such as large buildings, probe height (inlet >3 m), and cost. An example of matching scale and objective is the determination of CO exposure of pedestrians on sidewalks in urban street canyons. The location of a station to meet this objective would be an elevation about 3 m on a street with heavy vehicular traf\ufb01c and large numbers of pedestrians. In the United States, ambient air quality monitoring is conducted by state and local agencies. The network consists of four major categories of monitoring stations: State and Local Air Monitoring Stations (SLAMS) National Air Monitoring Stations (NAMS) Special Purpose Monitoring Stations (SPMS) Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS). By far the most ambient sites are in SLAMS (see Figure 26.2). The networks include a variety of monitoring sites in general categories to measure the highest concentrations expected to occur in the area covered by V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26. APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA the network, as well as typical concentrations in areas of high population density. The network should also indicate the impact of substantial sources and source categories on ambient pollution levels, provide data on general background concentration levels, and information regarding the extent of regional pollutant transport among populated areas, including support of secondary standards. Some sites are also designed to ascertain air pollution impacts on visibility, vegetation damage, or other welfare-based impacts, to judge compliance with and progress toward meeting ambient air quality standards, to activate emergency control procedures that prevent or alleviate air pollution episodes, to show air pollution trends throughout the region, including nonurban areas, and to provide reliable and representative data for air pollution research. This research includes the evaluation of health effects; options for urban planning, land use, and transportation planning; development and evaluation of abatement strategies; and development, evaluation, and ground truthing of air quality models.6 26.3 AIR POLLUTANT PHASES Chapter 25 introduced measurement approaches for both gas-phase and particulate-phase pollutants. The United States, under the Clean Air Act, lists six principal, i.e. \u201ccriteria\u201d, pollutants for which EPA has established NAAQS. The four gas-phase criteria pollutants, i.e. carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, are gases at standard temperature and pressure. Monitoring programs need to interpret vapor measures as well, since many of the gas-phase pollutants are actually vapors, i.e. they are predominantly liquid under environmental conditions, but over time, partition to the atmosphere.", "Vapor-phase compounds, many hydrocarbons and organic solvents, must be quanti\ufb01ed to explain ground-level ozone. The smog results from a photochemical oxidation process involving hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, and other compounds, leading to the production of ozone. In addition, many of the air toxics are vapors, rather than ideal gases. For most air pollution assessment and control purposes, however, many of these vapors can be considered to be ideal gases. Indeed, the gas-phase detection equipment described in Chapter 24 treats them as gases. Particulate matter (PM) encompasses any particle, whether liquid or solid. For ambient air quality monitoring purposes, an aerosol is a liquid or solid particle that is suspended in the air. As discussed in Chapters 6 and 9, PM can be expressed as total suspended particulates (TSP); however, this is generally not reported for health purposes. More commonly, PM is differentiated by a particle\u2019s aerodynamic diameter, i.e. 2.5e10 mm diameter for PM10 and 2.5 mm diameter for PM2.5. The mass of PM in these size ranges per volume of air is usually reported. Both size ranges are regulated in many countries (see Table 26.2). For example, in the United States, the NAAQS for PM10 is a 24-h average of 150 mgm 3 (not to exceed this concentration more than once per year), and an annual average of 50 mgm 3 arithmetic mean.

The standard protecting public health (i.e. primary standard) is 12 mgm 3 for a 3-year annual mean (annual means averaged over 3 years). The standard protecting public welfare (i.e. secondary standard) is 15 mgm 3foran annual mean averaged over 3 years. The primary and secondary 24-h standard is 35 mgm 3 (98th percentile, averaged over 3 years).7 Particles in the atmosphere come from myriad sources, e.g. combustion, windblown dust, and gasto-particle conversion processes, as mentioned in Chapters 1 and 3. Figure 3.2 illustrates the wide range of particle diameters potentially present in the ambient atmosphere. A typical size distribution of ambient particles is shown in Figure 3.3. The distribution of number, surface, and mass can occur over different diameters for the same aerosol. Variation in chemical composition as a function of particle diameter has also been observed, as shown in Table 26.3. The percentages do not add up to 100% because they exclude oxygen (except for the nitrate and sulfate components), nitrogen (except for the nitrate component), hydrogen, and other components of the compounds of the listed elements in the form in which they actually exist in the atmosphere; for example, the most common form of particulate sulfur and sulfate in the atmosphere is (NH4)2(SO4). These mean chemical composition and atmospheric concentrations of suspended total, coarse, and \ufb01ne PM (total, coarse, and \ufb01ne) were measured over two decades ago. At that time, approximately 30% of the mass of PM is in the \ufb01ne fraction (<2.5 mm), 30% is in the coarse fraction (>15 mm), and 40% is coarser stilldbetween 15 and about 50 mm. These atmospheric concentrations and compositions have changed substantially since 1980. For much of the developed world, total, coarse, and \ufb01ne PM concentrations have fallen considerably (see Table 26.4). Note that the concentrations in Table 26.3 are in micrograms per cubic meter, but those in Table 26.4 are in nanograms per cubic meter. The tables are not exactly comparable, given that the 1980 data are for the United States generally, and the 2010 data are for a regional background site in Europe.", "However, the European site actually had higher mean PM2.5 concentrations than several other background sites in Europe (e.g. across Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Scandinavia, but lower than those in Switzerland, Italy, and Austria).8 Indeed,the PM at thesitewas high in organicmatter, sulfates, nitrates, ammonia, and crustal material, with only a small amount of elemental carbon, which likely means a lower contribution from combustion sources. The general downward trend can be tracked to increased pollution control and prevention efforts. In addition, the change in composition and amount of PM is in some manner affected by the economy. During the latter part of sampling, i.e. 2008e2010, Europe and much of the world suffered from an economic recession. Another factor is the change in meteorology, e.g. higher precipitation due to the North Atlantic Oscillation (i.e. pressure differences between Icelandic low-pressure and Azores high-pressure systems) especially affected winter PM concentrations.8 24.3.1 Pollutant Characterization Pollutants in the gas phase are usually characterized according to chemistry, i.e. oxidation state, fraction of speci\ufb01c compounds (i.e. chemical speciation), and half-life in the atmosphere. However, the gas-phase compounds can be expressed simply as atmospheric concentrations, e.g. 100 ng benzene per cubic meter of air, 500 mg of carbon monoxide in a room\u2019s air, or 3 ppb mercury in the ambient air. This is not the case for aerosols, which must be characterized in numerous ways. The vast majority of PM efforts has addressed the mass of PM by size, with smaller diameter PM being the principal concern. However, other characterizations are necessary. For example, morphology can make for a more or less toxic particle. The notable example is asbestos and other \ufb01bers, wherein aspect ratio (i.e. width:length) plays a major role in the type and severity of lung disease. Also, chemical constituents are important, e.g. the presence of toxic compounds and metals. Morphology is particularly important for the ultra\ufb01ne particle size range (aerodynamic diameter <0.1 mm). Particles include primary and secondary components. The primary component, i.e. those directly emitted from sources, frequently include aggregates of smaller particles. The secondary component consists of PM formed in the atmosphere after the emission. These often include sulfuric acid, sulfates, and nonvolatile to semivolatile organic transformation products. The common means of characterizing PM morphology is by electron microscopy. Unfortunately, these secondary products often vaporize during electron microscopy, so they are likely to be missed. Thus, current methods have at least two characterization weaknesses. First, the individual particle may be much smaller than what appears on the \ufb01lter, which is actually an aggregate of many smaller particles. The smaller particles have much greater surface area, so they are much more likely to aggregate on \ufb01lter media than larger particles. Second, the actual morphological measurement, e.g. scanning electron microscopy, is likely to alter the actual morphology and chemical constituency of the particle. While this is problematic for PM2.5, it is much worse for ultra\ufb01ne particles.9 V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26. APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA V.

The following are categories of air contaminant releases: \u0081 Fugitive dust resulting from \u0081 Wind erosion of contaminated soils \u0081 Vehicle travel over contaminated roadways \u0081 Volatilization release from \u0081 Covered land\ufb01lls (with and without gas generation) \u0081 Spills, leaks, and landforming \u0081 Lagoons The EPA has detailed procedures for conducting air pathway analysis for Superfund applications.10 Decision network charts are given for all expected situations. Figures 26.3 and 26.4 present the decision networks that guide contaminant release screening analysis. Figure 26.3 deals with contaminants in or under the soil and Figure 26.4 addresses aboveground wastes. Any release mechanisms evident at the site will require a further screening evaluation to determine the likely environmental fate of the contaminants involved. 26.4.1 Contaminant Fate Analysis Simpli\ufb01ed environmental fate estimation procedures are based on the predominant mechanisms of transport within each medium, and they generally disregard inter-media transfer or transformation processes. In general, they produce conservative estimates (i.e. reasonable upper bounds) for \ufb01nal ambient concentrations and the extent of hazardous substance migration. However, caution should be taken to avoid using inappropriate analytical methods that underestimate or overlook signi\ufb01cant pathways that affect human health. When more in-depth analysis of environmental fate is required, the analyst must select the modeling procedure that is most appropriate to the circumstances. In V.

Figures 26.5e26.7 present the decision network for screening contaminant fate in air, surface water, groundwater, and biota. Pathways must be further evaluated to determine the likelihood of population exposure. 26.4.1.1 Atmospheric Fate The following numbered paragraphs refer to particular numbered boxes in Figure 26.5: 1. The atmospheric fate of contaminants must be assessed whenever it is determined that signi\ufb01cant gaseous or airborne particulate contaminants are released from the site. The atmospheric fate of contaminants released originally to other media, but eventually partitioned to the atmosphere beyond site boundaries, must also be assessed whenever this intermedia transfer is likely to be signi\ufb01cant. 2. The predominant directions of contaminant movement will be determined by relative directional frequencies of wind over the site (as re\ufb02ected in area-speci\ufb01c wind rose data). Atmospheric stability and wind speeds determine off-site areas affected by ambient concentrations of gaseous contaminants. Usually, high stability and low-wind speed conditions result in higher atmospheric concentrations of gaseous contaminants close to the site. High stability and moderate wind speeds result in moderate concentrations over a larger downwind area. Low stability or high-wind speed conditions cause greater dispersion and dilution of contaminants, resulting in lower concentrations over larger areas. For particulate contaminants (including those adsorbed to dust or soil particles), ambient concentrations in the atmosphere and areas affected by airborne contaminants are determined by wind speed and stability and also by particle size distribution. High winds result in greater dispersion and cause particles to remain airborne longer (which may also increase release rates). Low winds and high stability result in rapid settling of particles and in a more concentrated contaminant plume closer to the site. Larger particles settle rapidly, decreasing the atmospheric concentrations with distance from the site. Finer particles remain airborne longer, and their behavior more closely approximates that of gaseous contaminants, as described. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.4 AIR POLLUTION FROM HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES Consider direction and rate of contaminant migration within waterbody.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26. APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA 3. Settling and rainout are important mechanisms of contaminant transfer from the atmospheric media to both surface soils and surface waters. Rates of contaminant transfer caused by these mechanisms are dif\ufb01cult to assess qualitatively; however, they increase with increasing soil adsorption coef\ufb01cients, solubility (for particulate contaminants or those adsorbed to particles), particle size, and precipitation frequency. Areas affected by signi\ufb01cant atmospheric concentrations of contaminants exhibiting the foregoing physical and chemical properties should also be considered as potentially affected by contaminant rainout and settling to surface media. Contaminants dissolved in rainwater may percolate to groundwater, run off or fall directly into surface waters, and adsorb to unsaturated soils. Contaminants settling to the surface through dry deposition may dissolve in or become suspended in surface waters or may be leached into unsaturated soils and groundwater by subsequent rainfall. Dry deposition may also result in formation of a layer of relatively high contamination at the soil surface. When such intermedia transfers are likely, one should assess the fate of contaminants in the receiving media. 4. If areas identi\ufb01ed as likely to receive signi\ufb01cant atmospheric contaminant concentrations include areas supporting edible biota, the biouptake of contaminants must be considered as a possible environmental fate pathway. Direct biouptake from the atmosphere is a potential fate mechanism for lipophilic contaminants. Biouptake from soil or water following transfer of contaminants to these media must also be considered as part of the screening assessments of these media. 26.4.1.2 Surface Water Fate The following numbered paragraphs refer to particular numbered boxes in Figure 26.6: 1.", "The aquatic fate of contaminants released from a site designated to be hazardous under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as those transferred to surface water from other media beyond site boundaries must be considered. 2. Direction of contaminant movement is usually clear only for contaminants introduced into rivers and streams. Currents, thermal strati\ufb01cation or eddies, tidal pumping, and \ufb02ushing in impoundments and estuaries render qualitative screening assessment of contaminant directional transport highly conjectural for these types of water bodies. In most cases, entire water bodies receiving contaminants must be considered potentially signi\ufb01cant human exposure points. More in-depth analyses or survey data may subsequently identify contaminated and unaffected regions of these water bodies. 3. Similarly, contaminant concentrations in rivers or streams can be roughly assessed based on rate of contaminant introduction and dilution volumes. Estuary or impoundment concentration regimes are highly dependent on the transport mechanisms enumerated. Contaminants may be localized and remain concentrated or may disperse rapidly and become diluted to insigni\ufb01cant levels. The conservative approach is to conduct a more in-depth assessment and use model results or survey data as a basis for determining contaminant concentration levels. 4. Important intermedia transfer mechanisms that must be considered where signi\ufb01cant surface water contamination is expected include transfers to groundwater where hydrogeology of the area indicates signi\ufb01cant surface wateregroundwater exchange, transfers to biota where waters contaminated with lipophilic substances support edible biotic species, and transfer to the atmosphere where surface water is contaminated by volatile substances. High temperatures, high surface area/ volume ratios, high wind conditions, and turbulent stream \ufb02ow also enhance volatilization rates. Contaminant transfer to bed sediments represents another signi\ufb01cant transfer mechanism, especially in cases where contaminants are in the form of suspended solids or are dissolved hydrophobic substances that can become adsorbed by organic matter in bed sediments. For the purposes of this chapter, sediments and water are considered part of a single system because of their complex interassociation. Surface waterebed sediment transfer is reversible; bed sediments often act as temporary repositories for contaminants and gradually rerelease contaminants to surface waters. Sorbed or settled contaminants are frequently transported with bed sediment migration or \ufb02ow. Transfer of sorbed contaminants to bottom-dwelling, edible biota represents a fate pathway potentially resulting in human exposure. Where this transfer mechanism appears likely, the biotic fate of contaminants should be assessed. 26.4.1.3 Soil and Ground Water Fate The following numbered paragraphs refer to particular numbered boxes in Figure 26.7: 1. The fate of contaminants in the soil medium is assessed whenever the contaminant release atmospheric, or fate screening, assessment results show that signi\ufb01cant contamination of soils is likely. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.4 AIR POLLUTION FROM HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES 2. The most signi\ufb01cant contaminant movement in soils is a function of liquid movement. Dry, soluble contaminants dissolved in precipitation, run-on, or human applied water will migrate through percolation into the soil. Migration rates are a function of net water recharge rates and contaminant solubility. 3. Important intermedia transfer mechanisms affecting soil contaminants include volatilization or resuspension to the atmosphere and biouptake by plants and soil organisms. These, in turn, introduce contaminants into the food chain. 26.4.2 Modeling An extremely dif\ufb01cult task is the estimation of emissions from hazardous waste sites. Frequently, both the amounts of materials existing within the site and the compounds and mixtures that are represented are not known. Even if both of these pieces of information are reasonably well known, the conditions of the containers holding these chemicals are not initially known. Hazardous materials may enter the air pathway by evaporation from leaking containers and release of these gases through \ufb01ssures and spaces between soil particles. Another pathway may release hazardous substances to the air if they are water soluble. Then groundwater passing leaking containers may carry substances to or near the surface, where they may be released to the air near the original source or at locations at signi\ufb01cant distances. 26.4.2.1 Estimates of Long-Term Impact If the foregoing problems of emissions estimation can be overcome, or if it is possible to make estimates of maximum possible and minimum possible emissions, then it is quite easy to make estimates of resulting long-term impact on the surrounding area. The representation of the emissions may be through consideration of an area source or area sources; or if vent pipes are releasing material or \ufb02aring the gases, point sources should be used.", "A single \ufb01nite line source method is used to simulate area sources in the long-term (seasons to years) Industrial Source Complex Long Term (ISCLT) model.11 Although this method has been criticized as frequently underestimating concentrations for receptors that are quite close to the area source (within two or three side lengths away), this model is usually used for these estimates. In addition to the long-term estimate of emission rate for each constituent to be modeled, the ISCLT model requires meteorological data in the form of a joint frequency distribution of three parameters: wind direction (in 16 classes), wind speed (in 6 classes), and Pasquill stability class (in 6 classes). As long as the emissions can be considered relatively constant over the period of simulation, the long-term estimates will represent mean concentrations over the period represented by the meteorological data. 26.4.2.2 Estimates of Short-Term Impact during Remediation If it is necessary to consider short-term (hours or days) impact, the point, area, and line (PAL) air quality model12 will do a superior simulation of the area sources and a similar simulation of any point sources as done by the ISCLT model. PAL also includes a version with deposition and settling algorithms. In addition to short-term emission estimates, normally for hourly periods, the meteorological data include hourly wind direction, wind speed, and Pasquill stability class. Although of secondary importance, the hourly data also include temperature (only important if buoyant plume rise needs to be calculated from any sources) and mixing height. The short-term model can then be used to estimate resulting concentrations during speci\ufb01c periods or to estimate concentrations for suspected adverse meteorological conditions, so that changes can be incorporated in the remediation process if concentrations are expected to be higher than desirable. 26.4.3 Assessment of a Hazardous Waste Site The contaminant cleanup process is shown in Figure 26.8. The \ufb01rst step of a contaminant cleanup is a preliminary assessment (PA). During the PA of a site, readily available information about a site and its surrounding area are collected to \u201cdistinguish between sites that pose little or no threat to human health and the environment and sites that may pose a threat and require further investigation\u201d.13 Any possible emergency response actions may also be identi\ufb01ed. A site inspection or site investigation (SI) is performed if the PA, based on limited data, calls for one (that is why this step is often referred to as the PA/SI).14 In the United States, certain hazardous waste sites are considered to be of suf\ufb01cient concern to be \u201clisted\u201d on the National Priority List (NPL). The listing is actually a combination of the hazard (usually toxicity) of the contaminants found at the site and the likelihood that people or ecosystems will be exposed to these pollutants. Severely polluted sites and sites that contain very toxic compounds in measurable quantities are ranked higher than those with less toxic substances in lesser quantities. A public disclosure of the condition following contaminant treatment must be made. This \ufb01nal record of decision (ROD) indicates that the speci\ufb01c engineering remedy has been selected for the site. Like any other V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.

Since public of\ufb01cials are not exempt from personal tort liabilities in their decisions, the ROD is usually made as a collective, agency decision based on past and ongoing contaminant measurements, and includes provisions for monitoring for years to come to ensure that the engineered systems continue to perform according to plan. The ROD must also ensure that a plan for operating and maintaining all systems is in place, including a plan for dealing with failures and other unexpected contingencies, such as improvements in measurement techniques that later identify previously undetected pollutants. Scientists conduct exposure assessments to evaluate the kind and magnitude of exposure to contaminants. Such assessments are usually site speci\ufb01c for clearly identi\ufb01ed contaminants of concern. For example, they may be conducted for an abandoned hazardous waste site or a planned industrial facility.", "For the former site, the list of contaminants of concern would be based on sampling and analysis of the various environmental compartments, while the latter would be based on the types of chemicals to be used or generated in the construction and operation of the industrial facility. Thus, the assessment considers sources of contaminants, pathways through which contaminants are moving or will be moving, and routes of exposure where the contaminants \ufb01nd their way to receptors (usually people, but also receptors in ecosystems, such as \ufb01sh and wildlife). Table 26.5 includes some of the most important considerations in deciding on the quality of information needed to conduct an exposure assessment. The necessary information to quantify is determined by both the characteristics of the contaminant and the route of exposure. 26.4.3.1 The Hazard Quotient The hazard quotient (HQ) is the ratio of the potential exposure to a speci\ufb01c contaminant to the concentration at which no adverse effects are expected (known as the reference dose or RfD). The HQ is the ratio of a single contaminant exposure, over a speci\ufb01ed time period, to a RfD for that contaminant, derived from a similar exposure period: Exposure HQ \u00bc (26.1) RfD If the calculated HQ is less than 1, no adverse health effects are expected to occur at these contaminant V.

Have the soil depths been speci\ufb01ed? Do soil data represent surface soil data (>3 in in depth) or subsurface soil data (0.3 in in depth)? If soil depth is known, but does not meet surface or subsurface soil de\ufb01nitions, designate the data as soil and specify the depth (e.g. 0e6 in). If the soil depth is unknown, the health assessor should designate the data as unspeci\ufb01ed soil. Has soil been de\ufb01ned in the data? If not, the health assessor should assume soil includes any unconsolidated natural material or \ufb01ll above bedrock that is not considered to be soil and excludes man-made materials such as slabs, pavements, or driveways of asphalt, concrete, brick, rock, ash, or gravel. A soil matrix may consist of pieces of each of these materials. Do soil data include uphill and downhill samples and upwind and downwind samples both on and off the site? Sediment Have the sediment samples been identi\ufb01ed as grab samples or cores? Was the depth of the samples speci\ufb01ed? Was the sampling program designed to collect sediment samples at regular intervals along a waterway or from depositional areas or both? Do the sediment data include results for upstream and downstream samples both on-and off-site? Has sediment been de\ufb01ned by the samplers? (To prevent confusion between sediment and soil, assume \u201csediment\u201d is de\ufb01ned as any solid material, other than waste material or waste sludge that lies below a water surface, that has been naturally deposited in a waterway, water body, channel, ditch, wetland, or swale, or that lies on a bank, beach, or \ufb02oodway land where solids are deposited.) Have any sediment removal activities (e.g. dredging, excavation) occurred that may have altered the degree of sediment contamination (leading to a false negative). This becomes important when the following occur: 1. Sediment contamination in \ufb01shable waters is used to justify sampling and analyses of edible biota. 2. Sediment data are used to justify additional downstream sampling, particularly at points of exposure and in areas not subject to past removal activities. 3. The signi\ufb01cance of past exposure is assessed. Surface water Do surface water data include results for samples both upstream and downstream of the site? Was information obtained on the number of surface water samples taken at each station, as well as the frequency, duration, and dates of sampling?

If the calculated HQ is greater than 1, there is a likelihood that adverse action can occur at these concentrations.", "For example, the chromic acid (Cr6\u00fe) 3 11 mists dermal chronic RfD of 6.00 10 mg kg day . If the actual dermal exposure of people living near a plant is calculated (e.g. by intake or lifetime average 3 11 daily dose) to be 4.00 10 mg kg day , the HQ is 2/3 or 0.67. Since this is less than 1, one would not expect people chronically exposed at this level to show adverse effects from skin contact. However, at this same chronic 3 11 exposure, i.e. 4.00 10 mg kg day , to hexavalent chromic acid mists via oral route, the RfD is 3 11 3.00 10 mg kg day , meaning the HQ \u00bc 4/3 or 1.3. The value is greater than 1, so we cannot rule out adverse noncancer effects. The calculated HQ value cannot be translated into a probability that adverse health effects will occur (i.e. it is not actually a metric of risk). The HQ is merely a benchmark that can be used to estimate the likelihood of risk.15 It is not even likely to be proportional to the risk. So, an HQ 0.1 does not necessarily mean that adverse effects will occur. Noncancer hazard estimates often have substantial uncertainties from a variety of sources. Scienti\ufb01c estimates of contaminant concentrations, exposures, and risks always incorporate assumptions to the application of available information and resources. Uncertainty analysis is the process used by scientists to characterize just how good or bad the data are in making these estimates. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26. APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA 26.4.3.2 The Hazard Index The HQ values are for individual contaminants. The hazard index (HI) is the sum of more than one HQ value to express the level of cumulative noncancer hazard associated with inhalation of multiple pollutants (e.g. certain classes of compounds, such as solvents, pesticides, dioxins, fuels): n X HI \u00bc HQ (26.2) 1 An HI can be developed for all pollutants measured, such as the 32 compounds measured in New Jersey as part of the National Air Toxics Assessment (Figure 26.9). An HI can also be site speci\ufb01c. For example, if an environmental audit shows that only CCl4 and Cr6\u00fe were detected by sampling of soil. Recall that the previously calculated Cr6\u00fe dermal HQ was 0.67. The dermal chronic 4 11 RfD of CCl4 is 4.55 10 mg kg day .Ifthe exposure 4 11 is 1.00 10 mg kg day , the HQ for chronic dermal exposure to tetrachloromethane is 1.00/4.55 \u00bc 0.22. Thus, the HI for this site is 0.67 \u00fe 0.22 \u00bc 0.89. Since the HI is under 1, the noncancer effect is not expected at these levels of exposure to the two compounds. 1996 estimated county median noncancer hazard all noncarcinogens \u2013 New Jersey counties FIGURE 26.9 Noncancer hazard index for 32 air toxics included in the Clean Air Act, based on inhalation exposure data in New Jersey from political subdivisions. Estimates do not include indoor emissions and are based on exposure estimates for the median individual within each census tract, which EPA considers to be a \u201ctypical\u201d exposure, meaning that individuals may have substantially higher or lower exposures based on their activities. US Environmental Protection Agency. National Air Toxics Assessment. However, if the chronic dermal exposure to CCl4 had 4 11 been 2.00 10 mg kg day , the HQ for CCl4 would have been 0.44, and the HI would have been calculated as 0.67 \u00fe 0.44 \u00bc 1.11. This is a benchmark that indicates that the cumulative exposures to the two contaminants may lead to noncancer effects. 26.4.3.3 Comprehensive Risk Communication The amount of data and information regarding contaminant concentrations, exposure, and effects can be overwhelming when presented to the public and clientele. Thus, these data must be reduced into meaningful formats. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Urban Air Toxic Monitoring Program16 provides an example of how to collect measurements to support actions aimed at reducing potential air pollution risks in large urban areas with many industrial sources. Air quality samples were collected between 1989 and 1997 near a large industrial area in Cuyahoga County. The contaminant concentrations are typical of urban areas, and the concentrations are expected to decrease in coming years. Samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).", "The state agency conducted a risk assessment based on both the cancer and noncancer health risks, assuming that an individual is exposed constantly to the same concentration of the pollutant for a lifetime (i.e. exposure duration \u00bc total lifetime). The results of the cancer health risk assessment are provided in Table 26.6. Heavy metals contributed the majority of the cancer risk (about 66%). Each category in the table shows the cumulative risks from exposure to all compounds detected under a speci\ufb01c contaminant class. The US EPA has generally considered acceptable exposure risks for individual compounds to range from 10 6 to 10 4. Commonly, only one or a few contaminants are contributing the lion\u2019s share of risk to each contaminant class. For example, a particularly carcinogenic PAH, like benzo(a)pyrene or dibenz(a,h)anthracene (each with a TABLE 26.6 Cumulative Cancer Risk Based on Air Sampling in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, 1989e1997 Source of Cancer Risk Total Estimated Risk VOCs 0.515 10 4 Heavy metals 1.21 410 PAHs 0.123 10 4 Total carcinogenic risk 1.85 410 Source: Ohio Environmental Protection Agency; 1999.

In fact, this appears to be the case when looking at the individual chemical species listed in Table 26.7 that were used to derive the risks. Likewise, the VOC cancer risk was largely determined by the concentrations of benzene, while the heavy metals, although largely in\ufb02uenced by hexavalent chromium (Cr6\u00fe), were more evenly affected by arsenic and cadmium. The cancer risk calculations are based on the unit risk estimate (URE), which is the upper bound excess lifetime cancer risk that may result from continuous exposure to an agent at a de\ufb01ned concentration. For inhalation, this concentration is 1 mgm 3 in air. For example, if the URE \u00bc 1.5 10 6per mgm 3, then 1.5 excess tumors are expected to develop per million population being exposed daily for a lifetime to 1 mg of the contaminant per cubic meter of air. The cancer risk reported for each individual contaminant is below the level designated by federal health agencies as acceptable, and falls with the range of risks expected for large cities, with their numerous sources of toxic air contaminants (i.e. the so-called \u201curban soup\u201d). The noncancer HI calculations are provided in Table 26.8. Noncarcinogenic health effects include developmental, reproductive, or cardiovascular health V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.

Any total HI number below 1 is generally regarded as a safe level of exposure.a As was the case for cancer risk, a few compounds can drive the noncancer HI. For example, the case above, 3-chloropropene and tetrachloromethane, accounts for an HI of 0.53, while all the other measured VOCs account for only 0.10.", "And, these two compounds account for almost 82% of the total noncarcinogenic risk estimates. 26.5 QUALITY ASSURANCE Air quality monitoring for standards compliance, new facility siting, and long-term trend measurement has been going on for many years. Historically, a large number of federal, state, and local organizations, both governmental and nongovernmental, have been using a variety of technologies and approaches to obtain air quality data. This has resulted in multiple data sets of variable accuracy and precision. Questionable or con\ufb02icting air quality data are of little value in ascertaining compliance with air quality standards, determining whether air quality is improving or worsening in a given region over an extended period, or understanding the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere. In order to minimize the collection of questionable air quality data, the US EPA has established and implemented stringent regulations requiring well-documented quality assurance programs for air quality monitoring activities.1 Quality assurance programs are designed to serve two functions: (1) assessment of collected air quality data and (2) improvement of the data collection process. These two functions form a loop; as air quality data are collected, procedures are implemented to determine whether the data are of acceptable precision and accuracy. If they are not, increased quality control procedures are implemented to improve the data collection process. The components of a quality assurance program are designed to serve the two functions just mentionedd control and assessment. Quality control operations are de\ufb01ned by operational procedures, speci\ufb01cations, calibration procedures, and standards and contain the following components: 1. Description of the methods used for sampling and analysis 2. Sampling manifold and instrument con\ufb01guration 3. Appropriate multipoint calibration procedures 4. Zero/span checks and record of adjustments 5. Control speci\ufb01cation checks and their frequency 6. Control limits for zero, span, and other control limits 7. The corrective actions to be taken when control limits are exceeded 8. Preventative maintenance 9. Recording and validation of data 10. Documentation of quality assurance activities Table 26.9 contains a speci\ufb01c example of these components for ambient monitoring for ozone. In addition to ful\ufb01lling the in-house requirements for quality control, state and local air monitoring networks that are collecting data for compliance purposes are required to have an external performance audit on an annual basis. Under this program, an independent organization supplies externally calibrated sources of air pollutant gases to be measured by the instrumentation undergoing audit. An audit report summarizes the performance of the instruments. If necessary, further action must be taken to eliminate any major discrepancies between the internal and external calibration results. Data quality assessment requirements are related to precision and accuracy. Precision control limits are established, i.e. 110% of span value: di \u00bc yi xixi 100 (26.3) where, di is the percentage difference, yi the analyzer\u2019s indicated concentration of the test gas for the ith precision check, and xi the known concentration of the test gas for the ith precision check. The average percentage difference needs to be calculated for a given period, often for each quarterly reporting period to comply with air pollution regulations. This average difference is calculated as n X 1 dav \u00bc di (26.4) n i\u00bc1 a However, it should be noted that any quantitative or semi-quantitiative expression like the HI includes uncertainty. Thus, the \u201csafety\u201d must include con\ufb01dence intervals or other depictions of uncertainty. For example, if the con\ufb01dence only allows an HI to be reported as 0.65 to 1.22, this would not be considered to be safe, since the interval could indeed be a noncancer risk above 1. V.

The data used in these decisions are never completely free of error and always contain some level of uncertainty. Thus, for example, it is possible that decision makers may declare an area \u201cnonattainment\u201d when the area is actually in \u201cattainment\u201d, i.e. a false rejection (Figure 26.10) or to declare an area to be in \u201cattainment\u201d when actually it is not meeting the ambient standard, i.e. a false acceptance (Figure 26.11). Ambient air measurements require much coordination to ensure quality. In the United States, a primary quality assurance organization (PQAO) is a monitoring organization or a group of monitoring organizations that share a number of quality assurance factors.17 The measurement uncertainty among all stations in the organization is expected to be reasonably homogeneous in light of common factors, including 1. Operation by a common team of \ufb01eld operators according to a common set of procedures; 2. Use of a common QAPP or standard operating procedures; 3. Common calibration facilities and standards; 4. Oversight by a common quality assurance organization; and 5. Support by a common management, laboratory, or headquarters. For some pollutants, the number of monitoring sites in a PQAO may be used to determine the number and frequency of quality control checks, including the number of collocated monitors and audit frequencies. Data assessments for completeness, precision, and bias are aggregated at the PQAO level. The common factors are the key criteria to be used when an agency decides the sites to be considered for aggregation to a PQAO. There are cases where state, local, and tribal monitoring organizations have consolidated to one PQAO. All of the factors do not always have to be ful\ufb01lled, but common protocols and quality assurance plans are often needed to consolidate sites. Figure 26.12 shows the relationship of pollutants monitored at unique sites and how these unique sites can relate to monitoring organizations and PQAOs. In the case of PQAO #1, a tribal monitoring organization and local monitoring organization have common factors that allow for consolidation.18 An air monitoring plan must be in place before samples are collected and arrive at the laboratory. The plan includes quality assurance provisions and describes the procedures to be employed. These procedures must be strictly followed to investigate environmental conditions.

Data quality objectives (DQOs) are qualitative and quantitative statements that clarify the purpose of the study, de\ufb01ne the most appropriate type of information to collect, determine the most appropriate conditions from which to collect that information, V.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.5 QUALITY ASSURANCE apparatus (e.g. real-time probes, sample bags, bottles, and soil cores), the number of samples needed, sample handling, and transportation. The quality and quantity of samples are determined by the DQOs, which are de\ufb01ned by the objectives of the overall contaminant assessment plan (together the assessment plan and quality assurance (QA) plan is a quality assurance project plan or QAPP). The DQOs can be either qualitative or quantitative statements that translate nontechnical project goals into scienti\ufb01c and engineering outputs needed to answer technical questions.19 Quantitative DQOs specify a required level of scienti\ufb01c and data certainty, while qualitative DQOs express decisions goals without specifying those goals in a quantitative manner. Even when expressed in technical terms, DQOs must specify the decision that the data will ultimately support, but not the manner that the data will be collected. DQOs guide the determination of the data quality that is needed in both the sampling and analytical efforts. The US EPAhas listed three examples of the range of detail of quantitative and qualitative DQOs20: Example of a less detailed, quantitative DQO: Determine with greater than 95% con\ufb01dence that an emission does not pose a human exposure hazard. Example of a more detailed, quantitative DQO: Determine to a 90% degree of statistical certainty whether or not the concentration of mercury released from a site is less than 1 ppbv. Example of a detailed, qualitative DQO: Determine the proper disposition of each canister delivered in real time using a dynamic work plan and a \ufb01eld method able to turnaround lead (Pb) results on the air samples within 2 h of sample collection. Thus, if the condition in question is tightly de\ufb01ned, e.g. the hourly change in the emission of formaldehyde from a particular vent, a small number of samples or real-time probes would be de\ufb01ned as the DQO. Conversely, if the environmental assessment is more complex and larger in scale, e.g. the characterization of year-round outdoor and indoor air quality of an environmental justice neighborhood, the sampling plan\u2019s DQO may dictate that numerous samples at various points be continuously sampled for wide range of inorganic and organic contaminants. This is even more complicated when nonchemical stressors are of concern, e.g. pollen and other bioaerosols, nanoparticles, electromagnetic radiation, and odors. The sampling plan may have to include media other than the air, e.g. soil, water, and biota, such as near a hazardous waste site. The sampling and analysis plan should explicitly point out which methods will be used. For example, if toxic chemicals are being monitored, the US EPA speci\ufb01es speci\ufb01c sampling and analysis methods.21e23 The geographic area where data are to be collected is de\ufb01ned by distinctive physical features such as volume or area, e.g. metropolitan city limits, property boundaries down to a depth of 6 cm, a speci\ufb01c group of homes, the length along a shoreline, or the natural habitat range of a particular animal species. Care should be taken to de\ufb01ne boundaries. For example, Figure 26.13 shows a V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26. APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA sampling grid, with a sample taken from each cell in the grid.22 The target population may be divided into relatively homogeneous subpopulations within each area or subunit. This can reduce the number of samples needed to meet the tolerable limits on decision errors and to improve ef\ufb01ciency. Time is another essential parameter that determines the type and extent of monitoring needed. Conditions vary over the course of a study due to changes in weather conditions, seasons, operation of equipment, and human activities. These include seasonal changes in groundwater levels, seasonal differences in farming practices, daily or hourly changes in airborne contaminant levels, and intermittent pollutant discharges from industrial sources. Such variations must be considered during data collection and in the interpretation of results. Some examples of environmental time-sensitivity are \u0081 concentrations of lead in dust on windowsills may show higher concentrations during the summer when windows are raised and paint/dust accumulates on the windowsill; \u0081 terrestrial background radiation levels may change due to shielding effects related to soil dampness; \u0081 amount of pesticides on surfaces may show greater variations in the summer because of higher temperatures and volatilization; \u0081 instruments that may not give accurate measurements when temperatures are colder; and \u0081 airborne PM measurements that may not be accurate if the sampling is conducted in the wetter winter months rather than the drier summer months.", "Feasibility should also be considered. This includes gaining legal and physical access to the properties, equipment acquisition and operation, and environmental conditions, times, and conditions when sampling is prohibited (e.g. freezing temperatures, high humidity, and noise). Basically, the DQOs frame the amount and type of uncertainty that can be tolerated. This remains a challenge for air pollution. As mentioned, measurements of ambient air quality are typically made at one or a few sites in an airshed in order to determine the compliance of air quality data with ambient air quality standards. For example, sites vary considerably regarding emission densities and dispersion, meteorology, topography, street topography, and other conditions. Thus, the minimum numbers and locations of monitors need to be justi\ufb01ed scienti\ufb01cally. The more heterogeneous the area, the greater the number of monitoring sites that will be needed. Spatial variability informs this somewhat decision in part, e.g. known differences in ambient concentrations across the airshed. In a way, the monitor provides information about a relatively homogeneous parcel within the heterogeneous airshed, so spatial representativeness of a monitoring site may be de\ufb01ned as the area within which pollutant concentrations are approximately 25 constant. 26.6 MONITORING PLAN EXAMPLE Consider a plan to measure mobile source air toxic (MSAT) concentrations and variations in concentrations as a function of distance from the highway and to establish relationships between MSAT concentrations as related to highway traf\ufb01c \ufb02ows including traf\ufb01c count, vehicle types and speeds, and meteorological conditions such as wind speed and wind direction. Speci\ufb01cally, the monitoring plan has the following goals26: 1. Identify the existence and extent of elevated air pollutants near roads. 2. Determine how vehicle operations and local meteorology in\ufb02uence near-road air quality for criteria and toxic air pollutants. 3. Collect data that will be useful in evaluating and re\ufb01ning, if necessary, models used to determine the emissions and dispersion of motor vehicle-related pollutants near roadways. Such a complex monitoring effort requires management and technical staff with a diversity of skills that can be brought to bear on the implementation of this project. This diverse skill set includes program management, contracts administration, \ufb01eld monitoring experience, laboratory expertise, and QA oversight. The purpose of any site selection process is to gather and analyze suf\ufb01cient data that would lead one to draw informed conclusions regarding the selection of the most appropriate site for the monitoring at a speci\ufb01c location. Moreover, the site selection process needs to include programmatic issues to ensure an informed decision is reached. Selecting a monitoring site must be based on scienti\ufb01c and feasibility factors, as shown in Table 26.10 and Figure 26.14. Each step has varying degrees of complexity due to \u201creal-world\u201d issues. The \ufb01rst step was to determine site selection criteria (see Table 26.11). The follow-on steps include (1) develop list of candidate sites and supporting information; (2) apply site selection \ufb01lter (\u201ccoarse\u201d and \u201c\ufb01ne\u201d), (3) site visit; (4) select candidate site(s) via team discussion; (5) obtain site access permission(s); and (6) implement site logistics. A list of candidate sites based on these criteria can then be developed. Geographic information system (GIS) data, tools, and techniques and on-site visits would be used to compare various sites that meet these criteria. Quite commonly, even a well-designed monitoring plan will need to be adjusted during the V.

For example, investigators may discover barriers or differing conditions from what was observed in the planning phase (e.g. different daily traf\ufb01c counts or new road construction).

The use of spatial tools in decision processes is increa sing.27a,27b Until recently, the use of GIS and other spatial tools in decision processes have required the acquisition of large amounts of the data. In addition, the software has not been user-friendly. GIS data have now become more readily available in both quantity and quality, and GIS exists in common operating system environments. Typical data layers that are required are the location of suitable soils, wells, surface water sources, residential areas, schools, airports, roads, etc. From these data, layers queries are formulated to provide the most suitable sites (e.g. depth to water table may help identify sources of pollution). Typically, quantitative weighting criteria are associated with the siting criteria as well as elements of the data layers (e.g. certain types of soils would be more suitable than others and thus would have applicable quantitative values).28 26.7 LABORATORY ANALYSIS Although real-time analysis of air and other media is becoming more commonplace, many if not most air samples must continue to be brought to a laboratory analyzed after collection. The steps that must be taken to interpret the concentration of air pollutant in the sample are known as \u201cwet chemistry\u201d. 26.7.1 Extraction When an environmental sample arrives at the laboratory, the next step may be \u201cextraction\u201d. Extraction is needed when the actual sample collection was by trapping the chemicals onto sorbents; meaning that the V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.7 LABORATORY ANALYSIS chemicals must \ufb01rst be freed from the sorbant matrix. It would not be needed for air samples that can be carried into the chromatograph. However, numerous toxic chemicals have low vapor pressures and may not be readily dissolved in water. Thus, they may be found in various media, e.g. sorbed to particles, in the gas phase, or in the water column suspended to colloids (and very small amounts dissolved in the water itself). To collect such chemicals in the gas phase, a common method calls for trapping it on polyurethane foam (PUF) or other sorbants. To analyze semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in the air, the PUF or other sorbing media must be extracted.", "Since SVOCs partition between air and particles, to determine the amount of SVOC in PM requires extraction. Indeed, extraction is arguably one of most important and limiting steps in measuring some of the most toxic air pollutants, including the halogenated dioxins, persistent pesticides and products of incomplete combustion, e.g. PAHs (see Discussion Box: Laboratory Analysis of Semivolatile Organic Compounds). sometimes certain analytes cannot be detected directly with MS (e.g. highly polar compounds must \ufb01rst be derivatized). Thus, other detection systems, such as ultraviolet (UV) light, may need to be employed. The drawback is that the detection limits are often higher than that of MS. Analytes eluted from the capillary column are introduced into the mass spectrometer using a jet separator or a direct connection. Identi\ufb01cation of target analytes is accomplished by comparing their mass spectra with the electron impact (or electron impactlike) spectra of authentic standards (i.e. by the mass to charge [m/z] ratios of the molecular fragments). The column is selected based on the retention time (RT) of the particular SVOC. However, the most commonly used column for SVOCs is 30 m 0.25 mm or 0.32 mm interior diameter (ID) 1 mm \ufb01lm thickness silicone-coated fused-silica capillary column (J&W Scienti\ufb01c DB-5 or equivalent). Quantitation is accomplished by comparing the response of a major (quantitation) ion relative to an internal standard using a \ufb01ve-point calibration curve that has been prepared in a solvent of known concentrations of the target SVOC. Interference is a problem, since SVOCs are ubiquitous in the environment (e.g. phthalates are used as plasticizers even in laboratory settings). Thus, GC/MS data from all blanks, samples, and spikes must be evaluated for such interferences. SVOC Chromatography Example Consider the situation where an analytical laboratory has generated the following chromatogram and table (Continued ) DISCUSSION BOX Laboratory Analysis of Semivolatile Organic Compounds As mentioned in Chapter 25, the compendium of air toxic methods is a valuable resource. Thus, for sampling and analyzing SVOCs, a good place to state is the US EPA\u2019s \u201cMethod 1613\u201d, Tetra-through octa-chlorinated dioxins and furans by isotope dilution high resolution gas chromatograph/high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) (Rev. B); as well as the USEPA\u2019s \u201cRCRA SW846 Method 8290\u201d, Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) by HRGC/HRMS. For air, the best method is the PS-1 high-volume sampler system described in US EPA \u201cMethod TO-9A\u201d in Compendium of Methods for the Determination of Toxic Organic Compounds in Ambient Air, Second Edition, EPA/625/R-96/010b (1999). The extraction can be by solvent extraction, by supercritical \ufb02uid extraction (SFE), or by other techniques depending on the compound and the sorbant used to collect it. The procedure to analyze SVOCs begins with preparation of the sample for analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using the appropriate sample preparation (e.g. EPA Method 3500) and, if necessary, sample cleanup procedures (i.e. EPA Method 3600). Next, the extract is introduced into the GC/MS by injecting the sample extract into a GC with a narrow-bore fused-silica capillary column. The GC column is temperature programmed to separate the analytes, which are then detected with a mass spectrometer connected to the gas chromatograph. This is usually preferred; however, V.

Then you could calculate (actually the HPLC software will calculate) the calibration curve. So, for example, if a peak with an area of 200 is associated 24.53 Retention Time Area Type Area/Height Area % 18.29 NA NA NA 0.1 21.31 NA NA NA 31.4 21.91 NA NA NA 0.2 24.53 NA NA NA 67.2 26.25 NA NA NA 1.1 Even with the missing entries in the table, one can still ascertain certain information. What are the RTs of compound A and B? Which compound is present in a larger amount? Which compound has the higher boiling point? What would happen to the RTs of compounds A and B if the column temperature were raised? What if compound B were suspected to be benzo(a)pyrene based on company records and the type of industries nearby? Thoughtful targeting of laboratory studies can answer these questions. The RT of compound A is 21.31 min, shown above the peak and in the table\u2019s RT column. The RT of compound B is 24.53 min.", "You cannot tell from this table or chromatogram which compound is present in a larger amount, since the only way to do so is to have calibration curve from known concentrations of compound A and compound B (at least three, but preferably \ufb01ve). For example, you would run the HPLC successively with injections of pure solutions of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mgl 1 concentrations of compound A, and again with pure solutions of the same concentrations of compound B. These concentrations would give peak areas associated with each known with 1 mgl 1 of compound A and a peak with an area of 2000 is associated with 10 mgl 1 of compound A (i.e. a linear calibration curve) at 21.31 min after the aliquot is injected into the HPLC, then when you run your unknown sample and a peak at 21.31 min with an area of 1000 would mean you have about 5 mgl 1 concentration of compound A in your sample. The same procedure would be followed to draw a calibration curve for compound B at an RT of 24.53 min. The reason it is not suf\ufb01cient to look at the percent area is that each compound is physically and chemically different, and recall from the BeereLambert law (see Chapter 25) that the amount of energy absorbed (in this case, the UV light) is what gives us the peak. If a molecule of compound A absorbs UV at this wavelength (i.e. 254 nm) at only 25% as that of compound B, compound A\u2019s concentration would be higher than that of compound B (because even though compound B has twice the percent area, its absorbance is four times that of compound B). Compound A has the lower boiling point since it comes off the column \ufb01rst. Of course, this is only true if other factors, especially polarity, are about the same. For example, if compound B has about the same polarity as the column being used, but compound A has a very different polarity, compound A will have a greater tendency to leave the column. Generally, however, RT is a good indicator of boiling point; i.e. lower RTs mean lower boiling points. If the column temperature were raised, both compounds A and B would come off the column in a shorter time. Thus, the RTs of both compounds A and B would be shorter than before the temperature was raised. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.7 LABORATORY ANALYSIS DISCUSSION BOX (cont\u2019d ) To determine whether the peak at 24.53 min is benzo(a) pyrene, you must \ufb01rst obtain a true sample of pure benzo(a)pyrene to place in a standard solution. This is the same process as you used to develop the calibration curve above. That is, you would inject this standard of known benzo(a)pyrene into the same HPLC and the same volume of injection. If the standard gives a peak at an RT at about 25 min, there is a good chance it is benzo(a)pyrene. As it turns out, benzo(a)pyrene absorbs UV at 254 nm and does come off an HPLC column at about 25 min. The column type also affects RT and peak area. The one used by the laboratory is commonly used for PAHs, including benzo(a)pyrene. However, numerous columns can be used for SVOCs, so both the RT and peak area will vary somewhat. Another concern is coelution, i.e. two distinct compounds that have nearly the same RTs. One means of reducing the likelihood of coelution is to target the wavelength of the UV detector. For example, the recommended wavelength for benzo(a)pyrene is 254 nm, but 295 nm is preferred by environmental chromatographers because the interference peak in the benzo(a)pyrene window is decreased at 295 nm. Another way to improve detection is to use a diode array detection system with the UV detector. This gives a number of different chromatograms simultaneously at various wavelengths. Finally, there are times when certain detection systems are completely unable to detect a speci\ufb01c molecule. For example, if a molecule does not absorb UV light (i.e. it lacks a group of atoms in a molecule responsible for absorbing the UV radiation, known as chromophores), there is no way to use any UV detector. In this case another detector, e.g. MS, must be used. Extraction makes use of physics and chemistry. For example, many compounds can be simply extracted with solvents, usually at elevated temperatures. A common solvent extraction is the Soxhlet extractor, named after the German food chemist, Franz Soxhlet (1848e1913).", "The Soxhlet extractor (the US EPA Method 3540) removes sorbed chemicals by passing a boiling solvent through the media. Cooling water condenses the heated solvent and the extract is collected over an extended period, usually several hours. Other automated techniques apply some of the same principals as solvent extraction, but allow for more precise and consistent extraction, especially when large volumes of samples are involved. For example, SFE brings a solvent, usually carbon dioxide, to the pressure and temperature near its critical point of the solvent, where the solvent\u2019s properties are rapidly altered with very slight variations of pressure. 29 Solid phase extraction, which uses a solid and a liquid phase to isolate a chemical from a solution, and is often used to clean up a sample before analysis. Combinations of various extraction methods can enhance the extraction ef\ufb01ciencies, depending upon the chemical and the media in which it is found. Ultrasonic and microwave extractions may be used alone or in combination with solvent extraction. For example, the US EPA Method 3546 provides a procedure for extracting hydrophobic (that is, not soluble in water) or slightly water-soluble organic compounds from particles such as soils, sediments, sludges, and solid wastes. In this method, microwave energy elevates the temperature and pressure conditions (i.e. 100e115 C and 50e175 psi) in a closed extraction vessel containing the sample and solvent(s). This combination can improve recoveries of chemical analytes and can reduce the time needed compared with the Soxhlet procedure alone. As mentioned, not every sample needs to be extracted. For example, air monitoring using canisters and bags allows the air to \ufb02ow directly into the analyzer. Some air samples may also be directly injected into a detector on-site, such as a mobile gas chromatograph on a motor vehicle equipped with a chemical analysis system, such as the US EPA\u2019s Trace Atmospheric Gas Analyzer (TAGA). 26.7.2 Separation Science After extraction, if needed, the chemical compound of interest (e.g. the air pollutant) in the sample must be separated from the column and move to the detector. Surface methods, such as \ufb02uorescence, sputtering, and atomic absorption (AA), require only that the sample be mounted on speci\ufb01c media (e.g. \ufb01lters). Also, continuous monitors like the chemiluminescent system mentioned in the next section provide ongoing measurements. Chromatography is often used synonymously with separation; however, chromatography often includes both separation and detection. So, to explain the process this discussion will treat separation as a distinct process. Separation makes use of the chemicals\u2019 different af\ufb01nities for certain surfaces under various temperature and pressure conditions. The \ufb01rst step, injection, introduces the extract to a \u201ccolumn\u201d. The term column is V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26. APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA derived from the time when columns were packed with sorbents of varying characteristics, sometimes meters in length, and the extract was poured down the packed column to separate the various analytes. Today, columns are of two major types, gas and liquid. GC makes use of hollow tubes (\u201ccolumns\u201d) coated inside with compounds that hold organic chemicals. The columns are in an oven, so that after the extract is injected into the column, the temperature is increased, as well as the pressure, and the various organic compounds in the extract are released from the column surface differentially, whereupon they are collected by a carrier gas (e.g. helium) and transported to the detector. Generally, the more volatile compounds are released \ufb01rst (they have the shortest RTs), followed by the semivolatile organic compounds. So, boiling point is often a very useful indicator as to when a compound will come off a column. This is not always the case, since other characteristics such as polarity can greatly in\ufb02uence a compound\u2019s resistance to be freed from the column surface. For this reason, numerous GC columns are available to the chromatographer (different coatings, interior diameters, and lengths). Rather than coated columns, liquid chromatography (LC) makes use of columns packed with different sorbing materials with differing af\ufb01nities for compounds. Also, instead of a carrier gas, LC uses a solvent or blend of solvents to carry the compounds to the detector. In HPLC, pressures are also varied. Detection is the \ufb01nal step for quantifying the chemicals in a sample. The type of detector needed depends upon the kinds of pollutants of interest. Detection gives the \u201cpeaks\u201d that are used to identify compounds (Figure 26.15). For example, if hydrocarbons are of concern, GC with \ufb02ame ionization detection (FID) may be used.", "GC-FID gives a count of the number of carbon atoms, so, for example, long chains can be distinguished from short chains. The short chains come off the column \ufb01rst and have peaks that appear before the long-chain peaks. However, if pesticides or other halogenated compounds are of concern, electron capture detection is a better choice. A number of detection approaches are also available for LC. Probably the most common is absorption. Chemical compounds absorb energy at various levels, depending upon their size, shape, bonds, and other structural characteristics. Chemicals also vary in whether they will absorb light or how much light they can absorb depending upon wavelength. Some absorb very well in the UV range, while others do not. Diode arrays help to identify compounds by giving a number of absorption ranges in the same scan. Some molecules can be excited and will \ufb02uoresce. As mentioned, the BeereLambert law states that energy absorption is proportional to chemical concentration. Thus, the concentration of the chemical can be ascertained by measuring the light absorbed. The peaks on the chromatograph are calibrated to concentration by a calibration curve generated from known concentrations of the pollutant. The calibration curve simply associates absorbance, \ufb02uorescence, or other response to concentration. A calibration plot can be derived from this information. Figure 26.16 provides data for the calibration plot for a response of an ion from the herbicide clo\ufb01bric acid (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)2-methylpropanoic acid or C10H11ClO3) vs an ion of an internal standard. The data were derived by plotting the ratio of the response of the analyte to that of the internal standard vs the ratio of the amount of analyte to that V.

A regression of some order (usually linear, quadratic, or cubic) is performed on the data to obtain a calibration line.30 The equation of the calibration plot can be used to calculate the amount of the target analyte (s) in a sample in the form of an extract that has been added at a known level with the internal standard. For example, the internal standard is added at 10 ng for a 1 g sample the level is 10 ppb for the internal standard. From this value the amount of target can be calculated from the equation of the calibration curve. Usually, these calculations are performed by data system based on the calibration 31 curve. One of the most popular detection methods for environmental pollutants is MS, which can be used with either GC or LC separation. The MS detection is highly sensitive for organic compounds and works by using a stream of electrons to consistently break apart compounds into fragments. The positive ions resulting from the fragmentation are separated according to their masses. This is referred to as the \u201cmass to charge ratio\u201d or m/z. No matter which detection device is used, software is used to decipher the peaks and to perform the quantitation of the amount of each contaminant in the sample. For inorganic substances and metals, the additional extraction step may not be necessary. The actual media (e.g. collected airborne particles) may be measured by surface techniques like AA, X-ray \ufb02uorescence (XRF), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), or sputtering. As for organic compounds, the detection approaches can vary. For example, ICP may be used with absorption or MS. If all one needs to know is elemental information, for example, to determine total lead or nickel in a sample, AA or XRF may be suf\ufb01cient. However, if speciation (i.e. knowing the various compounds of a metal), then signi\ufb01cant sample preparation is needed, including a process known as \u201cderivatization\u201d. Derivatizing a sample is performed by adding a chemical agent that transforms the compound in question into one that can be recognized by the detector. This is done for both organic and inorganic compounds, for example, when the compound in question is too polar to be recognized by MS. The physical and chemical characteristics of the compounds being analyzed must be considered before visiting the \ufb01eld and throughout all the steps in the laboratory.", "Although it is beyond the scope of this book to go into detail, it is worth mentioning that the quality of results generated about contamination depends upon the sensitivity and selectivity of the analytical equipment. Table 26.12 de\ufb01nes some of the most important analytical chemistry threshold values. 26.8 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DISPLAY In general, air quality data are classi\ufb01ed as a function of time, location, and magnitude. Several statistical parameters may be used to characterize a group of air pollution concentrations, including the arithmetic mean, the median, and the geometric mean. These parameters may be determined over averaging times of up to 1 year. In addition to these three parameters, a measure of the variability of a data set, such as the standard deviation or the geometric standard deviation, indicates the range of data around the value selected to represent the data set. Raw data must be analyzed and transformed into a format useful for speci\ufb01c purposes. Summary tables, graphs, and geographic distributions are some of the formats used for data display. Air quality information often consists of a large body of data collected at a variety of locations and over different seasons. Table 26.13 shows the tabular format used by a local air pollution authority to report the status of compliance with air quality standards.32 The format has location, maximum values, annual means, and number of occurrences of hourly values above a given concentration as a function of the month of the year. One can quickly determine which areas are violating a standard, at what time of the year elevated concentrations are occurring, and the number of good data points collected. Pollutant concentration maps may be constructed as shown in Figure 26.17. In this example, elevated levels of ambient PM are associated with population centers.33 For a given geographic area, isopleths, lines showing equal concentrations of a pollutant, are drawn on a map. Regions of high concentration are quickly identi\ufb01ed. Further action may be taken to determine the cause, such as review of emission inventories of additional sampling. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26. APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA TABLE 26.12 Expressions of Chemical Analytical Limits Type of Limit Description Limit of detection (LOD) Lowest concentration or mass that can be differentiated from a blank with statistical con\ufb01dence. This is a function of sample handling and preparation, sample extraction ef\ufb01ciencies, chemical separation ef\ufb01ciencies, and capacity and speci\ufb01cations of all analytical equipment being used (see IDL below). Instrument detection limit (IDL) The minimum signal greater than noise detectable by an instrument. The IDL is an expression of the piece of equipment, not the chemical of concern. It is expressed as a signal to noise (S:N) ratio. This is mainly important to the analytical chemists, but the engineer should be aware of the different IDLs for various instruments measuring the same compounds, so as to provide professional judgment in contracting or selecting laboratories and deciding on procuring for appropriate instrumentation for all phases of remediation. Limit of quantitation (LOQ) The concentration or mass above which the amount can be quanti\ufb01ed with statistical con\ufb01dence. This is an important limit because it goes beyond the \u201cpresenceeabsence\u201d of the LOD and allows for calculating chemical concentration or mass gradients in the environmental media (air, water, soil, sediment, and biota). Practical quantitation limit (PQL) The combination of LOQ and the precision and accuracy limits of a speci\ufb01c laboratory, as expressed in the laboratory\u2019s quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) plans and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for routine runs. The PQL is the concentration or mass that the engineer can consistently expect to have reported reliably. Source: Vallero D. Engineering the Risks of Hazardous Wastes. Boston (MA): Butterworth-Heinemann; 2003. The methods described in Chapter 25 and the air quality results discussed in Chapter 28 are often for speci\ufb01c pollutants in particular spatial contexts, e.g. benzene concentrations indoors, CO concentrations at a roadway intersection, or O3 concentrations for an entire metropolitan area. However, this is not how air pollution exists. It is usually a complex mixture of criteria pollutants and air toxics that include solid, liquid, and vapor phases, which are generated from myriad sources, transformed in the atmosphere and other environmental compartments, and transported to the places where people breathe. Some pollutants are expected to be complex mixtures, (e.g. coke oven emission or diesel PM), but in the real world every air pollutant is a component of a complex mixture.", "For example, a person standing near a road is being simultaneously exposed to benzene, 1-3-butadiene, CO, NO2,O3,PM2.5, and numerous other chemicals. The respective totals will vary. For example, there is likely to have concentration gradients with distance downwind from the road. Also, if the person goes inside, the pollution mixture changes. Consider a person moving in space, as depicted in Figure 26.18. Ozone is usually a regional pollutant, so the concentrations are stable until the person goes indoors, where the concentrations are much lower. Benzene and 1,3-butadiene are near-road pollutants, so they are highest near the roadway and decrease with distance downwind; however, benzene is also a common indoor pollutant, if a benzene source (e.g. gas stove) is indoors, benzene concentrations increase indoors. PM has numerous sources, including vehicle emissions and fugitive dust from roads. There must be another source upwind (e.g. cement mixing operation). Like benzene, PM is also generated by numerous indoor sources. In addition, \ufb01ne particulate (e.g. <2.5 mm diameter) also penetrate from outdoors to indoors. As a result, the net PM concentrations consist of indoor sources plus PM from penetration. Concentrations of VOCs and PM indoors are often higher than outdoor concentrations, but contaminants generated by outdoor sources are transported to and penetrate into microenvironments. However, all pollutants have considerable variability in time and space. For example, diurnal spatial variations in O3 concentrations are controlled by the relative importance of transport versus local photochemical production and loss rates, the timing for entrainment of air from the nocturnal residual boundary layer, and the diurnal variability in mixing layer height. Figure 26.19 indicates that the daily 1-h O3 concentration maxima generally occur in midafternoon and daily 1-h minima tend to occur during the early morning. There is also considerable spread in these data, however, so caution is advised when extrapolating results from one region to another.34 Indeed, this caution goes beyond O3 and should be considered a general caution for most air pollutants. 26.9 CRITERIA AND STANDARDS For any pollutant, air quality criteria may refer to different types of effects.

They may be of a bacterial, viral, or fungal origin quite divorced from the inhalation of human-made pollutants in the ambient air. These causes in addition to the variety of congenital, degenerative, nutritional, and psychosomatic causes of disease must all be ruled out before a disease can be attributed to air pollution. However, air pollution commonly exacerbates preexisting disease states. In human health, air pollution can be the \u201cstraw that breaks the camel\u2019s back\u201d. Air quality standards prescribe pollutant levels that cannot legally be exceeded during a speci\ufb01c time period in a speci\ufb01c geographic area. Air quality standards are based on air quality criteria, with added safety factors as desired. Periodically, the US government reviews the scienti\ufb01c basis for the standards for each criteria pollutant by preparing an Air Quality Criteria Docu ment (AQCD).35a,35b The Clean Air Act requires an update and revision of the AQCD for PM every 5 years. The most recent started in 1998, following July 1997 promulgation of a new PM NAAQS. The PM AQCD is the scienti\ufb01c basis for the additional technical and policy assessments that form the basis for EPA decisions on the adequacy of the current PM NAAQS and the appropriateness of new or revised standards for PM. The original NAAQS for PM, issued in 1971 as TSP standards, were revised in 1987 to focus on protecting against human health effects associated with exposure to ambient particles with aerodynamic diameters less than or equal to 10 microns (<10 mm). These are able to deposit in the thoracic (tracheobronchial and alveolar) portions of the lower respiratory tract. The PM10 NAAQS set in 1987 (150 mgm 3,24h; 50 mgm 3, annual average) were retained in modi\ufb01ed form and new standards (65 mgm 3,24h;15 mgm 3, annual average) for particles <2.5 mm (PM2.5) were promulgated in July 1997. The current criteria document has pointed out a number of areas of uncertainty that need to be addressed. These are provided in Table 26.21.Althoughmuch has been learned about the hazards, exposure, effects, and risks of particulates, much still needs to be known. The main focus of the PM document is the evaluation and interpretation of pertinent atmospheric science information, air quality data, human exposure information, and health and welfare effects information published since what was assessed during the development of the 1996 PM AQCD. A number of draft versions of AQCD chapters have been evaluated via expert peer-review workshop discussions and peer reviews. The document is a rich resource for information about PM and air pollution in general. It is divided into two V.

NC: US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park; January 1982. Photochemical Oxidants published in 1978, the chemical designation of the standards was changed from photochemical oxidants to ozone (O3) in 1979 and a 1-h O3 NAAQS was set. The 1978 document focused mainly on the air quality criteria for O3 and, to a lesser extent, on those for other photochemical oxidants (e.g. hydrogen peroxide and the peroxy acetyl nitrates), as have subsequently revised versions of the document. As is true for PM, to meet Clean Air Act requirements noted above for periodic review of criteria and NAAQS, the O3 criteria document, Air Quality Criteria for Ozone and Other Photochemical Oxidants, was next revised and released in August 1986; and a supplement, Summary of Selected New Information on Effects of Ozone on Health and Vegetation, was issued in January 1992. These documents were the basis for a March 1993 decision by EPA that revision of the existing 1-h NAAQS for O3 was not appropriate at that time. That decision, however, did not take into account newer scienti\ufb01c data that had become available after completion of the 1986 criteria document. Such literature was assessed in the next periodic revision of the O3 AQCD, which was completed in 1996 and provided scienti\ufb01c bases supporting the setting by EPA in 1997 of the current 8-h O3 NAAQS.", "The purpose of this revised AQCD for O3 and related photochemical oxidants is to evaluate and assess the latest scienti\ufb01c information published since that assessed in the 1996 O3 AQCD, with the main focus being on pertinent new information useful in evaluating health and environmental effects data associated with ambient air O3 exposures. However, other scienti\ufb01c data are also discussed in order to provide a better understanding of the nature, sources, distribution, measurement, and concentrations of O3 and related photochemical oxidants and their precursors in the environment. Like the PM document, the ozone AQCD contains a wealth of information. The Executive Summary describes the key \ufb01ndings and conclusions as they pertain to background information on O3-related atmospheric science and air quality, human exposure aspects, dosimetric considerations, health effect issues, and environmental effect issues. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction, including an overview of legal requirements, the chronology of past revisions of O3-related NAAQS, and orientation to the structure of this document. Chapters 3 and 4 provide background information on atmospheric chemistry/physics of O3 formation, air quality, and exposure aspects to help to place ensuing discussions of O3 health and welfare effects into perspective. Chapters 5 through 8 then assess dosimetry aspects, experimental (controlled human exposure and laboratory animal) studies, and epidemiologic (\ufb01eld/ panel; other observational) studies. Chapter 9 then provides an integrative synthesis of key \ufb01ndings and conclusions derived from the preceding chapters with regard to ambient O3 concentrations, human exposures, dosimetry, and health effects. Chapter 9 deals with effects of O3 on vegetation, crops, and natural ecosystems, V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.

Ozone illustrates the complexity of applying measurement data to assess air pollution. It is a secondary pollutant formed by atmospheric reactions involving two classes of precursor compounds, i.e. VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOx).", "Carbon monoxide also contributes to O3 formation. The formation of O3 and associated compounds is a complex, nonlinear function of the intensity and spectral distribution of sunlight; atmospheric mixing and numerous atmospheric reactions of varying concentrations of precursors in ambient air. The photochemical oxidation of most anthropogenically and naturally generated VOCs is initiated by reaction b Electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum has wavelengths between 400 and 100 nanometers (nm), with energy between 3.1 and 12.4 electronvolts (eV) per photon. The UV radiation is divided into three compartments: UVA (400e315nm and 3.10e3.94 eV); UVB (315e280nm and 3.94e4.43 eV) and UVC (280e100nm and 4.43e12.4 eV). The UVA is not absorbed by the stratospheric ozone layer, but the medium wavelength UVB mostly is, and the short wavelength UVB is completely absorbed by the ozone layer and troposphere. Exposure to UVB causes sunburn and skin cancer. All three wavelengths, however, are considered to present carcinogenic risk. The World Health Organization has designated all UV to be a Group 1 carcinogen, i.e. \u201cenough evidence to conclude that it can cause cancer\u201d (http://www.who.int/uv/health/en/; accessed on May 14, 2014). V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.9 CRITERIA AND STANDARDS with hydroxyl (OH) radicals. At night, when they are most abundant, NO3 radicals oxidize alkenes. In coastal and other select environments, Cl and Br radicals can also initiate the oxidation of VOCs. Virtually all classes of VOCs (e.g. alkanes, alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and carbonyl compounds) and CO are in suf\ufb01cient quantities in many urban areas to form ground-level ozone. Although knowledge of the oxidative mechanisms of VOCs has improved, there remain substantial gaps in scienti\ufb01c understanding of the role of many chemical classes, e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons. As evidence, only about half of the C that is initially present in aromatic hydrocarbons in smog chamber studies is speciated. Also, many heterogeneous reactions are involved. Gas phase reactions are joined by reactions on the aerosol surfaces or within cloud droplets. Most of the well-established multiphase reactions appear to decrease the rate of O3 formation in polluted environments. With typical PM concentrations in ambient air, direct reactions of O3 and atmospheric particles appear to be too slow to decrease O3 formation. Oxidants other than O3 are found in the gas phase and in particles. Much still needs to be learned about the chemistry occurring in particle bound-water and the mechanisms leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species in particles.36 Although air quality standards are based predominantly on biological criteria, e.g. to protect human health and ecosystem condition, certain physical criteria also deserve consideration. Most materials will deteriorate even when exposed to an unpolluted atmosphere. Iron will rust, metals will corrode, and wood will rot. To prevent deterioration, protective coatings are applied. Materials-related costs are part of the economic aspects of air pollution rule-making. Some materials, such as railroad rails, are used without protective coatings. There are costs associated with the decrease in their life in a polluted atmosphere as compared to an unpolluted one. One may argue that for materials on which protective coatings are used, only pollution levels that damage such coatings are of concern. One may further argue that some air pollution damage to protection coatings is tolerable, since by their very nature such coatings require periodic replenishment to maintain their protective integrity or appearance; therefore, only coatings that require more frequent replenishment than they would in an unpolluted atmosphere should enter into the establishment of deterioration costs and air quality standards. This argument certainly does hold with respect to the soiling of materials and structures. In fact, it is frequently the protective coatings themselves that require replacement because they become dirty long before their useful life as protectants has terminated. It can readily be shown that there are costs associated with soiling, including the cost of removing soil, the cost of protective coatings to facilitate the removal of soil, the premature disposal of material when it is no longer economical or practicable to remove soil, and the growth inhibition of vegetation due to leaf soiling. However, decision making for air quality standards related to soiling is based less on economic evaluation than on esthetic considerations, i.e. on subjective evaluation of how much soiling the community will tolerate. This latter determination is judgmental and dif\ufb01cult to make.", "It may be facilitated by opinion surveys, but even when the limit of public tolerance for soiling is determined, it still has to be restated in terms of the pollution loading of the air that will result in this level of soiling. An important effect from air pollution is change in spectral transmission within the atmosphere. The UV and visible spectral regions are of greatest concern. Changes in UV radiation have demonstrable adverse effects, e.g. a decrease in the stratospheric ozone layer permits harmful UV radiation to penetrate to the surface of the earth. Excessive exposure to UV radiation results in increases in skin cancer and cataracts. The worldwide effort to reduce the release of stratospheric ozone-depleting chemicals such as chloro\ufb02uorocarbons is directed toward reducing this increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts for future generations. The fact that after a storm or the passage of a frontal system the air becomes crystal clear and one can see for many kilometers does not give a true measure of year-round visibility under unpolluted conditions. Between storms, even in unpolluted air, chemical compounds released from natural sources build up enough PM in the air so that on many days of the year there is less than ideal visibility. Throughout the world, mountains are called \u201cSmoky\u201d or \u201cBlue\u201d or some other name to designate the prevalence of a natural haze, which gives them a smoky or bluish color and impedes visibility. When the Spanish \ufb01rst explored the area that is now Los Angeles, California, they gave it the name \u201cBay of the Smokes\u201d. The Los Angeles de\ufb01nition of air quality before the advent of smog was that \u201cYou could see Catalina Island on a clear day\u201d. The part of the de\ufb01nition that is lacking is some indication of how many clear days there were before the advent of smog. There are costs associated with loss of visibility and solar energy. These include increased need for arti\ufb01cial illumination and heating; delays, disruptions, and accidents involving air, water, and land traf\ufb01c; vegetation growth reduction associated with reduced photosynthesis; and commercial losses associated with the decreased attractiveness of a dingy community or one with restricted scenic views. However, these costs are less likely to be involved in deciding, for air quality standard-setting purposes, how much of the attainable visibility improvement to aim for than are esthetic V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26. APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA considerations. Just as in the previously noted case of soiling, judgment on the limit of public tolerance for visibility reduction still has to be related to the pollutant loading of the atmosphere that will yield the desired visibility. Obviously, the pollutant level chosen for an air quality standard must be lower than the values required for soiling or visibility, otherwise one will be achieved without the other. Whether the level chosen will not be lower than the atmospheric pollutant level required for prevention of health effects will depend on the esthetic standards of the jurisdiction. 26.9.1 Conversion of Biological Data and Criteria to Standards There is considerable variability among species with respect to damage to vegetation by any speci\ufb01c pollutant. In addition, the substantial geographic variability with respect to where these species grow naturally or are cultivated may mean that none of the species particularly susceptible to damage by low levels of pollution may be present during a pollution episode. As an example, the pollution level at which citrus trees are adversely affected, while meaningful in setting air quality standards in California and Florida, is meaningless for this purpose in Minnesota and Wisconsin. In like manner, a jurisdiction may take different viewpoints with respect to indigenous and imported species. Regulators might set air quality standards low enough to protect its indigenous vegetation even if this level is too high to allow satisfactory growth of imported species. Even if a particularly susceptible species is indigenous, it may be held in such low local esteem commercially or aesthetically that the jurisdiction may be unwilling to let the damage level of that species be the air quality standard discriminator. In other words, the people would rather have that species damaged than assume the cost of cleaning up the air to prevent the damage. This same line of reasoning applies to effects on wild and domestic animals. A jurisdiction may base part of its decision making regarding vegetation and animal damage on aesthetics.", "Its citizens may wish to grow certain ornamentals or raise certain species of pet birds or animals and allow these wishes to override the agricultural, forestry, and husbandry economics of the situation. Usually, however, economic considerations predominate in decision making. Costs of air pollution effects on agriculture are the sum of the loss in income from the sale of crops or livestock and the added cost necessary to raise the crops or livestock for sale. To these costs must be added the loss in value of agricultural land as its income potential decreases and the loss suffered by the segments of local industry and commerce that are dependent on farm crops and the farmer for their existence. An interesting sidelight is that when such damage occurs on the periphery of an urban area, it is frequently a precursor to the breakup of such farmland into residential development, with a \ufb01nancial gain rather than a loss to the landowner. When the crop that disappears is an orchard, grove, or vineyard that took years to establish, and when usable farm buildings are torn down, society as a whole suffers a loss to the extent that it will take much time and money to establish a replacement for them at new locations. To some industries, air pollution costs include purchase of farm and ranch land to prevent litigation to recover damages, annual subsidy payments to farmers and ranchers in lieu of such litigation, and maintenance of air quality monitoring systems to protect themselves against unwarranted litigation for this purpose. There is a range of ambiguity in our human health effects criteria data. In this range there is disagreement among experts as to its validity and interpretation. Thus, from the same body of health effects data, one could adopt an air quality standard on the high side of the range of ambiguity or one on the low side. Much soul searching is required before one accepts the results of questionable human health effects research and is accused of imposing large costs on the public by so doing, or of rejecting these results and being accused of subjecting the public to potential damage of human health. 26.9.2 Air Quality Standards Since air pollution is controlled by air quality and emission standards, the principal philosophical discussions in the \ufb01eld of air pollution control focus on their development and application. The US Clean Air Amendments of 1977 de\ufb01ned two kinds of air quality standards: primary standards, levels that will protect health but not necessarily prevent the other adverse effects of air pollution, and secondary standards, levels that will prevent all the other adverse effects of air pollution (Table 24.8). The amendments also de\ufb01ne air quality levels that cannot be exceeded in speci\ufb01ed geographic areas for \u201cprevention of signi\ufb01cant deterioration\u201d (PSD) of the air of those areas. Although they are called \u201cincrements\u201d over \u201cbaseline air quality\u201d in the law, they are in effect tertiary standards, which are set at lower ambient levels than either the primary or secondary standards (Table 26.22). The PSD program applies to any \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d in attainment areas. For 28 named categories, a major emitting facility is one with a \u201cpotential to emit\u201d 100 tons or more per year of any regulated air pollutant. However, any source is regulated under PSD if it has a potential to emit 250 or more tons per year. Emission potential assumes maximum design capacity (42 USC x 7479). V.

Increments are said to be \u201cconsumed\u201d as new sources are given permits that allow pollution to be introduced into these areas. Jurisdictions with authority to issue permits may choose to \u201callocate\u201d portions of a PSD increment (or of the difference between actual air quality and the primary or secondary standard) for future consumption, rather than to allow its consumption on a \ufb01rst-come, \ufb01rst-served basis. The states are required to submit to the federal EPA plans, known as State Implementation Plans (SIP), showing how they will achieve the standards in their jurisdictions within a speci\ufb01ed time period. If after that time period there are areas within the states where these standards have not been attained, the states are required to submit and obtain EPA approval of revised plans to achieve the standards in these \u201cnonattainment\u201d areas. EPA also designates certain areas where the standards are being met, but which have the potential for future nonattainment, as Air Quality Maintenance Areas. Such regions have stricter requirements than attainment areas for the granting of permits for new sources of the pollutant not in attainment status. The Canadian Clean Air Act allows the provincial minister to formulate air quality objectives re\ufb02ecting three ranges of ambient air quality for any contaminant. The tolerable range denotes a concentration that requires abatement without delay. The acceptable range provides adequate protection against adverse effects. The desirable range de\ufb01nes a long-term goal for air quality and provides the basis for a nondegradation policy for unpolluted parts of the country (Table 26.23). The Canadian ambient PM2.5 and ozone standards are shown in Table 26.24. As in the United States, these Canada-wide standards (CWSs) for PM are aimed at protecting human health, i.e. mainly PM2.5 fraction, but are expected to incorporate advancements in scienti\ufb01c, technical, and economic information and analysis. The Canadian standard focuses on the sources of PM and PM precursor emissions that provide the greatest health bene\ufb01t, but acknowledges that health effects are also associated with the coarse fraction of PM with diameters between 10 and 2.5 mm. Thus, actions to reduce the concentrations of these coarser fractions in the atmosphere are also needed. In addition, some Canadian jurisdictions currently have ambient air quality objectives, guidelines, or standards related to the coarser fraction of PM, and should continue to use them to design air quality management programs for PM10. CWSs related to the coarser fraction may be a useful addition at a later date. There are other aspects that should be considered in any future update of these PM and ozone CWSs. Species of the PM and O3 standards other than the relatively short-term exposure species established under these standards, e.g. seasonal or annual average targets, may be added in the future. In addition, secondary-type standards to protect vegetation, visibility, materials, or other adverse effects may need to be assessed, since the CWSs presently related primarily to protection of human health.

Attention is now being refocused on \u201cindoor\u201d air quality. In developing countries, priorities have often differed from those of wealthier nations. Industrialization, water and food supply, sanitation, infrastructure improvements, and basic health care are often the focus of the leaders of a country. In some areas, the availability of a job is much more problematic than some consideration about the quality of the air in the workplace or the home. Many dwellings in developing countries do not have closable windows and doors, so the outdoor and indoor air quality issues are different. In some houses where cooking is done by \ufb01rewood or charcoal, the air quality outdoors may be considerably better than that inside the smoky residence. The evolution of our modern society and the concomitant changes in lifestyle, workplace, and housing improvements place concerns about indoor air quality in a different category than for developing countries and from the times of our ancestors. For many industrialized countries, efforts to improve the outdoor air quality have been under way for the majority of this century. In many locations around the world, signi\ufb01cant improvements have taken place. Air quality in many major cities such as London, New York, and Chicago has improved from the conditions present in the \ufb01rst half of the twentieth century. Mechanisms and control programs are in place in the developed countries to continue the improvement of ambient air quality. Considerable effort and energy have been expended to characterize, evaluate, and control air pollution emissions to the atmosphere. Buildings and their design have undergone major changes. Fifty years ago, central heating and windows that could be opened and closed depending on the season were the norm for commercial buildings. Now we have multistory buildings with central heating and air conditioning and sealed glass exterior walls. Residential housing has undergone similar design and structural changes, in some cases resulting in dwellings that may have poorer indoor air quality. New residences and commercial buildings are designed and built with energy conservation as a major design criterion. New materials have been developed and are being used in construction. Although these modi\ufb01cations have helped to save energy, a consequence of some of these modi\ufb01cations is slower exchange of air with the outside. This helps considerably with the heating or cooling system because energy must condition this \u201cnew\u201d air, which is introduced into the structure. However, the decreased air exchange rates usually translate into dirtier air.", "A second consideration is the change in lifestyle for individuals in industrialized societies. We are no longer a society dependent on occupations that require us to be outdoors for a signi\ufb01cant part of our day. Over the past two decades, studies of daily activities have consistently shown for urban populations that, on average, we spend V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26. APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA about 90% of our time indoors in our homes, cars, of\ufb01ces, factories, public buildings such as restaurants, malls, and others. Any given individual activity pro\ufb01le may differ signi\ufb01cantly from this average. Exposure assessment techniques now attempt to include as many as possible of the locations in which individuals now spend time. The concept involves identi\ufb01cation of microenvironments that are important for potential exposure. For example, exposure to CO would include time spent in commuting, parking garages, in residences with gas stoves, as well as time spent outdoors. This approach classi\ufb01es time spent in these microenvironments and the typical concentrations of CO in these locations. 26.10.1 Factors In\ufb02uencing Indoor Air Quality Several factors in\ufb02uence the quality of air indoors: the rate of exchange of air with air from outdoors, the concentration of pollutants in outdoor air, the rate of emissions from sources indoors, the rate of in\ufb01ltration from soil gases, and the rate of removal in the indoor environment (Figure 26.20). The source of indoor air pollutants may be inside the building, or they may be transported into the interior space from the outside. Sources located indoors include building materials, combustion sources, furnishings, and pets. Emissions of organic gases are higher with increased temperature and humidity but usually decrease with age of the structure or furnishings. Construction materials and the composition of furnishings inside the building may give off or out-gas pollutants into the interior airspace, e.g. glues or adhesives. Natural gas for cooking and kerosene space heaters release NO and CO2 even when operating properly. Molds may grow in the ventilation ducts and be distributed throughout a building.37 Radon from the soil can enter buildings through cracks in the foundation when the pressure inside is lower than in the soil. The rate of in\ufb01ltration depends on the soil type, the building structure, and the pressure differential between the soil and the building. Air is exchanged between indoors and outdoors by several ways: natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation, and in\ufb01ltration or ex\ufb01ltration. Natural ventilation involves movement of air through building openings like doors, windows, and vents. Mechanical ventilation involves fans and heating and air-conditioning systems. In\ufb01ltration and ex\ufb01ltration represents undesirable movement of air in and out of the structure. Buildings are characterized as \u201ctight\u201d when in\ufb01ltration rates are low. The air exchange rate in\ufb02uences the concentration of indoor pollutants in two ways. At higher air exchange rates, the pollutants inside a structure are removed from the interior. As long as the ambient outside air has lower pollutant concentrations, high exchange rates help lower indoor air pollutant levels. However, if the pollutant concentration outside is elevated, then an increase in the air exchange rate will bring these materials into the building; e.g. an idling vehicle adjacent to an air intake will transfer exhaust fumes into the building. At lower exchange rates, pollutants released from sources inside the building can contribute to higher levels of indoor pollutants. The concentration of indoor pollutants is a function of removal processes such as dilution, \ufb01ltration, and destruction. Dilution is a function of the air exchange rate and the ambient air quality. Gases and PM may also be removed from indoor air by deposition on surfaces. Filtration systems are part of many ventilation systems. As air is circulated by the air-conditioning system it passes through a \ufb01lter that can remove some of the PM. The removal ef\ufb01ciency depends on particle properties; including size and surface characteristics, such as electrostatics. In addition, some reactive gases like NO2 and SO2 are readily adsorbed on interior surfaces of a building or home. 26.10.2 Indoor Air Pollutants Table 26.26 shows the major categories of indoor air pollutants and sources. Table 26.27 shows a summary of reported indoor air pollutant concentrations compiled by the US EPA. Information in this table is not meant to be representative of typical indoor concentrations but only examples of measurements obtained by investigators and reported in the literature.

A listing of accredited laboratories can be found at www.aiha.org/LaboratoryServices/html/ lists.htm. Radon gas is formed in the process of radioactive decay of uranium. The distribution of naturally occurring radon follows the distribution of uranium in geological formations. Elevated levels have been observed in certain granite-type minerals. Residences built in these areas have the potential for elevated indoor concentrations of radon from radon gas entering through cracks and crevices and from out-gassing from well water. Radon gas is radioactive and emits alpha particles in the decay process. The elements resulting from radon decay are called radon daughters or progeny. These radon daughters can attach to airborne particles, which can deposit in the lung. The evidence supporting the radon risk of lung cancer comes from studies of uranium mine workers, in whom elevated rates of lung cancer have been observed. When an analysis of the potential exposure to radon inside homes was conducted by the US EPA, an estimate of 5000e20,000 excess lung cancer deaths was projected annually.47 The risk is associated directly with increased lifetime doses, i.e. the longer the time spent living in a residence with elevated levels of radon, the higher the risk. Indoor levels of radon range from less than 1e200 pCi l 1. Levels as high as 12 000 pCi l 1 have been observed but most levels are much lower.", "The US EPA has established an action level of 4 pCi l 1 for indoor radon, and if a home screening test shows concentrations below 4 pCi l 1, no remedial action is suggested. ETS, sometimes referred to as \u201csecond-hand smoke\u201d or \u201cpassive smoking\u201d, represents the exposure to tobacco smoke by individuals other than the smoker. For decades, the US Surgeon General has indicated that smoking is a cause of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease for individuals who smoke. The US EPA has also concluded that ETS is a lung carcinogen for others breathing it. The presence of biological contaminants gained widespread recognition with the outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1976. In that year, 221 persons attending a convention of Legionnaires developed pneumonia symptoms and 34 subsequently died. The agent, a bacterium later named Legionella pneumophila, was found in the cooling tower of the hotel\u2019s air-conditioning system. This bacterium has subsequently been responsible for other outbreaks of Legionnaires\u2019 disease. The bacteria in water supplies may be eliminated by suitable treatment procedures. Legionnella represents one of many types of biological agents that can cause allergic reactions and illness in the indoor environment. One of the more dif\ufb01cult challenges remaining is the characterization of \u201csick building\u201d syndrome. On numerous occasions, some employees in certain of\ufb01ce buildings or other workplaces have developed a combination of symptoms including respiratory problems, dryness of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, and other nonspeci\ufb01c complaints. In such situations a substantial portion of the workers may exhibit these symptoms, which decrease in severity or stop when the worker is away from the building over the weekend or for longer periods. Investigations into the cause of these symptoms sometimes provide explanations, uncover ventilation problems, or identify an irritant gas. But many of these problem buildings are very dif\ufb01cult to understand and additional research is necessary to understand the cause-and-effect relationships. 26.10.4 Control of Indoor Air Pollutants The control and regulation of indoor air quality are in\ufb02uenced by individual property rights and a complicated mosaic of federal, state, and local government jurisdiction with con\ufb02icts, overlaps, and gaps in addressing these issues. Table 26.28 shows a large number of U.S. agencies and departments involved in indoor air quality control efforts at the federal level. Government can institute certain laws and regulations for the citizens\u2019 well-being. Environmental and occupational examples abound, such as clean water and air legislation and workplace safety and health regulations. As the extension of this role into the home occurs, implementation and enforcement become more problematic. Examples of proactive regulatory approaches are building codes, zoning, consumer product standards, and safety requirements. Table 26.29 shows what various parties, from the individual to the federal government, can do to improve indoor air quality. Many of these efforts focus on education, improved materials, and better design of products and structures. The technological control strategies are related back to Figure 26.20. If the hazard is the result of elevated concentrations, then the technological solution is to reduce or remove the sources or dilute or remove the agent. Control techniques are discussed for agents mentioned earlierdradon, ETS, and biological agentsd and also for VOCs. The sources of VOCs are highly variable, including chemicals that off-gas from articles and construction materials, and those released during cooking, heating and other indoor combustion activities. For most pollutants, it is preferable to prevent their entry into the indoor environment rather than treat and remove them after entry. For example, radon enters the residence by two principal routes: in\ufb01ltration from soil beneath the structure and out-gassing from well water during showers. Elevated levels of radon are generally V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 26.

The mitigation techniques available include increased ventilation of the crawl space beneath the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor, soil gas venting from beneath a basement \ufb02oor, and sealing of all openings to the subsurface soil. These steps reduce the entry of radon into the home. Elevated levels of radon in well water can be removed by aeration or \ufb01ltration by absorbent-\ufb01lled columns. Control of ETS is complicated because of the personal behavior of individuals. For public buildings and facilities like of\ufb01ces, restaurants, and malls, many governmental bodies are placing restrictions on smoking in these areas, which can range from complete bans to requiring a restaurant to have a portion of a dining area for smokers and the remainder for nonsmokers. The dif\ufb01culty for the restaurant owner is ensuring that the nonsmoking section is free of ETS. Education is the primary approach to \u201ccontrol\u201d in the home. Information about the effects of ETS on family members, especially the health of pregnant women, unborn and young children, has modi\ufb01ed the behavior of some smokers. Control of biological agents is multifaceted. In the case of Legionella, cleaning and maintenance of heating and air-conditioning systems are generally suf\ufb01cient to reduce the risk of this disease. In home heating and air-conditioning systems, mold and bacteria may be present and controlled with maintenance procedures and V.

APPLYING AND INTERPRETING AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA increasingly available technologies (e.g. UV disinfection). Growth may be inhibited by lower humidity levels. Keeping a house clean lowers the presence of dust mites, pollen, dander, and other allergens. For VOCs, control options are multiple. Source reduction or removal includes product substitution or reformulation. Particleboard or pressed wood has been developed and used extensively in building materials for cabinet bases and sub\ufb02ooring and in furniture manufacturing for frames. If the product is not properly manufactured and cured prior to use as a building material, VOCs can out-gas into the interior of the residence or building. Other sources of VOCs may be paints, cleaning solutions, fabrics, binders, and adhesives. Proper use of household products will lower volatile emissions. In many of the industries associated with building or household products, efforts are under way to reduce the potential for subsequent VOC release to the interior of residences or commercial buildings. Modi\ufb01cation of the manufacturing process, solvent substitution, product reformulation, and altering installation procedures are a few of the approaches available. When VOCs are present indoors at elevated concentrations, modi\ufb01cation of ventilation rates is a control option for diluting and reducing these concentrations. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers has established standards for ventilation rates for outside air per individual. The guideline is 15 cfm per person. 48 This guideline is designed to bring suf\ufb01cient fresh air into a building to minimize the buildup of contaminants and odors. 26.11 PERSONAL MONITORING No matter what the quality of ambient and even indoor measurements of air pollutants, these are not often a good indication of the levels of exposure to air pollutants that people actually receive. Their activities and locations often vary considerably from person to person. In fact, the phenomenon known as \u201cpersonal cloud\u201d has recently been characterized to help predict a person\u2019s exposures and risks to air pollutants. The cloud indicates an increased personal exposure to air pollutants compared to indoor concentrations, or compared to the time-weighted indoor and outdoor concentrations. Results from several recent studies suggest that a number of factors, such as relative humidity and ventilation may lead to very different exposures based on personal measurements vs ambient concentrations of air pollutants. For example, one recent study found that while ambient \ufb01ne particle concentrations may somewhat represent exposures to \ufb01ne particles, the ability of either ambient gases or ambient \ufb01ne particles to represent exposure to gases is quite small (see Table 26.30). With personal monitoring, the monitoring device is worn by individuals as they proceed through their normal activities. This approach is most common in workplaces. The radioactivity sensors worn by nuclear power plant workers are one example.", "Personal monitoring is increasingly being used, however, to estimate total human exposures, including exposures from the air people breathe, the water they drink, and the food they eat. One advantage of personal monitoring is that the data provide valuable insights into the sources of the pollutants to which people are actually exposed. A challenge with personal monitoring is ensuring that suf\ufb01cient sampling is done to be representative of the population being studied. To make full use of the data discussed in Chapters 25 and 26, they must be extended in time and space beyond the measurements. This is possible with a variety of models, a number of which are discussed in Chapter 27. QUESTIONS 1.

A month after the above incident, the health department takes blood samples of the people in the building to determine if air pollutants observed a month earlier are present. However, only 15% of the workers on the \ufb02oors agree to give blood. If you compile these results, what type of error must you report? How can this be calculated? 24.

If you are trying to determine whether airborne Hg concentrations in a county are contributing to autism, what type of measurement data would you need? 27. You are the city engineer sitting in a discussion about a program to give kerosene space heaters to needy people. Recent inspections of target homes show that the air exchange rates (QV 1) at present to be an average four per hour. Before the heaters are given away, the city, with the help of a team of volunteers, will \ufb01x windows, caulk, and add insulation so that any home receiving the heater will be at most 1.5 air exchanges per hour. The manufacturer specs show that the heaters will produce 23 mg of carbon monoxide per second. If the average home will use one heater in the living room (500 m3) and one in each of the three bedrooms (each 400 m3), do you foresee any problems with this plan? Would you want to live and sleep in a home with these CO concentrations (e.g. based on health standards)? Support your recommendation in a memo to the mayor and city council. 28. Later in the same meeting, you are asked to consider the use of building materials for the new library. The architects call for library panel constructed of \ufb01berboard. It is much more aesthetically appealing than the alternate material (drywall). The \ufb01berboard emits formaldehyde at 360 mgm 2h 1andthe library walls to be covered represent a surface area of 20,000 m2. The emission rate is expected to drop by 40 mgm 2 h 1 each year as the product gives off gases and the formaldehyde decomposes. The drywall emits no HCHO, but in a few places the drywall will be reinforced with plywood, which 21 2 emits 4 mgm h (but only from 1500 m of wall surface).", "However, the grout used if the drywall is 5 21 selected emits radon at a rate of 1 10 mgm h. (Remember that the volume being used here is liters, not cubic meters, and that the density of water is much higher than that of air.) The volume of the library will be 250,000 m3. Assume that the library air will be well mixed. The library is designed to have 1.2 air exchanges per hour. Recent measurements in the area around the building site have detected 5 mgm 3 HCHO in the ambient air. Write a memo to the library planning commission communicating your calculations and estimates, as well as your recommendations about the choice of wall materials. Also, make some recommendations on what corrective actions will need to be taken if they still wish to install the panel as the architects wish, or if they go with the alterative. 29. From the previous three problems, can you draw any conclusions about the relationship of indoor air quality and energy ef\ufb01ciency (e.g. the role that air exchange rates play in both)? Can you think of some approaches that could ameliorate both air quality and energy ef\ufb01ciency in the same building? References 1. United States Code of Federal Regulations.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27 Modeling Applications 27.1 VALUE OF MODELS Models provide a means for representing a complicated system in an understandable way. They take many forms, beginning with \u201cconceptual models\u201d that explain the way a system works, including all the factors and parameters of how a pollutant moves in the air after an emission. Conceptual models are a frst and important step in identifying the major infuences on where a chemical is likely to be found in the environment, and as such, need to be developed to help target sources of data needed to assess an environmental problem. In general, developing a model requires two main steps: First, a model of the domain and the processes being studied must be defned. Then, at the model boundaries, a model of the boundary conditions must represent the infuencing environment surrounding the study domain. Scientists often develop \u201cphysical\u201d or \u201cdynamic\u201d models to estimate the location where a chemical would be expected to move under controlled conditions, only on a much smaller scale. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employs chambers or full-size test houses to model the fate of pollutants indoors. Like all models, the dynamic model\u2019s accuracyis dictatedbythe degree to which the actual conditions can be simulated and the quality of the information that is used.1 Numerical models apply mathematical expressions to approximate a system. There are three thermodynamic systems: 1. Isolated systems, in which no matter or energy crosses the boundaries of the system (i.e. no work can be done on the system). 2. Closed systems, in which energy can exchange with surroundings, but no matter crosses the boundary. 3. Open systems, in which both matter and energy freely exchange across system boundaries. Isolated systems are usually only encountered in highly controlled reactors, so are important in modeling pesticide formulation and manufacturing, but not directly pertinent to pesticide exposure modeling. In fact, most microenvironmental systems are open, but with simplifying assumptions, some subsystems can be treated as closed. Pesticide transport and fate models can be statistical and/or \u201cdeterministic\u201d. Statistical models include the pollutant dispersion models, such as the Lagrangian models, which follow the movement of a control volume starting from the source to the receptor locations. These often assume idealized Gaussian distributions of pesticides from a point of release, i.e. the pollutant concentrations are normally distributed in both the vertical and horizontal directions from the source. The Lagrangian approach is common for atmospheric releases. However, recent models based on the Lagrangian approach have incorporated descriptions of complex turbulence. \u201cStochastic\u201d models are statistical models that assume that the events affecting the behavior of a chemical in the environment are random, so such models are based on probabilities. These are being commonly adopted in the modeling of human exposures to air pollutants. Deterministic models are used when the physical, chemical, and other processes are suffciently understood so as to be incorporated to refect the movement and fate of chemicals. These are very diffcult models to develop because each process must be represented by a set of algorithms in the model. Also, the relationship between and among the systems, such as the kinetics and mass balances, must also be represented. Thus, the modeler must \u201cparameterize\u201d every important event following a pesticide\u2019s release to the environment.", "Often, hybrid models using both statistical and deterministic approaches are used, for example, when one part of a system tends to be more random, while another has a very strong basis is physical principals. Numerous models are available to address the movement of chemicals through a single environmental media, but increasingly, environmental scientists and engineers have begun to develop \u201cmultimedia models\u201d, such as compartmental models that help to predict the behavior and changes to chemicals as they move within and among reservoirs (e.g. carpet), in the air as dust and vapors, and in exchanges with surfaces.1 Fundamentals of Air Pollution 683 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00027-X Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS 27.2 METEOROLOGICAL BASES OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Air pollutants reach receptors by being transported and perhaps transformed in the atmosphere (Figure 27.1). The location of receptors relative to sources and atmospheric infuences affect pollutant concentrations, and the sensitivity of receptors to these concentrations determines the effects. The location, height, and duration of release, as well as the amount of pollutant released, are also of importance. Some of the infuences of the atmosphere on the behavior of pollutants, primarily the large-scale effects, are discussed here, as well as several effects of pollutants on the atmosphere. 27.2.1 Ventilation If air movement past a continuous pollutant source is slow, pollutant concentrations in the plume moving downwind will be much higher than they would be if the air were moving rapidly past the source. If polluted air continues to have pollution added to it, the concentration will increase. Generally, a source emits into different volumes of air over time. However, there can be a buildup of concentration over time even with significant air motion if there are many sources. Low-and high-pressure systems have considerably different ventilation characteristics. Air generally moves toward thecenterof a low (Figure 27.2) in the lower atmosphere, due in part to the frictional turning of the wind toward low pressure. This convergence causes upward vertical motion near the center of the low. Although the winds very near the center of the low are generally light, those away from the center are moderate, resulting in increased ventilation rates. Note the increased wind in the area to the west of the low in Figure 27.2. Low-pressure systems generally cover relatively small areas (although the low-pressure system shown in Figure 27.2 covers an extensive area) and are quite transient seldom remaining the same at a given area for a signifcant period of time. Lows are frequently accompanied by cloudy skies, which may cause precipitation. The cloudy skies minimize the variation in atmospheric stability from day to night. Primarily because of moderate horizontal wind speeds and upward vertical motion, ventilation (i.e. total air volume moving past a location) in the vicinity of low-pressure systems is quite good. High-pressure systems are characteristically the opposite of lows. Since the winds fow outward from the high-pressure center, subsiding air from higher in the atmosphere compensates for the horizontal transport of mass. This sinking air causes a subsidence inversion. Partially because of the subsiding vertical motion, the skies are usually clear, allowing maximum radiationd incoming during the day and outgoing at nightd Location Trasport wind direction local circulations Configuration Dilution wind speed Emissions time Dispersion and duration turbulence Characteristics Transformation height volume flow chemical physical temperature Location Monitoring Sensitivity plants (weather related) humans Removal fallout deposition washout impaction V.

Highs generally occupy large areas, and although they are transient, they are usually slow moving. Winds over large areas are generally light; note the winds to the south of the high in the lower left corner of Figure 27.2. Thus, the ventilation in the vicinity of high-pressure systems is generally much less than that of lows. 27.2.2 Stagnation At times the ventilation rate becomes very low.", "Such a lack of air motion usually occurs in the weak pressure gradient near the center of an anticyclone (i.e. of a high). If the high has a warm core, there is likely to be very little air movement near the center, i.e. stagnation. Under such circumstances, winds are very light. Skies are usually cloudless, contributing to the formation of surface-based radiation inversions at night. Although the clear skies contribute to instability in the daytime, the depth of the unstable layer (i.e. mixing height) may be severely limited due to the subsidence inversion over the high. The mixing height at a given time may be estimated by use of the morning radiosonde ascent plotted on a thermodynamic chart. The surface temperature at the given time is plotted on the diagram. If a dry adiabat is drawn through this temperature, the height above ground at the point where this dry adiabat intersects the morning sounding is the mixing height for that time. The mixing height for the time of maximum temperature is the maximum mixing height. Use of this sounding procedure provides an approximation because it assumes that there has been no signifcant advection since the time of the sounding. 27.2.3 Meteorological Conditions during Historic Pollution Episodes As discussed in Chapter 10, meteorological conditions can make the difference between a rather normal day and an air pollution episode. In the episode at Donora, Pennsylvania, during the period October 25e31, 1948,2 a nearly stationary polar high-pressure system caused the regional winds to be extremely light. Cold air accumulated in the bottom of the river valley and fog formed, which persisted past midday for four consecutive days. The top of a fog layer has a high albedo that refects solar radiation, so that only part of the incoming radiation is available to heat the fog layer and eliminate it (Figure 27.3(A)). During the night, longwave radiation leaves the top of the fog layer, further cooling and stabilizing the layer (Figure 27.3(B)). Wind speeds at Donora were less than 3.1 m s 1 (7 mi h 1) from the surface up to 1524 m (5000 ft) altitude for three consecutive days, so that pollutants emitted into the air within the valley were not transported far from their point of emission. Maximum temperatures at Donora at an elevation of 232 m (760 ft) mean sea level were considerably lower than those at the Pittsburgh airport, elevation 381 m (1250 ft), indicating the extreme vertical stability of the atmosphere. In the vicinity of Donora there were sources of sulfur dioxide, PM, and carbon monoxide. Previous recorded periods of stagnation had occurred in Donora in October 5e13, 1923 and October 7e18, 1938. This indicates that certain locations are vulnerable to such episodes, given their topography, e.g. river valleys. Similar meteorological conditions have led to other episodes, such as the anticyclonic conditions that formed a dense 4-day fog occurred in London and its surroundings during December 5e9, 1952.3,4 This system became stationary, so that there was almost no wind until milder weather returned. Measurements of PM less than approximately 20 mm in diameter and of sulfur dioxide were made at 12 sites in the greater London area during the episode. Note that this was before modern air pollutant monitoring techniques were standardized as they are today. However, the measurements appear to be reliable, since their methods have been well documented. The measurements V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS during the day (A) and radiates heat from the top of the fog at night (B). Adapted from Schrenk et al.2 were made by pumping air through a flter paper and then through a hydrogen peroxide solution. The smoke deposit on the flter was analyzed by refectometer; the sulfur dioxide was determined by titrating the hydrogen peroxide with standard alkali, eliminating interference by carbon dioxide. Using the sampling procedure, sulfur dioxide existing as a gas and dissolved in fne fog droplets was measured. Any sulfur dioxide associated with larger fog droplets or adsorbed on particles collected on the flter would not be measured. Smoke concentrations ranged from 0.3 to more than 4mgm 3. Daily means of the sampling stations are shown in Figure 27.4. Sulfur dioxide measurements ranged from less than 0.1 ppm (260 mgm3)to 1.34 ppm (3484 mgm 3). Also, 4 of the 11 stations had at least one daily value in excess of 1 ppm, and 9 of the 11 stations had at least one daily value in excess of 0.5 ppm.", "Compare these levels to the US primary standard for sulfur dioxide, which is a maximum 24-h concentration of 365 mgm 3 (0.14 ppm), not to be exceeded more than once per year. Daily means are shown in Figure 27.4. The mean smoke and SO2 values rose and later decreased in parallel. Daily concentrations of smoke averaged over all stations rose to about fve times normal and sulfur dioxide to about six times normal, peaking on December 7 and 8, respectively. In (A) (B) addition to the daily measurements at 12 sites, monthly measurements at 117 sites were made using lead peroxide candles. This allowed determination of the spatial pattern. The December 1952 concentrations were about 50% higher than those of December 1951. From the commencement of the fog and low visibility, many people experienced diffculty breathing, the effects occurring more or less simultaneously over a large area of hundreds of square kilometers. The rise in the number of deaths (Figure 27.4) paralleled the mean daily smoke and sulfur dioxide concentrations; daily deaths reached a peak on December 8 and 9, with many of them related to respiratory troubles. Although the deaths decreased when the concentrations decreased, the deaths per day remained considerably above the preepisode level for some days. A vexing question is whether most of the persons who died have died soon afterward anyway. If this were the case, a below-normal death rate would have occurred following the episode. This situation did not seem to exist, but detailed analysis was complicated by increased deaths in January and February 1953, which were attributed primarily to an infuenza outbreak. This is an example of the diffculty of attributing effects to elevated pollutant concentrations, given the complexity of estimating the amounts to which receptors are actually exposed, i.e. concentration is an important factor, but FIGURE 27.4 Daily air pollution (SO2 and smoke) 1000 and deaths during the 1952 London episode.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.2 METEOROLOGICAL BASES OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION not the only factor in calculating air pollution exposure (see Chapter 8). The excess deaths may be attributed to the synergistic effect of fne particles and sulfur dioxide. Surface inversions cause the condensation of fog, which, once formed, can persist. Air pollution is exacerbated with the persistence of fog for days coupled with considerable emissions of pollutants into a volume with topography that confnes air movement. 27.2.3.1 Air Pollution Emergencies Government authorities increasingly are facing emergencies that may require lifesaving decisions to be made rapidly by those on the scene. Of increasing frequency are transportation accidents involving the movement of volatile hazardous materials. A railroad derailment accident of a tank car of liquefed chlorine on February 26, 1978, at Youngtown, Florida, in which seven people died, and an accident in Houston, Texas, involving a truck carrying anhydrous ammonia on May 11, 1976, which also claimed seven lives are examples. Two potentially dangerous situations involved barges with tanks of chlorine, one that sank in the lower Mississippi River and another that came adrift and came to rest on the Ohio River dam at Louisville, Kentucky; neither resulted in release of material. Releases of radioactive materials from nuclear power plants have occurred, as during the worst US nuclear accident at Three-Mile Island, Pennsylvania in 1979, and much larger releases during the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl, Ukraine and the 2011 disaster at Fukushima, Japan. In such situations, releases may be suffcient to require evacuation of residents. Although nuclear releases are highly troubling, air pollution episodes have most often involved chemical releases. Air pollution disasters at Bhopal, India (organic chemical compounds), Chernobyl (radioisotopes) and Manhattan, New York (particulates and vapors) were unprecedented at the time they occurred. Bhopal, IndiadOn December 2, 1984, the contents of a methyl isocyanate (MIC) storage tank at the Union Carbide India plant in Bhopal became hot. Pressure in the tank became high. Nearly everything that could go wrong did. The refrigerator unit for the tank, which would have slowed the reactions, was turned off. After midnight, when the release valve blew, the vent gas scrubber that was to neutralize the gas with caustic soda failed to work. The fare tower, which would have burned the gas to harmless by-products, was down for repairs. As a result, many tons of MIC were released from the tank.", "The gas spread as a foglike cloud over a large, highly populated area to the south and east of the plant.5 The number of fatalities was in excess of 2000 with thousands of others injured. Although little is available in the way of meteorological measurements, it is assumed that winds were quite light and that the atmosphere at this time of day was relatively stable. Chernobyl, USSRdOn April 26, 1986, shortly after midnight local time, a serious accident occurred at a nuclear powerplantin Chernobyl inthe Ukraine. Itis estimated that 4% of the core inventory was releasedbetween April 26 and May 6. Quantities of Cs-137 (cesium) and I131 (iodine) were released and transported, resulting in contamination, primarily by wet deposition of cesium, in Finland, northern Sweden and Norway, the Alps, and the northern parts of Greece. Because of temperatures of several thousand kelvin during the explosion-like release, the resulting pollutant cloud is assumed to have reached heights of 2000 m or more. The estimated southeast winds at plume level initially moved the plume toward Finland, northern Sweden, and northern Norway. As winds at plume level gradually turned more easterly and fnally north and northwesterly, contaminated air affected the region of the Alps and northern Greece. A number of investigators, including Hass et al.,6 modeled the long-range transport including wet and dry removal processes. These attempts were considered quite successful, as radioactivity measurements provided some confrmation of the regions affected. Elevated levels of radioactivity were measured throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Because of the half-life of about 30 years for Cs-137, the contamination will endure. WorldTradeCenter (WTC),NewYorkdOnSeptember 11, 2001, terrorists intentionally crashed fully fueled Boeing 767 jets into the twin towers of the heavily populated WTC. The burning fuel, building materials and building contents, as well as the fbers and particles released duringthecollapsewerethesource of dangerousgasandparticle phase pollutants released throughout the city. In addition to the immediate threat, the fre smoldered for months following the attack, which was a source of a variety of pollutants (see Table 10.1 in Chapter 10). In such emergencies, it is most important to know the local wind direction at the accident site, so that the area that should be immediately evacuated can be determined. The next important factor is the wind speed, so that the travel time to various areas can be determined, again primarily for evacuation purposes. Both of these can be estimated on-site by simple means such as watching the drift of bubbles released by a bubble machine. It should be borne in mind that wind speeds are higher above ground and that wind direction is usually different. In fact, the WTC episode dramatically demonstrated the importance of local meteorology. The wind directions at Ground Zero were almost always different than that measured at any of the three nearby, major airports. And, the three airports often have meteorological conditions different from one another. As evacuation is taking place, it is important to determine whether meteorological events will cause a wind V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS direction shift later on, requiring a change in the evacuation scenario. Particularly in coastal areas, or areas of signifcant terrain, authorities should be alert to a possible change in wind direction in going from night to day or vice versa. Useful advice may be obtained from the nearest weather forecaster, although accurate forecasting of wind direction for specifc locations is not easy. Accurate air movement measurements and predictions are a matter of safety, even life and death. Portable meteorological stations have become accurate, precise, and reasonably available. These should be deployed during any emergency involving airborne contaminants, or the potential for such. If the situation is one of potential rather than current release, specifc concentrations at various distances and localities may be estimated for various conditions. 27.2.4 Pollution Processes the Atmosphere Obvious effects of pollutants on the atmosphere include increased PM, which decreases visibility and inhibits incoming solar radiation, and increased gaseous pollutant concentrations, which absorb longwave radiation and increase surface temperatures. However, particulate and gaseous pollutants affect the atmosphere in many other ways. 27.2.4.1 Turbidity The attenuation of solar radiation has been studied by McCormick and his associates7,8 utilizing the Voltz sun photometer, which uses measurements at a wavelength of 0.5 mm.", "The ratio of ground-level solar intensity at 0.5 mm to extraterrestrial solar intensity can be as high as 0.5 in clean atmospheres but can drop to 0.2e0.3 in polluted areas, indicating that ground-level solar intensity can be decreased as much as 50% by pollution in the air. By making measurements using aircraft at various heights, the vertical extent of the polluted air can be determined. The turbidity coeffcient can also be derived from the measurements and used to estimate the aerosol loading of the atmosphere. By assuming a particle size distribution in the size range 0.1e10 mm and a particle density, the total number of particles can be estimated. The mass loading per cubic meter can also be estimated. Because of the reasonable cost and simplicity of the sun photometer, it is useful for making comparative measurements around the world. 27.2.4.2 Precipitation Depending on its concentration, pollution can have opposite effects on the precipitation process. Addition of a few particles that act as ice nuclei can cause ice particles to grow at the expense of supercooled water droplets, resulting in particles large enough to fall as precipitation. An example of this is commercial cloud seeding, with silver iodide particles released from aircraft to induce rain. If too many such particles are added, none of them will grow suffciently to cause precipitation. Therefore, the effects of pollution on precipitation are not at all straightforward. There have been some indications, although controversial, of increased precipitation downwind of major metropolitan areas. Urban addition of nuclei and moisture and urban enhancement of vertical motion due to increased roughness and the urban heat island effect have been suggested as possible causes. 27.2.4.3 Fogs As mentioned in the previous section, the increased number of nuclei in polluted urban atmospheres can cause dense persistent fogs due to the many small droplets formed. Fog formationisverydependentonhumidity and, in some situations, humidity is increased by release of moisture from industrial processes. Low atmospheric moisture content can also occur, especially in urban areas; two causes are lack of vegetation and rapid runoff of rainwaterthrough stormsewers. Also,slightlyhighertemperatures in urban areas lower the relative humidity. 27.2.4.4 Solar Radiation In the early part of this century, the loss of ultraviolet light in some metropolitan areas due to heavy coal smoke was of concern because of the resulting decrease in the production of natural vitamin D, which causes the disease rickets. Recently, measurements in Los Angeles smoghave revealed much greaterdecreasesin ultraviolet than visible light. This is due to both absorption by ozone of wavelengths less than 0.32 mm and absorption by nitrogen dioxide in the 0.36e0.4 mm range. Heavy smog has decreased ultraviolet radiation by as much as 90%. 27.2.5 Removal Mechanisms Except for fne PM (0.2 mm or less), which may remain airborne for long periods of time, and gases such as carbon monoxide, which do not react readily, most airborne pollutants are eventually removed from the atmosphere by sedimentation, reaction, or dry or wet deposition. 27.2.5.1 Sedimentation (Settling by Gravity) Particles less than about 20 mm are treated as dispersing as gases, and effects due to their fall velocity are generally ignored. Particles greater than about 20 mm have appreciable settling velocities. The fall velocity of smooth spheres as a function of particle size has been plotted (Figure 27.5) by Hanna et al.9 Particles in the range 20e100 mm are assumed to disperse approximately as gases, but with their centroid moving downward in the atmosphere according to the fall velocity. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.2 METEOROLOGICAL BASES OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION 27.2.5.3 Dry Deposition Although it does not physically explain the nature of the removal process, deposition velocity has been used to account for removal due to impaction with vegetation 100 near the surface or for chemical reactions with the sur face. McMahon and Denison10 gave many deposition velocities in their review paper. Examples (in centimeters per second) are sulfur dioxide, 0.5e1.2; ozone, 0.1e2.0; iodine, 0.7e2.8; and carbon dioxide, negligible. 27.2.5.4 Wet Deposition Scavenging of particles or gases may take place in clouds (rainout) by cloud droplets or below clouds C (washout) washout ra by tio precipitation. A scavenging W can be defned as ratio or W \u00bc kr (27.3) where k is concentration of the contaminant in precipitation in micrograms per gram; r is the density of air, Vg (cm s&#2;1) 10 1 1 10 100 d (&#3;m)", "This can be accounted for by subtracting vgt from the effective height of release, where vg is the gravitational fall velocity of the particles and t, in seconds, is x/u, where x is downwind distance from the source in m and u is wind speed. This is called the tilted plume model. The model may be modifed to decrease the strength of the source with distance from the source to account for the particles removed by deposition. For 20e100 mm particles, the deposition w on the ground is w \u00bcvgC\u00f0x; y; z\u00de (27.1) where the air concentration C is evaluated for a height above ground z of about 1 m. which is approximately 1200 g m 3; and C is the concentration in micrograms per cubic meter, of the pollutant in the air prior to scavenging. McMahon and Denison10 gave a table of feld observations of washout ratios. The values for various pollutants range from less than 100 to more than 4000. These values are a function of particle size and rainfall intensity, generally decreasing with the latter and increasing with the former. Scavenging may also be considered as an exponential decay process: Lt C\u00f0t\u00de\u00bcC\u00f00\u00dee (27.4) where C(t) is the concentration in micrograms per cubic meter at time t in seconds, C(0) is the concentration at time 0, and L is the scavenging or washout coeffcient, Particles larger than 100 mm fall through the atmo sphere so rapidly that turbulence has less chance to act upon and disperse them. The trajectories of such parti cles are treated by a ballistic approach. 27.2.5.2 Reaction (Transformation) Transformations due to chemical reactions throughout the plume are frequently treated as exponential losses with time.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS per second. Figure 27.6, after Engelmann,11 gives the washout coeffcient as a function of particle diameter and rainfall rate. McMahon and Denison10 give a table of feld measurements of scavenging coeffcients. This same concept can be applied to gaseous pollutants. Fewer data are available for gases. Values ranging from 0.4 10 5 to 6 10 5 for SO2 are given by McMahon and Denison10 and compared reasonably well with an equation for SO2 by Chamberlain12: 5J0:53 L \u00bc 10 10 (27.5) where J is rainfall intensity in millimeters per hour. 27.3 TRANSPORT AND DISPERSION OF AIR POLLUTANTS 27.3.1 Wind Velocity 27.3.1.1 Wind Direction The initial direction of transport of pollutants from their source is determined by the wind direction at the source. Air pollutant concentrations from point sources are probably more sensitive to wind direction than any other parameter. If the wind is blowing directly toward a receptor (a location receiving transported pollutants), a shift in direction of as little as 5 (the approximate accuracy of a wind direction measurement) causes concentrations at the receptor to drop about 10% under unstable conditions, about 50% under neutral conditions, and about 90% under stable conditions. The direction of plume transport is very important in source impact assessment where there are sensitive receptors or two or more sources and in trying to assess the performance of a model through comparison of measured air quality with model estimates. There is normally considerable wind direction shear (change of direction) with height, especially near the ground. Although surface friction causes the wind to shift clockwise (veer) with height near the ground, the horizontal thermal structure of the atmosphere may exert a dominating infuence at higher altitudes, such that the wind will shift counterclockwise (back) with additional height. Cold air advection in an air layer will cause the wind to back with height through that layer. Warm air advection will cause veering with height. 27.3.1.2 Wind Speed Wind speed generally increases with height. A number of expressions describe the variation of wind speed in the surface boundary layer. A power law profle has frequently been used in air pollution work:", "\u00dep u\u00f0z\u00de\u00bc u\u00f0za\u00de\u00f0z=za (27.6) where u(z) is the wind speed at height z, u(za) the wind speed at the anemometer measurement height za, and p an exponent varying from about 0.1 to 0.4. Figure 27.7 gives the measured wind speed variation with height for specifc instances for fve locations. The result of using the power law profle (Eqn 27.6) is also shown (open circles and dashed lines) using a value of p of 1/7. It should be noted that the power law wind profles do not necessarily represent the data well. The exponent actually varies with atmospheric stability, surface roughness, and depth of the layer.13 One of the effects of wind speed is to dilute continuously released pollutants at the point of emission. Whether a source is at the surface or elevated, this dilution takes place in the direction of plume transport. Figure 27.8 shows this effect of wind speed for an elevated source with an emission of 6 mass units per second. For a wind speed of 6 m s 1, there is 1 unit between 500 0 024 68100 2468101214024 6 810 z (m) u (m s\u20131) V.

When the wind is slowed to 2 m s 1, there are 3 units between those same vertical parallel planes 1 m apart. Note that this dilution by the wind takes place at the point of emission. Because of this, wind speeds used in estimating plume dispersion are generally estimated at stack top. Wind speed also affects the travel time from source to receptor; halving of the wind speed will double the travel time. For buoyant sources, plume rise is affected by wind speed; the stronger the wind, the lower the plume. Specifc equations for estimating plume rise are presented in Chapter 2. 27.3.2 Turbulence Turbulence is highly irregular motion of the wind. The atmosphere does not fow smoothly but has seemingly random, rapidly varying erratic motions. This uneven fow superimposed on the mean fow has swirls or eddies in a wide range of sizes. The energy cascades through the eddy sizes, which are described by L. F. Richardson in verse: Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity And little whirls have lesser whirls and so on to viscosity. There are basically two different causes of turbulent eddies. Eddies set in motion by air moving past objects are the result of mechanical turbulence. Parcels of superheated air rising from the heated earth\u2019s surface, and the slower descent of a larger portion of the atmosphere surrounding these more rapidly rising parcels, result in thermal turbulence. The size and, hence, the scale of the eddies caused by thermal turbulence are larger than those of the eddies caused by mechanical turbulence. The manifestation of turbulent eddies is gustiness and is displayed in the fuctuations seen on a continuous record of wind or temperature. Figure 27.9 displays wind direction traces during (A) mechanical and (B) thermal turbulence. Fluctuations due to mechanical turbulence tend to be quite regular, that is, eddies of nearly constant size are generated. The eddies generated by thermal turbulence are both larger and more variable in size than those due to mechanical turbulence. The most important mixing process in the atmosphere that causes the dispersion of air pollutants is called eddy diffusion. The atmospheric eddies cause a breaking apart of atmospheric parcels, which mixes polluted air with relatively unpolluted air, causing polluted air at lower and lower concentrations to occupy successively larger volumes of air. Eddy or turbulent dispersion is most effcient when the scale of the eddy is similar to that of the pollutant puff or plume being diluted. Smaller eddies are effective only at tearing at the edges of the pollutant mass. On the other hand, larger eddies will usually only transport the mass of polluted air as a whole. The size and infuence of eddies on the vertical expansion of continuous plumes have been related to vertical temperature structure.15 Three appearances of instantaneous plumes related to specifc lapse rates and three appearances of instantaneous plumes related to combinations of lapse rates are shown in Figure 27.10. Strong lapse is decrease in temperature with height in excess of the adiabatic lapse rate.", "Weak lapse is decrease in temperature with height at a rate between the dry adiabatic rate and the isothermal condition (no change of temperature with height). A number of methods have been used to measure or estimate the level of turbulence in the atmosphere and, (B) thermal. From Smith.14 5 43 2 1 V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.

These methods vary from direct measurement of wind fuctuations by sensitive wind measurement systems; to classifcation based on the appearance of the chart record of the wind direction trace; to classifcation of atmospheric stability indirectly by wind speed and estimates of insolation (incoming solar radiation) or outgoing longwave radiation. Details of these methods are given in the next section. 27.3.3 Estimating Concentrations from Point Sources The principal framework of empirical equations that form a basis for estimating concentrations from point sources is commonly referred to as the Gaussian plume model. Employing a three-dimensional axis system of downwind, crosswind, and vertical with the origin at the ground, it assumes that concentrations from a continuously emitting plume are proportional to the emission rate, that these concentrations are diluted by the wind at the point of emission at a rate inversely proportional to the wind speed, and that the time-averaged (about 1 h) pollutant concentrations crosswind and vertically near the source are well described by Gaussian or normal (bell-shaped) distributions. The standard deviations of plume concentration in these two directions are empirically related to the levels of turbulence in the atmosphere and increase with distance from the source. In its simplest form, the Gaussian model assumes that the pollutant does not undergo chemical reactions or other removal processes in traveling away from the source and that pollutant material reaching the ground or the top of the mixing height as the plume grows is eddy-refected back toward the plume centerline. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.3 TRANSPORT AND DISPERSION OF AIR POLLUTANTS 27.3.3.1 The Gaussian Equations All three of the Gaussian Eqns (27.7)e(27.9) are based on a coordinate scheme with the origin at the ground, x downwind from the source, y crosswind, and z vertical. The normal vertical distribution near the source is modifed at greater downwind distances by eddy refection at the ground and, when the mixing height is low, by eddy refection at the mixing height. Eddy re\ufb02ection refers to the movement away (\u201crefection\u201d) of circular eddies of air from the earth\u2019s surface, since they cannot penetrate that surface. Cross-sections in the horizontal and vertical at two downwind distances through a plume from a 20-m-high source with an additional 20 m of plume rise (to result in a 40-m effective height) are shown in Figure 27.11.The following symbols are used: C concentration, grams per cubic meter Q emission rate, grams per second u wind speed, meters per second sy standard deviation of horizontal distribution of plume concentration (evaluated at the downwind distance x and for the appropriate stability), meters sz standard deviation of vertical distribution of plume concentration (evaluated at the downwind distance x and for the appropriate stability), meters L mixing height, meters h physical stack height, meters H effective height of emission, meters x downwind distance, meters y crosswind distance, meters z receptor height above ground, meters The concentration c resulting at a receptor at (x, y, z) from a point source located at (0, 0, H)isgiven by one of the three following equations. (Methods for obtaining values for the dispersion parameters sy and sz in the following equations are discussed later in this chapter.) For stable conditions or unlimited vertical mixing (a very high mixing height), use n .h ion .h io C \u00bc Q\u00f01=u\u00de g1 \u00f02p\u00de0:5 sy g2 \u00f02p\u00de0:5 sz (27.7) where . g1 \u00bc exp 20:5y 2 sy h . i h . i g2 \u00bc exp 0:5 \u00f0H z\u00de2 2 sz \u00fe exp 0:5\u00f0H\u00fe z\u00de2 2 sz Note that if y \u00bc 0, or z \u00bc 0, or both z and H are 0, this equation is greatly simplifed. For locations in the vertical plane containing the plume centerline, y \u00bc 0 and g1 \u00bc 1.", "For unstable or neutral conditions, where sz is greater than 1.6L, use the following equation to fnd the steady state concentration: n .h io C \u00bc Q\u00f01=u\u00de g1 \u00f02p\u00de0:5 sy \u00f01=L\u00de (27.8) For these large sz values, eddy refection has occurred repeatedly both at the ground and at the mixing height, so that the vertical expanse of the plume has been uniformly mixed through the mixing height, i.e. 1/L. For unstable or neutral conditions, where sz is less than 1.6L, use the following equation provided that both H and z are less than L: n .h ion .h io C \u00bc Q\u00f01=u\u00de g1 \u00f02p\u00de0:5 sy g3 \u00f02p\u00de0:5 sz (27.9) where N nh .i X 2 g3 \u00bc exp 0:5\u00f0Hz\u00fe 2NL\u00de2 s z N\u00bc N h .io 2 \u00fe exp 0:5\u00f0H\u00fe z\u00fe 2NL\u00de2 s z V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS This infnite series converges rapidly, and evaluation with N varying from 4to \u00fe4 is usually suffcient. These equations are used when evaluating by computer, as the series g3 can easily be evaluated. When estimates are being made by hand calculations, Eqn (27.7) is frequently applied until sz \u00bc 0.8L. This will cause an infection point in a plot of concentrations with distance. Byadding Eqn (27.9), which includes multiple eddy refections, and changing the criteria for the use of Eqn (27.8) to situations in which sz is evaluated as being greater than 1.6L, a smooth transition to uniform mixing, Eqn (27.8), is achieved regardless of source or receptor height. By differentiating Eqn (27.7) and setting it equal to zero, an equation for maximum concentration can be derived: 2Q sz Cmax \u00bc (27.10) pueH2 sy and the distance to maximum concentration is at the distance where sz \u00bc H/(2)0.5. This equation is strictly correct only if the sz/sy ratio is constant with distance. 27.3.3.2 Alternate Coordinate Systems for the Gaussian Equations For estimating concentrations from more than one source, it is convenient to use map coordinates for locations. Gifford16 has pointed out that the resulting calculated concentration is the same whether the preceding axis system is used or whether an origin is placed at the ground beneath the receptor, with the x-axis oriented upwind, the z-axis remaining vertical, and the y-axis crosswind. This latter axis system is convenient in assessing the total concentration at a receptor from more than one source provided that the wind direction can be assumed to be the same over the area containing the receptor and the sources of interest. Given an eastenorth coordinate system (R, S) the upward distance x and the crosswind distance y of a point source from a receptor are given by x \u00bc Sp Sr cos q \u00fe Rp Rr sin q (27.11) y \u00bc Sp Sr sin q Rp Rr cos q (27.12) where Rp, Sp are the coordinates of the point source; Rr, Sr are the coordinates of the receptor; and q is the wind direction (the direction from which the wind blows). The units of x and y will be thesameas those of the coordinate system R, S. In order to determine plume dispersion parameters, distances must be in kilometers or meters. A conversion may be required to convert x and y above to the appropriate units. 27.3.3.3 Determination of Dispersion Parameters 27.3.3.3.1 BY DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF WIND FLUCTUATIONS Hay and Pasquill17 and Cramer18,19 have suggested the use of fuctuation statistics from fxed wind systems to estimate the dispersion taking place within pollutant plumes over fnite release times. The equation used for calculating the variance of the bearings (azimuth) from 2 the point of release of the particles, s p, at a particular downwind location is 22 sp \u00bc sa\u00f0s; s\u00de (27.13) 2 where s is the variance of the azimuth angles of a wind a vane over the sampling period s calculated from average wind directions averaged over averaging periods of duration s; s equals T/b, where T is the travel time to the downwind location; T is equivalent to x/u, where x is the downwind distance from the source and u is the transport wind speed. Here b is the ratio of the timescale of the turbulence moving with the air stream (Lagrangian) to the timescale of the turbulence at a fxed point (Eulerian). Although b has considerable variation (from about 1 to 9), a reasonable ft to feld data has been found using a value of 4 for b. A similar equation can be written for vertical spread from an elevated source.", "The standard deviation of the vertical distribution of pollutants at the downwind distance x is given by sz \u00bc se\u00f0s; s\u00dex (27.14) where sz is in meters and se is the standard deviation of the elevation angle, in radians, over the sampling period s calculated from averaged elevation angles over averaging periods s. Here, as before, s equals T/b where T is travel time, and b can be approximated as equal to 4; x in Eqn (27.14) is in meters. In application, s values can be calculated over several set averaging periods s. The distances to which each s applies are then given by x \u00bc bus. To calculate plume dispersion directly from fuctuation measurements, Draxler20 used equations in the form sy \u00bc xsafy (27.15) sz \u00bc xsefz (27.16) He analyzed dispersion data from 11 feld experiments in order to determine the form of the functions fy and fz, including release height effects. Irwin21 has V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.3 TRANSPORT AND DISPERSION OF AIR POLLUTANTS used simplifed expressions for these functions where both fy and fz have the form .h i f \u00bc 11 \u00fe 0:9\u00f0T=T0\u00de0:5 (27.17) where travel time T is x/u; T0 is 1000 for fy; T0 is 500 for fz for unstable (including daytime neutral) conditions; and T0 is 50 for fz for stable (including nighttime neutral) conditions. 27.3.3.3.2 BY CLASSIFICATION OF WIND DIRECTION TRACES Where specialized fuctuation data are not available, estimates of horizontal spreading can be approximated from conventional wind direction traces. A method suggested by Smith14 and Singer and Smith22 uses classifcation of the wind direction trace to determine the turbulence characteristics of the atmosphere, which are then used to infer the dispersion. Five turbulence classes are determined from inspection of the analog record of wind direction over a period of 1 h. These classes are defned in Table 27.1. The atmosphere is classifed as A, B2,B1, C, or D. At Brookhaven National Laboratory, where the system was devised, the most unstable category, A, occurs infrequently enough that insuffcient information is available to estimate its dispersion parameters. For the other four classes, the equations, coeffcients, and exponents for the dispersion parameters are given in Table 27.2, where the source to receptor distance x is in meters. 27.3.3.3.3 BY CLASSIFICATION OF ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY Pasquill24 advocated the use of fuctuation measurements for dispersion estimates but provided a scheme \u201cfor use in the likely absence of special measurements of wind structure, there was clearly a need for broad TABLE 27.1 Brookhaven Gustiness Classes A Fluctuations of wind direction exceeding 90 B2 Fluctuations ranging from 45 to 90 B1 Similar to A and B2, with fuctuations confned to a range of 15 e45 C Distinguished by the unbroken solid core of the trace, through which a straight line can be drawn for the entire hour without touching \u201copen space\u201d. The fuctuations must be 15 , but no upper limit is imposed D The trace approximates a line. Short-term fuctuations do not exceed 15 Based on variations of horizontal wind direction over 1 h at the height of release.

The frst element is a scheme that includes the important effects of thermal stratifcation to yield broad categories of stability. The necessary parameters for the scheme consist of wind speed, insolation, and cloudiness, which are basically obtainable from routine observations (Table 27.3). Pasquill\u2019s dispersion parameters were restated in terms of sy and sz by Gifford26,27 to allow their use in the Gaussian plume equations. The parameters sy and sz are found by estimation from the graphs (Figure 27.12), as a function of the distance between source and receptor, from the appropriate curve, one for each stability class.23 Alternatively, sy and sz can be calculated using the equations given in Tables 27.4 and 27.5, which are used in the point source computer TABLE 27.3 Pasquill Stability Categories Isolation Night Surface Thinly Wind Overcast Speed or \u20214/8 \u00a33/8 (m sL1) Strong Moderate Slight Low Cloud Cloud <2A AeBB ee 2e3AeBBCE F 3e5B BeCCD E 5e6C CeDDD D > 6CDDD D (for AeB, take the average of values for A and B, etc.) Notes 1.", "Strong insolation corresponds to sunny midday in midsummer in England; slight insolation to similar conditions in midwinter. 2.

What is the approximate distance of the maximum concentration, and what is the concentration at this point if the atmosphere is appropriately represented by Pasquill stability class B? Solution: The maximum occurs approximately when sz \u00bcH/(2)1/2 \u00bc28.3 m. Under B stability, this occurs at TABLE 27.4 PasquilleGifford Horizontal Dispersion Parameter Stability Parameter A T \u00bc24.167 2.5334 ln x B T \u00bc18.333 1.8096 ln x C T \u00bc12.5 1.0857 ln x D T \u00bc8.3333 0.72382 ln x E T \u00bc6.25 0.54287 ln x F T \u00bc4.1667 0.36191 ln x Note: sy (m) \u00bc465.116x tan T; x is downwind distance in kilometers; T is one-half Pasquill\u2019s q (degrees). 100 101 x, Distance downwind (km) x \u00bc0.28 km.

Note that the concentration obtained from this equation is the same as that obtained from the approximation equation for the maximum. Buoyancy-induced dispersion, which is caused near the source due to the rapid expansion of the plume during the rapid rise of the thermally buoyant plume after its release from the point of discharge, should also be included for buoyant releases.27 The effective vertical dispersion sze is found from 2 22 s \u00bc\u00f0DH=3:5\u00de\u00fes (27.19) ze z V.

The primary quantity needed is the hourly average wind speed. A representative value may be obtained from values taken each minute, although values taken at intervals of 1e5s are better. The vane can be used for both average wind direction and the fuctuation statistic sa, both determined over hourly intervals. The vane should have a distance constant of less than 5 m and a damping ratio greater than or equal to 0.4 to have a proper response. Relative accuracy should be 1 and absolute accuracy should be 5 .In order to estimate sa accurately, the direction should be sampled at intervals of 1e5 s. This can best be accomplished by microcircuitry (minicomputer) designed to sample properly the output from the vane and perform the calculations for both mean wind and sa, taking into account crossover shifts of the wind past the 360 and 0 point. The elevation angle, and through appropriate data processing se, can be measured with a bivane (a vane pivoted so as to move in the vertical as well as the horizontal). Bivanes require frequent maintenance and calibration and are affected by precipitation and formation of dew. A bivane is therefore more a research instrument than an operational one. Vertical fuctuations may be measured by sensing vertical velocity w and calculating sw from the output of a propeller anemometer mounted on a vertical shaft. The instrument should be placed away from other instrumentation and the propeller axis carefully aligned to be vertical. The specifcations of this sensor are the same as those of the wind sensor. Because this instrument will frequently be operating near its lower threshold and because the elevation angle of the wind vector is small, such that the propeller will be operating at yaw angles where it has least accuracy, this method of measuring vertical velocity is not likely to be as accurate as the measurement of horizontal fuctuation. Rather than using separate systems for horizontal and vertical wind measurements, a uevew anemometer system (Figure 27.15) sensing wind along three orthogonal axes, with proper processing to give average wind direction and sa from the combination of the u and v components and w and sw from the w component may be used. Additional near-surface measurements may also be required to support calculated quantities such as the bulk Richardson number (a stability parameter): gh qh qz RiB \u00bc 2 Tu h which requires a temperature gradient, a temperature, and wind speed at the height of the boundary layer h.", "For this purpose, in addition to the wind speed at 10 m from the instrumentation, a vertical temperature difference measurement is needed. This can be obtained for the interval of 2e10 m above ground using two relatively slow response sensors wired to give the temperature difference directly. Again, hourly averages are of greatest interest. The specifcations are response V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.3 TRANSPORT AND DISPERSION OF AIR POLLUTANTS time of 1 min, accuracy of 0.1 C, and resolution of 0.02 C. Both sensors should use good-quality aspirated radiation shields to give representative values. Sensor sampling about every 30 s yields good hourly averages. Radiation instruments are useful in determining stability such as F. B. Smith\u2019s29 stability parameter P. Although somewhat similar to the Pasquill stability class (Table 27.3), P is continuous (rather than a discrete class) and is derived from wind speed and measurement of upward heat fux or, lacking this, incoming solar radiation (in daytime) and cloud amount at night. Pyranometers measure total sun and sky radiation. Net radiometers measure both incoming (mostly shortwave) radiation and outgoing (mostly longwave) radiation. Data from both are useful in turbulence characterization, and the values should be integrated over hourly periods. Care should be taken to avoid shadows on the sensors. The net radiometer is very sensitive to the condition of the ground surface over which it is exposed. 27.3.4.2 Measurements above the Surface Measurements above the surface are also important to support pollutant impact evaluation. The radiosonde program of the National Weather Service (Figure 27.16), established to support forecast and aviation weather activities, is a useful source of temperatures and data on winds aloft, although it has the disadvantage that measurements are made at 12-h intervals and the surface layer is inadequately sampled because of the fast rate of rise of the balloon. Mixing height, the height V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS above ground of the neutral or unstable layer, is calculated from the radiosonde information (see Chapter 2). Measurements of wind, turbulence, and temperature aloft may also be made at various heights on meteorological towers taller than 10 m. Where possible, the sensors should be exposed on a boom at a distance from the tower equal to two times the diameter of the tower at that height. Aircraft can take vertical temperature soundings and can measure air pollutant and tracer concentrations and turbulence intensity. Airborne lidar can measure plume heights, and integrating nephelometers can determine particle size distributions. Since operating aircraft, building towers, and establishing instruments on towers are extremely expensive, considerable attention has focused on indirect upper air sounding from the ground. Mixing height within the range of measurement (approximately 500e600 m above ground) can be determined by either the Doppler or the monostatic version of sodar (sound direction and ranging) with a spatial resolution of about 30 m. Data on wind and turbulence can be determined by Doppler sodar, frequency modulated-continuous wave (FM-CW) radar, and lidar. Doppler sodar measurements of wind components are within approximately 0.5 m s 1 of tower measurements. Measurements represent 30-m volume averages in the vertical. A height of 500 m above ground, and sometimes over 1000 m, can be reached routinely. Some measurements that are completely impractical for routine measurement programs are useful during periods of intensive feld programs. Winds and temperatures can be measured through frequent releases of balloon-carried sensors. Lidar is useful for determining plume dimensions. The particle lidar measures backscatter of laser radiation from particles in the plume and particles in the free air. The differential absorption lidar uses two wavelengths, one with strong absorption by sulfur dioxide and the other for weak absorption. The difference determines the amount of sulfur dioxide in the plume. Positioning of the lidar and its scanning mode determines whether vertical or horizontal dimensions of the plume are measured. 27.3.4.3 Data Reduction and Quality Assurance A meteorological measurement program includes data reduction, calculation of quantities not directly measured, data logging, and archiving. Special-purpose minicomputers are used for sampling sensor output at frequent intervals (down to fractions of a second), calculating averages, and determining standard deviations. The output from the minicomputer should go to a data logger so that the appropriate information can be recorded on magnetic tape or disk or paper tape. If only hourly values must be archived, a considerable period of record for all data from a site can be contained on a single tape, disk, or cassette. Hard copy from a printer is usually also obtained.", "Immediate availability of this copy can aid in detecting system or sensor malfunctions. Sometimes analog charts are maintained for each sensor to provide backup data recovery (in case of reduction error or data logger malfunction) and to detect sensor malfunction. An extremely important part of a measurement program is an adequate quality assurance program. Cost cutting in this part of the program can result in useless measurements. A good-quality assurance program includes calibration of individual components and of the entire system in the laboratory; calibration of the system upon installation in the feld; scheduled maintenance and servicing; recalibration (perhaps quarterly); and daily examination of data output for unusual or unlikely values. More frequent servicing than that recommended by manufacturers may be required when sensors are placed in polluted atmospheres that may cause relatively rapid corrosion of instrument parts. 27.3.5 Atmospheric Tracers 27.3.5.1 Technique Tracer studies are extremely important in furthering our knowledge of atmospheric dispersion. These studies consist of release of a known quantity of a unique substance (the tracer), with measurements of that substance at one or more downwind sampling locations. Early experiments released uranine dye as a liquid spray; the water evaporated, leaving fne fuorescent particles to be sampled. Later, dry fuorescent particles (e.g. zincecadmium sulfde) having a relatively narrow range of particle sizes were used. Since the early 1970s, the gas sulfur hexafuoride has been used for most tracer studies, with collection in bags at sampling locations for later laboratory analysis using electron-capture gas chromatography. Most recently, the US Departments of Homeland Security, Energy, and Commerce, and the EPA have used perfuoride tracers (PFTs) in their Urban Dispersion Program. The PFTs have the advantage over sulfur hexafuoride in that there are a very few sources that may interfere with the measurements. In addition, the various chemical forms of PFTs can be readily identifed at very low concentrations (circa parts per quadrillion). Having a number of different chemical forms allows the tracer measurements to be linked to different sources. In fact, this was accomplished in tracer studies conducted in New York City in 2005 (see Figures 27.17 and 27.18).30 V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.3 TRANSPORT AND DISPERSION OF AIR POLLUTANTS in New York City. The tracers are PMCP (perfuoromethylcyclopentane), oc-PDCH (perfuoro-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane), PMCH (perfuoromethyl-cyclohexane), and PECH (perfuoroethyl-cyclohexane). Ref. 30. Tracer studies are generally conducted by going into the feld for a 2-week to 1-month intensive study period. The tracer is released, generally from a constant height, continuously at a constant rate for a set period (perhaps 2e3 h) on a day selected for its meteorological conditions with the wind forecast to blow toward the sampling network. Sampling equipment is arranged at ground level on constant-distance arcs usually at three or four distances. The samplers begin at a set time as switched on by the feld crew or by radio control. More sophisticated samplers allow the unattended collection sequentially of several samples. Sampling time varies from around 20 min to several hours. This procedure measures horizontal dispersion at the height of the samplers. Although it is highly desirable to determine vertical dispersion as well by direct measurement, it is seldom practical. Sampling in the vertical can be done by sampling on fxed towers or arranging samplers along the cables of captive balloons. Both of these methods are extremely expensive in terms of both equipment and personnel. Although it is possible to sample the tracer with aircraft, the pass through the pollutant plume occurs at such high speed that it is diffcult to relate this instantaneous sample to what would occur over a longer sampling time of from 20 min to 1h. 27.3.5.2 Computations If the tracer concentration is ci measured at each sampling position that has its position at yi on a scale along the arc (either in degrees or in meters), estimates of the mean position of the plume at ground level and the variance of the ground-level concentration distribution are given by P ciyi y \u00bc P (27.21) ci V.

Provided that the emission rate Q, the height of release H, and the mean wind speed u are known, the standard deviation of the vertical distribution of the pollutant can be approximated from either the peak concentration (actual or ftted) or the crosswind integrated (CWI) concentration from one of the following equations: .h i 20:5 sz exp 0:5\u00f0H=sz\u00de\u00bc2Q \u00f02p\u00de (27.24) ucCWI .h i 2 sz exp 0:5\u00f0H=sz\u00de\u00bcQ \u00f0p\u00deusyCpeak (27.25) The CWI concentration in grams per square meter may be approximated from the tracer measurements from X CCWI \u00bcsampler spacing \u00f0m\u00de Ci (27.26) Using the data from Figure 27.20,the calculated sz from the CWI concentration is 239 m; from the observed peak concentration it is 232 m; and from the ftted peak concentration it is 235 m. Note that errors in any of the parameters H, Q,or u, will cause errors in the estimated sz. Although extremely useful, tracer experiments require considerable capital expenditures and personnel.

For example, trying to interpret a series of tracer experiments, even if conducted over a relatively large number of hours, in relation to the conditions that cause the second highest concentration once a year is extremely diffcult, if not impossible. 27.3.6 Concentration Variation with Averaging Time If emission and meteorological conditions remained unchanged hour after hour, concentrations at various locations downwind would remain the same. However, since such conditions are ever-changing, concentrations 10,000 vary with time. Even under fairly steady meteorological conditions, with the mean wind direction remaining nearly the same over a period of some hours, as the averaging time increases, greater departures in wind direction from the mean are experienced, thus spreading the time-averaging plume more and reducing the longer averaging time concentration compared with that experienced for shorter averaging times at the location of the highest concentrations. This effect is more pronounced for receptors infuenced by single point sources than for those infuenced by a number of point sources or by a combination of point and area sources, because there will be many hours when the wind is not blowing from the source to the receptor. Figure 27.18 shows the maximum sulfur dioxide concentrations for eight averaging times over a 1-year period (1976) for two air monitoring stations in the Regional Air Monitoring (RAM) network in St. Louis. These two monitoring stations, 104 and 113, have the highest and lowest maximum 1-h concentrations of the 13 stations with sulfur dioxide measurements. These maximum concentrations deviate only slightly from a power law relation: Sulfur dioxide concentration ( g m 3) 1000 100 b \u00bc at (27.27) Cpp where cp is the maximum concentration for the period p, tp is the averaging time in hours, and a and b are appropriate constants. The power b is 0.28 for station 104 and 0.33 for station 113. Larsen31e34 has developed averaging time models for use in analysis and interpretation of air quality data. For urban areas where concentrations for a given averaging time tend to be lognormally distributed, that 10 Week Month Quarter Year is, where a plot of the log of concentration versus the cumulative frequency of occurrence on a normal fre- quency distribution scale is nearly linear, the two tions with sampling time for locations with highest (station 104) and lowest (station 113) maximum 1-h concentrations. parameter averaging time model (Figure 27.21)is V.

If these two parameters for a pollutant at a site can be determined for an averaging time, the model can calculate them and the annual maximum concentration expected for any other averaging time. For receptors in the vicinity of point sources, where for a given averaging time many concentrations will be zero, a three-parameter averaging time model is required. The third parameter is an increment (positive or negative) that is added to every observed concentration. In Figure 27.21,the three-parameter model applied to data from the vicinity of a power plant, 6 mgm 3 has been added to each observed concentration. 27.4 AIR POLLUTION MODELING AND PREDICTION To build new facilities or to expand existing ones without harming the environment, it is desirable to assess the air pollution impact of a facility prior to its construction, rather than construct and monitor to determine the impact and whether it is necessary to retroft additional controls. Potential air pollution impact is usually estimated through the use of air quality simulation models. A wide variety of models is available. They are usually distinguished by type of source, pollutant, transformations and removal, distance of transport, and averaging time. No attempt has been made here to list all the models in existence at the time of this writing. In its simplest form, a model requires two types of data inputs: information on the source or sources including pollutant emission rate and meteorological data such as wind velocity and turbulence. The model then simulates mathematically the pollutant\u2019s transport and dispersion, and perhaps its chemical and physical transformations and removal processes. The model output is air pollutant concentration for a particular time period, usually at specifc receptor locations. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.4 AIR POLLUTION MODELING AND PREDICTION Impact estimates by specifc models are required to meet some regulatory requirements. 27.4.1 Plume Rise Gases leaving the tops of stacks rise higher than the stack top when they are either of lower density than the surrounding air (buoyancy rise) or ejected at a velocity high enough to give the exit gases upward kinetic energy (momentum rise). Buoyancy rise is sometimes called thermal rise because the most common cause of lower density is higher temperature. Exceptions are emissions of gases of higher density than the surrounding air and stack downwash, discussed next. To estimate effective plume height, the equations of Briggs35e39 are used. The wind speed u in the following equations is the measured or estimated wind speed at the physical stack top. 27.4.1.1 Stack Downwash The lowering below the stack top of pieces of the plume by the vortices shed downwind of the stack is simulated by using a value h\u00a2 in place of the physical stack height h. This is somewhat less than the physical height when the stack gas exit velocity vs is less than 1.5 times the wind speed u (meters per second): h0\u00bc h for vs > 1:5u (27.28) h0\u00bc h \u00fe 2d\u00bd\u00f0vs =u\u00de 1:5 for vs < 1:5u (27.29) where d is the inside stack-top diameter, m. This h\u00a2 value is used with the buoyancy or momentum plume rise equations that follow. If stack downwash is not considered, h is substituted for h\u00a2 in the equations. 27.4.1.2 Buoyancy Flux Parameter For most plume rise estimates , the value of the buoyancy fux parameter F in m4 s 3 is needed: F \u00bc gvsd2\u00f0Ts T\u00de=\u00f04Ts\u00de (27.30) F \u00bc 2:45vsd2\u00f0Ts T\u00de Ts where g is the acceleration due to gravity, about 9.806ms 2, Ts is the stack gas temperature in kelvin, T is ambient air temperature in kelvin, and the other parameters are as previously defned. 27.4.1.3 UnstableeNeutral Buoyancy Plume Rise The fnal effective plume height H, in meters, is stack height plus plume rise. Where buoyancy dominates, the horizontal distance xf from the stack to where the fnal plume rise occurs is assumed to be at 3.5x*, where x* is the horizontal distance, in kilometers, at which atmospheric turbulence begins to dominate entrainment. For unstable and neutral stability situations, and for F less than 55, H, in meters, and xf, in kilometers, are .

The wind speed that yields the same rise from Eqn (27.33) as that from Eqn (27.35) for calm conditions is u \u00bc 0:2746F1=4S1=8 (27.35) 27.4.1.6 Gradual Rise: Buoyancy Conditions Plume rise for distances closer to the source than the distance to the fnal rise can be estimated from . 2=3 H \u00bc h0 160F1=3 xu (27.36) where x is the source-to-receptor distance, kilometers. If this height exceeds the fnal effective plume height, that height should be substituted. 27.4.1.7 UnstableeNeutral Momentum Plume Rise If the stack gas temperature is below or only slightly above the ambient temperature, the plume rise due to momentum will be greater than that due to buoyancy. For unstable and neutral situations, H \u00bc h0 3dvs =u (27.37) V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS This equation is most applicable when vs/u exceeds 4. Since momentum plume rise occurs quite close to the source, the horizontal distance to the fnal plume rise is considered to be zero. 27.4.1.8 Stable Momentum Plume Rise For low-buoyancy plumes in stable conditions, plume height due to momentum is given by 1=31=6 2 H \u00bc h0 1:5 vd2T \u00f04Tsu\u00de (27.38) s Equation (27.38) should also be evaluated and the lower value is used. 27.4.1.9 MomentumeBuoyancy Crossover There is a specifc difference between stack gas temperature and ambient air temperature that gives the same result for buoyancy rise as for momentum rise.

Concentration (g s 1) dispersion parameters. Maximum concentrations are nearly the same for stabilities A, B, and C and occur at wind speeds of 1.5e2.0 m s 1. The maximum for D stability occurs at around u \u00bc 2.5 m s 1. Because of the competing effects of dilution by wind and lower effective stack heights with higher wind speeds, concentrations do not change rapidly with wind speed. For E and F stabilities the concentrations are nearly the same (assuming that Dq/Dz is 0.02 K m 1 for E stability and 0.035 for F stability), but are considerably less than for the unstable and neutral cases. 27.4.2 Modeling Techniques Gaussian techniques are reasonable for estimates of concentrations of nonreactive pollutants within 20 km of point sources. It is preferable to utilize on-site wind fuctuation measurements to estimate the horizontal and vertical spreading of a pollutant plume released from a point source. In addition to the Gaussian modeling techniques already discussed, four other methods will be considered. 27.4.2.1 Box Model Models that assume uniform mixing throughout the volume of a three-dimensional box are useful for estimating concentrations, especially for frst approximations. For steady-state emission and atmospheric conditions, with no upwind background concentrations, the concentration is given by c \u00bc Dxqa =\u00f0ziu\u00de (27.42) where c is the steady state concentration, Dx is the distance over which the emissions take place, qa is the area emission rate, zi is the mixing height, and u is the mean wind speed through the vertical extent of the box. When there is an upwind background concentration cb and the mixing height is rising with time into a layer aloft having an average concentration of ca, the equation of continuity is dc dt \u00bc Dxqa \u00fe uzi\u00f0cb c\u00de (27.43)", "\u00fe Dx\u00f0Dzi =Dt\u00de\u00f0cc\u00de Dxzi a This forms a basis for an urban photochemical box model (PBM)40 discussed later in this chapter. 27.4.2.2 Narrow Plume Hypothesis By assuming that the principal contributors to the concentration at a receptor are the sources directly upwind, especially those nearby, the concentration due to area sources can be calculated using the vertical V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.4 AIR POLLUTION MODELING AND PREDICTION growth rate rather than uniform vertical mixing and considering the specifc area emission rate of each area upwind of the receptor. Area emission rate changes in the crosswind direction are neglected as being relatively unimportant. The expansion in the vertical is usually considered using the Gaussian vertical growth.41,42 27.4.2.3 Gradient Transport Models The mean turbulent fux of concentration in the vertical direction z is w0 c 0 . Assuming that this turbulent fux is proportional to the gradient of concentration, and in the direction from higher to lower concentrations, an overall diffusivity K can be defned as w0 c0\u00bc K\u00f0dc=dz\u00de (27.44) The change in concentration with respect to time can be written as dc dc dc dc d dc d dc \u00fedt u \u00fe v \u00fe w dxdydz \u00bc Kx \u00fe Kydx dx dy dy d dc \u00fe Kz \u00fe S (27.45) dz dz where the term in parentheses on the left accounts for advection. The terms on the right account for diffusivities in three directions, Kx, Ky, and Kz (where Kx is in the direction of the wind, Ky is horizontally crosswind, and Kz is vertically crosswind), and S represents emissions. This equation is the basis for the gradient transport model, which can handle varying wind and diffusivity felds. The vector speeds u, v, and w (where u is in the direction of the wind, v is horizontally crosswind, and w is vertically crosswind) and concentrations imply both time and space scales. Fluctuations over times and distances less than these scales are considered as turbulence and are included in the diffusivities. The gradient transport model is most appropriate when the turbulence is confned to scales that are small relative to the pollutant volume. It is therefore most applicable to continuous line and area sources at ground level, such as automobile pollutants in urban areas, and to continuous or instantaneous ground-level area sources. It is not appropriate for elevated point source diffusion until the plume has grown larger than the space scale. Numerical rather than analytical solutions of Eqn (27.45) are used. Errors in advection may completely overshadow diffusion. The amplifcation of random errors with each succeeding step causes numerical instability (or distortion). Higher order differencing techniques are used to avoid this instability, but they may result in sharp gradients, which may cause negative concentrations to appear in the computations. Many of the numerical instability (distortion) problems can be overcome with a second-moment scheme,43 which advects the moments of the distributions instead of the pollutants alone. Six numerical techniques were investigated,44 including the second-moment scheme; three were found that limited numerical distortion: the second-moment, the cubic spline, and the chapeau function. In the application of gradient transfer methods, horizontal diffusion is frequently ignored, but the variation in vertical diffusivity must be approximated.9,29,45,46 27.4.2.4 Trajectory Models In its most common form, a trajectory model moves in a vertical column, with a square cross-section intersecting the ground, at the mean wind speed, with pollutants added to the bottom of the column as they are generated by each location over which the column passes. Treatment of vertical dispersion varies among models, from those that assume immediate vertical mixing throughout the column to those that assume vertical dispersion using a vertical coeffcient Kz with a suitable profle.47 Modeling a single parcel of air as it is being moved along allows the chemical reactions in the parcel to be modeled. A further advantage of trajectory models is that only one trajectory is required to estimate the concentration at a given end point. This minimizes calculation because concentrations at only a limited number of points are required, such as at stations where air quality is routinely monitored. Since wind speed and direction at the top and the bottom of the column are different, the column is skewed from the vertical. However, for computational purposes, the column is usually assumed to remain vertical and to be moved at the wind speed and direction near the surface. This is acceptable for urban application in the daytime, when winds are relatively uniform throughout the lower atmosphere.", "Trajectory models of a different sort are used for long-range transport, because it is necessary to simulate transport throughout a diurnal cycle in which the considerable wind shear at night transports pollutants in different directions. Expanding Gaussian puffs can be used, with the expanded puff breaking, at the time of maximum vertical mixing, into a series of puffs initially arranged vertically but subsequently moving with the appropriate wind speed and direction for each height. 27.4.3 Modeling Nonreactive Pollutants 27.4.3.1 Seasonal or Annual Concentrations In estimating seasonal or annual concentrations from point or area sources, shortcuts can generally be taken rather than attempting to integrate over short intervals, such as hour-by-hour simulation. A frequent shortcut V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS consists of arranging the meteorological data by joint frequency of wind direction, wind speed, and atmospheric stability class, referred to as a STability ARray (STAR). The Industrial Source Complex Long Term (ISCLT)48 is a model of this type and is frequently used to satisfy regulatory requirements where concentrations averaged over 1 year (but not shorter averaging times) or longer are required. Further simplifcation may be achieved by determining a single effective wind speed for each stabilityewind direction sector combination by weighting 1/u by the frequency of each wind speed class for each such wind directionestability combination. Calculations for each sector are made, assuming that the frequency of wind direction is uniform across the sector. 27.4.3.2 Single Sources: Short-term Impact Gaussian plume techniques have been quite useful for determining the maximum impact of single sources, which over fat terrain, occurs within 10e20 km of the source. The ISCST model48 is usually used to satisfy regulatory requirements. Because the combination of conditions that produces multihour high concentrations cannot be readily identifed over the large range of source sizes, it has been a common practice to calculate the impact of a source for each hour of the year for a large number of receptors at specifc radial distances from the source for 36 directions from the source, e.g. every 10 . Averaging and analysis can proceed as the calculations are made to yield, upon completion of a year\u2019s simulation, the highest and second-highest concentrations over suitable averaging times, such as 3 and 24 h. Frequently, airport surface wind data have been utilized as input for such modeling, extrapolating the surface wind speed to stack top using a power law profle, with the exponent dependent on stability class, which is also determined from the surface data. Although the average hourly wind direction at stack top and plume level is likely to be different from that at the surface, this has been ignored because hourly variations in wind direction at plume level closely parallel surface directional variations. Although the true maximum concentration may occur in a somewhat different direction from that calculated, its magnitude will be closely approximated. SeveralpointsourcealgorithmsfromtheHybrid Plume Dispersion Model49,50 and a multiple source Gaussian dispersion algorithm using on-site turbulence data (TUPOS)51,52 incorporate the use of fuctuation statistics (the standard deviations of horizontal and vertical wind directions) and non-Gaussian algorithms for strongly convective conditions. Because during strong convective conditions, thermals with updrafts occupy about 30e35% of the area and slower descending downdrafts occupy 65e70% of the area, the resulting distribution of vertical motions are not Gaussian but have a smaller number of upward motions, but with higher velocity, and a larger number of downward motions, but with lower velocity. These skewed vertical motion distributions then cause non-Gaussian vertical distributions of pollutant concentrations. 27.4.3.3 Multiple Sources and Area Sources The problem, already noted, of not having the appropriate plume transport direction takes on added importance when one is trying to determine the effects of two or more sources some distance apart, since an accurate estimate of plume transport direction is necessary to identify critical periods when plumes are superimposed, increasing concentrations. In estimating concentrations from area sources, it is important to know whether there is one source surrounded by areas of no emissions or whether the source is just one element in an area of continuous but varying emissions. To get an accurate estimate of the concentrations at all receptor positions from an isolated area source, an integration should be done over both the alongwind and crosswind dimensions of the source. This double integration is accomplished in the point, area, and line (PAL) source model53 by approximating the area source using a number of fnite crosswind line sources.", "The concentration due to the area source is determined using the calculated concentration from each line source and integrating numerically in the alongwind direction. If the receptor is within an area source, or if emission rates do not vary markedly from one area source to another over most of the simulation area, the narrow plume hypothesis can be used to consider only the variation in emission rates from each area source in the alongwind direction. Calculations are made as if from a series of infnite crosswind line sources whoseemissionrateisassigned from theareasource emission rate directly upwind of the receptor at the distance of the line source. The Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Laboratory (ATDL) model54 accomplishes this for ground-level area sources. The RAM model42 does this for ground-level or elevated area sources. Rather than examining the variation of emissions with distance upwind from the receptor as already described, one can simplify further by using the area emission rate of only the emission square in which the receptor resides.55 The concentration c is then given by V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.4 AIR POLLUTION MODELING AND PREDICTION C \u00bc Gqa u (27.46) where qa is the area emission rate, u is the mean wind speed over the simulation period, and the constant G is dependent on the stability, the effective height of emission of the sources, and the characteristics of the pollutant. For estimation of annual concentrations with this method, G \u00bc 50, 200, and 600 for SO2, PM, and CO, respectively.56 27.4.3.4 Pollutants that Deposit The Fugitive Dust Model (FDM)57 was formulated to estimate air concentrationsaswellasdepositionfrom releases of airborne dust. It has a greatly improved deposition mechanism compared with that in previous models. It considers the mass removed from the plume through deposition as the plume is moved downwind. Up to 20 particle size fractions are available. The particle emissions caused as material is raised from the surface by stronger winds is built internally into this model. It has the capacity of making calculations for PAL sources. The area source algorithm has two options, simulation of the area source by fve fnite line sources perpendicular to wind fow or a converging algorithm that provides greater accuracy. Currently, the model should be used for releases at or below 20 m above ground level. 27.4.3.5 Dispersion from Sources over Water The Offshore and Coastal Dispersion (OCD) model58 was developed to simulate plume dispersion and transport from offshore point sources to receptors on land or water. The model estimates the overwater dispersion by use of wind fuctuation statistics in the horizontal and the vertical measured at the overwater point of release. Lacking these measurements, the model can make overwater estimates of dispersion using the temperature difference between water and air. Changes taking place in the dispersion are considered at the shoreline and at any point where elevated terrain is encountered. 27.4.3.6 Dispersion over Complex Terrain Development efforts in complex terrain by US EPA researchers using physical modeling, both in the wind tunnel and in the towing tank, and feld studies at three locations have resulted in the development of Complex Terrain Dispersion Model Plus Algorithms for Unstable Situations (CTDMPLUS) complex terrain dispersion model plus the calculation of concentrations for unstable conditions.59 Complex terrain is the situation in which there are receptor locations above stack top. Using the meteorological conditions and the description of the nearby terrain feature, the model calculates the height of a dividing streamline. Releases that take place below the height of this streamline tend to seek a path around the terrain feature; releases above the streamline tend to rise over the terrain feature. Because the dispersion is calculated from fuctuation statistics, the meteorological measurements to provide data input for the model are quite stringent, requiring the use of tall instrumented towers. Evaluations of both the model60 and a screening technique derived from the model61 indicate that the model does a better job of estimating concentrations than previous complex terrain models. 27.4.4 Modeling Pollutant Transformations 27.4.4.1 Individual Plumes Most pollutants react after release. However, many pollutants have such long half-lives in the atmosphere, it is safe to assume for most modeling purposes that they are nonreactive. However, numerous other pollutants undergo degradation within the atmosphere to such an extent that the model needs to consider their transformation to properly predict concentrations of the parent compound. The transformation is affected by numerous factors, including cloud chemistry and other aspects of water vapor, aerosol concentrations, catalysis, and photochemistry.", "In fact, many of the processes described in Table 6.1 occur in the atmosphere. An understanding of the transformation of SO2 and NOx into other constituents no longer measurable as SO2 and NOx is needed to explain mass balance changes from one plume cross-section to another. This loss of the primary pollutant SO2 has been described as being exponential, and rates up to 1% per hour have been measured.62 The secondary pollutants generated by transformation are primarily sulfates and nitrates. Thehorizontaldispersion of a plumehas been modeled by the use of expanding cells well mixed vertically, with the chemistry calculated for each cell.63 The resulting simulation of transformation of NO to NO2 in a power plant plume by infusion of atmospheric ozone is a peaked distribution of NO2 that resembles a plume of the primary pollutants, SO2 and NO. The ozone distribution shows depletion across the plume, with maximum depletion in the center at 20 min travel time from the source, but relatively uniform ozone concentrations back to initial levels at travel distances 1 h from the source. 27.4.4.2 Urban-Scale Transformations Approaches used to model ozone formation include box, gradient transfer, and trajectory methods. Another method, the particle-in-cell method, advects centers of V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS mass (that have a specifc mass assigned) with an effective velocity that includes both transport and dispersion over each time step. Chemistry is calculated using the total mass within each grid cell at the end of each time step. This method has the advantage of avoiding both the numerical diffusion of some gradient transfer methods and the distortion due to wind shear of some trajectory methods. It is not feasible to model the reaction of each hydrocarbon species with oxides of nitrogen. Therefore, hydrocarbon species with similar reactivities are lumped together, e.g. into four groups of reactive hydrocarbons: olefns, paraffns, aldehydes, and aromatics.64 In addition to possible errors due to the steps in the kinetic mechanisms, there may be errors in the rate constants due to the smog chamber databases from which they were derived. A major shortcoming is the limited amount of quality smog chamber data available. The emission inventory and the initial and boundary conditions of pollutant concentrations have a large impact on the ozone concentrations calculated by photochemical models. To model a decrease in visibility, the chemical formation of aerosols from sulfur dioxide and oxidants must be simulated. In a review of ozone air quality models, Seinfeld65 indicates that the most uncertain part of the emission inventories is the hydrocarbons. The models are especially sensitive to the reactive organic gas levels, speciation, and the concentrations aloft of the various species. He points out the need for improvement in the three-dimensional wind felds and the need for hybrid models that can simulate subgrid-scale reaction processes to incorporate properly effects of concentrated plumes. Schere66 points out that we need to improve the way vertical exchange processes are included in the model. Also, although the current models estimate ozone quite well, the atmospheric chemistry needs improvement to better estimate the concentrations of other photochemical components such as peroxyacyl nitrate (PAN), the hydroxyl radical (OH), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In addition to the improvement of databases, including emissions, boundary concentrations, and meteorology, incorporation of the urban ozone with the levels at larger scales is needed. 27.4.4.3 Regional-Scale Transformations In order to formulate appropriate control strategies for oxidants in urban areas, it is necessary to know the amount of oxidant already formed in the air reaching the upwind side of the urban area under various atmospheric conditions. Numerous physical and chemical processes are involved in modeling transformations67,68 on the regional scale (several days, 1000 km): (1) horizontal transport; (2) photochemistry, including very slow reactions; (3) nighttime chemistry of the products and precursors of photochemical reactions; (4) nighttime wind shear, stability stratifcation, and turbulence episodes associated with the nocturnal jet; (5) cumulus cloud effectsdventing pollutants from the mixed layer, perturbing photochemical reaction rates in their shadows, providing sites for liquid-phase reactions, infuencing changes in the mixed-layer depth, perturbing horizontal fow; (6) mesoscale vertical motion induced by terrain and horizontal divergence of the large-scale fow; (7) mesoscale eddy effects on urban plume trajectories and growth rates; (8) terrain effects on horizontal fows, removal, and diffusion; (9) subgrid-scale chemistry processes resulting from emissions from sources smaller than the model\u2019s grid can resolve; (10) natural sources of hydrocarbons, NOx, and stratospheric ozone; and (11) wet and dry removal processes, washout, and deposition.", "Approaches to long-term (monthly, seasonal, annual) regional exchanges are EURMAP69 for Europe and ENAMAP70 for eastern North America. These two models can calculate SO2 and sulfate air concentrations as well as dry and wet deposition rates for these constituents. The geographic region of interest (for Europe, about 2100 km NeS by 2250 km EeW) is divided into an emissions grid having approximately 50 by 50 km resolution. Calculations are performed by releasing a 12-h average emission increment or \u201cpuff\u201d from each cell of the grid and tracking the trajectories of each puff by 3-h time steps according to the 850-mb winds interpolated objectively for the puff position from upper air data. Uniform mixing in the vertical to 1000 m and uniform concentrations across each puff as it expands with the square root of travel time are assumed. A 0.01 h 1 transformation rate from SO2 to sulfate and 0.029 and 0.007 h 1 dry deposition rates for SO2 and sulfate, respectively, are used. Wet deposition is dependent on the rainfall rate determined from the surface observation network every 6 h, with the rate assumed to be uniform over each 6-h period. Concentrations for each cell are determined by averaging the concentrations of each time step for the cell, and deposition is determined by totaling all depositions over the period. The EURMAP model has been useful in estimating the contribution to the concentrations and deposition on every European nation from every other European nation. Contributions of a nation to itself range as follows: SO2 wet deposition, 25e91%; SO2 dry deposition, 31e91%; sulfate wet deposition, 2e46%; sulfate dry deposition, 4e57%. In the application of the model to eastern North America, the mixing height is varied seasonally, and hourly precipitation data are used. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.4 AIR POLLUTION MODELING AND PREDICTION 27.4.5 Modeling Air Pollutants 27.4.5.1 The Need for Models Models provide a means for representing a real system in an understandable way.a They take many forms, beginning with \u201cconceptual models\u201d that explain the way a system works, such as delineation of all the factors and parameters of how a particle moves in the atmosphere after its release from a power plant. Conceptual models help to identify the major infuences on where a chemical is likely to be found in the environment, and as such, need to be developed to help target sources of data needed to assess an environmental problem. In general, developing an air pollution model requires two main steps. First, a model of the domain and the processes being studied must be defned. Then, at the model boundaries, a model of the boundary conditions is especially needed to represent the infuential environment surrounding the study domain. The quality of the model study is related to the accuracy and representativeness to the actual study. 27.4.5.2 Physical Models Research scientists often develop \u201cphysical\u201d or \u201cdynamic\u201d models to estimate the location where a contaminant would be expected to move under controlled conditions, only on a much smaller scale. For example, the US EPA\u2019s wind tunnel facility in Research Triangle Part is sometimes used to support studies when local buildings and terrain have signifcant infuences. For example, the wind tunnel housed a scaled model of the town of East Liverpool, Ohio and its surrounding terrain to estimate the movement of the plume from an incinerator. The plume could be observed under varying conditions, including wind direction and height of release. Like all models, the dynamic models\u2019 accuracy is dictated by the degree to which the actual conditions can be simulated and the quality of the information that is used. More recently, the wind tunnel was used to simulate pollutant transport and dispersion in Lower Manhattan to simulate possible plumes of pollutants from the collapse of the WTC towers on September 11, 2001. The 1:600 scale model was constructed on a turntable to test different wind directions (see Figure 27.23). In addition to the building of Lower Manhattan and the rubble pile as it appeared approximately 1 week after the collapse, smoke for visualization and tracer gas for measurement dispersion patterns were released from positions throughout the simulated 16-acre site. The study design includes smoke visualization for a qualitative examination of dispersion in this very complex urban landscape, known as an \u201curban street canyon\u201d.", "Detailed measurements were taken of fow velocities and turbulence, as well as concentration distribution, which suggested a number of fow phenomena that are not possible to consider using simple Gaussian dispersion algorithms given in the specifc example of Figure 27.11. The Gaussian plume model can be generalized as depicted in Figure 27.24; however, these randomized models cannot represent deterministic aspects of the plume, such as vertical venting behind large/tall buildings, channeling down street canyons, and both horizontal and vertical recirculations associated with individual structures and groups of tall and tightly compacted buildings (such as the Wall Street area in the southeast edge of Manhattan, New York). 27.4.5.3 Numerical Simulation Modelsb Numerical models apply mathematical expressions to approximate a system. System is a thermodynamic concept. Recall that we deal with three basic types of systems in air pollution sciences: 1. Isolated systems, in which no matter or energy crosses the boundaries of the system (i.e. no work can be done on the system). a See Leete J. Groundwater modeling in health risk assessment. In: Benjamin S, Belluck D, editors. A practical guide to understanding, managing and reviewing environmental risk assessment reports, chapter 17. Boca Raton, FL: Lewis Publishers; 2001. b Alan H. Huber contributed substantially to this discussion. The author appreciates these insights from one of the pioneers in the application of CFD to air pollutant transport phenomena. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS Gaussian in z 2. Closed systems, in which energy can exchange with surroundings, but no matter crosses the boundary. 3. Open systems, in which both matter and energy freely exchange across system boundaries. Isolated systems are usually only encountered in highly controlled reactors, so are not pertinent to this discussion. In fact, most air pollution systems are open, but with simplifying assumptions, some subsystems can be treated as closed. Rapid advances in high performance computing hardware and software are leading to increasing applications of numerical simulation models that characterize an atmospheric plume as a system. These methods simulate spatially and temporally resolved details of the pathways of air pollutants from source emissions to pollutant concentrations within the local \u201cvirtual\u201d microenvironment. This approach to air pollution modeling applies numerical representation of fuid fow in a fuid continuum. Such an approach is known as computational fuid dynamics (CFD), which determines a numerical solution to the governing equations of fuid fow while advancing the solution through space or time to obtain a numerical description of the complete fow feld of interest. CFD models are based on the frst principles of physics; in particular, they start with single-phase fow based on NaviereStokes equations. The NaviereStokes equations are deterministic. They consider simultaneously the conservation of energy, momentum, and mass. Practical CFD solutions require a subgrid-scale model for turbulence. As computing capacities advance, the scale where turbulence is modeled can be reduced and the application of higher order numerical methods can support increasingly representative and accurate turbulence models. The transport and dispersion of air pollutants is part of the fuid fow solution. CFD methods have been developed and routinely applied to aerospace and automotive industrial applications and are now being extended to environmental applications. High-fdelity fne-scale CFD simulation of pollutant concentrations within microenvironments (e.g. near roadways or around buildings) is feasible now that high-performance computing has become more accessible. Fine-scale CFD simulations have the added advantage of being able to account rigorously for topographical details such as terrain variations and building structures in urban areas as well as their local aerodynamics and turbulence. Thermal heat fuxes may be added to terrain and building surfaces to simulate the thermal atmospheric boundary layer, their infuences on pollution transport and dispersion. The physics of particle fow and chemistry can be included in CFD simulations. The results of CFD simulations can be directly used to better understand specifc case studies as well as to support the development of better simplifed algorithms for adoption into other modeling systems. For example, CFD simulations with fne-scale physics and chemistry can enhance and complement photochemical modeling with Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ). Also, detailed CFD simulation for a complex site study can be used to develop reliable parameterizations to support simplifed and rapid application air pollution model. A few examples illustrate the utility of CFD modeling. Currently the main features of CFD application are the inclusion of site-specifc geometry and dynamic processes affecting air pollution transport and dispersion. The future will bring more refned spatial and temporal details, along with particle physics and chemistry.", "Avertical slice of the domain cells and a 10% sample of calculated wind vectors for these cells are shown in Figure 27.25. The fgure demonstrates a tendency for downward airfow on the windward faces of buildings and upward airfow on the leeward building faces. Figure 27.25 shows two different looking plume depictions for ground-level point emissions. In one case, the emissions plume is caught in the leeward building updraft leading to significant vertical mixing, whereas the other case shows emissions remaining close to the ground as they move through the street canyons. Figure 27.26 shows vertical slices of concentration for roadway emissions V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.4 AIR POLLUTION MODELING AND PREDICTION AH. US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park (NC) (unpublished work, used with permission). represented as a box along the streets. There are signifcant differences for the case with a building on only one side of the roadway (A), relative to the street canyon (B), which induces a region of circulation (C). CFD models have also found much use in estimating indoor and personal exposure to air pollutants. CFD modeling can also be used to simulate indoor air movement and pollution dispersion. For example, Furtawc presents an example of this in a room where air movement vectors and pollutant concentration isopleths are around an emission source (represented by the small square in Figure 27.27). While CFD model simulation of every room in many buildings may not be a feasible, example case studies are possible for very critical situations or generic situations leading to the development of exposure factors for typical indoor room environments. Similarly, Settlesd provides an excellent perspective on the increasing role for CFD model simulations for both ambient and indoor air concentrations as are critical to many homeland security issues involving potential human exposures. Figure 27.28 illustrates an application of CFD model simulations of trace concentrations behind a walking human. The computational solutions are obtaining using Reynolds averaged numerical simulation (RANS). CFD model simulations at the human exposure scales can be very detailed and particularly useful in developing human exposure factors applicable for more general population-based human exposure models. Some of atmospheric concentrations of pollutants consist of a regional background concentration due to long-range transport and regional-scale mixing as well as specifc local microenvironmental concentrations. Concentrations within the local microenvironment often dominate a profle of total human exposure to the pollutant. Regional air quality applications are normally applied at grid resolutions larger than 10 km. Urban applications are applied at smaller grid scales but there is a meaningful limit due to the subgrid-scale process models. In other words, there is no value in applying the model at fne scales without supporting details on the fner resolution. For example, the present framework of the CMAQ modeling system well supports environmental issues where large-sized grid-averaged concentrations are applicable. For example, regional emission control strategies are especially applicable while specifc profles of human exposure concentrations are not. The large grid-sized modeling system may be used for estimating profles of human exposure for pollutants having course temporal and spatial distributions.

US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park (NC). need to apply a subgrid-scale model including human exposure factors to estimate exposed populations (such as that shown in Figure 27.29). Such constraints related to local-scale air pollution and human exposure will be further discussed in the modeling sections below. Advances in numerical simulations models will continue to supplement and to improve the more simplifed models presented in the following sections, particularly for simulations where building environments and complex terrain are signifcant. Transport and fate models can be statistical and/or \u201cdeterministic\u201d. Statistical models include the pollutant dispersion models, such as the Lagrangian models, which assume Gaussian distributions of pollutants from a point of release (see Figure 27.24). That is, the pollutant concentrations are normally distributed in both the vertical and horizontal directions from the source. The Lagrangian approach is common for atmospheric releases.", "\u201cStochastic\u201d models are statistical models that assume that the events affecting the behavior of a chemical in the environment are random, so such models are based on probabilities. Deterministic models are used when the physical, chemical, and other processes are suffciently understood so as to be incorporated to refect the movement and fate of chemicals. These are very diffcult models to develop because each process must be represented by a set of algorithms in the model. Also, the relationship between and among the systems, such as the kinetics and mass balances, must also be represented. Thus, the modeler must \u201cparameterize\u201d every important event following a chemical\u2019s release to the environment. Often, hybrid models using both statistical and deterministic approaches are used, for example, when one part of a system tends to be more random, while another has a very strong basis is physical principals.

Environmental chemodynamics describe the movement and change of chemicals in the environment (see Chapter 6). From an air pollution modeling perspective, the air is among one compartment among many. Most air pollution modeling is conducted as if the troposphere were the only compartment. This is usually a reasonable approach. However, infuences shown in Figure 27.30 are always present. Air is a medium by which pollutants are transported. It is also the location of chemical reactions and physical changes, such as the agglomeration of smaller particles and the formation of particles from gas-phase pollutants. Fluid properties have a great bearing on the movement and distribution of contaminants. However, specifc partitioning relationships that control the \u201cleaving\u201d and \u201cgaining\u201d of pollutants among particle, soil, and sediment surfaces, the atmosphere, organic tissues, and water can also be = e The compartmental or \u201cbox and arrow\u201d models such as the one in Figure 27.30 are being enhanced by environmental scientists and chemical engineers. They depict of the frst law of thermodynamics, with each box representing a control volume of a given substance, e.g. incoming air pollutant, changes due to reactions within the control volume, and exiting substances, i.e. the parent compound and its degradation products. Much of the information in this fgure can be attributed to discussions with Yoram Cohen, a chemical engineering professor at UCLA, and Ellen Cooter, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration modeler on assignment to the US EPA\u2019s National Exposure Research Laboratory in Research Triangle Park, NC.

This is known as environmental fate. These relationships are sorption, solubility, volatilization, and organic carbonewater partitioning, which are, respectively, expressed by coeffcients of sorption (distribution coeffcient (KD) or solidewater partition coeffcient (Kp)), dissolution or solubility coeffcients, airewater partitioning (and the Henry\u2019s law (KH) constant), and organic carbonewater (Koc). These equilibrium coeffcients are discussed in detail in Chapter 18. 27.4.5.4 Using Models to Predict Air Pollution Air quality models mathematically simulate the physical and chemical processes that affect air pollutants as they disperse and react in the atmosphere.", "Meteorological data and source information (e.g. emission rates and stack height) are put into models to characterize pollutants that are emitted directly into the atmosphere. Air quality modelers generally refer to these as primary pollutants. Secondary pollutants, those that form as a result of complex chemical reactions within the atmosphere, can also be modeled. Models are a key component of air quality management at all scales. They are widely used by local, state, and federal agencies charged with addressing air pollution, especially to identify source contributions to air quality problems and to help to design effective strategies aimed at reducing air pollutants. Models can be used to verify that before issuing a permit, a new source will not exceed ambient air quality standards or, if appropriate, to agree on appropriate additional control requirements. Models are useful as prediction tools, for example, to estimate the future pollutant concentrations from multiple sources after a new regulatory program is in place. This gives a V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.4 AIR POLLUTION MODELING AND PREDICTION measure of the expected effectiveness of various options in reducing harmful exposures to humans and the environment. 27.4.5.5 Dispersion Modeling Dispersion modeling is used to predict concentrations at selected downwind receptor locations. According to the EPA, these air quality models help to determine compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and other regulatory requirements such as New Source Review (NSR) and Prevention of Signifcant Deterioration (PSD) regulations.f These guidelines are periodically revised to ensure that new model developments or expanded regulatory requirements are incorporated. The EPA recommends the atmospheric modeling system (AERMOD) be used by states and local regulators to determine their progress in reducing criteria air pollutants under the Clean Air Act (CAA). AERMOD is a steady state plume model that incorporates air dispersion based on planetary boundary-layer turbulence structure and scaling concepts, including treatment of both surface and elevated sources, and both simple and complex terrain. AERMOD is better able to characterize plume dispersion than the model it replaced, the Industrial Source Complex 3 (ISC3), which had been EPA\u2019s preferred model since 1980. In particular, AERMOD can simulate elevated air pollution sources as well as those at the surface, and can assimilate both simple and complex terrain (see Figure 27.31). A substantial advance is that AERMOD makes use of updated physics algorithms. Thus, since November 9, 2006, AERMOD replaced ISC3 as the EPA\u2019s preferred general-purpose model. Regulators now use it to estimate local levels of ozone, VOCs, carbon monoxide, NO2,SO2,PM, andlead. Areasthathavebeen unable to attain CAA standards for these criteria pollutants are required to use AERMOD to revise their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for existing air pollution sources. States must also use AERMOD for their NSR and PSD determinations. AERMOD modeling can be used to extrapolate from a limited number of data points. For example, it was recently used by the EPA in its regulatory impact analysis of the new standard for particulates by comparing a number of regulatory scenarios in terms of the costs and human health and welfare Meteorological data Terrain data National weather service data, surface U.S.G.S Elevation characteristics data benefts. In this case, the comparison was among scenarios associated with attaining both the selected and one alternative standard for annual and daily PM2.5 concentrations: Combination of Annual and Daily Values L3)(Annual/Daily in mgm Scenario 15/65 1997 Standards 15/35 New standard 14/35 Alternative One of the urban areas compared in analysis was Detroit, Michigan. The primary PM2.5 impacts at monitor locations in Wayne County, Michigan; the model shows locations where the annual (15 mgm 3) and daily (35 mgm 3) standards may well be exceeded.g Figure 27.32 provides the spatial gradient of primary PM2.5 for the urban area associated with emissions from all sources. The model shows that this particular Wayne County monitor is expected to exceed 15 mgm 3by2.4 mgm 3 in the year 2015. This indicates that local sources of primary PM2.5 contribute 3.3 mgm 3 f These models are addressed in Appendix A of EPA\u2019s Guideline on Air Quality Models (also published as Appendix W of 40 CFR Part 51), which was originally published in April 1978 to provide consistency and equity in the use of modeling within the US air quality management system. g US Environmental Protection Agency.

The modeling results indicate little additional reductions at this monitor for the 15/35 scenario but an additional 0.46 mgm 3 reduction in PM2.5 concentrations for the 14/35 scenario. The AERMOD simulations of annual and daily exceedances are shown in Tables 27.8 and 27.9, respectively. In 1991, the California Air Resources Board issued the frst version of CALPUFF, an advanced, integrated Gaussian puff modeling system. The EPA recommends CALPUFF for nonsteady state conditions. Since CALPUFF is a multilayer, multispecies nonsteady state puff dispersion model, it can be used to simulate the effects of time-and space-varying meteorological conditions on pollution transport, transformation, and removal. It can be applied at scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers. It includes algorithms for subgrid-scale effects (such as terrain impingement), as well as longer range effects (such as pollutant removal due to wet scavenging and dry deposition, chemical transformation, and visibility effects of PM concentrations). Thus, CALPUFF is particularly useful for long-range pollutant transport and for complex terrain. The system actually consists of three parts. In addition to CALPUFF, it includes a diagnostic three-dimensional meteorological model (CALMET), as well as postprocessing package (CALPOST). CALPUFF is one of the models used to characterize the plume from Ground Zero at WTC in New York City. The predicted plumes provided general insights into the likely pathway for pollutant emissions released from the collapse and the fre at the WTC site, both temporally and spatially (see Figure 27.33). Huber et al.h give some perspective about the use of CALPUFF: A CALMETeCALPUFF-type modeling system cannot provide as precise an estimate of pollution levels as fuller physics models might, is considered to be adequate for many applications. Even without the precise concentrations, knowing generally where the plume may have been can still help determine where to conduct more refned modeling of human exposures and where to study the population exposure in epidemiological studies. Having such results rapidly as a forecast or screening model could be very valuable to decision makers.

These models are large-scale air quality models that simulate the changes of pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere using a set of mathematical equations characterizing the chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere. They are applied at multiple spatial scales from local, regional, national, and global. Photochemical models structure the atmosphere as a modeled volume with a three-dimensional grid with thousands of grid cells. Each grid cell can be envisioned as a box. The boxes are stacked one atop another and V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS differ in height. Shorter boxes represent the parcels of air nearest to the ground surface. The photochemical calculates concentrations of pollutants, such as ozone, in each cell by simulating the movement of air into and out of cells by advection and dispersion. The model also includes algorithms to simulate mixing of pollutants vertically among layers, introduction of emissions from sources into each cell, as well as sets of chemical reactions, equations of pollution precursors and meteorology, especially incoming solar radiation (i.e. insolation) in each cell. Photochemical air quality models are of two basic mathematical types: the Lagrangian trajectory model that employs a moving frame of reference and the Eulerian grid model that uses a fxed coordinate system with respect to the ground. Early modeling efforts often used Lagrangian methods to simulate the formation of pollutants because of its computational simplicity. Describing physical processes, however, is incomplete, which is the major disadvantage of the Lagrangian method. Thus, most photochemical air quality models in operation today use three-dimensional Eulerian grid mathematics that allow for improved and more complete characterization of the physical processes in the atmosphere. This allows chemical-species concentrations to be predicted throughout the entire model domain. Arguably, the principal photochemical model in use is the CMAQ modeling system, which has been developed to improve the environmental management community\u2019s ability to evaluate the impact of air quality management practices for multiple pollutants at multiple scales and enhance the scientist\u2019s ability to probe, to understand, and to simulate chemical and physical interactions in the atmosphere.", "The most recent CMAQ version is available for download from the Community Modeling and Analysis System Web site at http://www. cmascenter.org/. Several other photochemical models have been developed and are applied to various pollutants. These include \u0081 Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensionsdsimulates air quality over different geographic scales; treats a wide variety of inert and chemically active pollutants, including ozone, PM, inorganic and organic PM2.5/PM10, and mercury and other toxics; and has plume-in-grid and source apportionment capabilities. \u0081 Regional Modeling System for Aerosols and Depositiondcalculates the concentrations of both inert and chemically reactive pollutants by simulating the physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere that affect pollutant concentrations over V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.4 AIR POLLUTION MODELING AND PREDICTION regional scales; and includes processes relevant to regional haze, PM, and other airborne pollutants, including soluble acidic components and mercury. \u0081 Urban Airshed Variable Grid (Urban Airshed Model (UAM)-V) Photochemical Modeling Systemdpioneering effort in photochemical air quality modeling in the early 1970s that has been used widely for air quality studies focusing on ozone. It is a three-dimensional photochemical grid model designed to calculate the concentrations of both inert and chemically reactive pollutants by simulating the physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere that affect pollutant concentrations. It is typically applied to model air quality episodes, i.e. periods during which adverse meteorological conditions result in elevated ozone pollutant concentrations. 27.4.5.7 Receptor Models Receptor models are mathematical or statistical procedures for identifying and quantifying the sources of air pollutants at a receptor location. Unlike photochemical and dispersion air quality models, receptor models do not use pollutant emissions, meteorological data, and chemical transformation mechanisms to estimate the contribution of sources to receptor concentrations. Instead, receptor models use the chemical and physical characteristics of gases and particles measured at source and receptor to both identify the presence of and to quantify source contributions to receptor concentrations. These models are therefore a natural complement to other air quality models and are used as part of SIPs for identifying sources contributing to air quality problems. The EPA has developed the Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) and UNMIX models as well as the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) method for use in air quality management. The CMB fully apportions receptor concentrations to chemically distinct source types depending on the source profle database, while UNMIX and PMF internally generate source profles from the ambient data. UNMIX is multivariate receptor modeling package that uses observations of particulate composition and seeks to fnd the number, composition, and contributions of the contributing sources or source type. CMB is one of several receptor models that have been applied to air quality problems since the 1980s. Based on an effective-variance least-squares method, it has supported numerous SIPs, when they include a source apportionment component. CMB requires speciated profles of potentially contributing sources and the corresponding ambient data from analyzed samples collected at a single receptor site. CMB is ideal for localized nonattainment problems and has proven to be a useful tool in applications where steady state Gaussian plume models are inappropriate, as well as for confrming or adjusting emissions inventories. The EPA UNMIX model, as the name implies, disaggregates (\u201cunmixes\u201d) the concentrations of chemical species measured in the ambient air to identify the contributing sources. Chemical profles of the sources are not required, but instead are generated internally from the ambient data by UNMIX, using a mathematical formulation based on a form of factor analysis. For a given selection of chemical species, UNMIX estimates the number of sources, the source compositions, and source contributions to each sample. The PMF technique is a form of factor analysis where the underlying covariability of many variables (e.g. sample to sample variation in PM species) is described by a smaller set of factors (e.g. PM sources) to which the original variables are related. The structure of PMF permits maximum use of available data and better treatment of missing and below-detection-limit values. When the results of air pollution measurements are interpreted, one of the frst questions asked by scientists, engineers, and policy makers is where did it come from? Sorting out the various sources of pollution is known as source apportionment. Anumber of tools are used to try to locate the sources of pollutants. A widely used approach is the \u201csourceereceptor model\u201d or as it is more commonly known, the receptor model. The distinction between receptor and dispersion models has to do with the direction of the prediction.", "Dispersion models start from the source and estimate where the plume and its contaminants are heading. Conversely, receptor models are based on measurements taken in the ambient environment and from these observations, make use of algorithms and functions to determine pollution sources. One common approach is the mathematical \u201cback trajectory\u201d model. Often, chemical co-occurrences are applied. So, it may be that a certain fuel is frequently contaminated with a conservative and, hopefully, unique element. Some fuel oils, for example, contain trace amounts of the element vanadium. Since there are few other sources of vanadium in most ambient atmospheric environments, its presence is a strong indication that the burning of fuel oil is a most likely source of the plume. The model, if constructed properly, can even quantify the contribution. So, if measurements show that sulfur dioxide (SO2)concentrationsare found to be 10 mgm 3 in an urban area, and vanadium is also found at suffcient levels to indicate that home heating systems are contributing a certain amount of the SO2 to the atmosphere, the model will correlate the amount of SO2 coming from home heating systems. If other combustion sources, e.g. cars and power plants, also have unique trace elements associated V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS with their SO2 emissions, further SO2 source apportionment can occur, so that the total may look something like Table 7.2. For a discussion of sourceereceptor relationships and modeling, see Discussion Box: Source Apportionment, Receptor Models, and Carbon Dating in Chapter 6. 27.4.5.8 Personal Exposure Models The actual exposures that people receive can also be modeled (see Figure 27.34). According to the EPA, there are three techniques to estimate pollutant exposures quantitatively: Sometimes the approaches to assessing exposure are described in terms of \u201cdirect measures\u201d and \u201cindirect measures\u201d of exposure (e.g. NRC, 1994). Measurements that actually involve sampling on or within a person, for example, use of personal monitors and biomarkers, are termed as \u201cdirect measures\u201d of exposure. Use of models, microenvironmental measurements, and questionnaires, where measurements do not actually involve personal measurements, are termed as \u201cindirect measures\u201d of exposure. The direct/indirect nomenclature focuses on the type of measurements being made; the scenario evaluation/point-ofcontact/reconstruction nomenclature focuses on how the data are used to develop the dose estimate. The three-term nomenclature is used in these guidelines to highlight the point that three independent estimates of dose can be developed. There is seldom a suffcient amount of direct information from measurements to estimate and to predict exposures for a population. Thus, indirect methods must be used. Personal exposure i can be expressed mathematically as a composite of the time in a microenvironment (e.g. in a garage, indoors at home, or in a car) and the concentration of the pollutant in that microenvironment: m Ei \u00bc TijCij (27.47) j\u00bc1 X where Tij is the time spent in microenvironment j by person i with typical units of minutes, Cij is the air pollutant concentration person i experiences in microenvironment j with typical units of micrograms per cubic meter, Ei represents the exposure for person i integrated Tij, and m is the number of different microenvironments. Thus, the units of exposure are mass per volume-time (micrograms per cubic meter per minute). Note, then, that exposure is the concentration per unit time. The calculation amounts to a weighted sum of concentrations with the weights being equal to the time spent experiencing a given concentration. What people are doing is crucial to modeling their exposure to air pollutants. To support exposure, intake dose, and risk assessments, the EPA developed the Consolidated Human Activity Database (CHAD). CHAD is a relational database with a graphical user interface that facilitates queries and report generation.j It contains databases from previously existing human activity pattern studies, which were incorporated in two forms: (1) as the original raw data and (2) as data modifed according to predefned format requirements. CHAD contains data obtained from preexisting human activity studies that were collected at city, state, and national levels. People\u2019s diary information is input in CHAD. Figure 27.35 and Tables 27.10 and 27.11 provide the structure and data elements of CHAD. Most of the felds are answers from the questionnaire. Some felds vary from day to day for an individual and felds based on the diary entries will most likely be different for each day. The CHAD_DIARY table contains one record for each activity during a 24-h period. No record The principal reference for this discussion is Klepeis NE.

The minimal information in the diary data is the CHADID, which links to the CHAD_DATA, a sequence number, which indicates the order of the records in a day, start, end, and duration times, and an activity and location. Thus, if we measure concentrations with personal and indoor air pollution monitors and we apply activity patterns, such as those in CHAD, we can estimate and predict personal exposures to numerous pollutants. Obviously the mean personal exposure can be expressed in concentration units (micrograms per cubic meter) by dividing Ei by the total time spent in each microenvironment and summing these exposures. Further, this can also be seen as a continuum in which the personal exposure is assumed to be constant during each time comprising Tij: 2 Z Ei \u00bc Cij\u00f0t; x; y; z\u00dedt (27.48) 1 where Ci(t, x, y, z) is the concentration occurring at a specifc point occupied by person i at time t and spatial coordinates (x, y, z), and t1 and t2 are the respective starting and ending times of a given exposure episode. The concentrations can be measured using a real-time personal monitoring device. These data are not actually continuous, but can be quite frequent (e.g. every few seconds). Other times, fully continuous space is not assumed, which means that discrete microenvionments are used. If this is the case the equation appears as 01 j2 Z m X BC Ei \u00bc @ Cij\u00f0t\u00dedtA (27.49) j\u00bc1 j1 where Cij(t) is the concentration to which the person is exposed in the discrete microenvironment j at a specifc point in time t over the time interval defned by [tj1, tj2], (NC); 2002. where tj1 is the starting time for the microenvironment and tj2 is the ending time. If we assume that every person in a population is exposed to the same microenvironment concentrations, a simplifed population exposure can be derived to show the total time spent by all receptors in each microenvironment: m X ~~ E \u00bc CjTj (27.50) j\u00bc1 where m is the number of microenvironments encountered, Cj is the average pollutant concentration in ~ microenvironment j assigned to every person i, E is the integrated exposure over all members of the population. The total time spent by all persons in microenvironment j is n X ~ Ti \u00bc Tij (27.51) i\u00bc1 where n is the total number of people in the population being modeled. This can be further simplifed if we assume that each person spends the same total amount of time across all microenvironments: m T \u00bc Ti \u00bc Tij (27.52) j\u00bc1 X Further, if the time spent by certain individuals in particular microenvironments is zero, then the average personal exposure for the population would be m X 1 ~ Ec CjTj (27.53) nT j\u00bc1 Therefore, timeeactivity relationships and concentrations can be used to model expected exposures to air pollutants.

Note that ambient contribution is quite small compared to personal and indoor exposures. k 27.4.5.9 Modeling Air Toxics The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90) included a specifc health outcome provision related to toxic air pollutants. The law included 190 substances that need to be addressed because they have been known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or to cause adverse environmental effects. The 1990 amendments established a range of air toxics requirements for EPA to implement that generally fall into four categories: 1. Establishing emission standards based on existing pollution control technologies, called Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT), for an estimated 84,000 major stationary sources within 158 industries. 2. Examining the remaining health risk (called the \u201cresidual risk\u201d) from these sources 8 years after implementing each MACT standard and, if warranted, issuing additional standards to protect public health or the environment. 3. Regulating air toxics emissions from small stationary sources, such as dry cleaners. 4. Evaluating the need for and feasibility of regulation of air toxics emissions from mobile sources, such as cars, and regulating these sources based on this evaluation. The amendments also required the EPA to periodically assess the costs and benefts of the entire CAA.", "This called for an assessment of the Act\u2019s costs and benefts prior to 1990 along with projections of future economic impacts resulting from the amendments (see the earlier discussion in this chapter regarding the regulatory impact analysis as it pertains to PM). Air toxics originate from a variety of sources (see Figure 27.37). Of the numerous compounds that are classifed as air toxics, however, about 60% are represented by just fve pollutant classes (see Table 27.12). The EPA has completed MACT standards for major stationary sources. The EPA establishes the federal standard, but the state and local air pollution control agencies generally implement the EPA\u2019s emission standards. These agencies can choose to impose more stringent requirements than the federal standards, and some state and local agencies have developed innovative air toxics programs that go beyond the federal program, which is enabling them to address air toxics that would be insuffciently covered by EPA\u2019s standards. The CAA residual risk program (i.e. the risk remaining after technology-based standards have been in place), must try to determine whether the most highly exposed individuals face excess cancer risk of more than one in 1 million (risk \u00bc 1 \u00bc 10 6). In cases where estimated risks exceed this threshold, the EPA must develop a new residual risk standard to provide an ample margin of safety for those potentially affected individuals. In fact, the EPA generally uses a lifetime cancer risk of one in 10,000 (risk \u00bc 1 \u00bc 10 4) as the upper boundary of acceptability. The ample margin of safety decision must also consider costs, technological feasibility, uncertainties, and other relevant factors. In this feasibility step, EPA must also assess whether to adopt more stringent standards to prevent adverse effects to wildlife, aquatic life, or natural resources considering cost, energy, and other pertinent details. The residual risk process is dynamic and continuously updated (For updates, see: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/ atw/rrisk/rtrpg.html). The reviews are intended to k Burke JM, Zufall MJ, Ozkaynak AH.

According to the US Government Accountability Offce (GAO)l: EPA does not have reliable data on the degree to which its programs have reduced risks. Furthermore, the data that are available suggest that the agency still has substantial opportunities to control emissions from mobile and small stationary sources. EPA faces signifcant challenges in implementing the air toxics program, many of which stem from its relatively low priority within the agency. Importantly, the agency lacks a comprehensive strategy for managing its implementation of the remaining air toxics requirements. Senior EPA offcials said that the program\u2019s agenda is largely set by external stakeholders who fle litigation when the agency misses deadlines. For example, EPA currently faces a court order to issue emissions standards for small stationary sources. Previous reports by GAO identifed inadequate funding for the air toxics program as a challenge, and key stakeholdersdincluding senior EPA offcials, environmental advocates, and state and local agency offcialsdsaid resource constraints continue to pose a major challenge. The percentage of funding for the air toxics program relative to all clean air programs ranged from 18% to 19% between 2000 and 2003 and declined to 15% in 2004 FIGURE 27.36 Cumulative frequency distributions of daily total and microenvironmental PM2.5 exposures (micrograms per cubic meter) for the simulated population of Philadelphia (solid lines).

The stakeholders identifed a number of other challenges, but perceptions varied by stakeholder group. For example, EPA and industry stakeholders rated the large number of statutory requirements as a challenge, while environmental stakeholders rated a lack of reliable data on air toxics sources and their emissions as a challenge. The EPA is required to conduct a National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) as a part of the national air toxics program, which \u0081 expands air toxics monitoring; \u0081 develops emission inventories; \u0081 conducts national and local-scale air quality analyses; \u0081 characterizes risks associated with air toxics exposures; \u0081 conducts research on health and environmental effects and exposures to both ambient and indoor sources; and \u0081 conducts exposure modeling. This helps EPA set program priorities, characterize risks, and track progress toward meeting goals, especially providing trends in air quality as the United States transitions from technology-based standards to a greater number of risk-based standards (see Figure 27.38). As part of the NATA program, EPA conducted a national screening-level assessment using 1996 emissions m inventory data to characterize air toxics risks nationwide. This helped to characterize the potential health risks associated with inhalation exposures to 33 air toxics and diesel PM. These 34 air toxics were identifed as priority pollutants in EPA\u2019s Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy.m The Assessment System for Population Exposure Nationwide (ASPEN) is the model used to estimate toxic air pollutant concentrations. It is based on the EPA\u2019s ISCLT, which simulates the behavior of the pollutants once they are emitted into the atmosphere. ASPEN uses estimates of toxic air pollutant emissions and meteorological data from National Weather Service stations to estimate air toxics concentrations nationwide. ASPEN incorporates a number of critical pollutant concentration variables, including \u0081 rate of release; \u0081 location of release; \u0081 the height from which the pollutants are released; \u0081 wind speeds and directions from the meteorological stations nearest to the release; \u0081 breakdown of the pollutants in the atmosphere after being released (i.e. reactive decay); \u0081 settling of pollutants out of the atmosphere (i.e. deposition); and \u0081 transformation of one pollutant into another (i.e. secondary formation). A list of the 34 selected toxics can be found at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata/34poll.html. V.

Report No. GAO-06-669; June 2006. The model estimates toxic air pollutant concentrations for every census tract in contiguous United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Census tracts are land areas defned by the US Bureau of the Census and typically contain about 4000 residents each. These census tracts are usually smaller than two square miles in size in cities, but much larger in rural areas. NATA is intended to identify ambient concentrations of air toxics attributable to anthropogenic (humangenerated) emissions, within 50 km of each source.", "However, for many pollutants, ambient concentrations have \u201cbackground\u201d components attributable to long-range transport, resuspension of previous emissions, and nonanthropogenic sources. To estimate ambient concentrations of air toxics accurately, these background concentrations must be addressed. In the 1996 assessment, with exception of diesel PM, background concentrations were based on measured values of 13 pollutants. The background concentrations used in the 1996 NATA are provided in Table 27.13. The modeled estimates for most of the pollutants are generally lower than the measured ambient annual average concentrations when evaluated at the monitors. However, when the maximum modeled estimate for distances up to 10e20 km from the monitoring location are compared to the measured concentrations, the modeled estimates approach the monitored concentrations. This may be the result of spatial uncertainty of the underlying data (emissions and meteorological), as well as the tendency of existing air toxics monitoring networks to characterize the higher (if not maximum) air pollution impact areas in the ambient air. Also, the model estimates are more uncertain at the census tract scale, but are more reliable at more extensive geographic scales, such as a county or state. Further, ASPEN and underlying data are used to estimate exposures and risks (see Figure 27.39). 27.4.6 Model Performance, Accuracy, and Utilization 27.4.6.1 Methodology of Assessing Model Performance A number of statistics have been suggested71,72 as measures of model performance. Different types of models and the use of models for different purposes may require different statistics to measure performance. In time series of measurements of air quality and estimates of atmospheric concentration made by a model, residuals d can be computed for each location.

A county\u2019s shading indicates its exposure concentration compared with all other counties in the nation. The exposure concentration value displayed is the county median in micrograms of benzene per cubic meter of air (micrograms per cubic meter). Similar maps can be generated for other states and various air toxics at the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s National Air Toxics Assessment Web site: http://www. epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata/mapexpo.html. The residual d is the difference between values paired timewise: d \u00bcME (27.54) where M is the measured value and E is the value estimated by the model. A measure of bias d is the frst moment of the distribution of these differences, or the average difference: X 1 d \u00bc d (27.55) N A measure of the variability of the differences is the variance S2, which is the second moment of the distribution of these differences: S2 \u00bc X d d 2 =N \u00bc P d2 N P d N 2 (27.56) The square root of the variance is the standard deviation. The mean absolute error (MAE) is X MAE \u00bc jdj=N (27.57) The mean square error (MSE) is X MSE \u00bc d2 N (27.58) The root-mean-square error is the square root of the MSE. Note that since the root-mean-square error involves the square of the differences, outliers have more infuence on this statistic than on the MAE. 27.

The use of various statistical techniques has been discussed77 for two situations. For standard air quality networks with an extensive period of record, analysis of residuals, visual inspection of scatter diagrams, and comparison of cumulative frequency distributions are quite useful techniques for assessing model performance. For tracer studies the spatial coverage is better, so that identifcation of maximum measured concentrations during each test is more feasible. However, temporal coverage is more limited with a specifc number of tests not continuous in time. The evaluations cited in the following sections are examples of the use of various measures of performance. 27.4.6.2 Performance of Single-Source Models Since wind direction changes with height above ground and plume rise will cause the height of the plume to vary in time, it is diffcult to model accurately plume transport direction. Because of this transport wind direction error, analyses of residuals and correlations are not frequently utilized for assessment of single-source model performance. Instead, cumulative frequency distributions of estimated and measured concentrations for specifc averaging times at each location are examined, as well as comparison of the highest concentrations such as the fve highest for each averaging time of interest, e.g. 3 and 24 h. The performance of one specifc single source atmospheric dispersion model, CRSTER,78 for the second-highest once-a-year 24-h concentrations, is summarized in Figure 27.40 in terms of ratios of estimates to measurements. Overestimates by more than a factor of 2 occur for all receptors whose elevations are near or exceed stack top. The value DE is the elevation of the receptor minus the elevation of the stack base; h is the physical stack height. Over seven sites, having stacks varying from 81 to 335 m, for receptors having elevations above the stack base less than 0.7 of the stack height, the second-highest, once-a-year 24-h estimates were within a factor of 2 of the measurements for 25 of 35 monitoring stations. Comparisons81 of measured concentrations of SF6 tracer released from a 36-m stack, and those estimated by the Point-to-Multipoint (PTMPT) model for 133 data 2.0 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 E/h pairs over Pasquill stabilities varying from B through F, had a linear correlation coeffcient of 0.81. Here 89% of the estimated values were within a factor of 3 of the measured concentrations. The calculations were most sensitive to the selection of stability class. Changing the stability classifcation by 1 varies the concentration by a factor of 2e4. 27.4.6.3 Performance of Urban Models for Nonreactive Pollutants Because there are multiple sources of most pollutants in urban areas, and because the meteorology of urban areas is modifed so that the extremes of stability are avoided, concentrations tend to vary much less in urban than in rural areas. For sources having a large component of emissions from low-level sources, the simple GiffordeHanna model given previously as Eqn (27.46), C \u00bc Gqa/u, works well, especially for long-term concentrations, such as annual ones. Using the derived coeffcients of 225 for PM and 50 for SO2, an analysis of residuals (measured minus estimated) of the dependent data sets (those used to determine the values of the coeffcient G) of 29 cities for PM and 20 cities for SO2 and an independent data set of 15 cities for PM is summarized in Table 27.14. For the dependent data sets, overestimates result. The standard deviations of the residuals and the MAE are about equal for particulates and sulfur dioxide. For the independent data set the mean residual shows only slight overestimation, and the standard deviation of residuals and MAE are considerably smaller. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.

A version of the GiffordeHanna model was evaluated81 using 1969 data for 113 monitoring stations for PM and 75 stations for SO2 in the New York metropolitan area. This version differed from Eqn (27.46) in considering major point source contributions and the stack height of emission release. This model produced results (Table 27.15) comparable to those of the much more complicated Climatological Dispersion Model (CDM).82 The urban RAM model was evaluated83 using 1976 sulfur dioxide data from 13 monitoring locations in St. Louis on the basis of their second-highest once-ayear concentrations. The ratio of estimated to measured 3-h average concentrations was from 0.28 to 2.07, with a median of 0.74. Half of the values were between 0.61 and 1.11. For the 24-h average concentrations the ratios ranged from 0.18 to 2.31, with a median of 0.70. Half of the values were between 0.66 and 1.21. Thus, the urban RAM model generally underestimates concentrations by about 25%. 27.4.6.4 Performance of Photochemical Models The performance of photochemical models is evaluated by their ability to estimate the magnitude, time, and location of occurrence of the secondary pollutant oxidant (ozone). Several photochemical models were evaluated using 10 days\u2019 data from St. Louis (Table 27.16). Among those evaluated were the PBM,40 which features a single variable-volume reacting cell. This model is most appropriate for use with light winds, so that most of the emissions will remain in the cell and react, rather than being rapidly transported through the downwind side of the cell. The maximum measured concentrations for the 10 days ranged from 0.08 to 0.18 ppm; the maximum model estimates ranged from 0.07 to 0.22 ppm. The second model evaluated was the Lagrangian Photochemical Model,85 a trajectory model. Backward trajectories were frst determined so that starting positions could be used that would allow trajectories to reach station locations at the times of measurement. Measured concentrations ranged from 0.20 to 0.26 ppm and estimated concentrations from 0.05 to 0.53 ppm. The third model evaluated was the UAM,86 athreedimensional grid-type model. The area modeled was 60 by 80 km, consisting of cells 4 km on a side. There are four layers of cells in the vertical, the bottom simulating the mixing layer. The model provides both spatially and temporally resolved estimates.

Measured concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 0.24 ppm and estimated concentrations ranged from 0.10 to 0.17 ppm. The model underestimates the concentration at the point of the observed maximum each day. Seinfeld65 indicates that photochemical models estimating peak ozone concentrations in urban areas are generally within 30% of measured peaks. 27.4.6.5 Utilization of Models For the air quality manager to place model estimates in the proper perspective to aid in making decisions, it is becoming increasingly important to place error bounds about model estimates. In order to do this effectively, a history of model performance under circumstances similar to those of common model use must be established for the various models. It is anticipated that performance standards will eventually be set for models. 27.4.6.5", "Modeling to Meet Regulatory Requirements In the United States if the anticipated air pollution impact is suffciently large, modeling has been a requirement for new sources in order to obtain a permit to construct. The modeling is conducted following guidance issued by the US EPA.87,88 The meeting of all requirements is examined on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis. Using the assumptions of a design that will meet all emission requirements, the impact of the new source, which includes all new sources and changes to existing sources at this facility, is modeled to determine pollutant impact. This is usually done using a screening-type model such as SCREEN.89 The impacts are compared to the modeling signifcance levels for this pollutant for various averaging times. These levels are generally about 20% of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. If the impact is less than the signifcance level, the permit can usually be obtained without additional modeling. If the impact is larger than the signifcance level, a radius is defned, which is the greatest distance to the point at which the impact falls to the signifcance level. Using this radius, a circle is defned, which is the area of signifcance for this new facility. All sources (not only this facility, but all others) emitting this pollutant are modeled to compare anticipated impact with the NAAQS and with the PSD increments. The implementation of CAAA90 not only requires permission for new sources but also permits for existing facilities. There is also a requirement for reexamination of these permits at intervals not longer than 5 years. The permit programs are set up and administered by the states under the review and guidance of EPA. These programs include the collection of permit fees suffcient to support the program. Implementation of CAAA90 will require the application of MACT on an industry-by-industry basis as specifed by EPA. Following the use of MACT, a calculation will be made of the residual risk due to the remaining pollutant emissions. This is accomplished using air quality dispersion modeling that is interpreted using risk factors derived from health information with the inclusion of appropriate safety factors. Because of their inclusion of the effects of building downwash, the ISC2 models,48 ISCST and ISCLT (short-term performing calculations by hourly periods and long-term using the joint frequencies of wind direction, wind speed, and Pasquill stability, commonly referred to as STAR data) are recommended. The ISC2 models differ only slightly from the earlier ISC models (several small errors that make little difference in the resulting calculations were corrected). The recoding of the model to result in ISC2 was requested by EPA to overcome a diffcult-to-understand code that had resulted from a number of changes that had been incorporated. The ISC models will make calculations for three types of sources: point, area, and volume. There are recognized defciencies in the area source algorithm incorporated in the ISC models. Models are continuing to improve, but many challenges remain. Combined with better measurements and analytical procedures, the new models are crucial to air pollution control and planning decisions. 27.5 MODELING AIR POLLUTION PARTITIONING Predicting the movement, transformation, and fate of an air pollutant must account not only for the initial contact with the pollutant, but also for what happens to the pollutant after contact with the receptor. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the pollutant and its metabolites within an organism after uptake is known as pharmacokinetics, or when specifcally applied to pollutants, toxicokinetics. Air pollutant exposure can be modeled in a unidirectional and one-dimensional fashion, such as the fow within an ecosystem (mass and energy transfer between trophic levels, i.e. bioenergetics). In addition, risk and exposure assessments must consider multiple levels of biological organization that can describe the interrelationships within the biological system. Mechanisms can be derived by characterizing and perturbing these networks (e.g. behavioral and environmental factors).90 This can apply to a food chain or food web model (Figure 7.2 in Chapter 7), surface exchanges (Figure 8.2 in Chapter 8) a multi-species kinetic model (Figure 27.41), or numerous other modeling platforms.

U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, OCSEAP Final Report # 45; 1983. p. 631e771. The affnities and partitioning discussed in Chapter 18 can be modeled. Food web and food chain diagrams and models are often useful in estimating and predicting environmental insults after an air pollutant has been deposited. They can begin with estimates of soil-to-air and water-to-air exchanges, e.g. the long-range transport of persistent compounds followed by predatoreprey and food linkages in the web (Figure 27.41), lead to dramatic differences in pollutant concentration in the tissue of different species in the system. The inherent properties and partitioning discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively, greatly infuence the rate of accumulation, e.g. bioaccumulation factors and octanoleair and octanolewater partitioning. Figure 27.42 illustrates that after the deposition of the persistent fame retardants, these semivolatile organic pollutants build up in the food chain. This is known as biomagnifcation, with the highest concentrations of the pollutants found in top predators. Food web and food chains are key modes by which humans and other organisms become exposed to contaminants, including air pollutants. Webs and chains account for the interrelationships among the abiotic (nonliving) and biotic (living) environments. Organisms, including humans, live within an interconnected network or web of life, with strands of energy and mass affecting the potential exposure. The toxicokinetic model (Figure 27.43) begins to show the complexity of the processes and mechanisms at play after a pollutant\u2019s intake. In this case, several models must be consolidated to show the kinetics, beginning with a breathing lung model consisting of alveoli, lower dead space, lung tissue, pulmonary capillaries, and upper dead space compartments. Gastrointestinal (GI) models allow for multiple circulating compounds with multiple metabolites entering and leaving each compartment, i.e. the GI model consists of the wall and lumen for the stomach, duodenum, lower small intestine, and colon, with lymph pool and portal blood compartments included. Bile fow is treated as an output from the liver to the duodenum lumen. All uptaken substances are treated as circulating. Nonspecifc ligand binding, e.g. plasma protein binding, is represented in arterial blood, pulmonary capillaries, portal blood, and venous blood. 27.5.1 Pollutant Transport For an air pollutant to come into contact with human populations and ecosystems it must frst be transported from the source. The distance may be quite small (e.g. less than a meter from a tailpipe to a person standing nearby) to very large (e.g. intercontinental transport of persistent compounds, greenhouse gases, and the V.

However, the physical processes are similar. Molecular diffusion is the exception, since it dominates only when advection and dispersion are near zero. This is seldom the case for any extended time period, so molecular diffusion is usually negligible in the ambient atmosphere.", "However, it is a very import transport process in quiescent systems, such as wet soils and sediment, where concentration gradients serve as the major transport process. Thus, air pollution sources, such as movement of contaminants through porous media may have to occur frst, before a contaminant can volatilize or aerosolize into the atmosphere. 27.5.2 Advection Air pollutants can be transported within the hydrosphere and troposphere. In fact, this may be the dominant transport mechanism for pollen, cysts, and spores. From a purely physical motion perspective, the most straightforward pollutant transport process arguably is advection (JAdvection). Advection is the transport of matter within the streamlines of a fuid, i.e. with the water or airfow. In terms of total volume and mass of pollutants moved, advection accounts for the lion\u2019s share. In fact, another name for advection is bulk transport. During advection, a contaminant is moved along with the fuid or, in the language of environmental science, the environmental medium. The contaminant is merely \u201chitching a ride\u201d on the fuid as it moves through the environment. Environmental fuids move within numerous matrices, such as the fow of air and water between soil particles, within sediment, in unconsolidated materials underground, and in the open atmosphere. Surface water is also an environmental medium in which advection occurs. Advection is considered a passive form of transport because the contaminant moves along with the transporting fuid. That is, the contaminant moves only because it happens to reside in the medium. Advection occurs within a single medium and among media. The rate and direction of transport is completely determined by the rate and direction of the fow of the media. The simplest bulk transport within one environmental medium or compartment is known as homogeneous advection, where only one fuid is carrying the contaminant. The three-dimensional rate of homogeneous, V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.

Las Vegas (Nevada): U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; 2006. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.5 MODELING AIR POLLUTION PARTITIONING advective transport is simply the product of the fuid medium\u2019s fow rate and the concentration of the contaminant in the medium: N \u00bc QC (27.64) where Q is the fow rate of the fuid medium (e.g. cubic meters per second) and C is the concentration of the chemical contaminant being transported in the medium (e.g. micrograms per cubic meter). Therefore, the units for three-dimensional advection are mass per time (e.g. micrograms per second). For example, the homogeneous advection of air containing 100 mgm 3 vinyl chlo 31 1 ride (gas phase) fowing at 10 m s is 1000 mgs or 1mgs 1. Thus, this plume of vinyl chloride can be characterized as a 1 mg m 3 plume until it is further diluted in the atmosphere. Heterogeneous advection refers to those cases where there is a secondary phase present inside the main advective medium, e.g. the presence of PM (i.e. suspended solids) carried by wind.", "Heterogeneous advection involves more than one transport system within the compartment. In the vinyl chloride case above, if particle matter is also fowing in the plume and the PM has a concentration of 100 mgm 3 and vinyl chloride makes up 0.05 of this PM concentration, then the aerosol phase of vinyl chloride in the plume is 5 mgm 3 and the homogeneous particle phase advection is 5 mgm 3 10m3s 1 \u00bc 50 mgs 1. This value must be added to the gas phase homogeneous calculation, so that the heterogeneous (gas and particle phases) vinyl chloride advection 11 1 would be 1000 s (gas) \u00fe 50 mgs (PM) \u00bc 1050 mgs . Thus, not only the concentration of the dissolved fraction of the contaminant must be known but also the concentration of chemical in and on the solid particles. Heterogeneous advection is a common transport mechanism for highly lipophilic compounds or otherwise insoluble matter that is often sorbed to particles as compared to dissolved in water. This may be similar to chemical transport, such as when metals form both lipophilic and hydrophilic species (e.g. ligands), depending upon their speciation. Many biomolecules and other complex organic compounds, such as the PAHs and PCBs, are relatively insoluble in water. Therefore, most of their advective transport is by attaching to particles. In fact, lipophilic organics are likely to have orders of magnitude greater concentrations in suspended matter than is dissolved in the water (recalling the discussion of Kow in Chapters 17 and 18). Another example of advective transport is atmospheric deposition of contaminants. The sorption of contaminants to the surface of atmospheric water droplets is known as wet deposition and sorption to solid particles is known as dry deposition. The process where these contaminants are delivered by precipitation to the earth is advection. Rather than three-dimensional transport, many advective models are represented by the one-dimensional mass fux equation for advection, which can be stated as JAdvection \u00bc vheC (27.65) where v \u00bc average linear velocity (meters per second) h \u00bc effective porosity (percent, unitless) e C \u00bc chemical concentration of the solute (kilogram per cubic meter) Probably the most common application of the fux term is in two dimensions: JAdvection \u00bc vC (27.66) Two-dimensional fuxes are an expression of the transport of a contaminant across a unit area. This rate of this transport is the fux density (see Figure 27.44), which is V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS the contaminant mass moving across a unit area per time. In most environmental applications, fuid velocities vary considerably in time and space (think about calm vs gusty wind conditions, for example). Thus, estimating fux density for advection in a turbulent fuid usually requires a time integration to determine average concentrations of the contaminant. For example, a piece of air monitoring equipment may collect samples every minute, but the model or calculation calls for an hourly value, so the 60 values are averaged to give one integrated concentration of the air pollutant. For example, if the atmospheric concentration of pollutant A is 15 ng m 3 and it is moving at a velocity of 0.1 m s 1, the average fux density of the pollutant A as it moves downwind can be calculated as 3 \u00bdA \u00bc15 ng m 13 2 JAdvection \u00bcvC \u00bc 0:1ms 15ng m \u00bc1:5ngm 27.5.3 Dispersion Numerous dispersion processes are at work in environmental biochemodynamic systems. As is the case for diffusion, the type of dispersion can vary according to scale. Contaminant transport literature identifes two principal types, i.e. hydrodynamic dispersion and mechanical dispersion. However, these are actually not mutually exclusive terms. In fact, mechanical dispersion is a factor in dynamic dispersion. Computational approximations are based on frst principles of motion and thermodynamics and can be applied to any physical agent. For example, they may be applied to escaped or intentionally released genetically engineered microbe or its spores. They may also be useful in predicting the dispersion of agents in emergency situations. The process of a contaminant plume\u2019s spread into multiple directions longitudinally is known dynamic dispersion. If in air, the spreading is known as aerodynamic dispersion, and if in water it is hydrodynamic dispersion. This spreading results from physical processes that affect the velocity of different molecules in an environmental medium. For example, in aquifers, the process is at work when the contaminant traverses the fow path of the moving groundwater. This is the result of two physical mechanisms: molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion.", "Molecular diffusion can occur under both freely fowing and stagnant fuid systems, while mechanical dispersion is of most importance in fowing systems. The units of dynamic dispersion dd are area per time (e.g. square centimeters per second). Since dispersion is the mixing of the pollutant within the fuid body (e.g. the atmosphere), the question arises as to whether it is better to calculate the dispersion from physical principles, using a deterministic approach, or to estimate the dispersion using statistics, actually probabilities. The Eulerian model bases the mass balance around a differential volume. A Lagrangian model applies statistical theory of turbulence, assuming that turbulent dispersion is a random process described by a distribution function. The Lagrangian model follows the individual random movements of molecules released into the plume, using statistical properties of random motions that are characterized mathematically. Thus, this mathematical approachestimatesthemovementofavolumeofchemical (particle)n from one point in the plume to another distinct point during a unit time. Thus, the path each particle takes during this time is an ensemble mean feld relates to the particle displacement probabilities: C\u00f0x; y; z; t\u00de\u00bcMTotalP\u00f0Dx; t\u00de (27.67) where Dx \u00bcx2 x1 \u00bcparticle displacement P(Dx2, t) \u00bcprobability that the point x2 will be immersed in the dispersing media at time t MTotal \u00bctotal mass of particles released at x1 C \u00bcmean concentration of all released particles \u00bcmass of particles the plume dx$dy$dz around x2 Gaussian dispersion models assume a normal distribution of the plume (see Figure 27.45). This is a common but at best a frst approximation of the actual dispersion within a biochemodynamic system. In a deterministic approach, the dispersion includes mixing at all scales. At the larger scales, characteristics of strata and variability in the permeability of the layers must be described. So, a deterministic dispersion fux would be JDispersion \u00bcD$gradC (27.68) n Science is not always consistent with its terminology. The term \u201cparticle\u201d is used in many ways. In dispersion modeling, the term particle usually means a theoretical point that is followed in a fuid. The point represents the path that the pollutant is expected to take. Particle is also used to mean aerosol in atmospheric sciences. Particle is also commonly used to describe unconsolidated materials, such as soils and sediment. The present discussion, for example, accounts for the effects of these particles (e.g. frictional) as the fuid moves through unconsolidated material. The pollutant PM, particle matter, is commonly referred to as \u201cparticles\u201d. Even the physicist\u2019s particle-wave dichotomy comes into play in environmental analysis, as the behavior of light is important in environmental chromatography. V.

For example, if a wet soil contains methylmercury (CH3Hg) compounds in concentrations of 100 ng l 1 at a depth of 3 mm and at 10 ng l 1depth of 2 mm, diffusion would account for the upward transport of the CH3Hg through the soil. Diffusion is described by Fick\u2019s laws. The frst law says that the fux of a solute under steady state conditions is a gradient of concentration with distance: d\u00bdc JDiffusion \u00bc D (27.69) dx where D is a diffusion coeffcient (units of area/time), [c]is the molar concentration of the contaminant, and x is distance between the points of contaminant concentration measurements (units of length). Note that the concentration can also be expressed as mass per fuid volume (e.g. milligram per liter), in which case, fux is expressed as dC JDiffusion \u00bc D (27.70) dx The concentration gradient can also appear in the form JDiffusion \u00bc doic (27.71) where do is again the proportionality constant, and vC ic \u00bc (27.72) vx The negative sign denotes that the transport is from greater to lesser contaminant concentrations. Fick\u2019s second law comes into play when the concentrations are changing with time. The change of concentrations with respect to time is proportional to the second derivative of the concentration gradient: vC v 2C \u00bc (27.73) 2 vt vx All of the diffusion expressed in these equations is one dimensional, but three-dimensional forms are available and used in models.", "Two types of diffusion are important to transport of contaminants: molecular diffusion and turbulent or eddy diffusion. Each Fickian process operates at its own scale. At the molecular level, in surface waters and atmospheric systems, diffusion dominates as a transport mechanism only in a very thin boundary layer between the fuid media. However, in sediments, sludge, and groundwater, this can be an important transport mechanism. Since the concentration gradient (ic) is the change in concentration (e.g. in units of kilogram per cubic meter) with length (in meters), the units of ic are kg m 4. Diffusion is therefore analogous to the physical potential feld theories (i.e. fow is from the direction of high potential to low potential, such as from high pressure to low pressure). This gradient is observed in all phases of matter, solid, liquid, or gas. So, molecular diffusion is really only a major factor of transport in porous media, such as soil or sediment, and can be ignored if other processes, such as advection, bring about a fow of 2 10 5 ms 1 or higher.o However, it can be an important process for source characterization, since it may be the principal means by which a contaminant becomes mixed in a quiescent container (such as a drum, a buried sediment, or a covered pile) or at the boundaries near clay or artifcial liners in landfll systems. Turbulent motion in fuids is characterized by the formation of eddies of various sizes. These eddies can be modeled according to Fick\u2019s frst law (concentration o This value is taken from Tucker WA, Nelkson LH. Diffusion coeffcients in air and water. Handbook of chemical property estimation techniques. New York, (NY): McGraw-Hill; 1982. Flows this low are not uncommon in some groundwater systems or at or in clay liners in landflls. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS gradients), so that the same equations in this chapter applied to molecular diffusion may also be used to estimate the transport of contaminants by eddy diffusion. Like molecular diffusion, eddy diffusion can be modeled in one, two, or three dimensions. One-dimensional models assume that the diffusion coeffcient (D) does not change with respect to direction. However, D must be adjusted to the model. This must be done when D is expected to vary with spatial location and time (which it always does, but if the change is not signifcant, it may be ignored). The coeffcient may also be anisotropic, that is, it may vary in different directions or vertically in the air or water. Pollutants can diffuse from biotechnological operations. Assume, for example, that a composting system is operating in a building with a \u201cfootprint\u201d of 200 m2 of untreated soil. The soil air 3 m beneath the compost has a concentration of 2 mgcm 3 total hydrocarbons (THC). If the diffusion coeffcient is 0.01 cm2 s 1 in this particular soil and assuming that the air is well mixed, the fux density of the vapor and the rate of vapor release by molecular diffusion can be calculated as a one-dimensional fux, the vertical concentration (upward on z axis) . dC 63 \u00bc 2 10 gcm \u00f0300 cm\u00de dz 94 \u00bc 6:7 10 gcm The fux density is dC Applying the fux density to the 200 m (2 106 ), JDiffusion \u00bc D dx \u00bc 10 2 2 cm s 1 6:7 10 9 gcm 4 \u00bc 6:7 10 11 gcm 2 s 1 2 2 cm the penetration of the vapor into the air 1121 2 6:7 10 gcm s 2 106cm 11 1 3600sh 24hday \u00bc 11:5 g day 27.5.5 Combined Effect of Fluxes, Sinks, and Sources Numerous, interrelated biochemodynamic processes determine transport and environmental fate of contaminants. Recall that one of the laws dictating fuid dynamics mentioned at the beginning of this discussion included conservation of mass. This is true, of course, but the molecular structure of the chemical may very well change. The transport depends upon chemical characteristics of the compound (e.g. solubility, vapor pressure, reactivity, and oxidation state) and those of the environment (e.g. presences of microbes, redox potential, ionic strength, and pH). The chemical degradation can be as simple as a frst-order decay process (i.e. the degradation of the contaminant concentration C): vC \u00bc lc (27.74) vt The degradation (l) terms are applied to each chemical. The new degradation products call for an iterative approach to the transport and fate of each degradation product can be described.", "As a new compound is formed, it must go through the same scrutiny for each transport step. This is even more critical if the degradates are toxic. Some are even more toxic than the parent compound.

Such models are of three types: Level 1 model: This model is based on an equilibrium distribution of fxed quantities of contaminants in a closed environment (i.e. conservation of contaminant mass). There is no chemical or biological degradation, advection, and no transport among compartments (such as sediment loading or atmospheric deposition to surface waters). A level 1 calculation describes how a given quantity of a contaminant will partition among the water, air, soil, sediment, suspended particles, and fauna, but does not take into account chemical reactions. Early level 1 models considered an area of 1 km2 with 70% of the area covered in surface water. Larger areas are now being modeled (e.g. about the size of the state of Ohio). Level 2 model: This model relaxes the conservation restrictions of level 1 by introducing direct inputs (e.g. emissions) and advective sources from air and water. It assumes that a contaminant is being continuously loaded at a constant rate into the control volume, allowing the contaminant loading to reach steady state and equilibrium between contaminant input and output rates. Degradation and bulk movement of contaminants (advection) is treated as a loss term. Exchanges between and among media are not quantifed. Since the level 2 approach is a simulation of a contaminant being continuously discharged into numerous compartments and that achieves a steady state equilibrium, the challenge is to deduce the losses of the contaminant due to chemical reactions and advective (nondiffusive) mechanisms. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.5 MODELING AIR POLLUTION PARTITIONING Reaction rates are unique to each compound and are published according to reactivity class (e.g. fast, moderate, or slow reactions), which allows modelers to select a class of reactivity for the respective contaminant to insert into transport models. The reactions are often assumed to be frst order, so the model will employ a frst-order rate constant for each compartment in the environmental system (e.g. x mol h 1in water, y molh 1 in air, z mol hr 1in soil). Much uncertainty is associated with the reactivity class and rate constants, so it is best to use rates published in the literature based upon experimental and empirical studies, wherever possible. Advection fow rates in level 2 models are usually refected by residence times in the compartments. These residence times are commonly set at 1 h in each medium, so the advection rate (ri) is the volume of the compartment divided by the residence time (t): 1 ri \u00bc Vt (27.76) Level 3 model: Sameaslevel2,butdoesnot assumeequilibrium between compartments, so each compartment has its own fugacity. Mass balance applies to the whole system and each compartment within the system. Includes mass transfer coeffcients, rates of deposition and resuspension of contaminant, rates of diffusion, soil runoff, and area covered. All of these factors are aggregated into an inter-media transport term (D) for each compartment. The assumption of equilibrium in level 1 and 2 models is a simplifcation, and often a gross oversimplifcation of what actually occurs in environmental systems. When the simplifcation is not acceptable, kinetics must be included in the model. Numerous diffusive and nondiffusive transport mechanisms are included in level 3 modeling. For example, values for the various compartments\u2019 unique intermedia transport velocity parameters (in length per time dimensions) are applied to all contaminants being modeled (these are used to calculate the D values). It is important to note that models are only as good as the information and assumptions that go into them. For example, neighborhood-scale effects (see Figure 27.46) can modify estimates from transport models or from measurement interpolations (barriers, channeling, local fows, and trapping). This applies to all transport models, whether highly computational or simplifed. Site-specifc differences can greatly affect predicted outcomes, such as whether terrain is complex or simple, whether there are frequent inversions, whether sources emit the contaminant continuously or haphazardly, etc. This is true at all scales. For example, microenvironmental models must account for variability in room confgurations, movements and activities of occupants, and seasonal changes.", "Myriad physical, chemical, and biological processes are at work within the atmosphere and environmental systems and in the various receptor systems after products and organisms are released. Combinations of these processes into equations and models can increase uncertainty, which can be propagated and magnifed as the factors and variables interact. Thus, air pollution V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27. MODELING APPLICATIONS ADDRESSING UNCERTAINTY The processes that lead to the ultimate fate of air pollutants are complicated. Their relationships with one another are complex. These complexities must be captured in a model for at least two reasons. First, they must document what is going on during a given period of time. Almost always, actual measurement data are not available to characterize the movement and change of materials in the environment. Second, models provide a means of predicting outcomes based on currently available information. Therefore, the uncertainties stem from the model itself and the data being input. Figure 27.47 illustrates the steps that should be taken to develop an air pollution or any environmental model. The model generators are to the left and the users are to the right. This illustrates the connection between the biochemodynamic factors as applied to decision making. Each arrow indicates the connection between processes; each factor and process introduces information to the model, but simultaneously adds uncertainty. Uncertainty lies in estimating the values to be assigned to each compartment of a model, including theoretical \u0081Source facility owners or responsible parties \u0081Directly affected neighboring property owners & public \u0081Courts and interested government entities (e.g. agencies) \u0081Advocacy groups (e.g. environmental, industry, and trade organizations FIGURE27.47 Steps needed to develop and implement an environmental decision model from inception to completion. These include problem specifcation; model identifcation and selection (a site-specifc model may be generated de novo or based on an existing model framework); model development (including problem-and site-specifc model conceptualization, model formulation and design, and model calibration); model evaluation (e.g. based on peer review, data quality assessment, model code verifcation, model confrmation/corroboration, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty analysis); model use (diagnostic analysis, solution, and application support for decision making); and review after use.

Measurement error and other uncertainties in data used in Model 2 Selection of appropriate data for Model 1 Selection of appropriate data for Model 2 Analytical uncertainty in Model 1 Uncertainties in Models 1 and 2 results + measurement and analytical uncertainties in Model 3, i.e. hybrid of Models 1 and 2 Uncertainties in Model 3 resulting from propagation of uncertainties form Models 1 and 2 + other data and analytical uncertainties from combining the models uncertainty (e.g. which of the published values of the partitioning coeffcients discussed in Chapter 18 are relevant to a particular scenario) and measurement uncertainty (e.g. limitations in the ability to measure in the real world, such as the need for destructive methods or analytical problems, such as storing samples before they can be analyzed). However, models add another dimension to uncertainty (see Figure 27.48). Uncertainty increases with each addition of information, each algorithm, and each assumption. Combining models adds even more uncertainty. Uncertainty can be classifed as either aleatory or epistemic. Aleatory uncertainty is random uncertainty or stochastic uncertainty that is impossible to predict. All environmental systems have inherent, random uncertainty that cannot be reduced by additional observations. On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty arises from insuffcient knowledge about the system. Thus, as more reliable information becomes available regarding the processes described in this chapter, one would expect epistemic uncertainty to fall. Thus, from a scalar perspective, any model outcome (Y) is affected by a function of the probabil ity of these two types of uncertainty91: Y \u00bc h\u00f0U; V\u00de (27.77) where U \u00bc all epistemic uncertainties (uncertain parameters), V \u00bcaleatory uncertainties (stochastic variables), and h is the computational model considered as a deterministic function of both uncertainties. An example of aleatory uncertainty would be a forecast of failure to contain a genetically engineered microbe within the physical confnement of a laboratory or a (Continued ) V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 27.", "MODELING APPLICATIONS ADDRESSING UNCERTAINTY (cont\u2019d ) cleanup site, e.g. where the occurrence of failure occurs randomly over time and the actual time of failure cannot be predicted, no matter the size of the data set. Conversely, epistemic uncertainty includes uncertainties inherent to a variable or parameter, as well as uncertainties in the model\u2019s algorithms. For example, a model may miss a possible route by which an air pollutant can be released because of wrong information about the molecule\u2019s affnity to a certain type of aerosol or soil particle. With increasing information about these relationships, the epistemic uncertainty should decrease and the predictive capability of the model would commensurately increase. A means of predicting this type of uncertainty is by hierarchical holographic modeling (HHM), which addresses large system complexities by Identifying the components and processes of all subsystems and suggests ways in which they might interact with each other based on established/supportive information. The technique decomposes the system by looking at it from many different perspectives including, for example, the functions, activities, geo-political boundaries, or structures of the system. HHM can be used in one of two waysdas a hazard identifcation tool or as a comprehensive analytical modeling tool. The analyst constructs an HHM by frst identifying the most appropriate perspectives for the problem in hand. These are used to defne the sub-systems which in turn are further decomposed into components, processes, functions or activities, which may or may not overlap with other sub-systems. The analyst can investigate the quantitative properties of the system if the functions, activities, components or processes of the system can be described by a series of overlapping models, subject to overall system constraints. The analyst(s) can also identify hazards by comparing potential interactions between the subsystems in a qualitative fashion. This is best achieved by a team, whose members are expert in one or more of the chosen perspectives.92a,92b With reliable hazard and exposure calculations, risks can be characterized quantitatively. transport, biochemodynamic, exposure and risk models, and applications must fnd ways to identify and minimize the effect of these uncertainties. (See discussion box, \u201cAddressing Uncertainties\u201d.) 27.6 EXPOSURE AND DOSE MODELS Exposure modeling begins with the initial collection and organization of information to focus on the cumulative factors that lead to the exposure (see Figure 27.49). These steps in Figure 27.50 are often not sequential and require iterations to parameterize and input data regarding population vulnerabilities, public health information, toxicological and epidemiologic data, completed exposure pathways, differential exposures, and contact the air pollutant.93 This effort can provide population profles, listing of relevant chemicals, chemical groups for use in risk analysis and characterization, and a conceptual model. The fnal step of interface exposure assessment results with the doseeresponse assessment. Rather than employing single values to generate a discrete estimate of exposure as is done in deterministic approaches, a probabilistic approach can be used to better depict the uncertainty and variability in infuential input variables. Fundamental to a probabilistic approach is using statistical distributions for input variables, parameterizing these distributions, and characterizing the conditions or probabilities associated with the use of particular distributions. The complexity needed in these models depends on the variables that use statistical distributions, whether multiple variables correlate with one another (e.g. body mass, fat-free body mass, overall ftness) and the number of individuals to which the model will be applied. The probability model will provide a statistical distribution of the estimated exposure or doses for the receptors. Models used to estimate and predict exposures to air pollutants have advanced in application and reliability in recent years. Although many of the physical and chemical factors, parameters, and algorithms are similar to those discussed in this chapter, the differences are substantial in terms of scale and weighting, as well as in the behavioral and biological features. Some of the kinetics within an organism, i.e. toxicokinetics, has been discussed in this chapter, but this is after intake and exposure, i.e. physiologically based pharmacokinetic models. Exposure models that lead to this contact and intake depend on the types, intensities, and extent of activities, as well as biological factors like breathing rates V.

Flow characteristics inside urban street canyons were studied in a laboratory water channel. The approaching fow direction was horizontal and perpendicular to the street axis. The street width was adjusted to form street canyons of aspect ratios 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. The velocity feld and turbulent intensity were measured with a laser Doppler anemometer at various locations within the street canyons, which were used to elucidate the fow pattern inside the street canyons. What kind of model is this? 2. A model assumes that an individual particle moves independently of the motions of all other particles and that the movements of one and the same particle in different time intervals are independent processes, so long as these time intervals are not chosen too small. The model includes a time interval, which is very small compared to the observable time intervals, but nevertheless so large that in two successive time intervals, the particle movement is assumed to be events that are independent of each other. What kind of model is this? 3. The mass balance can be determined for any control volume.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28 Air Quality Status and Trends 28.1 INTRODUCTION For most of Canada, the United States, and Western Europe, the pollutants known to affect public health have decreased in concentrations in the ambient air. As indicated in Table 3.3 in Chapter 3, for example, in the United States, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for protection of human health and welfare have shown a continuing decrease for these \u201ccriteria air pollutants\u201d, i.e. carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ground-level ozone (O3), lead (Pb), and particulate matter (PM). However, this does not mean that the air is necessarily \u201cclean\u201d throughout the world or even the entirety of North America and Europe, as many areas still do not meet health standards for these criteria pollutants (see Figure 26.1 in Chapter 26). Unfortunately, many or even most of the world\u2019s population have not experienced such improvements. Serious risks to health continue in many of the world\u2019s urban areas from exposuretoPMandO3 in both developed and developing countries. Air pollution levels have been linked to increased human mortality or morbidity, even at relatively low concentrations. In particular, elevated concentrations of many pollutants in the indoor air may pose a risk to the health of over half of the world\u2019s population. In homes where biomass fuels and coal are used for cooking and heating, PM concentrations can be 10e50 times higher than the guideline values set by the World Health Organization (WHO). The source of much of these pollutants is the combustion of fossil fuels.1 The representativeness of measurement data from large-scale ambient monitoring has continuously improved as new technologies have become more reliable. This is in large part due to two factors. First, the areas that did not meet the ambient air quality standards in the twentieth century were more extensive than today.", "This is especially true for CO, SO2, and NO2. Second, the standards increasingly have been ratcheted down as new evidence of health effects were documented by improved biomedical research and engineering technologies to detect these pollutants at increasingly lower concentrations. In addition, three other factors must be considered with respect to overall air quality trends. First, the criteria pollutants are in many ways merely indicators of overall ambient air quality. For example, many toxic air pollutants in addition to the criteria pollutants are in the ambient air, but are not being measured at the air monitoring sites. Some of these have either not been decreasing at the rates of criteria pollutants or in some areas are increasing in concentration. Second, the monitoring sites for criteria pollutants are meant to have relatively large spatial coverage, so they would miss many pollutants at a fner scale, e.g. hot spots in neighborhoods. Third, ambient concentrations are weak indicators at best for actual exposures to many pollutants, including those with indoor sources. This is true for both criteria pollutants, e.g. PM, and air toxics, e.g. formaldehyde. The standards for PM have incrementally changed to address fner particle sizes, especially PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mm). Indeed, there is increasing emphasis on even fner particles, i.e. ultra-fnes <100 ng. Ground-level O3 status is more complicated. Like the other pollutants, more continues to be known, but much is still not understood about O3 formation in the troposphere. In addition, the sources, especially mobile sources, are increasing in many parts of the world, with the increase in the number of motor vehicles. However, this is offset to some extent by more stringent emission standards for new vehicles and increased surveillance and inspection activities in certain areas for older vehicles. The more stringent standards address volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx), which are the key precursors for the formation of ozone in the troposphere. In addition, O3 formation depends on sunlight penetration, so climate change could also affect the amount of incoming solar radiation, which would change the photochemistry. Again, this is complicated, since any pollutants added to the ambient air that decrease radiation (e.g. PM) would decrease O3 formation if they absorb or Fundamentals of Air Pollution 755 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00028-1 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 28. AIR QUALITY STATUS AND TRENDS refect solar radiation. Conversely, any climate change that increases incoming solar radiation, e.g. increased precipitation of aerosols or long-range transport of O3 precursors could increase O3 formation. In addition, it is important to keep in mind that these six pollutants do not include many other compounds that are known or suspected to be toxic, especially the hazardous air pollutants listed in Table 7.2 in Chapter 7. Many of these compounds are diffcult to measure and model. As the state-of-the-sciences improve, they will be found in many more locations throughout the world. 7 (A) 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 01 3 5 24 Time (h) 5 (B) 4 3 0 012345 dispersion, the temporal variability of source strengths and the scavenging and conversion mechanisms in the 4 atmosphere affect the residence time of chemicals in Concentration (ppm) 2 1 28.1.1 Averaging Time The variability inherent in air pollutant transport and Time (h) 3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Time (h) 5 4 (D) 3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Time (h) FIGURE 28.1 The same atmosphere measured by (A) a rapid (C) 5 the atmosphere. These and other factors result in variability in the concentration of a pollutant arriving at a receptor. Thus, a continuous record of the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor, as measured by an instrument with rapid response, may resemble the graph shown in Figure 28.1(A). If, however, instead of measuring with a rapid-response instrument, the measurement at the receptor site was made with sampling and analytical procedures that integrated the concentration arriving at the receptor over various time periods, e.g. 15 min, 1 h, or 6 h, the resulting information would look variously like Figures 28.1(B)e(D), respectively. It should be noted that from the information in Figure 28.1(A), it is possible to derive mathematically the information in Figure 28.1(B)e(D), and it is possible to derive the information in Figures 28.1(C) and (D) erly reduced and interpreted in order to become useful information for users.", "However, even data that are prop erly collected may become noisy if their volume is so large that they are not able to be interpreted in a timely manner. This leads to a low signal to noise (S/N) ratio. response instrument and by sampling and analytical procedures that integrate the concentration arriving at the receptor over a time period of (B) 15min, (C) 1h, and (D) 6h. True meaning Data Interpretation S/N = Low V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION from that in Figure 28.1(B). The converse is not true. With only the information from Figure 28.1(D) available, Figures 28.1(A)e(C) could never be constructed, nor could Figures 28.1(A) and (B) be constructed from Figure 8.3(C), nor Figure 28.1(A) from Figure 28.1(B). In these examples, the time intervals involved in Figures 28.1(B)e(D)d15 min, 1 h, and 6 h, respectivelydare the averaging times of the measurement of pollutant exposure at the receptor. The averaging time of the rapid-response record (Figure 28.1(A)) is an inherent characteristic of the instrument and the data acquisition system. It can become almost an instantaneous record of concentration at the receptor. However, in most cases this is not desirable, because such an instantaneous record cannot be put to any practical air pollution control use. What such a record reveals is something of the turbulent structure of the atmosphere, and thus it has some utility in meteorological research. In communications science parlance, an instantaneous recording has too much noise (see Figure 28.2 on the previous page), preventing a proper interpretation of the measurements. It is therefore necessary to flter or damp out the noise in order to extract the useful information about pollution concentration at the receptor that the signal is trying to reveal. This damping is achieved by building time lags into the response of the sampling, analysis, and recording systems (or into all three); by interrogating the instantaneous output of the analyzer at discrete time intervals, e.g. once every minute or once every 5 min, and recording only this extracted information; or by a combination of damping and periodic interrogation. 28.1.2 Temporal Cycles The most signifcant of the principal cyclic infuences on variability of pollution concentration at a receptor is the diurnal cycle (see Figures 28.3 and 28.4). First, there is a diurnal pattern to source strength. In general, emissions from almost all categories of sources are less at night than during the day. Factories and businesses shut down or reduce activity at night. There is less automotive, aircraft, and railroad traffc, use of electricity, cooking, home heating, and refuse burning at night. Second, there is a diurnal pattern to transport and diffusion. The next signifcant cycle is the weekendeweekday cycle. This is entirely a source strength cycle associated with the change in the pattern of living on weekends as compared with weekdays. The curves in Figure 28.3 are bimodal, and resemble the winter curve in Figure 28.4. However, the summer curve is relatively fat with mild spike midday. Note that the CO data in Figure 28.3 are a composite of several US urban areas, whereas the CO data in Figure 28.4 are only from one city in Kuwait. Thus, it would be premature to attribute the cycle profles to particular sources, V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28. AIR QUALITY STATUS AND TRENDS given the many variables, e.g. seasonal climate, population, traffc, and types of sources. On an annual basis, some year-to-year changes in source strength may be expected as a community, a region, a nation, or the world increases in population or changes its patterns of living. Source strength will be reduced if control efforts or changes in technology succeed in preventing more pollution emission than would have resulted from increases in population (see Figure 28.5). These changes over time are called trends. Although an annual trend in source strength is expected, no such trend is expected in climate or weather, even though each year will have its own individuality with 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 \u03bcg m 3 respect to its weather. However, there is at present an ongoing debate as to whether global mean temperatures will continue to increase due to increasing concentration of global greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide and methane. If so, this would be a climatic trend. In addition to atmospheric concentration trends, emission trends are commonly displayed for air pollutant measurements.", "For example, emissions of industrial smoke in Great Britain, which decreased from 1.4 million tons per year in 1953 to 0.1 million tons per year in 1972; domestic smoke emission was reduced from 1.35 million tons per year in 1953 to 0.58 million tons per year in 1972; and Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec FIGURE 28.5 Seasonal variations of airborne particulate concentrations in Hyderabad, India (178.100e178.500 N latitude and 788.100e788.500 E longitude).

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION the number of London fogs (\u201csmogs\u201d) capable of reducing visibility at 9 a.m. to less than 1 km was reduced from 59 per year in 1946 to 5 per year in 1976. Each pollutant has a unique profle. For example, annual trends in urban ozone can be more subtle, with less apparent response to changes in emissions, than many other compounds because of the complex interaction among precursors (hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen) and meteorology, including solar radiation. Ground-level O3 is particularly sensitive to seasonal effects, but not so much in the lower latitudes, since the difference in incoming solar radiation is much less seasonably variable in the tropics (see Figure 28.6) than in the middle latitudes (see Figure 28.7). V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28. AIR QUALITY STATUS AND TRENDS a The terms gas and vapor are often used synonymously; however, a vapor is a gaseous substance that is a solid or liquid at standard temperature and pressure (STP), i.e. at 0 C and 101.325 kPa. Thus, CO2 is a gas, but ethanol is predominantly a liquid under these conditions. Note that not all of ethanol is liquid, since it is vaporizing. However, with increasing temperature and constant pressure, a greater amount of ethanol will move to the gas phase in accordance with Henry\u2019s law (see Chapter 18). That is, at lower temperatures only a small number of ethanol molecules are suffciently excited to move to the gas phase, but with increasing temperature, the number of molecules escaping increases. Thus, when these ethanol molecules are measured in the gas phase, this is considered to be a vapor measurement. 28.1.3 Primary and Secondary Pollutants A substantial portion of the gas and vaporsa emitted to the atmosphere in appreciable quantity from anthropogenic sources tends to be relatively simple in chemical structure: carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitric oxide from combustion processes; hydrogen sulfde, ammonia, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fuoride from industrial processes. The solvents and gasoline fractions that evaporate are alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics with relatively simple structures. In addition, more complex molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins Type ofreaction Primarypollutants Acid gas Simplereaction Oxidation reaction Photochemical chain reaction are released from industrial processes and combustion sources and are referred to as toxic pollutants. Substances such as these, emitted directly from sources, are called primary pollutants. They are certainly not innocuous, as will be seen when their adverse effects are discussed in later chapters. However, the primary pollutants do not, of themselves, produce all of the adverse effects of air pollution. Chemical reactions may occur among the primary pollutants and the constituents of the unpolluted atmosphere (Figure 28.8). The atmosphere may be viewed as a reaction vessel into which reactants are added, and in which a tremendous array of new chemical compounds Secondary Unpollutedpollutants atmosphere V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28.2 TROPOSPHERIC OZONE AND SMOG are produced. These new compounds are generated by gases and vapors reacting with each other and with the particles in the air. The pollutants manufactured in the air are called secondary pollutants; they are responsible for most of the smog, haze, and eye irritation and for many of the forms of plant and material damage attributed to air pollution. In air pollution parlance, the primary pollutants that react are termed the precursors of the secondary pollutants. With the knowledge that each secondary pollutant arises from specifc chemical reactions involving specifc primary reactants, we must control secondary pollutants by controlling how much of each primary pollutant is allowed to be emitted.", "Note that the use of primary and secondary pollutants used here is different from the regulatory defnitions of primary and secondary pollutants, i.e. many countries set primary standards to protect public health and secondary standards to protect welfare. 28.2 TROPOSPHERIC OZONE AND SMOG The WHO\u2019s recently lowered the ground-level O3 guidelines level to 120 mgm 3,based on recently documented associations between daily mortality and ozone levels occurring below this level. Indeed, several European studies have shown that with each increment of 10 mgm 3 increase in O3 concentrations, daily mortality increases by 0.3% and cardiovascular diseases by 0.4%.1 One of the major changes required when the US Clean Air Act was amended in 1990 (Section 182) was the call for greater attention to photochemical oxidant smog in the lower atmosphere, which is arguably the most widespread and persistent urban air pollution problem around the world. The causes of this and the lesser problem of CO and PM2.5 pollution in urban areas are largely due to the diversity and number of urban air pollution sources. One component of urban smog, hydrocarbons, comes from motor vehicle emissions, petroleum refneries, chemical plants, dry cleaners, gasoline stations, house painting, and printing shops. Another key component, nitrogen oxides, comes from the combustion of fuel for transportation, utilities and industries. Although there are other reasons for continued high levels of ozone pollution, such as growth in the number of stationary sources of hydrocarbons and continued growth in automobile travel, the remaining sources of hydrocarbons are the most diffcult to control. These are the small sources, those that emit less than 100 tons of hydrocarbons per year. These sources, such as auto shops and dry cleaners, may individually emit less than 10 tons per year but collectively emit many hundreds of tons of pollution. Title I of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA90) allows the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to defne the boundaries of \u201cnonattainment\u201d areas for ozone, CO, and PM10. Emission standards for these areas are based on a new set of \u201cnonattainment categories\u201d. The USEPA has established a classifcation system for ozone design values (goals) and attainment deadlines. Table 28.1 lists these parameters. In the United States, if a nonattainment area is classifed as serious, based on ambient ozone measurements, then the state must implement actions to come into compliance within 9 years. The CAAA90 also specifes the size and, therefore, the number of sources subject to regulatory control as a function of nonattainment classifcation. Table 28.2 illustrates these requirements for ozone nonattainment classifcations of extreme and severe; the state must include sources with combined NOx and VOC emissions of 10 tons per year in their control plans. As mentioned, nonattainment areas must implement different control measures, depending on their classifcation. Marginal areas, for example, are the closest to meeting the standard. They are required to conduct an inventory of their ozone-causing emissions and institute a permit program. Nonattainment areas with more serious air quality problems must implement various control measures. The worse the air quality, the more the control areas will have to implement.

Generally, the lower the boiling point, the sooner the compound will leave the gas chromatography (GC) column. VOCs are generally separated using GC. However, this is not the case for liquid chromatography. For example, for high-performance liquid chromatography, reverse phase chromatography is widely used. The stationary phase is made of nonpolar organic chains fused to silica and the mobile phase is usually a mixture of aqueous and organic solvents. Here, compounds that are more polar exit the column and move to the mobile phase \ufb01rst. For volatile organic compounds, the elution sequence is for GC separation, unless otherwise stated, e.g. ethylene will separate before isoprene, which will separate before 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene. Source: Ref. 3. The new law also establishes similar programs for areas that do not meet the federal health standards for the pollutants carbon monoxide and PM. Areas exceeding the standards for these pollutants are divided into \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d classifcations. Depending on the degree to which they exceed the carbon monoxide standard, areas are required to implement programs introducing oxygenated fuels and/or enhanced emission inspection programs, among other measures. Depending on their classifcation, areas exceeding the PM standard will have to implement either Reasonably Available Control Technology or Best Available Control Technology, among other requirements. Numerous sampling sites that have been added to the US network are known as Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS). Since smog results from atmospheric photochemical reaction involving VOCs and oxides of nitrogen (NOx), the stationary networks in the United States had to improve ozone (O3) and include reliable chemical speciation of the O3 precursors. Continued V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28.2 TROPOSPHERIC OZONE AND SMOG In addition, meteorological information had to be improved in order to match the photochemical data gathered at each site. Table 28.3 provides the target parameters for PAMS sites. The improved network is aimed at providing sound information that can be used by air pollution control agencies as they evaluate, track progress, and refne control strategies for attaining the ozone air quality standards.3 The current standard4 is 75 ppb for the fourth highest daily maximum 8-h concentration annually, averaged over 3 years.b The PAMS network design consists of fve types of sites (see Figure 28.9).5 The siting requirements are described in the Discussion Box: Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Station Siting Criteria. In the United States, the ground-level ozone has been a more persistent problem than the other gas-phase criteria pollutants. It has decreased in average concentrations in recent decades, but has actually shown a slight increase since 2009. Indeed, the standard of 75 ppb, which is based on the annual fourth maximum of daily maximum 8-h averages, is actually being exceeded by the nationwide average concentration (see Figure 28.10). Meteorology can have a major impact on O3 and other air pollutant concentrations. For example, O3 forms optimally on hot, sunny days in a stable (stagnant) air mass. Figure 28.11 compares national O3 concentrations as observed to those corrected for weather conditions. PHOTOCHEMICAL ASSESSMENT MONITORING STATION SITING CRITERIA The PAMS network consists of four types of monitoring sites: Site#1 Upwind and background characterization site. These stations are located so as to characterize background O3 concentrations and incoming O3 that has been transported into the area. This site also includes background and incoming concentrations for the precursor compounds. The locations are based on the predominant morning upwind direction from the local area of highest precursor emissions and at a distance needed for urban scale measurements, i.e. near the upwind edge of the photochemical grid model domain. Site#2 Maximum ozone precursor emissions impact site. These sites are established to monitor the magnitude and type of precursor emissions in the area where maximum precursor emissions representative of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) are expected to impact and are suited for the monitoring of urban air toxic pollutants. The #2 sites are located immediately downwind (using the same morning wind direction as for locating site #1) of the area of maximum precursor emissions and are typically placed near the downwind boundary of the primary area of precursor emissions mix to obtain neighborhood scale measurements (often the central business district). The size of the area may dictate placing a second site at the second most predominant morning wind direction.", "Site#3 This site is intended to monitor maximum O3 concentrations downwind (typically 10 to 30 mi) from the area of maximum precursor emissions. These data will provide an estimate of the scale of the pollution. Site#4 These sites are intended to characterize the extreme downwind transported concentrations of O3 and precursor compounds moving out of the area. Combined with background information (site #1), the data from these sites help to show the contribution of transport to downwind areas. These sites are typically located near the downwind edge of the photochemical grid model domain, i.e. in the predominant afternoon downwind direction from the local area of maximum precursor emissions at a distance suffcient to obtain urban scale measurements. b The ozone rule was fnalized on March 12, 2008. The 1997 ozone standard (0.08 ppm, annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour concentration, averaged over 3 years) and related implementation rules continue to be in force. In 1997, the 1-hour ozone standard (0.12 ppm, not to be exceeded more than once per year) was revoked in all areas, although some areas have continued obligations under that standard (so-called antibacksliding). The 1-hour ozone standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum hourly average concentrations above 0.12 ppm is less than or equal to 1.5 V.

Ref. 3. 28.3 CARBON MONOXIDE Carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations vary considerably across the globe, with much seasonal variability (see Figure 28.12). For example, the seasonal shifts in carbon monoxide in central Africa are tied to the widespread agricultural burning that shifts north and south of the equator with the seasons. Combustion, e.g. biomass burning and internal combustion engines, is an important source of carbon monoxide pollution in other regions of the Southern Hemisphere, such as the Amazon and Southeast Asia.6 In the United States, concentrations of 8-h CO decreased 52% between 2001 and 2010, as shown in Figure 28.13. From 2000 to 2012, the national CO average decreased by 57%. For several years, measured CO concentrations have been below the 8-h standard (9 ppm) and 1-h standard (35 ppm). The decrease was fairly evenly distributed throughout the United States. 28.4 NITROGEN DIOXIDE The WHO guideline values for NO2 are 40 mgm 3 annual mean and 200 mgm 3 1-h mean. At short-term concentrations exceeding 200 mgm 3,NO2 causes signifcant infammation of the airways. In addition, NO2 is a precursor for both tropospheric ozone and particulates. If forms nitrate aerosols, which are a major constituentofPM2.5; and in the presence of ultraviolet light, NO2 forms O3. The major sources of anthropogenic emissions of NO2 are combustion processes. Exposure FIGURE 28.10 Trends for the 8-h ozone concentrations in the United States, based on annual fourth maximum 8-h average at 230 nationwide sites. Nationally, average O3 concentrations decreased 25% between 1980 and 2012, but have appeared to be increasing in recent years. The sharpest decline occurred in the 1980s, leveling off in the 1990s, with another substantial decline after 2002. About 90% of sites have concentrations below the top line and 10% of the sites have concentrations below the bottom line. The center white line is the mean concentration for all sites.

Reduced lung function has been documented at NO2 concentrations currently experienced in urban areas in Europe and North America.1 In 2010, the United States strengthened its health-based NO2 ambient air quality standard, lowering it to 100 ppb for the 1-h, 3-year average of the 98th percentile of the annual distribution of daily maximum 1-h average concentrations.

The WHO recommends that the SO2 concentration of mgm 3 should not be exceeded over average periods of 10 min duration, based on studies showing that people with asthma experience changes in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms after periods of exposure to V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28.5 SULFUR DIOXIDE SO2 as short as 10 min. The recent lowering of the 24-h guideline from 125 to 20 mgm 3 was based on recent fndings that the health effects are now known to be associated with much lower levels of SO2 than previously believed. Thus, a greater degree of protection is needed. In addition, the lower recommendation has the added beneft of decreasing other air pollutants, e.g. secondary aerosols (see Figure 28.8).1 In addition to health benefts, the lower standard should also ameliorate acid deposition impacts on ecosystems and materials. Sulfur dioxide is produced from the burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) and the smelting of mineral ores that contain sulfur. The main anthropogenic source of SO2 is the burning of sulfur-containing fossil fuels for domestic heating, power generation, and motor vehicles. SO2 can affect the respiratory system and the functions of the lungs, and causes irritation of the eyes.

Hospital admissions for cardiac disease and mortality increase on days with higher SO2 levels. When SO2 combines with water, it forms sulfuric acid; this is the main component of acid rain, which is a cause of deforestation.3 In the United States, ambient SO2 concentrations have shown an improving trend over recent decades (see Figure 28.16). Nationally, annual mean concentrations of SO2 decreased about 50% between 2001 and 2010. In 2010, annual SO2 concentrations were the lowest measured of the 10-year period.", "A site in Hawaii measured concentrations above the level of the annual standard (30 ppb) and four Hawaiian sites had concentrations greater than the 24-h standard (140 ppb), likely due to volcanic emissions.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28. AIR QUALITY STATUS AND TRENDS 28.6 PARTICULATE MATTER Around the world, more people are exposed to unhealthful concentrations of PM of various sizes than to any other pollutant. PM is composed of various compounds, including but not limited to sulfates, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, carbon, mineral dust, and water. It is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles of both inorganic and organic constituents that are suspended in the air. The PM is identifed according to aerodynamic diameter, usually distinguished between coarse or PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 mm) or fne PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mm). Smaller particles generally are more dangerous since, when inhaled, they may reach the peripheral regions of the bronchioles, and interfere with gas exchange inside the lungs.1 The WHO guideline values for PM2.5 are 10 mgm 3 annual mean and 25 mgm 3 24-h mean. The WHO guideline values for PM10 are 20 mgm 3 annual mean and 50 mgm 3 24-h mean. Diseases associated with PM exposure occur in most countries, in both urban and rural populations. In developing countries, exposure to pollutants from indoor combustion of solid fuels on open fres or traditional stoves increases health risks among young children. Indoor air pollution from solid fuel use also presents a major risk to humans of all ages. The mortality in urban areas with high PM pollution exceeds that observed in relatively cleaner cities by 15e20%. In Europe, the average life expectancy is 8.6 months lower due to exposure to PM2.5 produced by human activities.1 In the United States, both PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations have fallen continuously (see Figures 28.17 and 28.18). Between 2000 and 2012, PM2.5 concentrations (i.e. PM2.5) concentrations in the United States, based on 570 nationwide sites.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28.8 AIR TOXICS 769 fell 33%, from 1990 to 2012, PM10 concentrations dropped by 33%. 28.7 AIRBORNE LEAD Long-term trends can be determined from samples measured by stationary air quality monitoring networks. For example, Figure 28.19 shows the longterm decrease in ambient concentrations of lead (Pb) in the atmosphere in the United States, resulting from reducing Pb in gasoline and improved control technologies. The ambient Pb concentrations have continued to decrease, i.e. approximately 71% between 2001 and 2010 (see Figure 28.20). These monitoring sites are chosen to determine the concentrations of an air pollutant within the expected zone of infuence for a source or set of sources. In this case, 39 sampling stations have been sited near large stationary sources. For comparisons, 63 sites were chosen away from stationary industrial sources. For Pb, average concentrations near a stationary source expected to emit Pb (e.g. metal processing, battery manufacturing, and mining) are about eightfold higher than at a site that is not near a stationary industrial source.", "There are signifcant year-to-year changes in lead concentrations at sites near stationary sources; these refect changes in emissions due to changes in operating schedules and plant closings.8 From the 196 sites shown in Figure 28.21,the Pb standard set in 2008 (0.15 mgm 3) was exceeded at 34 sites, The largest and most rapid decrease occurred during the 1980s and early 1990s, much of which can be attributed to decreasing lead content in gasoline. The trend is based on data from 20 monitoring sites in 14 US counties out of 122 total sites that were operational in 2009. The number reporting 3-month average lead concentrations above the level of the 2008 NAAQS (0.15 mgm 3) fell from 19 to 2 over the same time period. Also shown are the 90th and 10th percentiles based on the distribution of annual statistics. (For color version of this fgure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.)

Beginning in 2010 in the United States, additional monitoring is required near stationary lead sources estimated to emit 0.50 or more tons per year (tpy) of Pb. This means that as many as 270 new locations have been added. 28.8 AIR TOXICS As mentioned, in addition to the criteria pollutants there are numerous compounds that cause health problems, especially chronic illnesses. There are limited data for such compounds at the international or national scale, given the variability of sources. However, there are numerous data on specifc areas from measurements using equipment such as those discussed in Chapter 25. In Europe, for example, the mean ambient air concentration of benzene9 in urban areas is as high 20 mgm 3and in rural areas less than 1 mgm 3. In occupational, indoor, and other settings, benzene concentrations can be much higher. The European concentrations of formaldehyde11 are shown in Table 28.4. Benzene and formaldehyde are but two organic compounds in a long list of air toxics. In addition, there are entire classes of compounds, especially the dioxins, furans, and PAHs, that are grouped together, as well as combinations of organic and inorganic compounds, e.g. coke oven emissions, which are reported. These are often reported along with levels of concern. In Europe, PAHs may be represented by concentrations of a single compound, e.g. benzo(a)pyrene, or dioxins may be represented by the most toxic congener, 2,4,7,8-tetrachlordibenzo-para-dioxin. A unit risk for benzo(a)pyrene is estimated to be 8.7 10 5 per ng m 3, which translates to excess cancer lifetime risks 4 35 36 of 10 at 1.2ng m ,10 at 0.12ng m , and 10 at V.

Approximately, 20 million tons of SO2 are emitted annually in the United States, mostly from the burning of fossil fuels by electric utilities. Acid rain damages lakes, harms forests and buildings, contributes to reduced visibility, and is suspected of damaging health.", "The CAAA90 required a permanent 10 million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from 1980 levels. To achieve this, the USEPA allocated allowances of 1 ton of sulfur dioxide in two phases. The frst phase, effective January 1, 1995, required 110 power electric plants to reduce their emissions to a level equivalent to the product of an emissions rate equal to 2.5 lbs of SO2 per million Btu (mm Btu) times the average mm Btu of their 1985e1987 fuel use. Plants that use certain control technologies to meet their phase I reduction requirements were able to receive a 2-year extension of compliance until 1997. The law also had a special allocation of 200,000 annual allowances per year each of the 5 years of phase I to power plants in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. The second phase, effective January 1, 2000, required approximately 2000 utilities to reduce their emissions to a level equivalent to the product of an emissions rate of (1.2 lbs of SO2 mm Btu 1) (the average mm Btu of their 1985e1987 fuel use). In both phases, affected sources were required to install systems that continuously monitor emissions in order to track progress and assure compliance. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28.11 GLOBAL GHGs 771 The law provided for utilities to trade allowances within their systems and/or buy or sell allowances to and from other affected sources. Each source must have suffcient allowances to cover its annual emissions. If not, the source is subject to a $2000 per ton excess emissions fee and a requirement to offset the excess emissions in the following year. Nationwide, plants that emit SO2 at a rate below 1.2 lbs mm Btu 1 were able to increase emissions by 20% between a baseline year and 2000. Bonus allowances will be distributed to accommodate growth by units in states with a statewide average below 0.8 lbs mm Btu 1. Plants experiencing increases in their utilization in the last 5 years also receive bonus allowances; 50,000 bonus allowances per year are allocated to plants in 10 Midwestern states that make reductions in phase I. Plants that repower with a qualifying clean coal technology were able to receive a 4-year extension of the compliance date for phase II emission limitations. The law also includes specifc requirements for reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides, based on USEPA regulations to be issued not later than mid-1992 for certain boilers and 1997 for all remaining boilers. Title IV was designed to reduce total SO2 emissions by approximately 50% over a 10-year period. Provisions of the title are designed to introduce economic fexibility for the electric power industry, to recognize controls already implemented by progressive utilities and to reduce the economic impact on high-sulfur coal regions of the United States. 28.10 STRATOSPHERIC OZONE The CAAA90 was built on the market-based structure and requirements on existing USEPA regulations to phase out the production of substances that deplete the ozone layer. The law requires a complete phase-out of alkyl halides like chlorofuorocarbons (CFCs) and halons with interim reductions and some related changes to the existing Montreal Protocol, revised in June 1990.11 The most common CFC is dichlorodifuoromethane (known as R-12 or Freon-12). Many CFCs have been widely used as refrigerants and propellants (in aerosol applications), as well as solvents. The manufacture of such compounds has been phased out, and substituted with physical processes (e.g. manual pumps) or with products such as R-410A, which is a mixture of difuoromethane (CH2F2) and pentafuoroethane (CHF2CF3). The alkyl halides contain bromine (Br) or chlorine (Cl), but the only halogen in R-410A is fuorine (F), which does not contribute to ozone depletion. Under CAAA90 provisions, the USEPA must list all regulated substances along with their ozone-depletion potential, atmospheric lifetimes, and global warming potentials within 60 days of enactment. In addition, the USEPA was required to ensure that class I chemicals be phased out on a schedule similar to that specifed in the Montreal ProtocoldCFCs, halons, and carbon tetrachloride by 2000; methyl chloroform by 2002dbut with more stringent interim reductions. Class II chemicals, hydrochlorofuorocarbons (HCFCs) will be phased out by 2030. The CAAA90 also requires USEPA to publish a list of safe and unsafe substitutes for class I and II chemicals and to ban the use of unsafe substitutes. The law required nonessential products releasing class I chemicals to be banned within 2 years of enactment. In 1994, a ban went into effect for aerosols and noninsulating foam using class II chemicals, with exemptions for fammability and safety.", "Regulations for this purpose are in place. The Montreal Protocol required the United States to reduce its consumption of HCFCs by 35% below the US baseline cap. As of January 1, 2003, the USEPA banned production and import of HCFC-141b, the most ozone-destructive HCFC. This action allowed the United States to meet its obligations under the Montreal Protocol. All baseline allowances for production and import of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b have been issued. The Montreal Protocol requires the United States to reduce its consumption of HCFCs by 75% below the US baseline. In the European Union and the United States, virgin HCFCs cannot be used in new air conditioning or similar units as of 2010. In other parts of the world, the phase-out date varies by nation. As a result, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system manufacturers may not produce new air conditioners and heat pumps containing R-22. By January 1, 2015, the United States must reduce its consumption of HCFCs by 90% below the US baseline. Finally, by 2020, the Montreal Protocol requires the United States to reduce its consumption of HCFCs by 99.5% below the US baseline. Refrigerant that has been recovered and recycled/ reclaimed will be allowed beyond 2020 to service existing systems, but chemical manufacturers will no longer be able to produce R-22 to service existing air conditioners and heat pumps.12 28.11 GLOBAL GHGs Since the 1980s, many scientists have accepted that human activities play a signifcant role in warming of the planet. Global surface temperatures increased 0.74 C between 1906 and 2005. Eleven of the 12 years between 1993 and 2006 had the highest recorded surface temperatures since 1850.13 The years 2005 and 2010 were the hottest on record. Sea levels have risen about 1.8 mm per year since 1961, and 3.1 mm per year since 1993, due to melting ice from polar ice sheets and glaciers. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28. AIR QUALITY STATUS AND TRENDS The production of global GHGs, chiefy carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), is largely responsible for the increase in global temperatures. GHGs warm the earth by preventing solar radiation from being refected into outer space. Increased concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere are associated with global warming. Anthropogenic GHGs, which have risen steadily since 1750,c increased 70% from 1970 to 2004. Numerous human activities, including transportation, manufacturing, urban development, indoor heating, electric power generation, cement manufacture, and agriculture, produce GHGs. If no actions are taken to stabilize or reduce emissions of anthropogenic GHGs, global temperatures and sea levels may continue to rise. According to various estimates, average global temperatures can be expected to rise between 1.1 and 6.4 C in the next century, and sea levels will rise between 0.18 and 0.59 m, unless steps are taken to stabilize GHG emissions. Global temperatures and sea levels will continue to rise even if GHG emissions remain at current levels, due to time lags between GHG levels and geological and biological responses, such as removal of CO2 from the air by plants. Much of the debate within the scientifc community has involved two aspects of climate change. First, how much of any observed and projected mean global temperature increase is the result of human activities (anthropogenic sources of GHGs)? Second, how certain are the estimates of future global climate change? It is important to acknowledge this debate and recent controversies regarding the data and models being used. In fact, global climate change is similar to other modeling efforts in that accuracy of prediction depends on the quality and representativeness of the data and the algorithms. Errors in assumptions and improper weighting of variables will lead to incorrect predictions. Indeed, climate is a function of many variables and the contribution of each variable is not known with very much precision. Only more data over time will help in defning the role of each variable. Global GHGs, whether from natural or anthropogenic sources, play an important role in the atmosphere\u2019s warming, so information about their emissions and atmospheric concentrations is a worthwhile aspect of air pollution science. Some pollutants are the same as those released from natural sources, but due to human activities, these are found in higher quantities or different places than would be released by natural systems. For example, forests release formaldehyde, but at much lower concentrations than certain manufacturing facilities or even from furniture and other household items.", "Other pollutants would not be produced by natural systems, such as many of the toxic organic compounds, like the CFCs discussed in the previous section. The GHGs fall into both categories, notably CO2 and CH4. Indeed, CO2 is not only the product of photosynthesis and respiration (natural), but also the product of combustion (natural and anthropogenic). Likewise, CH4 is a product of microbial degradation, which is part of the decomposition components of food webs and volcanic emissions (natural) as well as released from livestock and other feeding operations and manufacturing facilities (anthropogenic). Based on atmospheric measurements, there indeed has been a continuous increase in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 in recent centuries. At the beginning of rapid industrialization at the end of the eighteenth century, the mean global CO2 concentration is estimated to have been 280 ppmv (parts per million measured as volumes). In 2011, the mean concentration had increased to 392 ppmv. This increase correlates with a mean global temperature of the earth rising to about 0.8 C over this time period.14 (see Figure 1.4 in Chapter 1). The trend continues, as shown in Figure 28.22. Mean GHG concentrations, particularly CO2, are highly correlated with mean global temperature. Correlation is not necessarily causation, but it does add weight of evidence that GHGs are contributing to climate change (our second question). It is impossible to stop the production of CO2 for 10 years and see if it makes a difference. However, the correlation between the temperature rise and the increase in CO2 concentration is remarkable (especially over the past 100 years) and is supported by the International Panel on Climate Change 2007 and 2011 reports (see Figure 28.23). Radiative forcing is an important feature of GHGs, i.e. the infuence that this gas has on the balance of incoming c This year is used to distinguish pre-Industrial Revolution for post-Industrial Revolution eras.

The gases of most importance in forcing are listed in Table 28.5. Climate change results from natural internal processes and from external forcings. Both are affected by persistent changes in the composition of the atmosphere brought about by changes in land use, release of contaminants, and other human activities. Radiative forcing can be expressed as the change in the net vertical irradiance within the atmosphere. Radiative forcing is often calculated after allowing for stratospheric temperatures to readjust to radiative equilibrium, while holding all tropospheric properties fxed at their unperturbed values. Commonly, radiative forcing is considered to be the extent to which injecting a unit of a GHG into the atmosphere changes global average temperature, but other factors can affect forcing, as shown in Figures 28.24 and 28.25. Note that these radiant gases include halocarbons, with the CFCs, which TABLE 28.5 Relative Forcing of Increased Global Temperature Gas Percentage of Relative Radiative Forcing Carbon dioxide, CO2 64 Methane, CH4 19 Halocarbons (predominantly chlorofuorocarbons, CFCs) 11 Nitrous oxide, N2O 6 are notorious for their role in another atmospheric problem, i.e. destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer. There is much uncertainty about the effects of the presence of these radiant gases (see Table 28.6), but the overall effect of the composite of gases is well understood. The effectiveness of CO2 as a global warming gas has been known for over 100 years. However, the frst useful measurements of atmospheric CO2 were not taken until 1957. The data from Mauna Loa show that even in the 1950s the CO2 concentration had increased from the baseline 280 to 315 ppm; and this has continued to climb over the last 50 years at a nearly constant rate of about 1.6 ppm per year.", "The most serious problem with CO2 is that the effects on global temperature due to its greenhouse effect are delayed. Even in the completely impossible scenario of not emitting any new CO2 into the atmosphere, CO2 concentrations will to continue to increase from our present 370 ppm to possibly higher than 600 ppm. The effect of this is discussed below. Overall, total radiative forcings for CO2,O3,CH4, and N2O are 1.66, 0.30, 0.48, and 0.16 W m 2, respectively. The relative global warming potential for CO2,CH4, and N2O are 1, 25, and 298 respectively, and the concentrations of CO2,O3,CH4, and N2O in the atmosphere are 392, 0.034, 1.77, and 0.32 ppmv, respectively. The mean CH4 concentration has more than doubled from 0.72 ppmv in the year 1750, to its present value, but appears to have stabilized over the past decade. In addition to GHG concentrations, other factors must be considered in climate change, including solar radiation changes, volcanic activity, and the earth\u2019s orbital characteristics.16 However, numerous scientists consider the increase in GHG concentrations to be the largest factor.17 28.12 INDOOR AIR QUALITY Indoor air may be contaminated by such sources as fuel-fred cooking or space heating ranges, ovens, or stoves that discharge their gaseous and aerosol combustion products to the room; by solvents evaporated from coatings, paints, adhesives, cleaners, or other products; by formaldehyde, radon, and other products emanating from building materials; and by other pollutant sources indoors.18 If some of these sources exist inside a building, the pollution level of the indoor air might be higher than that of the outside air. However, if none of these sources are inside the building, the pollution level inside would be expected to be lower than the ambient concentration outside because of the ability of the surfaces inside the buildingdwalls, foors, ceilings, furniture, and fxturesdto adsorb or react with gaseous pollutants and to attract and retain particulate V.

This represents the Panel\u2019s subjective judgment about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors such as the assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of knowledge of the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, and the uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing.

This adsorption and retention would occur even if doors and windows were open, but the difference between outdoor and indoor concentrations would be even greater if they were closed, in which case air could enter the building only by infltration through cracks and walls. For example, VOCs, such as the carbonyls (aldehydes and ketones), are frequently found in residences. Various sources of carbonyls are often present inside homes, but little is known about their indoor source strengths, that is, the amount generated indoors versus outdoors. A recent study19 using a database established in the relationships of indoor, outdoor, and personal air (RIOPA) estimated indoor source strengths of 10 carbonyls and outdoor contributions to measured indoor concentrations of these carbonyls.

Table 28.7 shows indoor and outdoor concentrations of carbonyls. Scatter plots of paired indoor and outdoor carbonyl concentrations are shown in Figure 28.26. Table 28.8 indicates that the study found variations in the estimated decay rate (rate of chemical breakdown) constants across the RIOPA homes.", "Across-home estimates of indoor source strengths are presented in Figure 28.26. Myriad factors infuence indoor air pollutant concentrations, but air volume and indoor source strength have been shown to be the most infuential parameters in determining indoor concentrations for compounds with strong indoor sources, whereas the outdoor concentration had the most signifcant impact for compounds mainly generated from outdoor sources. Interestingly the air exchange rates and the decay rate constant were the least sensitive parameters in the model used to determine the indoor concentrations for the RIOPA homes. In addition to indoor combustion sources, chemicals are brought indoors. The indoor environment can be quite different than the environmental conditions for which partitioning coeffcients and persistence estimates are based. For example, indoor environments can have much higher levels of exposure since many relatively reactive compounds become persistent indoors, given the lower rates of photodegradation and biodegradation, as well as the presence of many sorbing substrates (e.g. carpet twill) into which chemicals can be sequestered. In addition, the manner and the frequency of product use can greatly increase exposure levels.

This occurs to a much greater extent indoors than in the outdoor air. Many ordinances have been established to limit or prohibit smoking in public and work places. Indoor air quality continues to be of interest to both the scientifc community and homeowners. In fact, indoor environmental quality is one of the keystone areas for green architecture and engineering, as well as sustainable buildings and construction. 28.13 AIR QUALITY INDICES After air quality is measured and interpreted, it must be shared widely with scientists, engineers, physicians, and the general public. This means that it must be summarized in a way that is understandable to a large audience. One of the ways this is done for air quality in different geographic areas is to reduce the data using an index, such as the air quality index (AQI). An index is a very useful device for digesting complex and complicated information in a manner that is more generally understandable. It also is a systems tool that can combine data and information from different sources to provide multi-pollutant summaries. Such indices must provide benchmarks, such as how a particular region\u2019s atmospheric concentrations of a specifc air pollutant or suite of pollutants compares to the rest of the country or the rest of the world. This is often presented as percentiles, e.g. an urban area\u2019s mean concentration of O3 is at the 90th percentile, which means that this region is worse than 90% of the rest of the nation for ground-level O3. Air quality indices must also allow comparisons to level at which adverse responses could occur. The index comparison must address each pollutant\u2019s characteristic response times: short term (i.e. seconds or minutes), intermediate term (i.e. hours or days), and long term (i.e. months or years) (see Table 28.9). Thus, indices usually have line or other indication where no adverse responses are expected or where a particular segment of the population is vulnerable (e.g. red may mean that this level is bad for everyone, but orange may mean it is particularly bad for children with asthma).

The odor response curve, e.g. to hydrogen sulfde, shows that a single inhalation requiring approximately 1 s can establish the presence of the odor but that, due to odor fatigue, the ability to continue to recognize that odor can be lost in a matter of minutes. Nasopharyngeal and eye irritation, e.g. by ozone, is similarly subject to acclimatization due to tear and mucus production. The three visibility lines correlate with the concentration of suspended PM in the air. Corrosion of metal, painted surfaces, or nylon hose is shown by a line starting at 1 s and terminating in a matter of minutes, i.e. when the acidity of the droplet is neutralized by the material attacked. Indices can present data in numerous ways. For example, vegetation damage can be measured biologically or socioeconomically. Using the latter measure, there is a 0% loss when there is no loss of the sale value of the crops or ornamental plants but a 100% loss if the crop is damaged to the extent that it cannot be sold. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 28.13 AIR QUALITY INDICES These responses are related to dose, i.e. concentration times duration of exposure, as shown by the percent loss curves on the chart. A number of manifestations of material damage, e.g. rubber cracking by ozone, require an exposure duration long enough for the adverse effects to be signifcant economically. That is, attack for just a few seconds or minutes will not affect the utility of the material for its intended use, but attack for a number of days will. The biological response line for acute respiratory disease is a doseeresponse curve, which for a constant concentration becomes a durationeresponse curve. The shape of such a curve refects the ability of the human body to cope with short-term, ambient concentration respiratory exposures, and the overwhelming of the body\u2019s defenses by continued exposure. The choice of data to represent response by animals is highly variable and depends on the type of index, e.g. ecological or agricultural. For example, fuorosis of livestock is not induced until there has been a long enough period of deposition of a high enough ambient concentration of fuoride to increase the level of fuoride in the forage. Since the forage is either eaten by livestock or cut for hay at least once during the growing season, the duration of deposition ends after the growing season. The greater the duration of the season, the greater the time for deposition, hence the shape of the line labeled \u201cfuorosis\u201d. Long-term vegetation responsesd decreased yield of fruit and forestdand long-term material responsesdcorrosion, soiling, and material deteriorationdare shown on the chart as having essentially the same response characteristics as human chronic respiratory disease and lung cancer. The relationship of these response curves to ambient air quality is shown by lines A, B, and C, which represent the maximum or any other chosen percentile line from a display such as Figure 28.28, which shows actual air quality. Where the air quality is poor (line A), essentially all the adverse effects displayed will occur. Where the air quality is good (line C), most of the intermediate and long-term adverse effects displayed will not occur. Where the air quality is between good and poor, some of the intermediate and long-term adverse effects will occur, but in an attenuated form compared with those of poor air quality. Indices have been devised for categorizing the air quality measurements of several individual pollutants by one composite number. The index used by the USEPA, for example, is authorized by Section 319 of the Clean Air Act and is called the AQI (Table 28.10). Comparable values for international standards are shown in Table 28.11. The AQI includes the category \u201cunhealthy for sensitive groups\u201d; breakpoints for the ozone (O3)subindex in terms of 8-h average O3 concentrations, along a subindex for fne PM (PM2.5) as well as subindices for coarse PM (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The AQI is designed to convey information to the public regarding daily air quality and its associated health risks. The scientifc understanding of pollutants, especially PM and O3, continues to improve. As such, air quality indices will need to incorporate this knowledge, so changes in categories and benchmarks should be expected.", "These criteria pollutants have no threshold below which health effects are not likely to Average time FIGURE 28.28 Adverse response times and rela 1 s 1 min 1 h 1 day 1 month 1 year tive concentrations of air pollutants. 100 h\u2013rubber cracking i\u20130% crop loss g\u2013100% crop loss a\u20131 mi visibility j Concentration (arbitrary units) IA b\u201310 mi visibility k B Moderate c\u2013100 mi visibility j\u2013Acute respiratory disease k\u2013Livestock fluorosis I\u2013Human-chronic respiratory disease-lung cancer Vegetation-decreased yield of fruit and forest C Material-corrosion, deterioration, and soiling 0.01 0.001 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10 000 Average time (h) V.

The six levels of health concern and what they mean are \u0081 \u201cGood\u201d: The AQI value for your community is between 0 and 50. Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk. \u0081 \u201cModerate\u201d: The AQI for your community is between 51 and 100. Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people. For example, people who are unusually sensitive to ozone may experience respiratory symptoms. \u0081 \u201cUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups\u201d: When AQI values are between 101 and 150, members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. This means they are likely to be affected at lower levels than the general public. For example, people with lung disease are at greater risk from exposure to ozone, while people with either lung disease or heart disease are at greater risk from exposure to particle pollution. The general public is not likely to be affected when the AQI is in this range. \u0081 \u201cUnhealthy\u201d: Everyone may begin to experience health effects when AQI values are between 151 and 200. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. \u0081 \u201cVery unhealthy\u201d: AQI values between 201 and 300 trigger a health alert, meaning everyone may experience more serious health effects. \u0081 \u201cHazardous\u201d: AQI values over 300 trigger health warnings of emergency conditions.

These studies also found adverse effects on the health of children living in metropolitan areas characterized by higher levels of NO2 even in cases where the overall city-wide NO2 level was fairly low.

Everyone else should avoid exertion outdoors * Nitrogen dioxide can cause respiratory problems in children and adults who have respiratory diseases, such as asthma. The AQI for nitrogen dioxide is not included here because ambient nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the United States have been below the national air quality standard for the past several years. These concentrations are suf\ufb01ciently low so as to pose little direct threat to human health. Nitrogen dioxide, however, is a concern because it plays a signi\ufb01cant role in the formation of tropospheric ozone, particulate matter, haze, and acid rain. As concentrations increase, the proportion of people prone to experience health effects and the seriousness of these effects are expected to increase. Thus, the 1997 standards were intended to include an ample margin of safety (as required by Section 109(b) of the Clean Air Act Amendments). The margin includes special concern about protecting the health of sensitive individuals. However, they were not considered risk free and exposures to ambient concentrations just below the numerical level of the standards may be problematic for the most sensitive individuals. On the other hand, exposures to levels just above the NAAQS are not expected to be associated with health concerns for most healthy individuals. Such is the complicated nature of individual response to air pollutants, and one of the objectives of the revised index is to provide suf\ufb01cient information to allow sensitive people to avoid unhealthy exposures. occur.

This chapter\u2019s focus is on ways to remove, treat and, hopefully, eliminate pollutants before they are emitted. The technologies for controlling vary by type of pollutant and the processes that have led to producing the pollutant. The frst major distinction is the physical phase, i.e. the amount of pollutant that is in the vapor-phase and the amount in the aerosol-phase. For most natural sources, the means of control are limited, since the releases occur often over large areas and times of release are diffcult to predict. These controls are often aimed at personal exposures. For example, frst responders must wear respirators and other control technologies when they are near wildfres; whereas, residents are evacuated to limit exposure to the pollutants (if they have not already been evacuated for safety reasons). The same is true for exposure to naturally occurring asbestos, i.e. the best means of protection against inhalation is to keep people away from known areas. Certainly, some controls are put in place for natural sources of air pollution, such as dust control (e.g. periodic wetting) and paving where vehicles may need to access areas. Most of this chapter addresses anthropogenic sources. These range in scale from personal to economic sectors.", "29.1.1 Emissions from Industrial Sources A great deal of industrial pollution comes from manufacturing products from raw materialsd(1) iron and steel from ore, (2) lumber from trees, (3) gasoline and other fuels from crude oil, and (4) stone from quarries. Each of these manufacturing processes produces a product, along with several waste products, which include air pollutants. Often, part or all of the polluting material can be recovered and converted into a usable product. Indeed, matter and energy that exit the facility via stacks, vents, pipes, and by other means represents a major fnancial loss. Thus, industry is increasingly embracing green and sustainable processes, not just for environmental reasons, but for economic ones as well (see Chapter 30). Industrial pollution is also emitted by industries that convert products to other productsd(1) automobile bodies from steel, (2) furniture from lumber, (3) paint from solids and solvents, and (4) asphaltic paving from rock and oil. Industrial sources are stationary, and each facility emits relatively consistent qualities and quantities of pollutants. A paper mill, for example, will be in the same place tomorrow that it is today, emitting the same quantity of the same kinds of pollutants unless a major process change is made. Control of industrial sources can usually be accomplished by applying known technology. The most effective regulatory control is that which is applied uniformly within all segments of industries in a given region, e.g. \u201cEmission from all asphalt plant dryers in this region shall not exceed 230 mg of particulate matter per standard dry cubic meter of air\u201d. 29.1.2 Emissions from Utilities The electric power generating utilities (see Figure 29.1) are an integral part of modern life in developed and increasingly in developing nations. Utilities are in the business of converting energy from one form to another and transporting that energy. If a large steam generating plant, producing 2000 MW, burns a million kilograms per hour of 4% ash coal, it must somehow dispose of 40,000 kg of ash per hour. Some will be removed from the furnaces by the ash-handling systems, but some will go up the stack with the fue gases. If 50% of the ash enters the stack and the fy ash collection system is 99% effcient, 200 kg of ash per hour will be emitted to the atmosphere. For a Fundamentals of Air Pollution 787 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00029-3 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS typical generating plant, the gaseous emissions would include 341,000 kg of oxides of sulfur per day and 185,000 kg of oxides of nitrogen per day. If this is judged as excessive pollution, the management decision can be to (1) purchase lower-ash or lower-sulfur coal, (2) change the furnace so that more ash goes to the ash pit and less goes up the stack, or (3) install more effcient air pollution control equipment. In any case, the cost of operation will be increased and this increase will be passed on to the consumer. Another type of utility that is a serious air pollution source is the one that handles the wastes of modern society. The principal concern with solid waste and sewage is land, surface water, and ground water pollution, but an overloaded, poorly designed, or poorly operated sewage treatment plant can cause an air pollution problem which will arouse citizens to demand immediate action. In many countries around the world, open dumps still exist. These may catch fre and release harmful plumes of smoke and fumes. Even in more economically developed nations, landflls remain sources of dust and smoke, as are fres in abandoned mine shafts and in industrial waste disposal and reclamation sites. These are certainly sources of public complaint, even though it may be explained to the same public that it is the \u201ccheapest\u201d way to dispose of their solid waste. The public has shown its willingness to ban burning dumps and pay the additional cost of adequate waste disposal facilities to have a pollution-free environment. 29.1.3 Emissions from Residential and Personal Sources Even in Western society, which has moved toward centralized industries and utilities, there remain many personal sources of air pollution, including: (1) automobiles, (2) home furnaces, (3) home freplaces and stoves, (4) backyard barbecue grills, and (5) open burning of refuse and leaves. Figure 29.2 illustrates the personal emissions of a typical US family. The collective contribution of individual actions, such as backyard burning can be substantial.", "For example, signifcantly higher levels of dioxins are produced by burning trash in burn barrels than in municipal incinerators. Household burn vessels receive limited oxygen, so the combustion occurs at relatively low temperatures. This produces products of incomplete combustion (PIC), including halogenated dioxins and furans, in addition to smoke and other pollutants. Conversely, large incinerators in many countries are required by regulations to have pollution control systems that reduce dioxin emissions primarily by preventing their formation, e.g. specifcation of incineration time, temperature, and mixing. Backyard burning is also particularly dangerous because it releases pollutants at ground level where they are more readily inhaled or incorporated into the food chain.1 The energy release and air pollution emissions from personal sources in the United States are greater than those from industry and utilities combined. In any major city in the United States, the mass of pollutants emitted by the vast numbers of private automobiles exceeds that from any other source. Control of these personal sources of pollution takes the form of (1) regulation (freplaces and stoves may be used only when atmospheric mixing is favorable), (2) change of lifestyle (sell the automobile and ride public transportation), (3) change from a more polluting to a less polluting source (convert the furnace to natural gas), or (4) change the form of pollution (instead of burning leaves, haul them to the city landfll for composting). Whatever method is used for control of pollution from personal sources, it is usually diffcult and unpopular to enforce. It is diffcult to get citizens to believe that their new, highly advertised, shiny, unpaid-for automobiles are as serious a pollution problem as the smoking factory stack on the horizon. It is also a very ineffective argument to point out that the workers at that factory put more pollution into the air each day by driving their automobiles to and from work, or by mowing their V.

Combustion is the most widely used class of chemical reactions to provide energy and to manufacture products. Combustion occurs as the rapid union of a substance with oxygen accompanied by the evolution of light and heat.2 The economies of highly industrialized nations are heavily dependent on combustion. Much of the transportation by automobile, rail, and airlines is based on internal combustion engines that burn gasoline or diesel fuels. Small internal combustion engines are deceivingly important sources of air pollutants. In fact, with the advent of low emitting vehicles (LEVs), lawn mower usage for 1 h emits about as much as driving a car 100 miles (650 miles for a vehicle made before 1990). A push mower emits as much hourly pollution as 11 cars and a riding mower emits as much as 34 cars. Since small engine use exceeds three billion hours per year in the United States, the US EPA proposed a rule in 2007 to reduce small engine exhaust of hydrocarbons by 35% and oxides of nitrogen emissions by 60%. In addition, fuel evaporative emissions of hydrocarbons are expected to fall by 45% if the rule is implemented. To meet exhaust emission standards, manufacturers are expected to use catalytic converters for the frst time in numerous small watercraft, lawn, and garden equipment. The rule also lays out fuel evaporative standards, national standards for vessels powered by stern-drive or inboard engines, and CO standards for gasoline-powered engines used in recreational watercraft.3 Combustion is the relatively simple phenomenon of oxidizing a substance in the presence of heat. Chemically, effcient combustion is: a\u00f0CH\u00de D bO2 / cCO2 D dH2O (29.1) x The coeffcients and subscript depend on the specifc fuel composition. Most thermal processes, however, do not reach complete combustion. More complex combustion reactions are shown in Table 29.1.Theyare usually oxygen limited, leading to the generation of a wide variety of compounds, many that are toxic. Other reactions besides combustion also produce air pollutants. Decomposition of a substance in the absence of oxygen is known as pyrolysis. In fact, a single fre can have pockets of both combustion and pyrolytic processes. This lack of homogeneity results in temperatures varying in both space and time. Plastic fres, for example, can release over 450 different organic compounds.3", "The relative amount of combustion and pyrolysis in a V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.

Temperature is also important, but there is no direct relationship between temperature and pollutants released. For example, Figure 29.3 shows that in a plastics 10.00 fre (i.e. low-density polyethylene pyrolysis) compounds are generated at lower temperatures, but for others the optimal range is at higher temperatures. The aliphatic compounds in this fre (i.e. 1-dodecene, 9-nonadecane, 8.00 and 1-hexacosene) are generated in higher concentrations 1-Hexacosene Chrysene 9-Nonadecane Phenanthrene Fluorene Biphenyl 2-Methylnapthalene 1-Dodecene Naphthalene Indene at lower temperatures (about 800 C), and the aromatics need higher temperatures (see Figures 29.3 and 29.4). Combustion is used primarily for heat by changing the potential chemical energy of the fuel to thermal en ergy. This occurs in a fossil fuel-fred power plant, a home furnace, or an automobile engine. Combustion is also used as a means of destruction for our unwanted materials. This decreases the volume of a solid waste by burning the combustibles in an incinerator. We subject combustible gases, with undesirable properties such as odors, to a high temperature in an afterburner system to convert them to less objectionable gases. The effcient reaction can be seen as two simple reactions that produce carbon dioxide and water: C D O2 / CO2 (29.2) 2H2 D O2 / 2H2O (29.3) The problems with the combustion reaction occur because the process also produces many other products. These can be gases, e.g. carbon monoxide (CO), CO2, oxides of sulfur (SOx), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), smoke, fy ash, metals, metal oxides, metal salts, aldehydes, ketones, acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), halogenated organic compounds that include Concentration (mg g\u20131) 6.00 4.00 2.00 0.00 800\u00b0 850\u00b0 900\u00b0 950\u00b0 Temperature (\u00baC) FIGURE 29.3 Selected hydrocarbon compounds generated in a low-density polyethylene \ufb01re (pyrolysis; low oxygen conditions) in four temperature regions.

Concentration (mg g\u20131) hexachlorobenzene and the dioxins and furans, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and many others. For a number of decades now combustion engineers have devoted considerable attention to the relatively small quantities of materials emitted from the combustion process that are considered to be air pollutants. Prior to then an automotive engineer, for example, was not overly concerned about the 1% of carbon monoxide in the exhaust of the gasoline engine. By getting this 1% to burn to carbon dioxide inside the combustion chamber, the engineer could expect an increase in gasoline mileage of something less than one-half of 1%. This 1% of carbon monoxide, however, is 10,000 ppm by volume, and a number of such magnitudes cannot be ignored by an engineer dealing with air pollution problems. This is now a key aspect of any engine design. Combustion is extremely complicated but is generally considered to be a free radical chain reaction. Several reasons exist to support the free radical mechanism: (1) Simple calculations of the heats of disassociation and formation for the molecules involved do not agree with the experimental values obtained for heats of combustion.", "(2) A great variety of end products may be found in the exhaust from a combustion reaction. Many complicated organic molecules have been identifed in the effuent from a system burning pure methane with pure oxygen. (3) Inhibitors, such as tetraethyl lead and methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), can greatly change the rate of reaction.d When visualizing a combustion process, it is useful to think of it in terms of the three Ts: time, temperature, and turbulence. Time for combustion to occur is necessary. A combustion process that is just initiated, and suddenly has its reactants discharged to a chilled environment, will not go to completion and will emit excessive pollutants. A high enough temperature must exist for the combustion reaction to be initiated. Combustion is an exothermic reaction (it gives off d MMT (CH3C5H4)Mn(CO)3 is an octane enhancer, which was approved as a fuel additive in the US. Some decades ago, the US EPA determined that MMT, added at 1/32 g per gallon of manganese (Mn), will not cause or contribute to regulated emissions failures of vehicles. Some have expressed concerns that the use of MMT may harm on-board diagnostic equipment (OBD) which monitors the performance of emissions control devices in the vehicle. Currently, the US EPA considers the data collected to be inconclusive with regard to OBD. After completing a 1994 risk evaluation on the use of MMT in gasoline, the US EPA was unable to determine if there is a risk to the public health from exposure to emissions of MMT gasoline. Like lead, manganese is also neurotoxic, so the US EPA has required the manufacturer perform testing to support a more defnitive risk evaluation, including health pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and one emission characterization. Completed fnal reports for all of these studies have been submitted to EPA. These fnal reports can be found in the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS) at www.regulations.gov identifed by docket number EPA-HQOAR-2004-0074. In addition to the already completed tests, the manufacturer is now in the process of developing physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for manganese which are being derived from data generated from the completed testing. The manufacturer anticipates that these PBPK models will be completed in 2008. The US EPA is presently reviewing exposure and risk information and may refne its risk evaluation or may ask for further testing based on the results of the submitted testing and resulting model now being developed, as well as any other available data.

AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS Ignition Fuel &#2; oxygen mixture \u0394H Heat of combustion Products of combustion Time heat), but it also requires energy to be initiated (see Figure 29.5). Turbulence is necessary to ensure that the reacting fuel and oxygen molecules in the combustion process are in intimate contact at the proper instant, when the temperature is high enough to cause the reaction to begin. The physical state of the fuel for a combustion process dictates the type of system to be used for burning. A fuel may be composed of volatile material, fxed carbon, or both. The volatile material burns as a gas and exhibits a visible fame, whereas the fxed carbon burns without a visible fame in a solid form. If a fuel is in the gaseous state, such as natural gas, it is very reactive and can be fred with a simple burner. If a fuel is in the liquid state, such as fuel oil, most of it must be vaporized to the gaseous state before combustion occurs. This vaporization can be accomplished by supplying heat from an outside source, but usually the liquid fuel is frst atomized and then the fnely divided fuel particles are sprayed into a hot combustion chamber to accomplish the gasifcation. With a solid fuel, such as coal or wood, a series of steps are involved in combustion. These steps occur in a defnite order, and the combustion device must be designed with these steps in mind. Figure 29.6 indicates what happens to a typical solid fuel during the combustion process. The cycle of operation of the combustion source affects air pollutant formation. A steady process, such as a large steam boiler, operates with a fairly uniform load and a continuous fuel fow. The effuent gases, along with any air pollutants, are discharged steadily and continually from the stack. An automobile engine, on the other hand, is a series of intermittent sources.", "The emissions from the automotive engine will be vastly different from those from the boiler in terms of both quantity and quality. A four-cylinder automotive engine operating at 2500 rpm has 5000 separate combustion processes started and completed each minute of its operation. Each of these lasts about 0.01 s from beginning to end. A comparison of typical emissions from various common combustion sources may be seen in Table 29.2. The emissions from combustion processes may be predicted to some extent if the variables of the processes are completely defned. Figure 29.7 indicates how the emissions from a combustion source would be expected to vary with the temperature of the reaction. No absolute values are shown, as these will vary greatly with fuel type, independent variables of the combustion process, etc. 29.3 STATIONARY EMISSION SOURCES Emissions from industrial processes are varied and often complex.4 These emissions can be controlled by applying the best available technology. The emissions may vary slightly from one facility to another, using apparently similar equipment and processes, but inspite Fuel Ash enters discharged Time FIGURE 29.6 Physical and chemical processes during solid fuel combustion.

It should not be necessary for plant Y to spend excessive amounts for research and development if plant X has a system that is operating satisfactorily. The solution to the problem is often to look for a similar industrial process, with similar emissions, and fnd the type of control system used. That said, good engineering must always consider the details in any design. Thus, even seemingly small differences between two similar processes (e.g. quantity, fow rates, holding times, materials, and reactor size and shape) can lead to dramatically different waste products, not to mention unforeseen safety and liability issues. Consequently, the following discussions are merely guidelines that must be adapted for each facility. 29.3.1 Chemical and Allied Products The emissions from a chemical process can be related to the specifc process. A plant manufacturing a resin might be expected to emit not only the resin being manufactured but also some of the raw material and some other products which may or may not resemble the resin. A plant manufacturing sulfuric acid can be expected to emit sulfuric acid fumes and SO2. A plant manufacturing soap products could be expected to emit a variety of odors. Depending on the process, the emissions could be any one or a combination of dust, aerosols, fumes, or gases. The emissions may or may not be odorous or toxic. Some of the primary emissions might be innocuous but later react in the atmosphere to form an undesirable secondary pollutant. A fowchart and material balance sheet for the particular process are very helpful in understanding and analyzing any process and its emissions.6 In any discussion of the importance of emissions from a particular process for an area, several factors must be consideredd(1) the percentage of the total emissions of the area that the particular process emits, (2) the degree of toxicity of the emissions, and (3) the obvious characteristics of the source (which can be related to either sight or smell). 29.3.2 Resins and Plastics Resins are solid or semisolid, water-insoluble,3 organic substances with little or no tendency to crystallize. They are the basic components of plastics and are V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS also used for coatings on paper, particleboard, and other surfaces that require a decorative, protective, or special-purpose fnish.", "The common characteristic of resins is that heat is used in their manufacture and application, and gases are exhausted from these processes. Some of the gases that are economically recoverable may be condensed, but a large portion is lost to the atmosphere. One operation, coating a porous paper with a resin to form battery separators, was emitting to the atmosphere about 85% of the resin purchased. This resin left the stacks of the plant as a blue haze, and the odor was routinely detected more than 2 km away. Since most resins and their by-products have low-odor thresholds, disagreeable odor is the most common complaint against any operation using them. 29.3.3 Varnish and Paints In the manufacture of varnish, heat is necessary for formulation and purifcation. The same may be true of operations preparing paints, shellac, inks, and other protective or decorative coatings. The compounds emitted to the atmosphere are gases, some with extremely low-odor thresholds. Acrolein, with an odor threshold of about 4000 mg 3, and reduced sulfur compounds, with odor thresholds of 2 mg 3, are both possible emissions from varnish cooking operations. The atmospheric emissions from varnish cooking appear to have little or no recovery value, whereas some of the solvents used in paint preparation are routinely condensed for recovery and returned to the process. If a paint fnish is baked to harden the surface by removal of organic solvents, the solvents must either be recovered, destroyed, or emitted to the atmosphere. The last course, emission to the atmosphere, is undesirable and may be prohibited by the air pollution control agency. However, the reactants and other materials used to produce or modify resins and plastics (e.g. polymers) may include chemicals with high aqueous solubility, such as the neurotoxic compound, acrylamide (650,000 mg l 1). This means that such ancillary chemicals can fnd their way to the air via water vapor or water flms on particles. They may also move to other environmental compartments (e.g. contaminating surface and ground water). 29.3.4 Acid Manufacture Acids are used as basic raw materials for many chemical processes and manufacturing operations. Figure 29.8 illustrates an acid plant with its fow diagram. Sulfuric acid is one of the major inorganic chemicals in modern industry. The atmospheric discharges from a sulfuric acid plant can be expected to contain gases including SO2 and aerosol mists, containing SO3 and H2SO4,in the submicron to 10-mm size range. The aerosol mists are particularly damaging to paint, vegetation, metal, and synthetic fbers. Other processes producing acids, such as nitric, acetic, and phosphoric acids, can be expected to produce acid mists from the processes themselves as well as various toxic and nontoxic gases. The particular process must be thoroughly studied to obtain a complete listing of all the specifc emissions. 29.3.5 Soaps and Detergents Soaps are made by reacting fats or oils with a base. Soaps are produced in a number of grades and types. They may be liquid, solid, granules, or powder. The air pollution problems of soap manufacture are primarily odors from the chemicals, greases, fats, and oils, although particulate emissions may occur during drying and handling operations. Detergents are manufactured from base stocks similar to those used in petroleum refneries, so the air pollution problems are similar to those of refneries. 29.3.6 Phosphate Fertilizers Phosphate fertilizers are prepared by benefciation of phosphate rock to remove its impurities, followed by drying and grinding. The PO4 in the rock may then be reacted with sulfuric acid to produce normal superphosphate fertilizer. Over 100 plants operating in the United States produce approximately a billion kilograms of phosphate fertilizer per year. Figure 29.9 is a fow diagram for a normal superphosphate plant which notes the pollutants emitted. The particulate and gaseous fuoride emissions cause greatest concern near phosphate fertilizer plants. Water Diluted acidAcid from fan and stack FIGURE 29.8 Flow diagram for a phosphoric acid plant. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.3 STATIONARY EMISSION SOURCES 29.3.7 Other Inorganic Chemicals Production of the large quantities of inorganic chemicals necessary for modern industrial processes can result in air pollutant emissions as undesirable byproducts. Table 29.3 lists some of the more common inorganic chemicals produced, along with the associated air pollutants potentially emitted from the specifc 7 process. 29.3.8 Petroleum and Coal Petroleum and coal are the principal fuels that supply the majority of the energy in all industrial countries.", "This fact gives an indication of the vast quantities of materials handled and also hints at the magnitude of the air pollution problems associated with obtaining the resource, transporting it, refning it, and transporting it again (see Chapter 5). The emission problems from burning fossil fuel have been previously discussed. TABLE 29.3 Miscellaneous Inorganic Chemicals and Associated Air Pollution Emissions Inorganic Chemical Produced Associated Air Pollution Emissions Calcium oxide (lime) Lime dust Sodium carbonate (soda ash) Ammoniadsoda ash dust Sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) Ammoniadcaustic dust and mist Ammonium nitrate Ammoniadnitric oxides Chlorine Chlorine gas, hydrochloric acid (HCI) Bromine Bromine gas and compounds, chlorine gas, radionuclides 29.3.8.1 Petroleum Petroleum products are obtained from crude oil. In the process of getting the crude oil from the ground to the refnery, many possibilities for emission of hydrocarbon and reduced sulfur gaseous emissions occur. In many cases, these operations take place in relatively remote regions and affect only those employed by the industry, so that little or no control is attempted. In the United States in 2011, petroleum refneries released 26 million kg of toxic pollutants, with 58% directly emitted from refnery stacks or indirectly as fugitive emissions.8 As shown in Figure 29.10,animproperly controlled petroleum refnery is a potential source of large tonnages of atmospheric emissions. All refneries are odorous, the degree being a matter of the housekeeping practices around the refnery. Since refneries are essentially closed processes, emissions are not normally considered a part of the operation. Refneries do need pressure relief systems and vents, and emissions from them are possible. Most refneries use very strict control measures for economic as well as regulatory reasons. The recovery of 1 or 2% of a refnery throughput which was previously lost to the atmosphere can easily pay for the cost of the control equipment. The expense of the catalyst charge in some crackers and regenerators requires that the best possible control equipment be used to prevent catalyst emissions to the atmosphere. Potential air pollutants from a petroleum refnery could include: (1) hydrocarbons from all systems, leaks, loading, and sampling; (2) sulfur oxides from boilers, treaters, and regenerators; (3) carbon monoxide from regenerators and incinerators; (4) nitrogen oxides from combustion sources and regenerators; (5) odors from air and steam blowing, condensers, drains, and vessels; and (6) particulate matter from boilers, crackers, regenerators, coking, and incinerators. Loading facilities must be designed to recover all vapors generated during flling of tank trucks or tanker V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS ships. Otherwise these vapors will be lost to the atmosphere. Since they may be both odorous and photochemically reactive, serious air pollution problems could result. The collected vapors must be returned to the process or disposed of by some means. An increasingly important concern is the likelihood of an uncontrolled fre caused by an accident or by a terrorist act at the refnery. This can be the source of large and highly toxic plumes. Thus, refneries need special measures for protection and security, coupled with vigorously diligent monitoring, operation, and maintenance. Every refnery also needs an up-to-date contingency plan. 29.3.8.2 Coal The air pollution problems associated with combustion of coal are of major concern. These problems generally occur away from the coal mine. The problems of atmospheric emissionsdue to mining,cleaning, handling, and transportation of coal from the mine to the user are of lesser signifcance as far as the overall air pollution problems are concerned. Whenever coal is handled, particulate emission becomes a problem. The emissions can be either coal dust or inorganic inclusions. Control of these emissions can be relatively expensive if the coal storage and transfer facilities are located near residential areas. This is particularly problematic in developing nations. For example, China\u2019s economic and industrial expansion over the past decade has been largely supported by coal combustion (about two-thirds of energy use). This leads to three types of problems: 1. Coal is among the worst fuels in terms of production of greenhouse gases, mainly CO2. 2. Coal often has high sulfur and ash content, so it is a major source of oxides of sulfur and particulate matter, respectively. 3. Coal contains heavy metals, particularly mercury, so it is also a major contributor to air toxics. 29.3.9 Primary Metals Industry Metallurgical equipment has long been an obvious source of air pollution. The effuents from metallurgical furnaces are submicron-size dusts and fumes and hence are highly visible. The emissions from associated coke ovens are not only visible but odorous as well.", "29.3.9.1 Ferrous Metals Iron and steel industries have been concerned with emissions from their furnaces and cupolas since the industry started. In recent decades, most of the companies controlling these operations have opened new, controlled plants to replace older, higher-emitting plants. Table 29.4 illustrates the changes in the steelmaking processes that have occurred in the United States. Air-polluting emissions from steelmaking furnaces include metal oxides, smoke, fumes, and dusts to make up the visible aerosol plume. They may also include gases, both organic and inorganic. If steel scrap is melted, the charge may contain appreciable amounts of oil, grease, and other combustibles that further add to the organic gas and smoke loadings.

Emissions from foundry cupolas are relatively small but still signifcant, in some areas. An uncontrolled 2-m cupola can be expected to emit up to 50 kg of dust, fumes, smoke, and oil vapor per hour. Carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and organic gases may also be expected. Control is possible, but the cost of the control may be prohibitive for the small foundry which only has one or two heats per week. Steel-making is commonly associated with coke ovens. Coke is coal that has undergone pyrolysis, i.e. heated up to 1000e1400 C in the absence of oxygen, so it is not burned. This process intentionally releases gaseous components of the coal to produce nearly pure carbon.9 Coke oven emissions are complex mixtures of gas, liquid, and solid phases, usually including a range of about 40 PAHs, as well as other PICs; notably formaldehyde, acrolein, aliphatic aldehydes, ammonia, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, phenol, cadmium, arsenic, and mercury. More than 60 organic compounds have been collected near coke plants. A metric ton of coal yields up to 635 kg of coke, up to 90 kg of coke breeze (large coke particulates), 7e9 kg of ammonium sulfate, 27.5e34 l of coke oven gas tar, 55e135 l of ammonia liquor, and 8e12.5 l of light oil. Up to 35% of the initial coal charge is emitted as gases and vapors. Most of these gases and vapors are collected during by-product coke production. Coke oven gas is comprised of hydrogen, methane, ethane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ethylene, propylene, butylene, acetylene, hydrogen sulfde, ammonia, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coke oven gas tar includes pyridine, tar acids, naphthalene, creosote oil, and coal-tar pitch. Benzene, xylene, toluene, and solvent naphthas may be extracted from the light oil fraction. Coke production in the US increased steadily between 1880 and the early 1950s, peaking at 65 million metric tons in 1951. In 1976, the United States was second in the world with 48 million metric tons of coke, i.e. 14.4% of the world production. By 1990, the US produced 24 million metric tons, falling to fourth in the world. A gradual decline in production has continued; production has decreased from 20 million metric tons in 1997 to 15.2 million metric tons in 2002. Demand for blast furnace coke also has declined in recent years because technological improvements have reduced the amount of coke consumed per amount of steel produced by as much as 25%. Obviously, the volatilized gases are air pollutants. In fact, coke ovens are the source of thousands of compounds, many that are toxic. Coke facilities have recognized that many of these gases are also economically valuable, so technologies exist and are being applied to recover, separate, and sell them for proft. Some of the processes shown in Table 29.4 no longer need coke to produce steel. This is an example of green engineering. 29.3.9.2 Nonferrous Metals Around the turn of the century, one of the most obvious effects of industry on the environment was the complete destruction of vegetation downwind from copper, lead, and zinc smelters. This problem was caused by the smelting of the metallic sulfde ores. As the metal was released in the smelting process, huge quantities of sulfur were oxidized to SO2, which was toxic to much of the vegetation fumigated by the plume.", "Present smelting systems go to great expense to prevent the uncontrolled release of SO2, but in many areas the recovery of the ecosystem will take years and possibly centuries. Early aluminum reduction plants were responsible for air pollution because of the fuoride emissions from their operations. Fluoride emissions can cause severe damage to vegetation and to animals feeding on such vegetation. The end result was an area surrounding the plant devoid of vegetation. Such scenes are reminiscent of those downwind from some of the uncontrolled copper smelters. New aluminum reduction plants are going to considerable expense to control fuoride emissions. Some of the older plants are fnding that the cost of control will exceed the original capital investment in the entire facility. Where the problem is serious, control agencies have developed extensive sampling networks to monitor emissions from the plant of concern. Emissions from other nonferrous metal facilities are primarily metal fumes or metal oxides of extremely small diameter. Zinc oxide fumes vary from 0.03 to 0.3 mm and are toxic. Lead and lead oxide fumes are extremely toxic and have been extensively studied. Arsenic, cadmium, bismuth, and other trace metals can be emitted from many metallurgical processes. 29.3.10 Stone and Clay Products The industries which produce and handle various stone products emit considerable amounts of particulate matter at every stage of the operation. These particulates may include fne mineral dusts of a size to cause damage to the lungs. Depending on the type of rock, mineral fbers can also be released, notably asbestos. The threshold values for such dusts have been set quite low to prevent disabling diseases for the worker, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, pleural diseases, asbestosis, and silicosis. In the production of clay, talc, cement, chalk, etc., an emission of particulate matter will usually accompany each process. These processes may involve grinding, drying, and sieving, which can be enclosed and controlled to prevent the emission of particles. In V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS many cases, the recovered particles can be returned to the process for a net economic gain. During the manufacture of glass, considerable dust, with particles averaging about 300 mm in size, will be emitted. Some dusts may also be emitted from the handling of the raw materials involved. Control of this dust to prevent a nuisance problem outside the plant is a necessity. When glass is blown or formed into the fnished product, smoke and gases can be released from the contact of the molten glass with lubricated molds. These emissions are quite dense but of a relatively short duration. 29.3.11 Forest Products Industry 29.3.11.1 Wood Processing Trees are classifed as a renewable resource which is being utilized in most portions of the world on a sustained yield basis. A properly managed forest will produce wood for lumber, fber, and chemicals indefnitely. Harvesting this resource can generate considerable dust and other particulates. Transportation over unpaved roads causes excessive dust generation. The cultural practice of burning the residue left after a timber harvest, called slash burning, is still practiced in some areas and is a major source of smoke, gaseous, and particulate air pollution in the localities downwind from the fre (see Figure 29.11). Visibility reduction from such burning can be a serious problem. Processing the harvested timber into the fnished product may involve sawing, peeling, planing, sanding, and drying operations, which can release considerable amounts of wood fber and lesser amounts of gaseous material to the atmosphere. Control of wood fber emissions from the pneumatic transport and storage systems can be a major problem of considerable expense for a plywood mill or a particleboard plant. 29.3.11.2 Pulp and Paper Pulp and paper manufacture is increasing in the world at an exponential rate. The demand for paper will continue as new uses are found for this product. Since most paper is manufactured from wood or wood residue, it provides an excellent use for this renewable resource. The most widely used pulping process is the kraft process, as shown in Figure 29.12, which results in recovery and regeneration of the chemicals. This occurs in the recovery furnace, which operates with both oxidizing and reducing zones. Emissions from such recovery furnaces include particulate matter, very odorous reduced sulfur compounds, and oxides of sulfur. Bleaching has been a substantial source of dioxins, but many processors have now modifed their operations to use substantially less chlorine, greatly reducing the dioxin FIGURE 29.11 Plume from slash burning in the Amazon region of South America.", "From the rainforests around the Amazon River (top) in Brazil, through the central highlands and into Bolivia to the southwest, numerous fres (highlighted in red) were burning throughout the region on September 8, 2002. The fres were detected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA\u2019s Terra satellite, and their locations are marked with red dots in this true-color image. Thick smoke and clouds are shrouding the highlands in the southern portion of the image.

If extensive and expensive control is not exercised over the kraft pulp process, the odors and aerosol emissions will affect a wide area. Odor complaints have been reported over 100 km away from these plants. A properly controlled and operated kraft plant will handle huge amounts of material and produce millions of kilograms of fnished products per day, with little or no complaint regarding odor or particulate emissions. 29.3.12 Noxious Trades As the name implies, these operations, if uncontrolled, can cause a serious air pollution problem. The main problem is the odors associated with the process. Examples of such industries are tanning works, confned animal feeding operations (CAFOs), rendering plants, and many of the food processing plants such as fsh meal plants. In most cases, the emissions of particulates and gases from such plants are not of concern, only the odors. However, other air pollutants are also common (e.g. chromium in tanning and nitric oxide (NO) near V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.4 AIR EMISSIONS FROM HAZARDOUS WASTES CAFOs). Requiring these industries to locate away from the business or residential areas is no longer acceptable as a means of control. 29.4 AIR EMISSIONS FROM HAZARDOUS WASTES 29.4.1 Air Quality and Hazardous Wastes In Chapter 32, we generally address air pollution as a byproduct of another process, such as manufacturing. Air pollution controls are also a necessary component of directly treating other forms of wastes. The goal is to treat the waste to reduce the toxicity, to decrease exposures and, ultimately, to eliminate or at least properly the risks from hazardous substances in the waste. The type of technology applied depends on the intrinsic characteristics of the contaminants and on the substrate in which they reside. The choice must factor in all of the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the contaminant with respect to the matrices and substrates (if soil and sediment) or fuids (air, water, or other solvents) where the contaminants are found. Chapter 32 provides the basics of most air pollution control technologies, but when addressing particularly hazardous air pollutants, a number of additional factors must be considered. The selected approach must meet criteria for treatability (i.e. the effciency and effectiveness of a technique in reducing the mobility and toxicity of a waste). The comprehensive remedy must consider the effects of each action taken will have on past and proceeding steps. Eliminating or reducing pollutant concentrations in a waste stream begins with assessing the physical and chemical characteristics of each contaminant, and matching these characteristics with the appropriate treatment technology. All of the kinetics and equilibria, such as solubility, fugacity, sorption, and bioaccumulation factors, will determine the effectiveness of destruction, transformation, removal, immobilization of these contaminants. For example, Table 29.5 ranks the effectiveness of selected treatment technologies on organic and inorganic contaminants typically found in contaminated slurries, soils, sludges, and sediments. As shown, there can be synergies (e.g. innovative incineration approaches are available that not only effectively destroy organic contaminants, but in the process also destroys the inorganic cyanic compounds). Unfortunately, there are also antagonisms among certain approaches, such as the very effective incineration processes for organic contaminants that transform heavy metal species into more toxic and more mobile forms. The increased pressures and temperatures are good for breaking apart organic molecules and removing functional groups that lend them toxicity, but these same processes oxidize or in other ways transform the metals into more toxic or more bioavailable forms. So, when mixtures of organic and inorganic contaminants are targeted, more than one technology may be required to accomplish project objectives, and care must be taken not to make trade one problem (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs) for another (e.g. more mobile species of cadmium).", "The characteristics of the substrate (e.g. solid waste, soil, sediment, or water) will affect the performance of any contaminant treatment or control. For example, sediment, sludge, slurries, and soil characteristics that will infuence the effcacy of treatment technologies include particle size, solids content, and high contaminant concentration (see Table 29.6). Particle size may be the most important limiting characteristic for application of treatment technologies to sediments. Most treatment technologies work well on sandy soils and sediments. The presence of fne-grained material adversely affects treatment system emission controls because it increases particulate generation during thermal drying, it is more diffcult to dewater, and it has greater attraction to the contaminants (particularly clays). Clayey sediments that are cohesive also present materials handling problems in most processing systems. Solids content generally ranges from high (i.e. usually the in situ solids content (30e60% solids by weight)) to low (e.g. hydraulically V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS V.

Source: Ref. 10. dredged sediments (10e30% solids by weight)). Treatment of slurries is better at lower solids contents; but this can be achieved even for high solids contents by water addition at the time of processing. It is more diffcult to change from a lower to a higher solids content, but evaporative and dewater approaches, such as those used for municipal sludges, may be employed. Also, thermal and dehalogenation processes are decreasingly effcient as solids content is reduced. More water means increased chemical costs and increased need for wastewater treatment.", "Elevated levels of organic compounds or heavy metals in high concentrations must also be considered. Higher total organic carbon (TOC) content favors incineration and oxidation processes. The TOC can be the contaminant of concern or any organic, since they are combustibles with caloric value. Conversely, higher metal concentrations may make a technology less favorable by increasing contaminant mobility of certain metal species following application of the technology. A number of other factors may affect selection of a treatment technology other than its effectiveness for treatment (some are listed in Table 29.7). For example, vitrifcation and supercritical water oxidation have only been used for relatively small projects and would require more of a proven track record before implementing them for full-scale sediment projects. Regulatory compliance and community perception are always a part of decisions regarding an incineration system. Land use considerations, including the amount of acreage needs, are commonly confronted in solidifcation and solid-phase bioremediation projects (as they are in sludge farming and land application). Disposing of ash and other residues following treatment must be part of any process. Treating water effuent and air emissions must be part of the decontamination decision-making process.10 29.4.2 Pre-control Considerations 29.4.2.1 Estimating Contaminant Migration Estimating potential contaminant releases (i.e. \u201closses\u201d as defned by environmental regulators) from various combinations of treatment technologies is diffcult due to the variability of chemical and physical characteristics of contaminated media (especially soils and sediments), the strong affnity of most contaminants for fne-grained sediment particles, and the limited track record or \u201cscale-up\u201d studies for many treatment technologies. Off-the-shelf models can be used for simple process operations, such as extraction or thermal vaporization applied to single contaminants in relatively pure systems.

Treatability studies may be performed at the bench-scale (in the laboratory) or at pilot-scale level (e.g. a real-world study, but limited in number of contaminants, in spatial extent, or to a specifc, highly controlled form of a contaminant, e.g. one pure congener of PCBs, rather than the common mixtures). Most treatment technologies include post-treatment or controls for waste streams produced by the processing. The contaminant losses can be defned as the residual contaminant concentrations in the liquid or gaseous streams released to the environment. For technologies that extract or separate the contaminants from the bulk of the sediment, a concentrated waste stream may be produced that requires treatment offsite at a hazardous waste treatment facility, where permit requirements may require destruction and removal effciencies greater than 99.9999% (i.e. the so-called rule of \u201csix nines\u201d). The other source of loss for treatment technologies is the residual contamination in the sediment after treatment.", "After disposal, treated wastes are subject to leaching, volatilization, and losses by other pathways. The signifcance of these pathways depends on the type and level of contamination that is not removed or treated by the treatment process. Various waste streams for each type of technology that should be considered in treatability evaluations are listed in Table 29.8. 29.4.3 Contaminant Treatment and Control Approachesa The life cycle viewpoint is instructive in controlling hazardous air pollutants. Five steps in sequence defne an event that results in environmental contamination of the air, water, or soil pollution. These steps individually and collectively offer opportunities to intervene and to control the risks associated with hazards and thus protect public health and the environment. The steps address the presence of waste at fve points in the life cycle:10 As a frst step, the contaminant source must be identifable. A hazardous substance must be released from a The principal sources for this section are collaborations with two prominent environmental engineers, Ross E. McKinney and J. Jeffrey Peirce. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS the source, be transported through the air, water, or soil environment, reach a human, animal, or plant receptor in a measurable dose, and the receptor must have a quantifable detrimental response in the form of death or illness. Intervention can occur at any one of these steps to control the risks to public health and to the environment. Of course, any intervention scheme and subsequent control by the engineer must be justifed by the environmental engineer as well as the public or private client in terms of scientifc evidence, sound engineering design, technological practicality, economic realities, ethical considerations, and the laws of local, state, and national governments. 29.4.3.1 Intervention at the Source of Contamination A contaminant must be identifable, either in the form of an industrial facility that generates waste byproducts, a hazardous waste processing facility, a surface or subsurface land storage/disposal facility, or an accidental spill into a water, air, or soil receiving location. The intervention must minimize or eliminate the risks to public health and the environment by utilizing technologies at this source that are economically acceptable and based on applicable scientifc principles and sound engineering designs. In the case of an industrial facility producing hazardous waste as a necessary byproduct of a proftable item, as considered here for example, the engineer can take advantage of the growing body of knowledge that has become known as life cycle analysis.10 In the case of a hazardous waste storage facility or a spill, the engineer must take the source as a given and search for possibilities for intervention at a later step in the sequence of steps as discussed below. Under the life cycle analysis method of intervention, the environmental manager considers the environmental impacts that could incur during the entire life cycle of (1) all of the resources that go into the product; (2) all the materials that are in the product during its use; and (3) all the materials that are available to exit from the product once it or its storage containers are no longer economically useful to society. Few simple examples exist that describe how life cycle analysis is conducted but consider for now any one of a number of household cleaning products. Consider that a particular cleaning product, a solvent of some sort, must be fabricated from one of several basic natural resources. Assume for now that this cleaning product currently is petroleum based. The engineer could intervene at this initial step in the life cycle of this product, as the natural resource is being selected, and consequently the engineer could preclude the formation of a source of hazardous waste by suggesting instead the production of a water-based solvent. Similarly, intervention at the production phase of this product\u2019s life cycle and suggested fabrication techniques can preclude the formation of a source of certain contaminants from the outset. In this case the recycling of spent petroleum materials could provide for more household cleaning products with less or zero hazardous waste generation, thus controlling the risks to public health and the environment. Another example is that of \u201cco-generation\u201d, which may allow for two manufacturing facilities to co-locate so that the \u201cwaste\u201d of one is a \u201cresource\u201d for the other.", "An example is the location of a chemical plant near a power generation facility, so that the excess steam generated by the power plant can be piped to the nearby chemical plant, obviating the need to burn its own fuel to generate the steam needed for chemical synthesis. Another example is the use of an alcohol waste from one plant as a source for chemical processes to another. As discussed in Chapter 30, the product under consideration must be considered long before any switches are fipped and valves turned. For example, a particular household cleaning product may result in unintended human exposure to buckets of solvent mixtures that fumigate the air in a home\u2019s kitchen or pollute the town\u2019s sewers as the bucket\u2019s liquid is fushed down a drain. In this way, life cycle analysis is type of systems engineering where a critical path is drawn, and each decision point considered. Under the plan, the disposal of this solvent\u2019s containers must be considered from a long-term risk perspective. The challenge is that every potential and actual environmental impact of a product\u2019s fabrication, use, and ultimate disposal must be considered. This is seldom, if ever, a \u201cstraight line projection\u201d. 29.4.3.2 Intervention at the Point of Release Once a contaminant source has been identifed, the next step is to intervene at the point at which the waste is released into the environment. This point of release could be at the top of a stack or vent from the source of pollution to a receiving air shed, or it could be a more indirect release, such as from the bottom-most layer of a clay liner in a hazardous waste landfll connected to surrounding soil material. Similarly this point of release could be a series of points as a contaminant is released along a shoreline from a plot of land into the air, from an evaporation pond, from a landfll, near a river or through a plane of soil underlying a storage facility (i.e. a so-called \u201cnon-point source\u201d). 29.4.3.3 Intervention as the Contaminant Is Transported in the Environment Wise site selection of facilities that generate, process, and store contaminants is the frst step in preventing or reducing the likelihood that they will move. For V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.4 AIR EMISSIONS FROM HAZARDOUS WASTES example, the distance from a source to a receptor is a crucial factor in controlling the quantity and characteristics of waste as it is transported. Meteorology is a primary determinant of the opportunities to control the atmospheric transport of contaminants. For example, manufacturing, transportation, and hazardous waste generating, processing, and storage facilities must be sited to avoid areas where specifc local weather patterns are frequent and persistent. These avoidance areas include ground-based inversions, elevated inversions, valley winds, shore breezes, and city heat islands. In each of these venues, the pollutants become locked into air masses with little of no chance of moving out of the respective areas. Thus the concentrations of the pollutants can quickly and greatly pose risks to public health and the environment. In the soil environment the engineer has the opportunity to site facilities in areas of great depth-to-groundwater, as well as in soils (e.g. clays) with very slow rates of transport. In this way, engineers and scientists must work closely with city and regional planners in early in the site selection phases.b 29.4.3.4 Intervention to Control the Exposure As mentioned in Chapter 1, the receptor of contamination can be a human, other fauna in the general scheme of living organisms, fora, or materials or constructed facilities. In the case of humans, as we discussed previously, the contaminant can be ingested, inhaled, or dermally contacted. Such exposure can be direct with human contact to, for example, particles of lead that are present in inhaled indoor air. An exposure also can be indirect as in the case of human ingestion of the cadmium and other heavy metals found in the livers exposure to air pollutants, from the \u201cgreening\u201d of statutes through the de-zinc process associated with low pH rain events to the crumbling of stone bridges found in nature. Isolating potential receptors from exposure to hazardous air pollutants, the engineer has an opportunity to control the risks to those receptors. The opportunities to control exposures to contaminants are directly associated with the ability to control the amount of hazardous pollutants delivered to the receptor through source control and siting of control systems and hazardous waste management facilities.", "One solution to environmental contamination could be to increase their dilution in the air, water, or soil environments. We will discuss specifc examples of this type of intervention later in this chapter. 29.4.3.5 Intervention at the Point of Response Opportunities for intervention are grounded in basic scientifc principles, engineering designs and processes, and applications of proven and developing technologies to control the risks associated with contaminants. Let us consider thermal processing as a class of hazardous control technology that is widely used in treating wastes, but which has a crucial air pollution component. 29.4.4 Thermal Treatment Processes 29.4.4.1 Thermodynamics and Stoichiometry Contaminants, if completely organic in structure, are, in theory, completely destructible using principles based in thermodynamics with the engineering inputs and outputs summarized as: Hydrocarbons D O2\u00f0 D energy?\u00de / CO2 D H2O\u00f0 D energy?\u00de (29.5) of beef cattle that were raised on grasses receiving nutrition from cadmium-laced municipal wastewater treatment biosolids (commonly known as \u201csludge\u201d). Heavy metals or chlorinated hydrocarbons similarly can be delivered to domestic animals and animals in the wild. Construction materials are also sensitive to Contaminants are mixed with oxygen, sometimes in the presence of an external energy source, and in fractions of seconds or several seconds the byproducts of gaseous carbon dioxide and water are produced to exit the top of the reaction vessel while a solid ash is produced to exit the bottom of the reaction vessel.c b This goes beyond zoning. Obviously, the engineer should be certain that the planned facility adheres to the zoning ordinances, land use plans, and maps of the state and local agencies. However, it behooves all of the professionals to collaborate, hopefully before any land is purchased and contractors are retained. Councils of Government (COG) and other \u201cA-95\u201d organizations can be rich resources when considering options on siting. They can help avoid the need for problems long before implementation, to say nothing of contentious zoning appeal and planning commission meetings and perception problems at public hearings. c Numerous textbooks address the topic of incineration in general and hazardous waste incineration in particular. For example, see Refs 29e32. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS 3K Energy may also be produced during the reaction and the heat may be recovered. A derivative problem in this simple reaction could be global warming associated with the carbon dioxide. Conversely, if the contaminant of concern to the engineer contains other chemical constituents, in particular chlorine and/or heavy metals, the original simple input and output relationship is modifed to a very complex situation: and microbiological characteristics of the waste also over the planning period of the project. The space required for the incinerator itself ranges from several square yards to possibly on the back of a fat bed truck to several acres to sustain a regional incinerator system. Laboratory testing and pilot studies matching a given waste to a given incinerator must be conducted prior to the design, citing, and construction of each incinerator. Generally, the same reaction applies to Hydrocarbons D O2\u00f0D energy?\u00de D Cl or heavymetal\u00f0s\u00de D H2O D inorganic salts D nitrogen compounds D sulfur compounds D phosphorus compounds / CO2 (29.6) D H2O\u00f0D energy?\u00de D chlorinated hydrocarbons or heavy metal\u00f0s\u00de inorganic salts D nitrogen compounds D sulfur compounds D phosphorus compounds With these contaminants the potential exists for destruction of the initial contaminant, but actually exacerbating the problem by generating more hazardous off-gases containing chlorinated hydrocarbons and/or ashes containing heavy metals are produced (e.g. the improper incineration of certain chlorinated hydrocarbons can lead to the formation of the highly toxic chlorinated dioxins, furans, and hexachlorobenzene). All of the thermal systems discussed below have common attributes. All require the balancing of the three \u201cT\u2019s\u201d of the science, engineering, and technology of incineration of any substance: 1. Time of incineration 2. Temperature of incineration 3.", "Turbulence in the combustion chamber The advantages of thermal systems include: (1) the potential for energy recovery; (2) volume reduction of the contaminant; (3) detoxifcation as selected molecules are reformulated; (4) the basic scientifc principles, engineering designs, and technologies are well understood from a wide range of other applications including electric generation and municipal solid waste incineration; (5) application to most organic contaminants which compose a large percentage of the total contaminants generated worldwide; (6) the possibility to scale the technologies to handle a single gallon per pound (liter per kilogram) of waste or millions of gallon per pound (liter per kilogram) of waste; and (7) land areas that are small compared to many other facilities (e.g. landflls). Each system design must be customized to address the specifc contaminants under consideration, including the quantity of waste to be processed over the planning period as well as the physical, chemical, most thermal processes, i.e. gasifcation, pyrolysis, hydrolysis, and combustion11,12: C20H32O10 \u00fe x1O2 \u00fe x2H2O / y1C \u00fe y2CO2 \u00fe y3CO D \u00fe y4H2 \u00fe y5CH4 \u00fe y6H2O \u00fe y7CnHm (29.7) The coeffcients x and y balance the compounds on either side of the equation. The delta under the arrow indicates heating. In many thermal reactions, CnHm includes the alkanes, C2H2,C2H4,C2H6,C3H8,C4H10, C5H12, and benzene, C6H6. The actual reactions from test burns for commonly incinerated compounds are provided in Table 10.1. Of all of the thermal processes, incineration is the most common process for destroying organic contaminants in industrial wastes. Incineration simply is heating wastes in the presence of oxygen to oxidize organic compounds (both toxic and non-toxic). The principal incineration steps are shown in Figure 29.13. 29.4.4.2 Applying Thermal Processes for Treatment A word of warning when choosing incineration as the recommended technology: The mere mention of \u201cincineration\u201d evokes controversy in communities. There have been real and perceived failures. It is also important to note that incineration alone does not \u201cdestroy\u201d heavy metals; it simply changes the valence of the metal. In fact, incineration can increase the leachability of metals via oxidation, although processes like slagging (operating at suffciently high temperatures to melt and remove incombustible materials) or vitrifcation (producing V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.4 AIR EMISSIONS FROM HAZARDOUS WASTES Treated solids Solids Water non-leachable, basalt-like residue) actually reduce the mobility of many metals. Leachability is a measure of the ease with which compounds in the waste can move into the accessible environment. The increased leachability of metals would be problematic if the ash and other residues are to be buried in landflls or stored in piles. The leachability of metals is generally measured using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) test, discussed earlier. Incinerator ash that fails the TCLP must be disposed of in a waste facility approved for hazardous wastes. Enhanced leachability would be advantageous only if the residues are engineered to undergo an additional treatment step of metals. Again, the engineer must see incineration of but one component within a systematic approach for any contaminant treatment process. There are a number of places in the incineration fow of the contaminant through the incineration process where new compounds may need to be addressed. As mentioned, ash and other residues may contain high levels of metals, at least higher than the original feed. The fue gases are likely to include both organic and inorganic compounds that have been released as a result of temperature induced volatilization and/or newly transformed PICs with higher vapor pressures than the original contaminants. The disadvantages of hazardous waste incinerators include: (1) the equipment is capital intensive, particularly the refractory material lining the inside walls of each combustion chamber that must be replaced as cracks form whenever a combustion system is cooled and/or heated; (2) the operation of the equipment requires very skilled operators and is more costly when fuel must be added to the system; (3) ultimate disposal of the ash is necessary and particularly troublesome and costly if heavy metals and/or chlorinated compounds are found during the expensive monitoring activities; and (4) air emissions may be hazardous and thus must be monitored for chemical constituents and controlled. Given these underlying principles of incineration, seven general guidelines emerge: 1. Only liquid purely organic contaminants are true candidates for combustion. 2.", "Chlorine-containing organic materials deserve special consideration if in fact they are to be incinerated at all; special materials used in the construction of the incinerator, long (many seconds) of combustion time, high temperatures (>1600 C), with continuous mixing if the contaminant is in the solid or sludge form. 3. Feedstock containing heavy metals generally should not be incinerated. 4. Sulfur-containing organic material will emit sulfur oxides which must be controlled. 5. The formation of nitrogen oxides can be minimized if the combustion chamber is maintained above 1100 C. 6. Destruction depends on the interaction of a combustion chamber\u2019s temperature, dwell time, and turbulence. 7. Off-gases and ash must be monitored for chemical constituents, each residual must be treated as appropriate so the entire combustion system operates within the requirements of the local, state, and federal environmental regulators, and hazardous components of the off-gases, off-gas treatment processes, and the ash must reach ultimate disposal in a permitted facility. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS Atmosphere StackDemister ID fan Carbon bed adsorbor 29.4.5 Thermal Destruction Systems The types of thermal systems vary considerably. Five general categories are available to destroy contaminants: (1) rotary kiln; (2) multiple hearth; (3) liquid injection; (4) fuidized bed; and (5) multiple chamber. 29.4.5.1 Rotary Kiln The combustion chamber in a rotary kiln incinerator as illustrated in Figure 29.14 is a heated rotating cylinder that is mounted at an angle with possible baffes added to the inner face to provide the turbulence necessary for the target three \u201cT\u2019s\u201d for the contaminant destruction process to take place. Engineering design decisions, based on the results of laboratory testing of a specifc contaminant, include: (1) angle of the drum; (2) diameter and length of the drum; (3) presence and location of the baffes; (4) rotational speed of the drum; and (5) use of added fuel to increase the temperature of the combustion chamber as the specifc contaminant requires. The liquid, sludge, or solid hazardous waste is input into the upper end of the rotating cylinder, rotates with the cylinder-baffe system, and falls with gravity to the lower end of the cylinder. The heated upward moving off-gases are collected, monitored for chemical constituents, and subsequently treated as appropriate prior to release, while the ash falls with gravity to be collected, monitored for chemical constituents, and also treated as needed before ultimate disposal. The newer rotary kiln systems4 consist of a primary combustion chamber, a transition volume, and a fred afterburner chamber. After exiting the afterburner, the fue gas is passed through a quench section followed by a primary air Redundant air pollution control system pollution control system (APCS). The primary APCS can be a venture scrubber followed by a packed-column scrubber. Downstream of the primary APCS, a backup secondary APCS, with a demister, an activated carbon adsorber, and a high-effciency particulate air (HEPA) flter can collect contaminants not destroyed by the incineration. The rotary kiln is applicable to the incineration of most organic contaminants, it is well suited for solids and sludges, and in special cases liquids and gases can be injected through auxiliary nozzles in the side of the combustion chamber. Operating temperatures generally vary from 800 to 1650 C. Engineers use laboratory experiments to design residence times of seconds for gases and minutes or possibly hours for the incineration of solid material. 29.4.5.2 Multiple Hearth In the multiple hearth illustrated in Figure 29.15 generally contaminants in solid or sludge form are fed slowly through the top vertically stacked hearth; in special confgurations hazardous gases and liquids can be injected through side nozzles. Multiple hearth incinerators, historically developed to burn municipal wastewater treatment biosolids, rely on gravity and scrapers working in the upper edges of each hearth to transport the waste through holes from upper hotter hearths to lower cooler hearths. Heated upward moving off-gases are collected, monitored for chemical constituents, and treated as appropriate prior to release; the falling ash is collected, monitored for chemical constituents, and subsequently treated prior to ultimate disposal. Most organic wastes generally can be incinerated using a multiple hearth confguration. Operating V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.4 AIR EMISSIONS FROM HAZARDOUS WASTES temperatures generally vary from 300 to 980 C. These systems are designed with residence times of seconds if gases are fed into the chambers to several hours if solid materials are placed on the top hearth and allowed to eventually drop to the bottom hearth exiting as ash.", "29.4.5.3 Liquid Injection Vertical or horizontal nozzles spray liquid hazardous wastes into liquid injection incinerators specially designed for the task or as a retroft to one of the other incinerators discussed here. The wastes are atomized through the nozzles that match the waste being handled with the combustion chamber as determined in laboratory testing. The application obviously is limited to liquids that do not clog these nozzles, though some Burners Supplemental fuel Combustion air Shaft cooling air return Solids flow Drop holes success has been experienced with hazardous waste slurries. Operating temperatures generally vary from 650 to 1650 C (1200e3000 F). Liquid injection systems (Figure 29.16) are designed with residence times of fractions of seconds as off-gases, the upward moving off-gases are collected, monitored for chemical constituents, and treated as appropriate prior to release to the lower troposphere. 29.4.5.4 Fluidized Bed Contaminated feedstock is injected under pressure into a heated bed of agitated inert granular particles, usually sand, as the heat is transferred from the particles to the waste, and the combustion process proceeds as summarized in Figure 29.17. External heat is applied V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS Discharge 120\u2013250% to quench or Aqueous waste Steam Auxiliary fuel Liquid waste Atomizing steam or air Mean combustion gas residence time Coal Water to the particle bed prior to the injection of the waste and continually is applied throughout the combustion operation as the situation dictates. Heated air is forced into the bottom of the particle bed and the particles become suspended among themselves during this continuous fuidizing process. The openings created within the bed permit the introduction and transport of the waste into and through the bed. The process enables the contaminant to come into contact with particles that maintain their heat better than, for example, the gases inside a rotary kiln. The heat maintained in the particles increases the time the contaminant is in contact with a heated element and thus the combustion process could become more complete with fewer harmful byproducts. Off-gases are collected, monitored for chemical constituents, and treated as appropriate prior to release, and the falling ash is collected, monitored for chemical constituents, and subsequently treated prior to ultimate disposal. Most organic wastes can be incinerated in a fuidized bed, while the system is best suited for liquids. Operating temperatures generally vary from 750 to 900 C. Liquid injection systems are designed with residence times of fractions of seconds as off-gases, the upward moving off-gases are collected, monitored for chemical constituents, and treated as appropriate prior to release to the lower troposphere. 29.4.5.5 Multiple Chamber Contaminants are turned to a gaseous form on a grate in the ignition chamber of a multiple chamber system. The gases created in this ignition chamber travel through baffes to a secondary chamber where the actual combustion process takes place. Often the secondary V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.4 AIR EMISSIONS FROM HAZARDOUS WASTES chamber is located above the ignition chamber to promote natural advection of the hot gases through the system. Heat may be added to the system in either the ignition chamber or the secondary chamber as required for specifc burns. The application of multiple chamber incinerators generally is limited to solid wastes with the waste entering the ignition chamber through an opened charging door in batch, not continuous, loading. Combustion temperatures typically hover near 540 C for most applications. These systems are designed with residence times of minutes to hours for solid hazardous wastes as off-gases are collected, monitored for chemical constituents, and treated as appropriate prior to release to the lower troposphere. At the end of each burn period the system must be cooled so that the ash can be removed prior to monitoring for chemical constituents and subsequent treatment prior to ultimate disposal. 29.4.6 Destruction Removal 29.4.6.1 Calculating Destruction Removal Federal hazardous waste incineration standards require that hazardous organic compounds meet certain destruction effciencies. These standards require that any hazardous waste undergo 99.99% destruction of all hazardous wastes and 99.9999% destruction of extremely hazardous wastes like dioxins. Recall that destruction removal effciency (DRE) is calculated as: Win Wout DRE \u00bc 100 (29.8)Win where, Win is the rate of mass of waste fowing into the incinerator and Wout is the rate of mass of waste fowing out of the incinerator.", "For example, let us calculate the DRE if during a stack test, the mass of pentachlorodioxin is loaded into incinerator at the rate of 10 mg min 1 and the mass fow rate of the compound measured downstream in the stack is 200 pg min 1. Is the incinerator up to code for the thermal destruction of this dioxin? Win Wout DRE \u00bc 100 Win 11 10 mg min 200 pg min \u00bc 100 1 10 mg min Since 1 pg \u00bc 10 12gand 1mg \u00bc 10 3,then1pg \u00bc 10 9mg. So 11 10 mg min 200 10 9mg min 100 1 10 mg min \u00bc 999; 999:98% removal Even if pentachlorodioxin is considered to be \u201cextremely hazardous\u201d, this is better than the \u201crule of six nines\u201d so the incinerator is operating up to code. If we were to calculate the DRE during the same stack test for the mass of tetrachloromethane (CCl4) loaded into incinerator at the rate of 100 l min 1 and the mass fow rate of the compound measured downstream is 1 ml min 1. Is the incinerator up to code for CCl4? This is a lower removal rate since 100 l are in and 0.001 are leaving, so the DRE \u00bc 99.999. This is acceptable, i.e. better removal effciency than 99.99% by an order of magnitude, so long as CCl4 is not considered an extremely hazardous compound. If it were, then it would have to meet the rule of six nines (it only has fve). By the way, both of these compounds are chlorinated. As mentioned, special precautions must be taken when dealing with such halogenated compounds, since even more toxic compounds that those being treated can end up being generated. Incomplete reactions are very important sources of environmental contaminants. For example, these reactions generate PICs, such as dioxins, furans, carbon monoxide (CO), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and hexachlorobenzene. Thus, the formation of unintended byproducts is always a possibility with thermal systems. An extensive discussion can be found in Chapter 7, for example, on the various processes that can lead to the formation of dioxins and furans. In particular, see the thermal relationships in Table 7.5 and Figure 7.6. 29.4.7 Other Thermal Processes 29.4.7.1 Processes Other than Incineration Incineration is frequently used to decontaminate soils with elevated concentrations of organic hazardous constituents. High-temperature incineration, however, may not be needed to treat soils contaminated with most volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Also, in waste feeds with heavy metals, high temperature incineration will likely increase the volatilization of some of these metals into the combustion fue gas (see Tables 29.9 and 29.10). High concentrations of volatile trace metal compounds in the fue gas pose increased challenges to air pollution control. Thus, other thermal processes, i.e. thermal desorption and pyrolysis, can provide an effective alternative to incineration. When successful in decontaminating soils to the necessary treatment levels, thermally desorbing contaminants from soils have the additional benefts of lower fuel consumption, no formation of slag, less volatilization of metal compounds, and less complicated air pollution control demands. So, beyond monetary costs and ease of operation, a less energy (heat) intensive system can be more advantageous in terms of actual pollutant removal effciency. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.

Partitioning for liquids is estimated at 100% for all metals. The combustion gas temperature is expected to be 100e1000 F higher than the solids temperature. Source: Ref. 32. 29.4.7.2 Pyrolysis Pyrolysis is the process of chemical decomposition induced in organic materials by heat in the absence of oxygen. It is practicably impossible to achieve a completely oxygen-free atmosphere, so pyrolytic systems run with less stoichiometric quantities of oxygen. Because some oxygen will be present in any pyrolytic TABLE 29.10 Metal and Metalloid Volatilization Temperatures system, there will always be a small amount of oxidation. Also, desorption will occur when volatile or semi-volatile compounds are present in the feed.", "During pyrolysis5 organic compounds are converted to gaseous components, along with some liquids, as coke, i.e. the solid residue of fxed carbon and ash. CO, H2,CH4, and other hydrocarbons are produced. If these gases cool and condense, liquids will form and leave oily tar residues and water with high concentrations of TOC. Pyrolysis generally takes place well above atmospheric pressure at temperatures exceeding 430 C. The secondary gases need their own treatment, such as by a secondary combustion chamber, by faring, and partial condensation. Particulates must be removed by additional air pollution controls, e.g. fabric flters or wet scrubbers. Conventional thermal treatment methods, such as rotary kiln, rotary hearth furnace, or fuidized bed furnace, are used for waste pyrolysis. Kilns or furnaces used for pyrolysis may be of the same design as those used for combustion (i.e. incineration) discussed earlier, but operate at lower temperatures and with less air than in combustion. The target contaminant groups for pyrolysis include semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), including pesticides, PCBs, dioxins, and PAHs. It allows for separating organic contaminants from various wastes, including those from refneries, coal tar, wood preservatives, creosote-contaminated and hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, mixed radioactive and hazardous wastes, synthetic rubber processing, and paint and coating processes.

V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.4 AIR EMISSIONS FROM HAZARDOUS WASTES organic contaminants that chemically decompose when heated (i.e. \u201ccracking\u201d). Pyrolysis is not effective in either destroying or physically separating inorganic compounds that coexist with the organics in the contaminated medium. Volatile metals may be removed and transformed but their mass balance, of course, will not be changed. 29.4.7.3 Emerging Thermal Technologies Other promising thermal processes include high-pressure oxidation and vitrifcation.6 High-pressure oxidation combines two related technologies, i.e. wet air oxidation and supercritical water oxidation, which combine high temperature and pressure to destroy organics. Wet air oxidation can operate at pressures of about 10% of those used during supercritical water oxidation, an emerging technology that has shown some promise in the treatment of PCBs and other stable compounds that resist chemical reaction. Wet air oxidation has generally been limited to conditioning of municipal wastewater sludges, but can degrade hydrocarbons (including PAHs), certain pesticides, phenolic compounds, cyanides, and other organic compounds. Oxidation may beneft from catalysts. Vitrifcation uses electricity to heat and destroy organic compounds and immobilize inert contaminants. A vitrifcation unit has a reaction chamber divided into two sections: the upper section to introduce the feed material containing gases and pyrolysis products, and the lower section consisting of a two-layer molten zone for the metal and siliceous components of the waste. Electrodes are inserted into the waste solids, and graphite is applied to the surface to enhance its electrical conductivity. A large current is applied, resulting in rapid heating of the solids and causing the siliceous components of the material to melt as temperatures reach about 1600 C. The end product is a solid, glass-like material that is very resistant to leaching. 29.4.8 Indirect Air Impacts In addition to direct treatment, air pollution is also a concern for other means of treating hazardous wastes, especially when these wastes are stored or treated more passively, such as in a landfll or aeration pond. Leachate collection systems (see Figure 29.18) provide a way to collect wastes that can then be treated. However, such \u201cpump and treat\u201d systems can produce air pollutants. Actually, this is often intentional. For example, groundwater is treated by drilling recovery wells to pump contaminated groundwater to the surface. Commonly used groundwater treatment approaches include air stripping, fltering with granulated activated carbon (GAC), and air sparging. Air stripping transfers volatile compounds from water to air (see Figure 29.19). Groundwater is allowed to drip downward in a tower flled with a permeable material through which a stream of air fows upward. Another method bubbles pressurized air through contaminated water in a tank. The air leaving the tank (i.e. the off-gas) is treated with methods described in Chapter 32 for removing gaseous pollutants.", "Filtering groundwater with GAC entails pumping the water through the GAC to trap the contaminants. In air sparging, air is pumped into the groundwater to aerate the water. Most often, a soil venting system is combined with an air sparging system for vapor extraction, with the gaseous pollutants treated, as in air stripping. Regulatory agencies often require two or three pairs of these systems as design redundancies to protect the integrity of a hazardous waste storage or treatment facility. A primary leachate collection and treatment system must be designed like the bottom of the landfll bathtub. This leachate collection system must be graded to promote the fow of liquid within the landfll from all points in the landfll to a central collection point(s) where the liquid can be pumped to the surface for subsequent monitoring and treatment. Crushed stone and perforated pipes are used to channel the liquid along the V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS Air with vaporized contaminants Ground water to be treated Clean air top layer of this compacted clay liner to the pumping locations. Thus, directly treating hazardous wastes physically and chemically, as with thermal systems and indirectly controlling air pollutants as when gases are released from pump and treat systems require a comprehensive approach. Otherwise, we are merely moving the pollutants to different locations or even making matters worse by either rendering some contaminants more toxic or exposing receptors to dangerous substances. 29.5 MOBILE EMISSION SOURCES A mobile source of air pollution can be defned as one capable of moving from one place to another under its own power. According to this defnition, an automobile is a mobile source and a portable asphalt batching plant is not. The regulatory defnition seems to center around the internal combustion engine. Generally, mobile sources imply transportation, but sources such Treated off-gas Drip system Packing Treated water Compressor as construction equipment, gasoline-powered lawn mowers, and gasoline-powered tools are included in this category.13 Mobile sources therefore consist of many different types of vehicles, powered by engines using different cycles, fueled by a variety of products, and emitting varying amounts of both simple and complex pollutants. Table 29.11 includes the more common mobile sources. The predominant mobile air pollution source in all industrialized countries of the world is the motor vehicle, powered by a four-stroke cycle (Otto cycle) engine fuel with gasoline. In the United States, over 253 million automobiles were registered for use.13 When one considers the present reliability, cost, and life expectancy of the internal combustion engine, it is not diffcult to see why it has remained so popular. A modern automotive engine traveling 100,000 km will have about 2.5 108 power cycles. The emissions from a gasoline-powered vehicle come from many sources.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.6 MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING EMISSION STANDARDS With time, motor vehicle emission standards have become increasingly stringent for the typical air pollutants, especially hydrocarbons, NOx, CO, and PM. With most of today\u2019s automobiles using unleaded gasoline, lead emissions are no longer a major concern in the West, but are still a problem in numerous other parts of the world. Currently, certain countries limit emissions of these pollutants from crankcases, fuel tanks and, especially, exhaust from engines. In the U.S., these emission standards for mobile sources have become increasingly lowered. The so-called Tier 2 standards are presently in effect (see Table 29.12), but newer standards, i.e. the Tier 3 program will soon replace them. Beginning in 2017, Tier 3 would set new vehicle emissions standards and lower the sulfur (S) content of gasoline. These emission standards will treat the vehicle and its fuel as an integrated system. That is, the proposed vehicle standards would reduce both tailpipe and evaporative emissions from passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty passenger vehicles, and some heavy-duty vehicles. The proposed gasoline S standard is expected to improve the on-board emission control systems for both existing and new vehicles, thus increasing the likelihood of meeting more stringent vehicle emissions standards. Removing S allows the vehicle\u2019s catalyst to work more effciently.", "Lower sulfur gasoline also facilitates the development of some lower-cost technologies to improve fuel economy and decrease GHG emissions. The proposed tailpipe standards include different phase-in schedules that vary by vehicle class but generally phase in between model years 2017 and 2025. In addition to the gradual phase-in schedules, other proposed fexibilities include credits for early compliance and the ability to offset some higher-emitting vehicles with extra-clean models.15 The proposed fuel S standards that are part of Tier 3 not only address mobile sources, but address emissions at stationary sources, e.g. they include an averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program that would allow refners and importers to spread out their investments through an early credit program and rely on ongoing nationwide averaging to meet the S standard. The ABT and other means of meeting implementing standards for air toxics are discussed in the next section. 29.6 MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING EMISSION STANDARDS The most common rationale for developing emission limits for stationary sources is the application of the best practicable means for control. Under this rationale, the degree of emission limitation achievable at the best designed and operated installation in a category sets the emission limits for all other installations of that category. As new technology is developed, what was the best practicable means in 1993 is likely not still the best attainable in 2013. This moving target means must be provided administratively to allow the facility which complied with a best practicable means limit to be considered in compliance for a reasonable number of years thereafter. It is important to note that best practicable means limits are set without regard to present or background air quality or the air quality standards for the specifc pollutants emitted, the number and location of sources affected by the limit, and the meteorology or topography of the area in which they are located. However, an additional limit on minimum stack height, or buffer zone, based on these noted factors may be coupled with a best practicable means limit on mass or emission. The other major rationales for developing emission limits have been based on some or all of the noted factorsdair quality, air quality standards, number and location of sources, meteorology, and topography. These include the rollback approach, which involves all these factors except source location, meteorology, and topography; and the single-source mathematical modeling approach, which considers only the air quality standard and meteorology, ignoring the other factors listed. Some variants of best practicable means were spelled out in the US Clean Air Act of 1977. One is the requirement that Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for a specifc pollutant be employed on new \u201cmajor sources\u201d that are to be located in an area that has attained the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for that pollutant. The BACT was also required for pollutants for which there is no NAAQS (e.g. total reduced sulfur (TRS), for which emission limits are specifed by a federal New Source Performance Standard (NSPS)). BACT must be at least as stringent as NSPS but is determined on a case-by-case basis. Another variant is the lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) for a specifc pollutant required for a new source of that pollutant to be located in a nonattainment area (i.e. one which has not attained the NAAQS for that pollutant). LAER is the lowest emission rate allowed or achieved anywhere without regard to cost or energy usage. LAER is intended to be more stringent than BACT or NSPS and is also determined on a case-bycase basis. This changed with the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90) and the subsequent regulations. The Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards continued for some years, but incrementally have been phased-out in favor of standards to address the margin of risk that remained from the technology-based standards. This is known as residual risk. Section 112(f) of the CAAA90 directs the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to V.

The 7-mode procedure was used through model year 1971 and was replaced by the CVS-72 procedure beginning in model year 1972. The CVS-75 procedure became the test procedure as of model year 1975. While it may appear that the total HC and CO standards were relaxed in 1972e74, these standards were actually more stringent due to the more stringent nature of the CVS-72 test procedure. Additional standards for CO and composite standards for NMHC and NOx tested under the new Supplemental Federal Test Procedure will be phased-in beginning with model year 2000; these standards are not shown in this table. xAll emissions standards must be met for a useful life of 5 years/50,000 miles. Beginning with model year 1994, a second set of emissions standards must also be met for a full useful life of 10 years/100,000 miles; these standards are shown in parentheses.

AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS prepare a report to Congress on the methods to be used to address this residual risk from sources that emit hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) have been promulgated and applied. The U.S. EPA presents a discussion of how it intends to provide the CAAA90\u2019s mandate to \u201cprovide an ample margin of safety to protect public health\u201d or to set more stringent standards, if necessary, \u201cto prevent, taking into consideration costs, energy, safety, and other relevant factors, an adverse environmental effect\u201d. This includes both human and ecological risk. The U.S. EPA published the Residual Risk Report to Congress in March 1999. All of the MACT regulations for 174 industry source categories have been reviewed to decrease emissions of toxic air pollutants listed in the Clean Air Act (see Table 5.2 in Chapter 5 for the nearly 200 listed compounds). The 1989 National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for benzene1 presented the following risk management framework for cancer risk, which refects the two-step approach suggested by the court. The benzene rule preamble states that in determining acceptable risk: The Administrator believes that an MIR [maximum individual risk] of approximately 1 in 10 thousand should ordinarily be the upper-end of the range of acceptability. As risks increase above this benchmark, they become presumptively less acceptable under Section 112, and would be weighed with the other health risk measures and information in making an overall judgment on acceptability. Or, the Agency may fnd, in a particular case, that a risk that includes MIR less than the presumptively acceptable level is unacceptable in light of the other health risk factors. The Risk and Technology Review (RTR) is a combined effort to evaluate both risk and technology as required by CAAA90 after the application of MACT standards. Section 112(f)(2) directs the U.S. EPA to conduct risk assessments on each source category subject to MACT standards and to determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks. Section 112(d)(6) of the CAA requires the U.S. EPA to review and revise the MACT standards, as necessary, taking into account developments in practices, processes and control technologies.16 The maximum individual risk (MIR), the distribution of risks in the exposed population, incidence, the science policy assumptions and uncertainties associated with risk measures, and the weight of evidence that a pollutant is harmful to health are all key determinants used to the estimate safety and risk posed by a HAP. To ensure protection of public health and the environment, the Section 112(f) requires a human health risk and adverse environmental effects based \u201cneeds test\u201d in the second regulatory phase of the air toxics program. As mentioned, this residual risk standard setting considers the need for additional national standards on stationary emission sources following regulation under Section 112(d) to provide an ample margin of public safety, and also mandates that the U.S. EPA determine whether residual risk standards are necessary to prevent adverse environmental effects, taking into consideration \u201ccosts, energy, safety, and other relevant factors\u201d in deciding what level is protective. Adverse environmental effect is defned in Section 112(a)(7) as \u201cany signifcant and widespread adverse effect, which may reasonably be anticipated, to wildlife, aquatic life, or other natural resources, including adverse impacts on populations of endangered or threatened species or signifcant degradation of environmental quality over broad areas\u201d. In 2005 the U.S. EPA issued fnal amendments to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants, or air toxics, from coke oven batteries; these were the frst of a series of emissions reductions under the new residual risk standards.", "Across the industry, this rule will require reductions of allowable emissions from 11.3 tons per year under the 1993 MACT to 9.8 tons per year under the amendments. This rule was also designed to ensure that the affected batteries do not increase their emissions back to the levels allowed in 1993. The fnal amendments include more stringent requirements for certain processes at several coke oven batteries to address health risks remaining after implementing EPA\u2019s October 1993 air toxics emission MACT standards. The fnal amendments also include requirements for new or reconstructed coke oven batteries that refect improvements in emission control practices that have occurred in the years since the 1993 MACT standards. This applies to coke oven emissions from nine batteries at fve coke plants for which the 1993 MACT standard applied. There are approximately 14 other coke oven plants in the country that are not affected by this rule because they chose to install more stringent controls than the MACT the LAER, beginning in 1993. Because these LAER batteries opted to reduce their emissions by more than the 1993 MACT required, they do not have to comply with residual risk rule until the year 2020. The fnal amendments apply to charging, leaks, and bypass stacks at coke oven batteries. Emissions from these processes occur at the start of the process of turning coal into coke, primarily as the coke ovens are heating up. Thus, residual risk measures focus in a number of areas, beyond technology. When owners wish to build a new source which will add a certain amount of a specifc pollutant to an area that is in nonattainment with respect to that pollutant, they must, under US federal regulations, document a reduction of at least that amount of the pollutant from another source in the area. They can effect this reduction, or \u201coffset\u201d, as it is called, in another plant they V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.6 MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING EMISSION STANDARDS own in the area or can shut down that plant. However, if they do not own another such plant or do not wish to shut down or effect such reduction in a plant they own, they can seek the required reduction or offset from another owner. Thus, such offsets are marketable credits that can be bought, sold, traded, or stockpiled (\u201cbanked\u201d) as long as the state or local regulatory agency legitimizes, records, and certifcates these transactions. The new source will still have to meet NSPS, BACT or MACT, and/or LAER standards, whichever are applicable. 29.6.1 Averaging, Banking, and Trading Emissions Emissions trading programs generally can be accomplished by netting, offsets, bubbles, and banking. Netting allows large new sources and major modifcations of existing sources to be exempted from certain review procedures if existing emissions elsewhere in the same facility are reduced by a suffcient amount. An offsets allows a major new source to locate in an area that does not attain a given air quality standard, i.e. a non-attainment area, if emissions from an existing source are decreased by at least as much as the new source would contribute, after installation of stringent controls. A bubble allows a regulated entity to combine the limits for several different sources into one combined limit and to determine compliance based on that aggregate limit instead of from each source individually. The name alludes to an imaginary \u201cbubble\u201d placed over the several sources. Banking allows a regulated entity to accumulate emission credits for future use or sale it take actions to lower emissions below the relevant standard. These approaches all have a common objective of fexibility to comply with traditional source-specifc command and-control standards, but achieving o providing even less emissions to improve local air quality.16 When a new stationary source has been added to a group of existing stationary sources under the same ownership in the same industrial complex, the usual practice has been to require the new source independently to meet the offset, NSPS, BACT, and/or LAER, disregarding the other sources in the complex. Under the more recent \u201cbubble concept\u201d (Figure 29.20) adopted by some states with the approval of the U.S. EPA, the addition of the new source is allowed, whether or not it meets NSPS, BACT, or LAER, provided the total emission of the relevant regulated pollutants from the total complex is decreased. This can be accomplished by obtaining the required offset from one or more of the other sources within the complex, by shutdown, or by improvement in control effciency.", "The bubble concept has been subject to litigation and may require a ruling or challenge to make it acceptable. Virtual bubble 29 19 63 80 Pollution controls at each emission point 8 1 FIGURE 29.20 Bubble concept. This pollution control concept places an imaginary bubble over an entire industrial plant, evaluating emissions from the facility as a whole instead of requiring control point-bypoint on emission sources. Numbers represent emissions from individual sources, some of which can be fugitive sources, and from the entire industrial plant. This hypothetical complex would produce 100 units of pollution in any of the three scenarios depicted. (For color version of this fgure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS 29.6.2 Fugitive and Secondary Emission Sources To estimate the potential for emission of a new source or source complex, it is necessary to consider two other source categories, \u201cfugitive\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d sources. Fugitive emissions are those from other than point sources, such as unpaved plant roads, outdoor storage piles swept by the wind, and surface mining. Secondary sources are those small sources with emissions of a different character from those of a major source, necessary for the operation of the major source, or source complex. 29.6.3 Indirect Sources A facility, building, structure, installation, or combination of these that generates or attracts mobile source activity is known as an indirect source of air pollution. The very existence of such a source results in emissions of any pollutant (or the precursor of an air pollutant, e.g. hydrocarbons and NOx for ground-level O3) for which there is a state ambient air quality standard. Examples include parking areas of shopping malls, sports arenas, and other facilities that attract large numbers of motor vehicles, frequently arriving and leaving over relatively short periods of time. Of somewhat similar character are traffc interchanges, as at an intersection of major highways, each highway being a line source in its own right. 29.6.4 Proportional Emission Predictions The proportional modeling or rollback approach assumes that emissions and atmospheric concentrations are proportional and linearly-related, i.e. that a given percentage reduction in emission will result in a similar percentage reduction in atmospheric concentrations. This is most likely a valid assumption for a nonreactive gas such as carbon monoxide, whose principal source is the automobile, however, it is not recommended for many pollutants and/or those with more complicated and complex physics and chemistry, e.g. ground-level O3.e The simple rollback model is g\u00f0P\u00de D R \u00bc 100 (29.9) g\u00f0P\u00de B Where, R is the required percentage reduction in emission, P is the present air quality, D is the air quality standard, B is the background concentration, and g is the growth factor in emissions (e.g. g is projected to a year in the future when emissions are expected to apply to all vehicles on the road). The basic steps18 for the rollback model are: 1. Determine representative monitoring station(s) and the design value; 2. Determine background as the lowest pollutant concentration value recorded at an upwind monitoring location on the same day or during the same time period; 3. Prepare a micro-scale inventory of the sources that emit the pollutant for the time period the monitor measured; 4. Calculate the percentage for each source based upon the entire inventory; 5. Calculate the relative contribution from each source to the concentration measured for the time period; 6. Estimate the anticipated increase or decrease in emissions from each source; 7. Apply the same percentage of increase or decrease in emissions from each source to the relative contribution calculated for the same source; and 8. Calculate the anticipated ambient concentration after source emissions change. As mentioned, rollback is a substantial oversimplifcation of the processes involved in air pollution, so basing emission reduction on rollback is fraught with error. Indeed, proportional modeling is mentioned in the U.S. air quality modeling only for PM and lead (Pb). Proportional models are not recommended for PM screening analysis, unless such techniques are used in conjunction with receptor modeling. Refned models are recommended for PM10. However, where possible, particle size, gas-to-particle formation, and their effect on ambient concentrations may be considered. For point sources of small particles and for source-specifc analyses of complicated sources, the appropriate recommended steady-state plume dispersion model should be used. Receptor models have proven useful for helping validate emission inventories and for corroborating source-specifc impacts estimated by dispersion models.", "The Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) model is useful for apportioning impacts from local sources. Other receptor models, e.g. the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model and Unmix, which do not have some of CMB\u2019s constraints, have also been applied. In regulatory applications, dispersion models have been used in conjunction with receptor models to attribute source (or source category) contributions.7 For lead (Pb) an entire major urban area or to model areas without signifcant sources of Pb emissions, as a e Preferred methods include dispersion modeling, source/receptor models such as the Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) models, and advanced regional models (e.g. the Urban Airshed Model; link: http://www.epa.gov/scram001/photochemicalindex.htm). V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.7 AIR TOXICS EMISSIONS minimum a proportional model may be used for air quality analysis. However, urban or other dispersion models are encouraged in these circumstances where the use of such models is feasible. In modeling the effect of traditional line sources (such as a specifc roadway or highway) on lead air quality, dispersion models applied for other pollutants can be used.19 29.6.5 Fuel Standards To reduce emissions from fuel-burning sources, one can limit the sulfur, ash, or volatile content of fuels.4 The U.S. EPA required major gasoline retailers to begin to sell one grade of unleaded gasoline by July 1, 1974. This mandate was primarily focused on protecting emissions control systems (e.g. catalytic converters). It was at this time that the working defnition of \u201cunleaded\u201d gasoline was to mean \u201cgasoline containing not more than 0.05 g of lead per gallon and not more than 0.005 g of phosphorus per gallon\u201d (38FR1255, January 10, 1973). The major Pb species was tetraethyl lead (TEL). The agency also called for the gradual phaseout of leaded gasoline. The schedule for reduction of lead content in automobile gasoline was 1.7 g per gallon (ggal 1) in 1975, to 1.4ggal 1 in 1976, 1.0ggal 1 in 1977, 0.8 g gal 1 in 1978, and 0.5 g gal 1 in 1979 (38FR33741, December 6, 1973). Subsequent regulations reduced the allowable lead content to 0.1 g gal 1 in 1986 (50FR9397, March 7, 1985), and prohibited leaded gas use after 1995 (61FR3837, February 2, 1996). The EPA established a limit of 1.1 g gal 1for the content of leaded gasoline beginning on July 1, 1985, 0.5 g gal 1 after July 1, 1985 and g gal 1after January 1, 1986. An EPA program to allow trading in lead credits among refners facilitated this schedule of lead reduction. On July 1, 1983 EPA allowed refners and importers of gasoline to trade lead reduction credits to meet the limit for the average lead content of gasoline. Refners and importers that reduced the average lead content of their gasoline below the EPA limit generated credits that could be sold to refners or importers that exceeded the limit. Once the limit for the average content of leaded gasoline reached 0.1 g gal 1, trading was no longer allowed because of concern that gasoline with less than 0.1 g gal 1 could cause excessive valve seat wear in older vehicles. In 1985 EPA allowed refners to bank lead credits for subsequent use before the end of 1987.20 Many other countries have imposed similar bans and phase-outs of TEL. In most industrialized countries, a phase-out of TEL from motor fuels was completed by the early 2000s. Technological advances have helped, e.g. in automotive engineering and petroleum chemistry. Safer methods for making higher octane blending stocks ameliorated the need for TEL, as did other antiknock additives of varying toxicity including metallic compounds, e.g., methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT, discussed earlier in the chapter and in Chapter 13); and oxygenating compounds, e.g. methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE, discussed in Chapter 3).21 As of June 2011, unleaded automotive gasoline is available almost universally throughout the world and the only countries in which leaded gasoline is the only type available are Burma and Afghanistan; Leaded gasoline also remains available in Algeria, Georgia, Iraq, North Korea, and Yemen.22 29.7 AIR TOXICS EMISSIONS Hazardous air pollutants are known in most air pollution control communities as toxic air pollutants or air toxics. These are the pollutants that cause or are strongly suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, including reproductive and developmental effects or birth defects. They are also often associated with adverse environmental and ecological effects. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to control 188 air toxics (see Table 5.2 in Chapter 5).", "Examples of toxic air pollutants include benzene, which is found in gasoline; perchloroethlyene, which is emitted from some dry cleaning facilities; and methylene chloride, which is used as a solvent and paint stripper by a number of industries. The Clean Air Act allows for petitions to modify the list (e.g. in 2006, caprolactam, hydrogen sulfde, and methyl ethyl ketone were undergoing modifcation). Most air toxics originate from human-made sources, including mobile and stationary sources, similar to the criteria pollutants discussed in this chapter. However, many are predominantly or nearly exclusively indoor air pollutants. Two types of stationary sources routinely emit air toxics: 1. Major sources emit 10 tons per year of any of the listed toxic air pollutants, or 25 tons per year of a mixture of air toxics. Major sources may release air toxics from equipment leaks, when materials are transferred from one location to another, or during discharge through emission stacks or vents. 2. Area sources are smaller-size facilities that release lesser quantities of air toxics. These sources emit less than 10 tons per year of a single air toxic, or less than 25 tons per year of a combination of air toxics. Though emissions from individual area sources are often relatively small, collectively their emissions can be of concerndespecially in heavily populated communities with many sources. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments direct the EPA to set standards for all major sources of air toxics (and V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS some area sources that are of particular concern). The EPA published the initial list of source categories in 1992 in the Federal Register (57FR31576, July 16, 1992), which has since been revised and updated frequently. The list designates whether the sources are considered to be major or area sources. 29.8 EMISSION INVENTORY An emission inventory is a list of the amount of pollutants from all sources entering the air in a given time period. The boundaries of the area are fxed.22 The tables of emission inventory are very useful to control agencies as well as planning and zoning agencies. They can point out the major sources whose control can lead to a considerable reduction of pollution in the area. They can be used with appropriate mathematical models to determine the degree of overall control necessary to meet ambient air quality standards. They can be used to indicate the type of sampling network and the locations of individual sampling stations if the areas chosen are small enough. For example, if an area uses very small amounts of sulfur-bearing fuels, establishing an extensive SO2 monitoring network in the area would not be an optimum use of public funds. Emission inventories can be used for publicity and political purposes: \u201cIf natural gas cannot meet the demands of our area, we will have to burn more high-sulfur fuel, and the SO2 emissions will increase by 8 tons per year\u201d. The method used to develop the emission inventory does have some elements of error, but the other two alternatives are expensive and subject to their own errors. The frst alternative would be to monitor continually every major source in the area. The second method would be to monitor continually the pollutants in the ambient air at many points and apply appropriate diffusion equations to calculate the emissions. In practice, the most informative system would be a combination of all three, knowledgeably applied. The US Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 strengthened the emission inventory requirements for plans and permits in nonattainment areas.24 The amendments state: InventorydSuch plan provisions shall include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of the relevant pollutant or pollutants in such area, including such periodic revisions as the Administrator may determine necessary to assure that the requirements of this part are met. Identifcation and quantifcationdSuch plan provisions shall expressly identify and quantify the emissions, if any, of any such pollutant or pollutants which will be allowed, from the construction and operation of major new or modifed stationary sources in each such area. The plan shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the emissions quantifed for this purpose will be consistent with the achievement of reasonable further progress and will not interfere with the attainment of the applicable national ambient air quality standard by the applicable attainment date. 29.8.1 Inventory Calculation and Construction The general equation for emissions estimation is: &#1;&#3; 1 ER E \u00bc AEF (29.10) 100", "Where, E \u00bc emissions; A \u00bc activity rate; EF \u00bc emission factor; and ER \u00bc overall emission reduction effciency (%). To develop an emission inventory for an area, one must (1) list the types of sources for the area, such as cupolas, automobiles, and home freplaces (see Figure 29.21); (2) determine the type of air pollutant emission from each of the listed sources, such as particulates and SO2; (3) examine the literature to fnd valid emission factors for each of the pollutants of concern (e.g. \u201cparticulate emissions for open burning of tree limbs and brush are 10 kg per ton of residue consumed\u201d); (4) through an actual count, or by means of some estimating technique, determine the number and size of specifc sources in the area (the number of steelmaking furnaces can be counted, but the number of home freplaces will probably have to be estimated); and (5) multiply the appropriate numbers from (3) and (4) to obtain the total emissions and then sum the similar emissions to obtain the total for the area.25 A typical example will illustrate the procedure. Suppose the amount of CO from oil furnaces emitted per day, during the heating season, in a small city of 50,000 population needs to be determined: 1. The source is oil furnaces within the boundary area of the city. 2. The pollutant of concern is carbon monoxide. 3. Emission factors for carbon monoxide are listed in various ways (240 g per 1000 l of fuel oil, 50 g per day per burner, 1.5% by volume of exhaust gas, etc.). For this example, use 240 g per 1000 l of fuel oil. 4. Fuel oil sales fgures, obtained from the local dealers association, average 40,000 l per day. 240gCO 40; 000 l 5. \u00bc 9:6 kg CO day 1 1000 l day 29.8.2 Emission Factors Valid emission factors for each source of pollution are the key to the emission inventory. It is not uncommon to fnd emission factors differing by 50%, depending on the V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29.8 EMISSION INVENTORY FIGURE 29.21 Types of sources included in emission inventory.

It must also be realized that an uncontrolled source will emit at least 10 times the amount of pollutants released from one operating properly with air pollution control equipment installed.24 Actual emission data are available from many handbooks, government publications, and literature searches of appropriate research papers and journals. In addition, online support is available, especially the Technology Transfer Network/Clearinghouse for Inventories and Emissions Factors, accessible at http://www.epa.gov/ ttn/chief/index.html. This site provides information on emission factors, inventory, modeling, along with a knowledge base for emissions monitoring. It is always wise to verify the data, if possible, as to the validity of the source and the reasonableness of the fnal number. Some emission factors, which have been in use for years, were only rough estimates proposed by someone years ago to establish the order of magnitude of the particular source. Emission factors must be also critically examined to determine the tests from which they were obtained. For example, carbon monoxide from an automobile will vary with the load, engine speed, displacement, ambient temperature, coolant temperature, ignition timing, carburetor adjustment, engine condition, etc. However, in order to evaluate the overall emission of carbon monoxide to an area, we must settle on an average value that we can multiply by the number of cars, or kilometers driven per year, to determine the total carbon monoxide released to the area. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 29. AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS 29.8.3 Data Gathering To compile the emission inventory requires a determination of the number and types of units of interest in the study area. It would be of interest, for example, to know the number of automobiles in the area and the number of kilometers each was driven per year. This fgure would require considerable time and expense to obtain. Instead, it can be closely approximated by determining the liters of gasoline sold in the area during the year.", "Since a tax is collected on all gasoline sold for highway use, these fgures can be obtained from the tax collection offce. Data regarding emissions are available from many sources. Sometimes the same item may be checked by asking two or more agencies for the same information. An example of this would be to check the liters of gasoline sold in a county by asking both the tax offce and the gasoline dealers association. Sources of information for an emission inventory include: (1) city, county, and state planning commissions; (2) city, county, and state chambers of commerce; (3) city, county, and state industrial development commissions; (4) census bureaus; (5) national associations such as coal associations; (6) local associations such as the County Coal Dealers Association; (7) individual dealers or distributors of oil, gasoline, coal, etc.; (8) local utility companies; (9) local fre and building departments; (10) data gathered by air pollution control agencies through surveys, sampling, etc.; (11) traffc maps; and (12) insurance maps. 29.6.5 Data Reduction and Compilation The fnal emission inventory can be prepared on a computer, with a program written so that changes can easily be made. There will be times when major changes occur and the inventory must be completely changed. Imagine the change that would take place when natural gas frst becomes available in a commercialeresidential area which previously used oil and coal for heating. To determine emission data, as well as the effect that fuel changes would produce, it is necessary to use the appropriate thermal conversion factor from one fuel to another. Table 29.13 lists these factors for fuels in common use. A major change in the emissions for an area will occur if control equipment is installed. This can be shown in the emission inventory to illustrate the effect on the community. By keeping the emission inventory current and updating it at least yearly as fuel uses change, industrial and population changes occur, and control equipment is added, a realistic record for the area is obtained.

Also assume that atmosphere has the stability class C and that mixing in the x direction is the same as mixing in the y direction. 38. Consider the following information from an accident report fled with the US EPA and write a brief contingency plan that would prevent such an incident occurring at any refnery: At about 10:15 a.m., on October 16, 1995, an explosion and fre occurred at Plant No. 1 of the Pennzoil Products Company refnery in Rouseville, Pennsylvania. After the initial explosion, fames quickly engulfed a large area of the refnery, including areas under construction, storage trailers, a trailer where contractors took work breaks, and many storage tanks. The fames ignited several tanks containing naphtha and fuel oil. During the fre, several loud explosions could be heard as compressed gas cylinders and other sealed containers exploded. The explosions hurled some plant debris beyond the fence line. Thick black smoke spread throughout the area. The fre forced Pennzoil employees and contractors at the plant, residents of the town of Rouseville and an elementary school, and the Pennzoil offce across Route eight from the facility, to evacuate. Firefghters extinguished the fre at about 12:30 p.m. that same day. Three workers were killed in the fre and three others were injured. Two of the injured died later as a result of their injuries. The fre resulted in extensive damage to the facility. Minor \u201csheening\u201d was reported on the stream that runs past the refnery, but there were no reports of any materials spilled into the stream or environmental damage. A welding operation was in progress on a service stairway located between two waste liquid storage tanks (tanks 487 and 488) at the time of the incident. These tanks contained mixtures of waste hydrocarbons and water. A hot work (welding, cutting) permit had been prepared, as required by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, which included combustible gas detection prior to welding to ensure the safety of the work. The EPA Chemical Accident Investigation Team (CAIT) identifed the immediate cause of the fre and the conditions which triggered the serious consequences. The immediate cause of the fre was the ignition of fammable vapors in storage tank 487. Although the CAIT could not determine the exact mechanism, there are at least two likely scenarios: undetected fammable vapors emitted from tank 487 were ignited by an ignition source which then fashed back into the tank; or an electrical discharge in the tank 487, generated by the arc welding, ignited fammable vapors in the tank.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30 Air Pollution Control Technologies 30.1 ENGINEERING CONTROL CONCEPTS 30.1.1 Introduction The application of control technology to air pollution problems assumes that a source can be reduced to a predetermined level to meet a regulation or some other target value. Control technology cannot be applied to an uncontrollable source, such as a volcano, nor can it be expected to control a source completely to reduce emissions to zero. The cost of controlling any given air pollution source is usually an exponential function of the percentage of control and therefore becomes an important consideration in the level of control required.1 Figure 30.1 shows a typical cost curve for control equipment. If the material recovered has some economic value, the picture is different. Figure 30.2 shows the previous cost of control with the value recovered curve superimposed on it. The plant manager looking at such a curve would want to be operating in the area to the left of the intersection of the two curves, whereas the local air pollution forces would insist on operation as far to the right of the graph as the best available control technology would allow. Control of any air pollution source requires a complete knowledge of the contaminant and the source. Cost ($) Quantity of material removed (%) FIGURE 30.1 Air pollution control equipment cost. The engineers controlling the source must be thoroughly familiar with all available physical and chemical data on the ef\ufb02uent from the source. They must know the rules and regulations of the control agencies involved, including not only the air pollution control agency but also any agencies, which may have jurisdiction over the construction, operation, and \ufb01nal disposal of the waste from the source.2 In many cases, heating or cooling of the gaseous ef\ufb02uent will be required before it enters the control device. The engineer must be thoroughly aware of the gas laws, thermodynamic properties, and reactions involved to secure a satisfactory design. For example, if a gas is cooled below its dewpoint, the gas will condense onto surfaces. If water is sprayed into the hot gas for cooling, it adds greatly to the speci\ufb01c volume of the mixture. As the gases pass through hoods, ducts, fans, and control equipment, temperatures and pressures change which in turn will change speci\ufb01c volumes and velocities.3 In addition, compounds may react with the water, e.g. they may undergo hydrolysis and form acids, which may would add to the corrosiveness and shorten equipment life. The control of atmospheric emissions from a process will generally take one of the three forms depending on the process, fuel, types, availability of control $ for control $ recovered Value and cost ($) 0 100 Quantity of material removed (%) FIGURE 30.2 Control equipment cost with value recovered. Fundamentals of Air Pollution 829 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00030-X Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES equipment, etc. The three general methods are (1) process change to a less polluting process or to lowered emission from the existing process through a modi\ufb01cation or change in operation, (2) change to a fuel that will give the desired level of emissions, and (3) installation of control equipment between the point of pollutant generation and its release to the atmosphere. Control may consist of either removal of the pollutant or conversion to a less polluting form.3 30.1.2 Process Change A process change can be either a change in operating procedures for an existing process or the substitution of a completely different process. In recent years, this has been labeled \u201cpollution prevention\u201d. Consider a plant manager who for years has been using solvent A for a degreasing operation. By past experimentation, it has been found that with the conveyor speed at 100 units per hour, with a solvent temperature of 80 C, one gets maximum cleaning with solvent, a loss that results in the lowest overall operating cost for the process. A new regulation is passed requiring greatly reduced atmospheric emissions of organic solvents, including solvent A. The manager has several alternatives: 1. Change to another more expensive solvent, which by virtue of its lower vapor pressure would emit less organic matter. 2. Reduce the temperature of the solvent and slow down the conveyor to get the same amount of cleaning. This may require the addition of another line or another 8 h shift.", "3. Put in the necessary hooding, ducting, and equipment for a solvent recovery system which will decrease the atmospheric pollution and also result in some economic solvent recovery. 4. Put in the necessary hooding, ducting, and equipment for an thermal oxidizing (afterburner) system which will burn the organic solvent vapors to a less polluting emission, but with no solvent recovery. In some cases, the least expensive control is achieved by abandoning the old process and replacing it with a new, less polluting one. Any increased production and/or recovery of material may help offset a portion of the cost. It has proved to be cheaper to abandon old steel mills and to replace them with completely new furnaces of a different type than to modify the old systems to meet pollution regulations. Kraft pulp mills found that the least costly method of meeting stringent regulations was to replace the old, high-emission recovery furnaces with a new furnace of completely different design. The kraft mills have generally asked for, and received, additional plant capacity to offset partially the cost of the new furnace type. 30.1.3 Fuel Change For certain air pollution control situations, a change to a less polluting fuel may be the ideal solution to the problem, at least in the near-term. If a power plant is emitting large quantities of SO2 and \ufb02y ash, conversion to natural gas could very well be cheaper than installing the necessary control equipment to decrease the pollutant emissions to meet the permitted values. If the drier at an asphalt plant is emitting 350 mg of particulate matter per standard cubic meter of ef\ufb02uent when \ufb01red with heavy oil of 4% ash, a switch to either oil of a lower ash content or natural gas may allow the operation to meet an emission standard of 250 mg per standard cubic meter. In the twentieth century, fuel switching based on meteorological or air pollution forecasts was a common practice to reduce the air pollution burden at critical times. Some control agencies allowed power plants to operate on residual oil during certain periods of the year when pollution potential was low. Some large utilities for years have followed a policy of switching from their regular coal to a more expensive but lower-sulfur coal when stagnation conditions were forecast. Caution should be exercised when considering any change in fuels to reduce emissions. This is particularly true when fuel is expensive. Speci\ufb01c considerations might be the following: 1. What are the current and potential fuel supplies? In many areas, natural gas is already in short supply. It may not be possible to convert a large plant with current allocations or pipeline capacity. 2. Most large boilers use a separate fuel for auxiliary or standby purposes. One actual example was a boiler \ufb01red with wood residue as the primary fuel and residual oil as the standby. A change was made to natural gas as the primary fuel, with residual oil kept for standby. This change was made to lower particulate emissions and to achieve a predicted slightly lower cost. Because of gas shortages, the plant now operates on residual oil during most of the cold season, and the resulting particulate emission greatly exceeds that of the previously burned wood fuel. In addition, an SO2 emission problem exists with the oil fuel that never occurred with the wood residue. Overall costs have not been lowered because natural gas rates have increased since the conversion. 3. Charts or tables listing supplies or reserves of low-sulfur fuel may not tell the entire story. For example, a large percentage of low-sulfur coal is owned by steel companies and is therefore not V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.1 ENGINEERING CONTROL CONCEPTS generally available for use in power generating stations even though it is listed in tables published by various agencies. 4. Strong competition exists for low-pollution fuels. While one area may be drawing up regulations to require use of natural gas or low-sulfur fuels, it is probable that other neighboring areas are doing the same. Although there may have been suf\ufb01cient premium fuel for one or two areas, if the entire region changes, not enough exists. Such a situation has resulted in extreme fuel shortages during cold spells in some large cities. The supply of low-sulfur fuels has been exhausted during period of extensive use. Nuclear reactors (Figure 30.3) used for power generation has been questioned from several environmental points of view.", "These appear to be relatively pollution free compared to the more familiar fossil fuel-\ufb01red plant, which emits carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, hydrocarbons, and \ufb02y ash. However, waste and spent-fuel disposal problems may offset the apparent advantages. These problems (along with steam generator leaks) have been the cause for premature closures of nuclear power plants. 30.1.4 Pollution Removal In many situations, suf\ufb01cient control over emissions cannot be entirely obtained by fuel or process change. In cases such as these, the levels of the pollutants of concern in the exhaust gases or process stream must be decreased to allowable values before they are released to the atmosphere. The equipment for the pollutant removal system includes: hoods, ducting, controls, fans, and disposal or recovery systems that might be necessary. The entire system should be engineered as a unit for maximum ef\ufb01ciency and economy. Many systems operate at less than maximum ef\ufb01ciency because a portion of the system has been designed or adapted without suf\ufb01cient consideration of the other portions.4 Ef\ufb01ciency of the control equipment is normally speci\ufb01ed before the equipment is purchased. If a plant is emitting a pollutant at 500 kg h 1 and the regulations allow an emission of only 25 kg h 1, it is obvious that at least 95% ef\ufb01ciency is required of the pollution control system. This situation requires the regulation to state \u201cat least 95% removal on a weight basis\u201d. The regulation should further specify how the test would be made to determine the ef\ufb01ciency. Figure 30.4 shows the situation as it exists. To atmosphere From process Hold-up Loss To waste FIGURE 30.4 Typical pollution control device as shown for ef\ufb01ciency calculations. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES The ef\ufb01ciency for the device shown in Figure 30.4 may be calculated in several ways: C Efficiency; % \u00bc 100 ; but since A \u00bc B \u00fe C (30.1) A Efficiency; % C AB AB \u00bc 100 or 100 or 100 B \u00fe CAB \u00fe C (30.2) The \ufb01nal acceptance test would probably be made by measuring two of the three quantities and using the appropriate equation. For a completely valid ef\ufb01ciency test, the effect of hold-up (D) and loss (E) must also be taken into account. To remove a pollutant from the carrying stream, some property of the pollutant that is different from the carrier must be exploited. The pollutant may have different size, inertia, electrical, or absorption properties. Removal requires that the equipment be designed to apply the scienti\ufb01c principles necessary to perform the separation. 30.1.5 Disposal of Pollutants If a pollutant is removed from the carrying gas stream, disposal of the collected material becomes of vital concern. If the collected material is truly inert, it may be disposed of in a sanitary land\ufb01ll. If it is at the other end of the scale, it is probably considered as a toxic waste and strict laws governing its disposal apply. Disposal of hazardous wastes is regulated by governmental agencies.5e11 In the United States, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 is the major legislation covering the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.2 This act provides a multifaceted approach to solving the problems associated with the generation of approximately 5 US billion metric tons of solid waste each year in the United States. It places particular emphasis on the regulation of hazardous wastes. This law established the Of\ufb01ce of Solid Waste within the US Environmental Protection Agency and directed the agency to publish hazardous waste characteristics and criteria. If a waste is designated as hazardous under the RCRA, regulations are applied to generators, transporters, and those who treat, store, or dispose of that waste. Regulations regarding hazardous wastes are enforced by the federal government, while the individual states are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the RCRA which apply to nonhazardous wastes. The act also provides for research, development, and demonstration grants for waste disposal. The US Environmental Protection Agency, Of\ufb01ce of Solid Waste Management Programs, de\ufb01nes hazardous waste as \u201cwastes or combinations of wastes which pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or living organisms because they cause, or tend to cause, detrimental cumulative effects\u201d. Hazardous wastes can be categorized in a way that shows their potential or immediate effect.", "A common system for categorizing substances is (1) toxic substances (acute or chronic damage to living systems), (2) \ufb02ammable, (3) explosive or highly reactive, (4) irritating and/or sensitizing, (5) corrosive (strong oxidizing agents), (6) radioactive, (7) bioaccumulative and/or bio-magni\ufb01ed substances (with toxic effects), and (8) genetically interactive substances (mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic). It is possible for a substance to be placed in any number of these categories, but placement in only one category is suf\ufb01cient for it to be considered hazardous.5e11 Table 30.1 indicates the four main types of hazardous material, with examples of substances of each type. Not presented in Table 30.1 are radioactive materials, which are considered as a separate type of hazardous 12 waste. Table 30.2 lists some of the currently used pretreatments and ultimate disposal methods for hazardous wastes.13 Pretreatment refers almost entirely to thickening or dewatering processes for liquids or sludges. This process not only reduces the volume of the waste but also allows easier handling and transport. The general purpose of ultimate disposal of hazardous wastes is to prevent the contamination of susceptible environments. Surface water runoff, ground water leaching, atmospheric volatilization, and biological accumulation are processes that should be avoided during the active life of the hazardous waste. As a rule, the more persistent a hazardous waste is (i.e. the greater its resistance to breakdown), the greater the need to isolate it from the environment. If the substance cannot be neutralized by chemical treatment or incineration and still maintains its hazardous qualities, the only alternative is usually to immobilize and bury it in a secure chemical burial site. 30.2 AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES The best means of addressing air pollutants is to prevent their existence through waste minimization and prevention. These techniques have improved but, unfortunately, the most common way to control air pollution remains pollution removal and treatment. For pollution removal to be accomplished, the polluted carrier gas must pass through a control device or system, which V.

The control device or system selected must be speci\ufb01c for the pollutant of concern. If the pollutant is an aerosol, the device used will, in most cases, be different from the one used for a gaseous pollutant. If the aerosol is a dry solid, a different device must be used than for liquid droplets. Not only the pollutant itself but also the carrier gas, the emitting process, and the operational variables of the process affect the selection of the control system. Table 30.3 illustrates the large number of variables which must be considered in controlling pollution 14a,14b,14c,14d from a source. After the control system is installed, its operation and maintenance become a major concern. Important reasons for an operation and maintenance (O&M) program are (1) the necessity of continuously meeting emission regulations, (2) prolonging control equipment life, (3) maintaining productivity of the process served by the control device, (4) reducing operation costs, (5) promoting better public relations and avoiding community alienation, and (6) promoting better relations with regulatory of\ufb01cials.15 The O&M program has the following minimum requirements: (1) an equipment and record system with equipment information, warranties, instruction manuals, etc.; (2) lubrication and cleaning schedules; (3) planning and scheduling of preventive maintenance; (4) a storeroom and inventory system for spare parts and supplies; (5) listing of maintenance personnel; (6) costs and budgets for O&M; and (7) storage of special tools and equipment. 30.3 PARTICULATE MATTER CONTROL DEVICE PHYSICS Controlling particulate matter (PM) emissions takes advantage of physical principles.

Pollution control equipment to remove PM makes use of several physical mechanisms: \u0081 Gravitational settling \u0081 Inertial impaction \u0081 Centrifugal inertial force \u0081 Brownian motion \u0081 Electrostatic attraction \u0081 Thermophoresis \u0081 Diffusiophoresis The importance of each varies according to the class of equipment. Each mechanism applies a combination of forces to a particle that makes it to move. The design of the control equipment takes advantage of this motion, i.e. moving the particle toward a collecting surface. Obviously, engineering must apply physical principles within a domain of uncertainty, so the more that is known about the mass and energy relationships of the particle, the air stream and the surfaces of the control equipment, the more that can be included in a design. These basic relationships are summarized as: X dvp F \u00bc mp$ap \u00bc mp (30.3) dt where, SF is the sum of all forces acting on a particle (gcms 2); mp, particle mass (g); ap, particle acceleration (cm s 2); vp, particle velocity; and t, time (s). In English units, these relationships are expressed as: X mp$ap F \u00bc (30.4) gc where, SF, sum of all forces acting on a particle (foot pounds, lbf); mp, particle mass (international avoirdupois pound, lbm), and ap, particle acceleration (ft s 2). The foot pound is the product of lbm and g0 (i.e. the standard gravitational \ufb01eld). That is, 1 lbf is equal to the force exerted by 1bm in a gravitational \ufb01eld. The gravitational constant (gc) is expressed as: lbm$ft gc \u00bc 32:2 (30.5) 2 lbf$s V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES All of these mechanisms are involved in particle movement. In practice, much of the motion that accounts for ef\ufb01cient particle removal involves three basic processes: 1. Initial capture of particles on surfaces 2. Gravity settling of solids into the hopper 3. Removal of solids from the hopper For example, high-ef\ufb01ciency particulate control systems, e.g. fabric \ufb01lters and electrostatic precipitators apply these processes; although the initial step of capturing varies considerably (e.g. one uses \ufb01ltration whereas the other uses electrostatics). Also, the means of using gravity will vary among devices. Thus, this discussion differentiates the particle collection mechanisms that control the effectiveness of initial capture of the incoming particles and gravity settling of the collected solids. The distribution of PM sizes is the \ufb01rst information that is needed when designing, selecting, and installing equipment. The type of source, operation conditions, and other factors lead to signi\ufb01cant differences in the particle size ranges, even from within the same industry or other source category.", "In addition, the type of control equipment may use the same physical mechanisms as other equipment, but in varying proportions. Indeed, technologies even within the same class, e.g. \ufb01ltration, are not limited to \ufb01lter mechanisms. For example, a pulse jet fabric \ufb01lter uses inertial impaction, Brownian motion, and electrostatic attraction to capture particles in the size range of 100 mm to less than 0.01 mm onto the accumulated layers of dust on the exterior surfaces of the bags. Thus, the bags must be cleaned regularly. Large aggregates of dust cake become dislodged from the \ufb01lter surface and drop into the hopper. These visible agglomerations of solids are several orders of magnitude larger than the individual particle, i.e. between 10,000 and 50,000 mm (1.0e5.0 cm). Thus, the aggregate mass causes them to readily fall into the hopper. Unfortunately, poor O&M, e.g. improper \ufb01lter cleaning, will allow for dislodging much smaller agglomerations; thus greatly decreasing the settling rate. This means that even with a very ef\ufb01cient capture of PM, the control equipment can become much less ef\ufb01cient if not followed by well-maintained gravity settling systems. The principle of pressure differential is crucial to particulate removal. The laws of potentiality state that \ufb02ow moves from high to low pressure. So, if pressure can decrease signi\ufb01cantly below that of the atmosphere, air will move to that pressure trough. If there is a big pressure difference between air outside and inside, the \ufb02ow will be quite rapid. So, the \u201cvacuum\u201d (it is really a pressure differential) is created inside the vacuum cleaner using an electric pump. When the air rushes to the low pressure region it carries particles with it. Increasing velocity is proportional to increasing mass and numbers of particles that can be carried. This is the same principle as the \u201ccompetence\u201d of a stream, which is high (i.e. can carry heavier loads) in a \ufb02owing river, but the competence declines rapidly at the delta where stream velocity approaches zero. This causes the river to drop its particles in descending mass, i.e. sedimentation of heavier particles \ufb01rst, but colloidal matter remaining suspended for much longer times. Two of the most common types of particle collection systems in industry are cyclones and fabric \ufb01lter systems. Both the cyclone and the fabric \ufb01lter are all designed to remove particles. In the United States, air quality standards were \ufb01rst directed at total suspended particulates (TSP) as measured by a high-volume sampler, i.e. a device that collected a large range of sizes of particles (aerodynamic diameters up to 50 mm), with added emphasis on smaller particles with time. Presently, ultra\ufb01ne particles (aerodynamic diameter 100 nm) are a major new emphasis. Some of the older PM removal systems will fall short in removing them, but will likely still need to employ the same principles mentioned above, but in different ways. For example, coarse PM will still need to be removed, but after this process, other mechanisms will be needed for the ultra\ufb01nes. Particle size is also important because of the relationship between the diameter of a sphere and the sphere\u2019s surface area. In the discussion of multistage impactors in Chapter 25 (Figure 25.25), each stage removes particles of progressively smaller diameter. The PM collected on each stage is an indication that inertial forces can be used to collect PM. As shown in Table 30.4, with each order of magnitude decrease in diameter, the surface area increases by two orders of magnitude. Thus, a 1 mm particle has six orders of magnitude greater surface area than a 1 mm particle. This difference in size-to-surface areas ratio affects sorption, which means that smaller particles will be more likely to sorb materials, including toxic compounds.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.3 PARTICULATE MATTER CONTROL DEVICE PHYSICS 30.3.1 Gravity After initial capture, gravity is the next important mechanism. Thus, the forces exerted on the particle must be calculated to estimate the extent to which a particle or clumps formed from particle aggregates can be collected by gravitational settling. These forces are the gravitational force (FG), buoyant force (FB), and the drag force (FD). The gravitational force causes the PM mass to fall.", "This is expressed as: FG \u00bc mp$g \u00bc rp$Vp$g (30.6) where, FG is the gravitational force (g cm s 2); mp, particle mass (g); g, particle acceleration due to gravity (980 cm s 2); rp, particle density (g cm 3); and Vp, particle volume (cm3). If the particle is assumed to be spherical, the volume term in Eqn (30.13) can be simpli\ufb01ed as: pd3 Vp \u00bc p (30.7) 6 where dp is the physical diameter of the particle (cm). Thus, substituting this term in Eqn (30.13) gives: pd3 r g FG \u00bc p p (30.8)6 30.3.2 Buoyancy It is important to note that the forces included in the sum of all forces in Equations 30.3 and 30.4 can be in the same or in opposite directions. A force in the opposite direction of gravity is buoyancy. Buoyancy force (BF) resists gravity, so the greater the buoyancy, the more likely a particle will remain suspended in the air. This can be expressed as: FB \u00bc mg$g \u00bc rg$Vp$g (30.9) where, FB is the buoyancy force (g cm s 2); mg, mass of displaced gas (g); g, particle acceleration due to gravity (980 cm s 2); rg, carrier gas density (g cm 3); and Vp, particle volume (cm3). Again, assuming a spherical particle, this equation can also be simpli\ufb01ed: pd3 r g FB \u00bc p g (30.10) 6 Note that FB depends on the density of the gas, which is usually air. Even in very polluted carrying gases, the gas is predominantly air. Thus, rg is on the order of 10 2 lbm ft 3; whereas the FG depends on rp, which is on the order of 102 lbm ft 3. This density difference means that in most practical situations, the buoyant force is orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational force and is usually neglected. 30.3.3 Drag As the particle begins to move downward due to FG, it encounters a resistive force that increases with increasing downward velocity. This is the third important force acting on a particle, i.e. drag force: 2 Ag$r $V2 $CD pd2 rgv $CD FD \u00bc gp \u00bc p p (30.11) 28 where, FD is the drag force (g cm s 2); Ap, cross pd2p sectional area of the particle (cm), which equals ; 4 rg,gas density(g cm 3); and CD,dragcoef\ufb01cient (dimensionless). The drag force results from the gas in front of the particle that is being displaced as the particle moves. This imparts momentum on the gas. Thus, FD equals the momentum per unit time imparted by the gas on the particle. Some of the particle velocity (vp) is imparted to the gas as gas velocity (vg). The amount of energy that vp gives to vg is related to a factor of friction, which is the drag coef\ufb01cient (CD) (see Figure 30.5). The drag coef\ufb01cient is related to particle velocity and the \ufb02ow pattern of the gas around the particle. This \ufb02ow is determined by the Reynolds number (NR or Re).a As discussed in Chapter 16, as velocity increases, a \ufb02uid\u2019s \ufb02ow ceases to be laminar and becomes turbulent. The NR is expressed as the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in a \ufb02uid: Inertial Forces NR \u00bc (30.12) Viscous Forces The inertial forces are proportional to the velocity and density of the \ufb02uid, as well as to the diameter of the conduit in which the \ufb02uid is moving. An increase in any of these factors will lead to a proportional increase in the momentum of the \ufb02owing \ufb02uid. The coef\ufb01cient of viscosity or absolute viscosity (m) represents the total viscous force of the \ufb02uid, so, NR can be calculated as: devr NR \u00bc (30.13) m where, De is the conduit\u2019s equivalent diameter, which evaluates the \ufb02uid \ufb02ow as a physical length. Recall that mr 1 is the kinematic viscosity y,so the Reynolds a Note that the symbol in Chapter 16 for the general \ufb02uid dynamics aspects of the Reynolds number is NR. The symbol Re is commonly used in air pollution science and engineering, so it is used here. The underlying theory and practice is the same; only the symbols differ. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES is referred to the online version of this book.) Adapted from: Ref. 16. number can be stated as the relationship between the size of the conduit, the average \ufb02uid velocity v,and y: dev NR \u00bc (30.14) y At very low velocities, the mass moves in discrete layers parallel to one another.", "The only movement across the \ufb02uid layers is molecular motion, which creates viscosity. Such a \ufb02ow is laminar (see Figure 16.14 in Chapter 16). The dimensionless particle Reynolds (Rep or NRp) number can also be expressed in terms similar to those of the forces, but adding gas viscosity: dpvprg Rep \u00bc (30.15) m g where, mg is the gas viscosity (g cm 1 s 1). As mentioned, three particle \ufb02ow regions exist: laminar, transition, and turbulent (see Figure 30.6). For low values of the particle Reynolds number (Rep <l), the \ufb02ow is considered laminar.b Laminar \ufb02ow is de\ufb01ned as the \ufb02ow in which the \ufb02uid moves in layers smoothly over an adjacent particle surface. For much greater values of the particle Reynolds number (e.g. Rep > 1000), the \ufb02ow is turbulent.c Turbulent \ufb02ow is characterized by erratic motion of \ufb02uid, with a violent interchange of momentum throughout the \ufb02uid near the particle surface. For particle Reynolds numbers between 1 and 1000, the \ufb02ow is in the transition region, i.e. the \ufb02ow can be either laminar or turbulent, depending on the local conditions. In most air pollution control applications, particles less than 100 mm are in the laminar \ufb02ow region. Transition and turbulent \ufb02ow conditions are relevant primarily to the gravity settling of large agglomerates in fabric \ufb01lters and electrostatic precipitators. The experimental data that are the basis for Figure 30.7 can be used to relate the values of CD and Rep as expressed in equations for each particle Reynolds region.17 The drag coef\ufb01cient in the laminar \ufb02ow region (Rep <1) is: 24 CD \u00bc (30.16) Rep b The laminar region is also known as the Stokes region. c The turbulent region is also known as the Newton region. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.3 PARTICULATE MATTER CONTROL DEVICE PHYSICS The drag coef\ufb01cient in the transition \ufb02ow region (1 < Rep < 1000) is: 18:5 CD \u00bc Re0:6 p (30.17) The drag coef\ufb01cient in the turbulent \ufb02ow region (Rep> 1000) is: CD \u00bc 0:44 (30.18) These equations apply to particles with diameters >3 mm, i.e. those where the gas is continuous around the particle. For smaller particles, the gas appears as distinct molecules. Such small-diameter particles can slip between the gas molecules, which means they fall faster than relationships developed for continuous media predict. English mathematician Ebenezer Cunningham deduced in 1910 that the drag coef\ufb01cient should be reduced for small particles.18 This means that the drag coef\ufb01cient equation for the laminar region must be modi\ufb01ed to include a term called the Cunningham slip correction factor (Cc): 24 CD \u00bc (30.19) Rep$CC An approximation of the slip correction (see Figure 30.6) can be based on the temperature and the particle diameter: 6:21 104T CC \u00bc 1 \u00fe (30.20) dp where T is the absolute temperature (K) and dp, the particle diameter (mm). Applying the slip corrections and substituting terms allow drag forces to be calculated for each \ufb02ow region. The drag force for the laminar region is: 3pmgvpdpFD \u00bc (30.21) CC The drag force for the transition \ufb02ow region is: 1:4$m 0:60:4 FD \u00bc 2:30 dp$vp $r (30.22) gg The drag force for the turbulent \ufb02ow region is: FD \u00bc 0:05p dp$vp2$r (30.23) g where, mg is the gas viscosity (g cm 1 s 1); dp, particle diameter (cm); rg, gas density (g cm 3); vp, particle velocity relative to the gas (cm s 1); and CC, Cunningham slip factor (dimensionless). With buoyancy not a factor, the two forces dominating particle deposition are gravity and drag. As the particle accelerates, its velocity increases. As shown in Figure 30.6, gravity and drag work against one another, either keeping the particle suspended and moving it toward settling. Thus, another way of considering Eqn (30.3) is to show when this balance is achieved when the two forces are equal: X dvp F \u00bc FG FD \u00bc mp$ap \u00bc mp \u00bc 0 (30.24) dt The drag force on the particle also increases with increasing velocity. At some point, velocity will become high enough that the drag force will be as large as the gravitational force. At this point, the gravitational and drag force balance, i.e. the net force is zero, and the particle will no longer accelerate, reaching a constant velocity. This constant velocity is known as the terminal settling velocity (vt). Terminal velocities differ for the three regions and can be derived by substituting the terms: g$CC$rp$d2p Laminar flow: vt \u00bc (30.25) 18m g 0:71$r 0:71$d1:14 0:153g ppTransition flow: vf \u00bc (30.26) 0:43 0:29 mg", "$rg V.

They are particularly useful for gravity settling to remove large agglomerated masses or clumps of dust that have been collected on fabric \ufb01lter, precipitator plates, or other collection surfaces. These large clumps of material have high terminal settling velocities (e.g. the bottom rows in Table 30.5). Another important force that acts in similar way as gravitation is centrifugal force. This is discussed in detail later in this chapter. 30.3.4 Particle Morphology The assumption in these force equations that a particle is spherical, however, is not actually the case in most air pollutant scenarios.", "Indeed, another particle characteristic that in\ufb02uences removal is the relationship between aerodynamic diameter and shape or morphology. For example, the settling velocities in Table 30.5 are assumed to be for spheres, but these values would differ for other shapes. The unit-density sphere mentioned in the table\u2019s caption is a correction for both density, i.e. rp \u00bc 1gcm 3 \u00bc the density of water at STP and the condition of the air (i.e. calm), but should also be corrected for the different morphology of a particle compared to that of a sphere. Few particles are spheres; however, so particles that appear to be different in physical size and shape can have the same aerodynamic diameter, as shown in Table 30.6. Conversely, some particles that appear similar can have somewhat different aerodynamic diameters. Particles can be spheres, hollow spheres, irregular shapes, \ufb02akes, \ufb01bers, aggregates, and condensation \ufb02ocs.19 30.3.5 Mechanisms of Particulate Removal The principal PM removal technologies are inertial and gravitational separation, fabric \ufb01ltration, and electro-magnetics. Filtration is an important technology in every aspect of environmental engineering (i.e. air pollution, wastewater treatment, drinking water, and even hazardous waste and sediment cleanup). Basically, \ufb01ltration consists of four mechanical processes: (1) diffusion, (2) interception, (3) inertial impaction, and (4) electrostatics (see Figure 6.33 in Chapter 6). Diffusion is important only for very small particles (<0.1 mm diameter) because the Brownian motion allows them to move in a \u201crandom walk\u201d away from the air stream. Interception works mainly for particles with diameters between 0.1 and 1 mm. The particle does not leave the air stream but comes into contact with the \ufb01lter medium (e.g. a strand of \ufb01berglass or fabric \ufb01ber). Inertial impaction, as explained in the cyclone discussion, collects particles suf\ufb01ciently large to leave the air stream by inertia (diameters >1 mm). Electrostatics consist of electrical interactions between the atoms in the \ufb01lter and those in the particle at the point of contact (Van der Waal\u2019s force), as well as electrostatic attraction (charge differences between particle and \ufb01lter medium). These are the processes at work in large-scale electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) that are employed in coal-\ufb01red power plant stacks around the world for particle removal. Other important factors affecting \ufb01ltration ef\ufb01ciencies include the thickness and pore diameter or the \ufb01lter, the uniformity of particle diameters and pore sizes, the solid volume fraction, the rate of particle loading onto the \ufb01lter (e.g. affecting particle \u201cbounce\u201d), the particle phase (liquid or solid), capillarity and surface tension (if either the particle or the \ufb01lter media are coated with a liquid), and characteristics of air or other carrier gases, such as velocity, temperature, pressure, and viscosity. Environmental engineers have been using \ufb01ltration to treat air and water for several decades. Air pollution controls employing fabric \ufb01lters (i.e. baghouses), remove particles from the air stream by passing the air through a porous fabric. The fabric \ufb01lter is ef\ufb01cient at removing \ufb01ne particles and can exceed ef\ufb01ciencies of 99%. Based solely on an extrapolation of air pollution control equipment, a \ufb01lter should be better than a cyclone. However, this does not take into operational ef\ufb01ciencies and effectiveness, which are very important to the consumer and the engineer. Changing the bag and insuring that it does not exceed its capacity must be monitored closely by the V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES TABLE 30.6 Morphology\u2019s Effect on Particle Diameter (d) and Density (rp) for Three Particles with the Same Aerodynamic Diameter (dp) Adapted from: Ref. 19. user. Also, the ef\ufb01ciency of the equipment is only as good as the materials being used. For example, a \ufb01lter\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency depends on interception, inertial impaction, and electromagnetics; and to a lesser extent diffusion. However, the cyclone only requires optimization for inertia. Selecting the correct control device is a matter of optimizing ef\ufb01ciencies. In some environments, e.g. research \u201cclean rooms\u201d in laboratories and assembly operations (e.g. semiconductors, high-ef\ufb01ciency particle air (HEPA)), \ufb01lters are \ufb01tted to equipment to enhance removal ef\ufb01ciency. Ef\ufb01ciency is often expressed as a percentage. So a 99.99% HEPA \ufb01lter is ef\ufb01cient enough to remove 99.99% particles from the air stream. This means that if 10,000 particles enter the \ufb01lter, on average only one particle would pass all the way through the \ufb01lter.", "This is exactly the same concept that we use for incinerator ef\ufb01ciency, but it is known as destruction removal ef\ufb01ciency (DRE), since it depends on at least two forms of energy: (1) thermal destruction of pollutants into simpler, less toxic compounds; and (2).motion for the physical removal of the breakdown products. For example, in the United States, federal standards require that hazardous compounds can only be incinerated if the process is 99.99% ef\ufb01cient, and for the more toxic compounds (i.e. \u201cextremely hazardous wastes\u201d) the so-called \u201crule of six nines\u201d applies (i.e. DRE >99.9999%). Thus, if 10 mg min of a hazardous compound is fed The HEPA and DRE calculations are simply restate ments of Eqn (30.1): DRE or HEPA efficiency \u00bc Min Mout 100 (30.28) Min 1 into the incinerator, only 0.001 mg min 1 \u00bc 1 mg min 1 is allowed to exit the stack for a hazardous waste. If the waste is an extremely hazardous waste, only 1 11 0.00001 mg min \u00bc 0.01 mgmin \u00bc 10 ng min is allowed to exit the stack. This is the same concept that is used throughout environmental engineering to calculate treatment and removal ef\ufb01ciencies. For example, assume that raw wastewater enters a treatment facility with 300 mg l 1 biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), 200 mg l 1 suspended solids (SS), and 10 mg l 1 phosphorous (P). If the plant must meet ef\ufb02uent standards 11 1 of <10 mg l BOD5, <10mgl SS, and <1mgl P, the removal rates of these contaminants must be 97% V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.4 REMOVAL OF DRY PM for BOD5, 95% for SS, and 90% for P, respectively. The pure ef\ufb01ciency values may be misleading because the ease of removal can vary signi\ufb01cantly with each contaminant. In this case, gravitational settling in the primary stages of the treatment plant can remove most of the SS, and the secondary treatment stage removes most of the BOD, but more complicated, tertiary treatment is needed for removing most of the nutrient P. Although the\ufb01ne andultra\ufb01nePMhavereceived the largest focus recently, there remain important reasons to remove the mass in the coarse fraction of particles, i.e. ranging between 2.5 and 10 mmaerodynamic diameter. These may consist of potentially toxic components, for example, resuspended road dust, brake lining residues, industrial byproducts, tire residues, heavy metals, and aerosols generated by organisms spores (known as \u201cbioaerosols\u201d), such as tree pollen and mold spores. A large fraction of these coarse particles may deposit to the upper airways, causing health scientists to link them to asthma. And, since asthma appears to be increasing in children, their role in triggering asthma and other respiratory diseases needs to address a compliment of ultra\ufb01ne, \ufb01ne, and coarse particles. Thus, equipment selection has been complicated by some fairly simple technical speci\ufb01cations. Ef\ufb01ciency is an important part of effectiveness, although the two terms are not synonymous. As we discussed, ef\ufb01ciency is simply a metric of what you get out of a system compared to what you put in. However, you can have a bunch of very ef\ufb01cient systems that may in to be ineffective. They are all working well as designed, but they may not be working on the right things, or their overall con\ufb01guration is not optimal to solve the problem at hand. So, the correct control device is the one that gives not only optimal ef\ufb01ciency, but also that effectively addresses the speci\ufb01c pollution problem at hand. 30.4 REMOVAL OF DRY PM The moisture content and stickiness of the air stream and particles are very important factors on equipment selection. Generally, dry aerosols differ so much from the carrier gas stream that their removal should present no major dif\ufb01culties. The aerosol is different physically, chemically, and electrically from the gas in which it is suspended. It has vastly different inertial properties than the carrying gas stream and can be subjected to an electric charge. It may be soluble in a speci\ufb01c liquid. With such a variety of removal mechanisms that can be applied, it is not surprising that PM, such as mineral dust, can be removed by a \ufb01lter, wet scrubber, or ESP with equally satisfactory results. 30.4.1 Inertial Collectors Inertial collectors, which include cyclones, baf\ufb02es, louvers, and rotating impellers, operate on the principle that the aerosol material in the carrying gas stream has a greater inertia than the gas.", "Since the drag forces on the particle are a function of the diameter squared and the inertial forces are a function of the diameter cubed, it follows that as the particle diameter increases, the inertial (removal) force becomes relatively greater. Inertial collectors, therefore, are most ef\ufb01cient for larger particles. The inertia is also a function of the mass of the particle, so that heavier particles are more ef\ufb01ciently removed by inertial collectors. These facts explain why an inertial collector will be highly ef\ufb01cient for removal of 10-mm rock dust and very inef\ufb01cient for 5-mm wood particles. It would be very ef\ufb01cient, though, for 75-mm wood particles. The most common inertial collector is the cyclone, which is used in two basic forms: the tangential inlet and the axial inlet (see Figure 30.8). In actual industrial practice, the tangential inlet type is usually a large (1e5 m in diameter) single cyclone, while the axial inlet cyclone is relatively small (about 20 cm in diameter and arranged in parallel units for the desired capacity). For any cyclone, regardless of type, the radius of motion (i.e. curvature), the particle mass, and the particle velocity determine the centrifugal force exerted on the particle. This centrifugal force may be expressed as F \u00bc MA (30.29) Dust outlet V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES where, F is the force (centrifugal); M, mass of the particle; and A, acceleration (centrifugal), and V2 A \u00bc (30.30) R where V, the velocity of particle; and R, the radius of curvature. Therefore: MV2 F \u00bc (30.31) R Other types of inertial collectors which might be used for particulate separation from a carrying gas stream depend on the same theoretical principles developed for cyclones. Table 30.7 summarizes the effect of the common variables on inertial collector performance. Although decreasing the radius of curvature and increasing the gas velocity both result in increased ef\ufb01ciency, the same changes cause increased pressure drop through the collector. Design of inertial collectors for maximum ef\ufb01ciency at minimum cost and minimum pressure drop is a problem which lends itself to computer optimization. Unfortunately, many inertial collectors, including the majority of the large single cyclones, have been designed to \ufb01t a standard-sized sheet of metal rather than a speci\ufb01c application and gas velocity. As tighter emission standards are adopted, the major use of inertial collectors will be to preclean in front of more sophisticated \ufb01ne PM and gas control devices. In a cyclone (Figure 30.9), air is rapidly circulated causing suspended particles to change directions. Due to their inertia, the particles continue in their original direction and leave the air stream (see Figure 30.10). This works well for larger particles because of their relatively large masses (and greater inertia), but very \ufb01ne particles are more likely to remain in the air stream and stay suspended. The dusty air is introduced in the cyclone from the top through the inlet pipe tangential to the cylindrical portion of the cyclone. The air whirls TABLE 30.7 Effect of Independent Variables on Inertial Collection Effciency Independent Variable Increase or Decrease of Concern to Improve Ef\ufb01ciency Radius of curvature Decrease Mass of particle Increase Particle diameter Increase Particle surface/volume ratio Decrease Gas velocity Increase Gas viscosity Decrease (A) Cleaned air Polluted carrier gas dust dust FIGURE 30.9 Schematic of simple cyclone separators: (A) Top inlet type; (B) Bottom inlet type.

Air Pollution Control Orientation Course, http://www.epa.gov/air/oaqps/eog/course422/ce6.html; accessed November 30, 2013. gas downward to form a peripheral vortex, which creates centrifugal forces. As a result, individual particles are hurled toward the cyclone wall and, after impact, fall downward where they are collected in a hopper. When the air reaches the end of the conical segment, it will change direction and move upward toward the outlet. This forms an inner vortex. The upward air\ufb02ow against gravitation allows for additional separation of particles. The cyclone vacuum cleaner applies the same inertial principles, with the collected dust hitting the sides of the removable cyclone separator and falling to its bottom. 30.4.1.1 Centrifugal Force in a Cyclone The geometry of pollution control equipment is important. For example, circular designs are usually preferable to avoid pockets of zero to very low air\ufb02ows, which can attract PM and increase the frequency of cleaning.", "In addition, inertial forces are often very effective when PM-laden air \ufb02ows in a circular route within a cylinder (see Figure 30.11). The approach used to estimate terminal settling velocity due to gravity can be used for the motion of a particle due to centrifugal force (FC). The drag and centrifugal forces balance at some point: X F \u00bc FC FD \u00bc 0 (30.32) 2 mpn s FC \u00bc (30.33) R where FC is the centrifugal force (g cm s 2); mp, particle mass (g); ns, tangential velocity of the gas (cm s 1); and R, radial position of the particle (cm).

AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES n term s is similar to the g (gravitational constant) term R used to calculate gravitational settling. The particle mass can also be expressed in terms of particle density and volume: 2 pd3p rpns FC \u00bc (30.34)6R where, dp is the physical particle density (cm) and rp, particle density (g cm 3). And, for \ufb01ne PM with laminar Reynolds numbers, the drag force is: 3pmgnpdpFD \u00bc (30.35) CC Equations (30.30) and (30.31) can be substituted into Eqn (30.28) to \ufb01nd particle\u2019s velocity in the cylinder: CCd2 rns vp \u00bc p p (30.36) 18m R g Thus, the particle velocity across the air streamlines and its velocity moving toward the walls of the cyclone are proportional to the square of the particle\u2019s diameter. (A) (B) (C) As is the case for settling velocities, the larger the particle the more effective the cyclone will be at PM removal. Also, no matter the size, the radial velocity of the particle is proportional to the square of the air-stream tangential velocity and inversely proportional to the radius of the cyclone. Thus, when selecting a cyclone system, these factors need to be known, since they determine the amount of spin within the cyclone. Higher air-stream velocities will increase radial velocities, which increase the amount of PM collected. It is important not to \u201coversize\u201d a cyclone, since a small radius causes a sharper turn of the air stream, which improves cyclone PM collection ef\ufb01ciencies. 30.4.1.2 Inertial Impaction A moving particle in the air stream can come into contact with surfaces of stationary and slower moving objects. The air-stream \ufb02ows around the object, but due to the particle\u2019s inertia the particle is displaced across the air-stream lines. As such, it moves into the object and, if there is suf\ufb01cient inertia, contacts the object and is captured (see Figure 30.12). The object can be a plate or other target surface. Particle V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.4 REMOVAL OF DRY PM Note the similarities of the inertial force competing with the drag force to the gravitational and centrifugal forces discussed earlier. Indeed, impaction ef\ufb01ciencies may be evaluated with the same approaches used for gravitational and centrifugal forces. For particles with Re <1, impaction effectiveness can relate to a dimensionless inertial impaction parameter (J), calculated as: CCd23ypr J \u00bc p p (30.37) 18mgDC where, CC is the Cunningham slip correction factor (dimensionless); dp, physical particle diameter (cm); yp, difference in velocity and collection object (cm s 1); DC, diameter of the collection object (cm); rp, density of particle; and mg, gas velocity (g cm 1 s 1). If the Stokes number (Stk) is used as the inertial impaction parameter rather than J, the parameter will be twice the value calculated in Eqn (30.37) since, rather than a coef\ufb01cient of 18 in the denominator, the Stk denominator has a coef\ufb01cient of 9. With increasing J values, particles are more likely to move radially toward a collection surface. Conversely, smaller J values mean that the particle is likely to remain in the air stream and miss the target collection surface. Therefore, larger diameter, faster moving, and denser particles are more likely to be captured by inertial impaction. Also, smaller collection targets (e.g. \ufb01ne wires or \ufb01lter \ufb01bers) increase the likelihood of inertial capture. 30.4.1.3 Brownian Motion", "As mentioned, molecular diffusion is only an important collection mechanism for very small particles (e.g. <0.2 mm diameters). These ultra\ufb01ne PM or nanoparticles can be de\ufb02ected slightly by coming into contact with gas molecules. This de\ufb02ection is the result of kinetic energy from fast-moving gas molecule imposed upon the small particle. The dimensionless diffusional collection parameter (JD) is analogous to the inertial impaction parameter discussed in the previous section: Xp JD \u00bc (30.38) DCnp where, Xp is the particle diffusivity (cm2 s 1); DC, collection target\u2019s diameter (cm); and np, relative velocity between the particle and the target object. Particle diffusivity is expressed as: CCkT Xp \u00bc (30.39) 3pmgdp where, k is the Boltzmann constant (g cm2 s 1 K 1); CC, Cunningham slip correction factor (dimensionless); dp, particle\u2019s physical diameter; T, absolute temperature (K); and mg, gas viscosity (g cm 1 s 1). As JD increases, so does the tendency of a particletobecollected by applying Brownian motion. Thus, very small particles in low viscosity gases are the best candidates for collection by molecular diffusive processes. However, the additional collection provided by diffusion becomes negligible above 0.3 mm diameter. 30.4.1.4 Electrostatic Mechanisms Field charging and diffusion (or ion) charging are employed in PM collection equipment. Field charging works best for particles larger than 2 mm, with collection rapidly diminishing with decreasing diameter. The opposite is true for diffusion charging. Diffusion charging is most effective for particles with diameters <0.4 mm, and improves with diminishing diameters. Diffusion charging occurs from collisions between particles and unipolar ions in the air stream. The collisions result from random walks (Brownian) of both ions and very small particles. The diffusion charging continues until the surface gains particles that have suf\ufb01cient charge to repel the ions. Diffusion charging needs no electrical \ufb01eld, but if one exists it will in\ufb02uence particles that have acquired a charge. The charged particles will move according to the electrical \ufb01eld lines in the direction of the lower \ufb01eld strength. Thus, the collection surface would ideally have a large charge differential with the particles. Field charging results from the creation of a strong electrical \ufb01eld having a high unipolar ion concentration. The ions need a large enough mass to cause local disruptions of the electrical \ufb01eld lines. The ions travel toward the particle surface along the \ufb01eld lines intersecting the particle. The electrical charge transfer will continue until the particle has an electrical \ufb01eld strength suf\ufb01cient to repel the electric \ufb01eld (i.e. it has reached a saturation charge). The number of charges imparted to a particle from \ufb01eld charging is a function of square of the particle diameter. This charge level is reached rapidly and, once charged, the particles are strongly in\ufb02uenced by the electrical \ufb01eld that makes for a force toward the collection surface. The particle charge is often expressed as the product of the number of charges (n) times the smallest unit of charge (i.e. the charge of an electron, which is 4.8 10 10 statcoulombs). The force on a particle with n units of charge in an electric \ufb01eld (E)is expressed as: FE \u00bc n$e$E (30.40) V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES where, FE is the electrostatic charge (dyne); n, number of charges; e, charge of electron (4.8 10 10 statcoulombs); and E, electrical \ufb01eld strength (statvolts cm 1). Electric \ufb01elds create forces orders of magnitude greater than gravity. The particle velocities within electric \ufb01elds can be estimated in the same way as gravity settling and centrifugal force: FE FD \u00bc 0 (30.41) 3pmgdpnpkT n$e$E \u00bc 0 (30.42) CC The migration or drift velocity toward the collecting service (u) applies to particles in the laminar \ufb02ow region. For Rep > 1, the mathematics become much more complicated. This migration is expressed as: n$e$E$CC u \u00bc (30.43) 3pmgdpnp For example,d what is the migration velocity of a 2 mm unit-density particle carrying 800 units of charge in an electric \ufb01eld of 2 kV cm 1? The gas temperature is20 C. \u0081 To solve this problem, the following relationships are used: \u0081 300 V \u00bc 1 statvolt \u0081 1 statvolt \u00bc 1 statcoulomb cm 1 \u0081 1 dyne \u00bc 1 statcoulomb2 cm 2 \u00bc 1g cms 2 \u0081 CC \u00bc 1.09 (as calculated in Example 4-2)", "The electric \ufb01eld in centimeteregramesecond units is: kV v statvolt statvolts E \u00bc 2 \u00bc 2000 \u00bc 6:67 cm cm 300 volts cm statcoulom bs \u00bc 6:67 2 cm 30.4.1.5 Thermophoresis and Diffusiophoresis The remaining forces on particles that can be deployed for pollutant collection are thermophoresis and diffusiophoresis; both relatively weak compared to those already discussed.17 Temperature differences on either side of a particle can lead to particle movement, i.e. thermophoresis. The particle is de\ufb02ected toward the colder side, since energy is transported from higher to lower potentials. Similarly, a particle can move due to differences in concentrations of molecules in one part of a particle than another. This difference leads to an increase in molecular collisions, with the particle moving toward the region of lower concentration. The major means of achieving diffusiophoresis is to use water vapor that is migrating with the bulk air stream toward colder liquid (e.g. scrubber liquid) onto which the water condenses. An air stream with 15% H2O vapor by volume and liquid with relatively constant low temperature can enhance collection ef\ufb01ciency substantially. For example, a study found that after a 30 inches of water column (in WC), pressure drop venturi downstream from an industrial incinerator had removed 90% of the PM and cooled the gases to 77 C water and saturated the air stream with H2O vapor, further cooling the air stream to 27 C in a 3-m counter current packed-bed cooling tower cooled removed another 60% of \ufb01ne PM.20 Thus, if condensation or evaporation of water is taking place, phoresis can make for particle movement. High moisture conditions lead to temperature and concentration gradients. However, typical temperature and concentration conditions in a gas stream lead to very little phoresis, so extra measures, such as the packed-bed cooling tower mentioned above, need to be provided. 30.4.1.6 Net Effects of Forces For most dry pollutant collection scenarios, particle size is the key factor.

Again, this illustrates that electrical \ufb01elds can pro-tional settling. Particles with diameters ranging from vide much larger force than gravity. 10 mm to 100 mm, respond well to inertial and electrical d This example is taken from: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. APTI 413: control of particulate matter emissions. Chapter 4: particle collection mechanisms; 2012. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.4 REMOVAL OF DRY PM forces, i.e. proportional to the square of the particle diameter. However, the ef\ufb01ciencies diminish dramatically with smaller diameters, to a point where molecular diffusion becomes a force of choice for very small particles (<0.3 mm diameters).17 Of course, a quick perusal of the equations in this chapter would indicate that no single parameter dictates the choice of the equipment. For example, gas velocity and electrical \ufb01eld strengths can be modulated to improve PM collection substantially. 30.4.2 Filtration A \ufb01lter removes PM from the carrying gas stream because the particulate impinges on and then adheres to the \ufb01lter material. As time passes, the deposit of PM becomes greater and the deposit itself then acts as a \ufb01ltering medium. When the deposit becomes so heavy that the pressure necessary to force the gas through the \ufb01lter becomes excessive, or the \ufb02ow reduction severely impairs the process, the \ufb01lter must either be replaced or cleaned. The \ufb01lter medium can be \ufb01brous, such as cloth; granular, such as sand; a rigid solid, such as a screen; or a mat, such as a felt pad. It can be in the shape of a tube, sheet, bed, \ufb02uidized bed, or any other desired form. The material can be natural or man-made \ufb01bers, granules, cloth, felt, paper, metal, ceramic, glass, or plastic. It is not surprising that \ufb01lters are manufactured in an in\ufb01nite variety of types, sizes, shapes, and materials. The theory of \ufb01ltration of aerosols from a gas stream is much more involved than the sieving action which removes particles in a liquid medium. The mechanisms mentioned in Chapter 6 and shown in Figure 6.33 account for the \ufb01ltration of most particles, although diffusion is important only for very small particles. Note that the particles are often depicted as spheres (e.g. in Figures 6.33 and 30.10).", "In practice, the particles and \ufb01lter elements are seldom spheres or cylinders. Thus, decisions on the optimal equipment should not simply be based on size and mass, but also morphology of the particles. Direct interception occurs when the \ufb02uid streamline carrying the particle passes within one-half of a particle diameter of the \ufb01lter element. Regardless of the particle\u2019s size, mass or inertia, it will be collected if the streamline passes suf\ufb01ciently close. Inertial impaction occurs when the particle would miss the \ufb01lter element if it followed the streamline, but its inertia resists the change in direction taken by the gas molecules and it continues in a suf\ufb01ciently direct course to be collected by the \ufb01lter element. Electrostatic attraction occurs because the particle, the \ufb01lter, or both possess suf\ufb01cient electrical charge to overcome the inertial forces; the particle is then collected instead of passing the \ufb01lter element. Note that size separation (\u201csieving\u201d) plays little or no role in \ufb01ltration. 30.4.2.1 Filter Ef\ufb01ciency Particles can be measured as either mass or count. Particle count is the number of particles in a given band of mass, such as particles with aerodynamic diameters greater than 10 mm (coarse fraction), those with diameters less than 10 mm, but greater than 2.5 mm(PM10 fraction), and those with diameters less than 2.5 mm(PM2.5 fraction, also known as the \ufb01ne fraction). However, the bands can be further subdivided. For example, there has been concern recently about the so-called \u201cnanoparticles\u201d. These have diameters less than 100 nm. Filtration is the most common method used to measure particles in the air. So, a sample, taken from a \ufb01lter could show bands within the \ufb01ne fraction, may resemble that shown in Table 30.8. Since \ufb01ltration is important in both measuring and controlling particle matter, expressions of \ufb01lter ef\ufb01ciency are crucial to air pollution technologies. Equation (30.3) provides the overall ef\ufb01ciency of any air pollution removal equipment. The ef\ufb01ciency (E) equation can be restated speci\ufb01cally for particles: Nin Nout E \u00bc (30.44) Nin TABLE 30.8 Mass of Particles Collected on a Filter (Fictitious Data) Size Range (mm) Count (Number of Particles) Mass (mg) Flow Rate L3(l min) Integration Time (min) Mass Concentration L3(mgm ) Description >10 2 100 16 60 96 Re-entrained dust >2.5 < 10 20 10 16 60 9.6 Tailpipe emission >0.01 < 2.5 200 1 16 60 0.96 Suspended colloids >0.01 20,000 0.1 16 60 0.096 Nanoparticles; mainly carbon (fullerenes \u00bc C-60) V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES Cin Cout E \u00bc (30.45)Cin where, N is the number of particles (count) and C is the mass concentration (subscripts: in, entering; out, exiting). Pollution control equipment often characterizes ef\ufb01ciency in terms of the fraction entering versus that exiting the \ufb01lter known as particle penetration (P): Nout P \u00bc\u00bc 1 E (30.46)Nin Cout P \u00bc\u00bc 1 E (30.47)Cin Since P is the inverse of E, an inef\ufb01cient \ufb01lter is one that allows a large number or mass of particles to penetrate the \ufb01lter. Thus, the air pollution engineer needs to specify the tolerances for \ufb01ltration in any design of measurement or control technologies. Inherent to penetration calculations is the velocity of air entering the system. The front (entry side) of the \ufb01lter is known as the face, so face velocity (U0) is the air\u2019s velocity just before the air enters the \ufb01lter: Q U0 \u00bc (30.48) A where, Q is the volumetric \ufb02ow and A is the area of the cross section through which the air is passing. However, since the \ufb02ow is restricted to the void spaces of the \ufb01lter, the actual velocity in the \ufb01lter itself is higher than the face velocity (same air mass through less volume). This is true for \ufb02ow through any porous medium, such as polyurethane traps (see Figure 11.2 in Chapter 11) and columns of sorbant granules, like XAD resins (see Figure 11.3 in Chapter 11). Thus the velocity within the \ufb01lter (U\ufb01lter) is: Q Ufilter \u00bc (30.49) A\u00f01 a\u00de where a is the packing density (solidity),e which is inverse to the \ufb01lter (or trap) porosity: Vff a \u00bc\u00bc 1 f (30.50)Vtotal where, Vff is the \ufb01lter \ufb01ber volume; Vtotal, total \ufb01lter volume; and 4, porosity. The \ufb01lter con\ufb01guration is similar to that of a sieve; however, \ufb01lters are quite different from sieves, given that size separation is not even listed as one of the mechanisms for PM removal.", "In fact, \ufb01brous \ufb01lters are more akin to numerous microscopic layers of \ufb01lters, each with a speci\ufb01c probability of catching a particle, depending on the particle\u2019s shape and size. Therefore, the ef\ufb01ciency is enhanced with \ufb01lter thickness. Thus, size capture is not one of the most important mechanisms for collection, compared to inertial impaction, interception, and electrostatics. Other less important mechanisms that result in aerosol removal by \ufb01lters are (1) gravitational settling due to the difference in mass of the aerosol and the carrying gas, (2) thermal precipitation due to the temperature gradient between a hot gas stream and the cooler \ufb01lter medium which causes the particles to be bombarded more vigorously by the gas molecules on the side away from the \ufb01lter element, and (3) Brownian deposition as the particles are bombarded with gas molecules that may cause enough movement to permit the aerosol to come into contact with the \ufb01lter element. Brownian motion may also cause some of the particles to miss the \ufb01lter element because they are moved away from it as they pass by. Regardless of the mechanism which causes the aerosol to come in contact with the \ufb01lter element, it will be removed from the air stream only if it adheres to the surface. Aerosols arriving later at the \ufb01lter element may then, in turn, adhere to the collected aerosol instead of the \ufb01lter element. The result is that actual aerosol removal seldom agrees with theoretical calculations. One should also consider that certain particles do not adhere to the \ufb01lter element even though they touch it. As time passes, the heavier deposits on the \ufb01lter surface will be dislodged more easily than the light deposits, resulting in increased re-entrainment. Because of plugging of the \ufb01lter with time, the apparent size of the \ufb01lter element increases, causing more interception and impaction. The contravening effects of all of these variables on the particle buildup and re-entrainment are shown in Figure 30.13. In this hypothetical example, the net aerosol collection ef\ufb01ciency actually increases slightly compared to that of the clean \ufb01lter (time \u00bc 0); due to the combination of attractions to \ufb01lter element and newly deposit mass onto the \ufb01lter elements. After time, however, the re-entrainment of deposits decreases the \ufb01lter ef\ufb01ciency, leading to the time when \ufb01lters become much less ef\ufb01cient and need cleaning and replacement. 30.4.2.2 Fabric Filter System Con\ufb01gurations The types of industrial \ufb01ltration systems vary considerably. Fabric \ufb01lters, commonly known as baghouses, e Packing density is analogous to bulk density in soil science, i.e. inversely proportional to porosity. Bulk density is calculated as the dry weight of soil divided by its volume. The volume includes that of the soil particles and the pores among particles, often expressed in g cm 3. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.4 REMOVAL OF DRY PM 100% 0% FIGURE 30.13 Change of \ufb01ltration ef\ufb01ciency Efficiency based only on with time. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the increased filter deposits reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Actual net efficiency can be highly ef\ufb01cient in removing PM. Filtration technologies have continuously improved from the early versions in the mid-twentieth century, with some systems ef\ufb01ciently removing ultra\ufb01ne (w100 nm diameter) particles. The mechanisms include those discussed under inertia separations systems, e.g. impaction, electrostatics, and molecular (Brownian) diffusion. Like other air pollution control equipment, \ufb01ltration is only as ef\ufb01cient as the O&M allows, with \ufb01lters susceptible to chemical degradation, physical damage (e.g. punctures, \ufb02exing, and abrasion) and thermal breakdown. Chemical, physical, and thermal susceptibility vary by \ufb01lter materials (see Table 30.9). In addition, dust cake \ufb01ssures can allow excessive penetration. Also, problems can result during cleaning and bag replacement, such as excessive pressure drop. A common con\ufb01guration of a fabric \ufb01lter system, i.e. the shaker \ufb01lter, is shown in Figure 30.14. The \ufb01lter bags are fabricated from woven material, with the material and weave selected to \ufb01t the speci\ufb01c application. Cotton and synthetic fabrics are used for relatively low temperatures, and glass cloth fabrics can be used for elevated temperatures, up to 290 C. The basic operating principle of all fabric \ufb01lters is that they capture particles directly in the \ufb01lter material or in the dust layers that form on these materials. Thus, the \ufb01rst mechanism at work is inertial impaction, which is quite effective for capturing PM with diameters TABLE 30.9 Thermal and Acid Resistance of Common Fabric Filter Materials Maximum Temperature", "( F) Filter Material Common or Trade Name Continuous Surges Acid Resistance Resistance to Abrasion and Flex Natural \ufb01ber, cellulose Cotton 180 225 Poor Good Polyole\ufb01n Polyole\ufb01n 190 200 Good to excellent Excellent Polypropylene Polypropylene 200 225 Excellent Excellent Polyamide &#1;Nylon 200 225 Excellent Excellent Acrylic &#1;Orlon 240 260 Good Good Polyester &#1;Dacron 275 325 Good Excellent Aromatic polyamide &#1;Nomex 400 425 Fair Excellent Polyphenylene sul\ufb01de &#1;Ryton 400 425 Good Excellent Polyimide &#1;P-84 400 425 Good Excellent Fiberglass Fiberglass 500 550 Fair Fair Fluorocarbon &#1;Te\ufb02on 400 500 Excellent Fair Stainless steel Stainless steel 750 900 Good Excellent Ceramic &#1;Nextel 1300 1400 Good Fair Source: Ref. 21. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES 1 mm, given the tortuosity of the pathways taken by particles and the many opportunities to contact objects, i.e. myriad situations like those depicted in Figure 30.12(C). Static charge also builds in the fabric and dust cake, so electrostatic attraction also adds PM capture ef\ufb01ciency. However, since the charges can be either negative or positive, particles will oscillate between attraction and repulsion depending on the net charge differential between the \ufb01lter and particles. Opposite or neutral polarity leads to particle attraction. Size separation or sieving can also add to PM capture after a dust layer forms.21 Brownian diffusion can add to the attraction of very small particles, especially given the protracted time and length required to traverse the \ufb01lter and dust cake. In addition, the pore spaces are quite small, so the distance to surfaces is small enough that the diffusion path is very short. The \ufb01ltration collection curve is somewhat U-shaped, i.e. \ufb01lters collect large and very small particles. Filtration is very ef\ufb01cient for PM10 and larger particles and reasonably ef\ufb01cient for ultra\ufb01nes (<100 nm), but not nearly as ef\ufb01cient for those particles in between. And, these ef\ufb01ciencies only occur after a suf\ufb01cient dust layer forms on the \ufb01lter material. Thus, ef\ufb01ciency is decreased substantially after cleaning or installation of new fabric. Thus, the cleaning schedule must be optimized between preventing excessive blockage and destroying ef\ufb01cient dust cake layers. Other types of industrial \ufb01ltration systems include (1) \ufb01xed beds or layers of granular material such as coke or sand; some of the original designs for cleaning large quantities of gases from smelters and acid plants involved passing the gases through such beds; (2) plain, treated, or charged mats or pads (common throwaway air \ufb01lters used for hot air furnaces and for air conditioners are of this type); (3) paper \ufb01lters of multiple plies and folds to increase \ufb01lter ef\ufb01ciency and area (the throwaway dry air \ufb01lters used on automotive engines are of this type); (4) rigid porous beds which can be made of metal, plastic, or porous ceramic (these materials are most ef\ufb01cient for removal of large particles such as the 30 mm particles from a wood sanding operation); and (5) \ufb02uidized beds in which the granular material of the V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.4 REMOVAL OF DRY PM bed is made to act as a \ufb02uid by the gas passing through it. Most \ufb02uidized beds are used for heat or mass transfer. Their use for \ufb01ltration has not been extensive. 30.4.2.3 Fabric Filter Operation, Maintenance, and Performance Evaluation The \ufb01lter ratio for baghouses, also called the gas-tocloth ratio or air-to-cloth (A/C) ratio,21 varies from 0.6 to 1.5 m3 of gas per minute per square meter of fabric. The air-to-cloth (A/C) ratio,21 which is an expression of the air-stream \ufb02ow rate through the fabric cloth: Qg A=C \u00bc (30.51) Afabric where, A/C is expressed as length time 1(L T 1); Qg is the actual gas \ufb02ow rate (L2 T 1), and Afabric is the fabric surface area (L2). With increasing A/C ratios, the velocities of the gas moving through \ufb01lter media and dust layers also increase. At high A/C, ultra\ufb01ne particles may pass unscathed and not be captured or re-entrained if loosely retained after capture. When either occurs it is known as \ufb01lter bleed-through. In addition to particle size, bleed-through is also increased with the amount of \ufb02ex and movement of the bags and decreased with the thickness of dust layers on the fabric. Other inherent material properties may also affect bleed-through, e.g. pore collapse. One means of knowing whether the dust layer is optimal is by measuring pressure drop.", "The pressure drop across the fabric is a function of the \ufb01lter ratio; it ranges from about 80 mm of water for the lower \ufb01lter ratios up to about 200 mm of water for the higher ratios. Before selecting any bag \ufb01lter system, a thorough engineering study should be made, followed by a consultation with different bag and baghouse manufacturers. Lower than optimal static pressure drop may mean that there is insuf\ufb01cient thickness of the dust cake; whereas higher than optimal pressure drop may indicate that the gas \ufb02ow is overly constricted. This \ufb02ow constriction can be caused by mechanical and electrical failures in air moving equipment. Thus, monitoring equipment can be located to indicate \ufb02ange-to-\ufb02ange static pressure drop (at the outlet and inlet ducts) and/or at the un\ufb01ltered side of the system to indicate media static pressure drop. The pressure drop through the \ufb01lter is a function of two separate effects. The clean \ufb01lter has some initial pressure drop. This is a function of \ufb01lter material, depth of the \ufb01lter, the super\ufb01cial gas velocity, which is the gas velocity perpendicular to the \ufb01lter face, and the viscosity of the gas. Pressure drop increases from the initial clean \ufb01lter\u2019s resistance as particles begin to adhere to form a cake on the \ufb01lter surface. This cake increases in thickness f1WC \u00bc 0.25 kPa. as approximately a linear function of time, and the pressure difference necessary to cause the same gas \ufb02ow also becomes a linear function with time. Usually, the pressure available at the \ufb01lter is limited so that as the cake builds up the \ufb02ow decreases. Timing of \ufb01lter cleaning can be based, therefore, on (1) increased pressure drop across the \ufb01lter, (2) decreased volume of gas \ufb02ow, or (3) time elapsed since the last cleaning. Put simply, media static pressure drop can be expressed as the sum of the pressure drop across the \ufb01lter media plus the pressure drop across the dust cake: DPtotal \u00bc DPmedia \u00fe DPdust cake (30.52) Pressure drop is often expressed as inches of water column (in. WC).f The drop in static pressure across the \ufb01lter media (DPmedia) is approximated as: DPmedia \u00bc k1$vf (30.53) where k1 is the \ufb01lter media resistance constant in: WC and vf, velocity through the \ufb01lter \u00f0ftmin 1\u00de\u00f0lbmft 2\u00de (ft min 1). The drop in static pressure through the dust cake (DPdust-cake) is approximated as: 2 DPdust cake \u00bc k2$ci$vf $t (30.54) where, k2 is the \ufb01lter media resistance constant in: WC 3 ; ci, the PM concentration (lbm ft ); \u00f0ftmin 1\u00de\u00f0lbmft 2\u00de and t, \ufb01ltration time (min). With substitutions, the total pressure drop is: 2 DPtotal \u00bc k1$vf \u00fe k2$ci$v $t (30.55) f The \ufb01lter drag (Sf) can be found by dividing both the sides of Eqn (30.55) by the velocity (vf): DPtotal Sf \u00bc\u00bc k1 \u00fe k2$ci$vf$t (30.56) vf where Sf is the \ufb01lter drag force (in. WC ft 1 min 1). These and other general predictions of pressure drop are gross approximations given the variability in dust cake thickness and other real-world conditions. The bags must be periodically cleaned to remove the accumulated PM (note in Figure 30.13 the general downward trend in ef\ufb01ciency with time). Bag cleaning methods vary widely with the manufacturer and with baghouse style and use. Methods for cleaning include (1) mechanical shaking by agitation of the top hanger, (2) reverse \ufb02ow of gas through a few of the bags at a time, (3) continuous cleaning with a reverse jet of air passing through a series of ori\ufb01ces on a ring as it moves up and down the clean side of the bag, and (4) collapse and pulsation cleaning methods. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES Common fabric \ufb01lter cleaning mechanisms include shaking, reverse air, and pulse jets. Shaker systems are cleaned after stopping the gas \ufb02ow, allowing the bags to relax (usually less than 1 min) and shaking the bags for 10e100 cycles with a rocker-arm assembly in 1e5 cycles per second. The cleaning cycles are usually controlled by a timing device which deactivates the section being cleaned. The dusts removed during cleaning are collected in a hopper at the bottom of the baghouse and then removed, through an air lock or star valve, to a bin for ultimate disposal. The reverse air \ufb01ltration system construction and operation resembles that of shaker collectors, including a tube sheet that separates the bags in the upper portion of the collector from the hoppers.", "The open bottoms of the bags are attached to the tube sheet and the closed tops are attached to an upper support. Gases enter through the hopper and pass up through the \ufb01lter bag, depositing the dust cake inside the bag. Cleaner air exits through an outlet duct. Reverse air collectors usually employ woven fabrics; as well as membrane bags and felted bags. Their typical A/C ratio is 0.8e1.8 cm s 1.21 There are two basic types of pulse jet collectors: top-access and side-access; with the top-access pulse jet more common (see Figure 30.15). In pulse jet collectors, the tube sheet is located near the top of the unit and the bags are suspended from it. This free-hanging design is needed to facilitate bag replacement, to direct gas stream movement upward and to avoid abrasive surfaces near the bottom of the bags. The pulse jet cleaning occurs V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.4 REMOVAL OF DRY PM from compressed air that passes through a drier, if gas has too much moisture, which can condense upon cooling and increase blinding. The compressed air is \ufb01ltered to remove oil droplets that condense from lubricating oils in the compressor, heated and delivered by compressed tubes to the bags.21 Cartridge \ufb01lter systems are similar to pulse jet fabric \ufb01lter systems, with \ufb01lter elements supported on a tube sheet that is usually mounted near the top of the \ufb01lter housing. Filtering is performed by the \ufb01lter media and the dust cake supported on the exterior of the \ufb01lter media. The \ufb01lter media is usually cellulose, polypropylene, or other \ufb02ex-resistant material covered with felt. Cartridges are usually shorter than pulse jet bags. They can be cylindrical but may also have other shapes to increase the surface area. Their short \ufb01lter element makes it less susceptible to being scratched by suspended matter in the air stream and allows cleaning with compressed air in a process similar to pulse jet cleaning. The actual performance of \ufb01ltration systems is a function of numerous factors, so the evaluation of performance is multifactorial as well. These factors include the type of fabric, the A/C ratio, approach velocity, \ufb01lter bag spacing and size, bag access, design of cleaning system and hopper, bypass dampening, and the type and locations of monitoring instrumentation. The A/C ratio is the most useful means of sizing fabric \ufb01lters. Gross A/C is the actual gas \ufb02ow rate at maximum operating conditions divided by the total area of fabric in the system: Qmax \u00f0A =C\u00de\u00bc (30.57) gross Atotal where, (A/C)gross is the gross air-to-cloth ratio [(ft3 min 1)ft 2]; Qmax, maximum actual \ufb02ow rate (f3 min 1); and Atotal, total fabric area (ft2). The net A/C ratio is commonly used for systems that have multiple compartments, with one or more of them separated from the gas \ufb02ow during cleaning, maintenance, or as a regularly scheduled part of a modular system: Qmax \u00f0A =C\u00de\u00bc (30.58) nets Anet where, (A/C)nets is the net air-to-cloth ratio [(ft3 min 1) ft 2]; Qmax, maximum actual \ufb02ow rate (ft3 min 1); and Anet, isolated compartment\u2019s fabric area (ft2). Bag area of a cylindrically shaped bag or shaker is: A \u00bc pDL (30.59) where, A/C is the bag surface area (ft2); D, bag diameter (ft); and L, bag length (ft). This assumes that \ufb01ltration only occurs on the side of the bag, not on the top or bottom. If the bag is a pleated cylindrical cartridge, the area is: A \u00bc 2ndh (30.60) where, A is the cartridge surface area (ft2); n,number of pleats; d, depth of pleat (ft); and h, pleat height (ft). To illustrate how A/C is useful in performance evaluation, consider two examples.g The air-to-cloth ratio used for a system depends on the particle size distribution, fabric characteristics, particulate matter loadings, and gas stream conditions. Low values for a design air-to-cloth ratio are generally used when the particle size distribution includes a signi\ufb01cant fraction of very \ufb01ne PM or if particulate loading is high. The air-tocloth ratios for cartridge \ufb01lters are usually maintained at values less than approximately 4 (ft3 min 1)ft2.General A/C ratio values for shaker, reverse air, and pulse jet fabric \ufb01lters in various settings are provided in Table 30.10. However, this is merely a general guideline, since sites and situations vary. In addition, air-to-cloth ratio requirements have been decreasing in recent decades, commensurate with more stringent PM emission limits. Other aspects of \ufb01lter system performance should be part of the evaluation.", "This includes inspection of the extent of gravity settling of dust cake agglomerates, sheet, and particles that can be released during cleaning. Collection ef\ufb01ciency and static pressure drops can result when \ufb01ne PM matter, with its inherently low settling velocities, returns to the \ufb01lter surface. Thus, a suf\ufb01cient amount of time is needed to allow for particles that have been resuspended to re-settle. Also, gas entering the hopper instead of the collector side during on-line cleaning (e.g. pulse jets) can block particle and aggregates from settling. The gas approach velocity of a pulse jet system is directly proportional to the A/C ratio. Thus, large dust agglomerates or sheets rather than small aggregates or individual particles should be released during cleaning. For example, consider two identical pulse jet systems with the following design characteristics: Design Characteristic First Unit Second Unit Compartment area, ft2 130 130 Number of bags 300 300 Bag diameter, in. 6 6 Bag height, ft 10 10 Air-to-cloth ratio, (ft3 min 1)ft 2 5 8 g These examples are taken from: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

This, combined with the longer path that \ufb01ne PM would have to travel in the more elongated bag would increase problems caused by additional gravity settling. The type of instrumentation should be properly matched to the equipment. As a minimum, for fabric \ufb01lters this likely includes instrumentation for static pressure drop measurement, inlet and outlet gas temperature measurements, and opacity monitors. It should be noted that often times a number of different air pollution control devices are used in sequences and series. For example, when addressing a very toxic compound, particulates and gases must be removed and/or treated. In these con\ufb01gurations, both inertial and \ufb01ltra tion equipment may be deployed, along with scrubbers and sorbing media for gases (see Figure 30.16). 30.5 ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATORS High-voltage ESPs have been widely used throughout the world for particulate removal since Fredrick Cottrell invented the \ufb01rst one early in the twentieth century. Most of the original units were used for recovery of process materials, but today gas cleaning for air pollution control is often the main reason for their installation. The ESP has distinct advantages over other aerosol collection devices: 1. It can easily handle high-temperature gases, which makes it a likely choice for boilers, steel furnaces, etc.; 2. It has an extremely small pressure drop, so that fan costs are minimized; 3. It has an extremely high-collection ef\ufb01ciency if operated properly on selected aerosols (many cases are on record, however, in which relatively low ef\ufb01ciencies were obtained because of unique or unknown dust properties); 4. It can handle a wide range of particulate sizes and dust concentrations (most precipitators work best on particles smaller than 10 mm, so that an inertial precleaner is often used to remove the large particles); and, 5. If it is properly designed and constructed, its operating and maintenance costs are lower than those of any other type of particulate collection system. Three of the disadvantages of ESPs are: 1. The initial cost is the highest of any particulate collection system; 2. A large amount of space is required for the installation, and, 3. ESPs are not suitable for combustible particles such as grain or wood dust. The particles move advectively with the gas stream that is moving through the ESP unit (see Figure 30.17). V.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.5 ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATORS The particles become charged and then are attracted by the charge differential to either side. The particles migrate toward the collection surface, where they are captured. The accumulated solids or liquids are deposited into the hoppers (or sumps for liquids) which are below the electrical zone. The ESP works by charging dust with ions and then collecting the ionized particles on a surface. The collection surfaces may consist of either tubular or \ufb02at plates. For cleaning and disposal, the particles are then removed from the collection surface, usually by rapping the surface. The alternating power supplied to the primary control cabinet is at a constant 480 V and 60 cycles per second. A transformererecti\ufb01er (TeR) set provides this power. The primary alternating power is converted to a secondary pulse-type direct power in the TeR set. The relatively low primary voltage is stepped up to a secondary voltage of more than 50,000 V. The voltage applied to the discharge electrodes is called the secondary voltage because the electrical line is on the transformer\u2019s secondary side, i.e. the high-voltage generating side.22 With increasing supply of primary voltage, the secondary voltage applied to the discharge electrodes increases.", "A high-voltage (30 kV or more) DC \ufb01eld is established between the central wire electrode and the grounded collecting surface. The voltage is high enough that a visible corona can be seen at the surface of the wire. The result is a cascade of negative ions in the gap between the central wire and the grounded outer surface. Any aerosol entering this gap is both bombarded and charged by these ions. The aerosols then migrate to the collecting surface because of the combined effect of this bombardment and the charge attraction. When the particle reaches the collecting surface, it loses its charge and adheres because of the attractive forces existing. It should remain there until the power is shut off and it is physically dislodged by rapping, washing, or sonic means. The electrical discharges from the precipitator discharge electrodes are termed corona discharges and are needed to charge the particles. Within the negative corona discharge, electrons are accelerated by a very strong electrical \ufb01eld and strike and ionize gas molecules. Each collision of a fast-moving electron with a gas molecule produces an additional electron and a positively charged gas ion. The corona discharges can be described as an \u201celectron avalanche\u201d since large numbers of electrons are generated during multiple electronegas molecule collisions.22 The positive gas ions generated in the ionization process turn back toward the discharge electrode. Some positive gas ions deposit on particles within the corona, adding a positive charge. The positively charged particles collect on negative discharge electrodes, and must be cleaned suf\ufb01ciently often to continue inducing charge. Electrons released in the corona discharges are captured by gas molecules, further from the discharge electrode, where the electrical \ufb01eld strength is lower. The negatively charged gas ions move toward the grounded collection plates. Some are captured by particles, inducing a negative charge. The particles quickly reach a maximum charge, i.e. saturation charge, at which the electrostatic \ufb01eld created by the captured ions is suf\ufb01ciently strong to de\ufb02ect additional gas ions approaching the particle.22 The magnitude of the saturation charge is dependent on the particle size: q \u00bc\u00f03p\u03b50E\u00ded2 (30.61) p where, q is the charge on particle; \u03b50, permittivity of free space (8.85 10 12 Fm 1); E0, strength of electrical \ufb01eld (Vm 1);and dp, physical diameter of particle. Since gas ions have small surfaces on which to deposit, small particles have low saturation charges. Thus, saturation charge increases with surface area and with the square of the particle diameter. Large particles accumulate higher electrical charges on their surface and, therefore, are more strongly affected by the applied electrical \ufb01eld. Upon attaching ions, particles are in\ufb02uenced by the strong, nonuniform electrical \ufb01eld between the discharge electrode and the grounded collection plate. As a result, the charged particles migrate toward the grounded plates at a velocity given by: qEpCC u \u00bc (30.62) 3pdpmg where, u is the migration velocity; q, charge on particle; E0, electrical \ufb01eld near collector plate; CC, Cunningham slip correction factor; mg, gas viscosity; and dp, physical diameter of particle. Simultaneously to the migration from the charge differential, drag forces, which depend on the particle mass or the cube of the particle diameter, are inducing particle to move unabated through the precipitator. Thus, very small particles deposit near the inlet, while increasingly larger particles deposit deeper into the precipitator. Often, particles larger than about 30 mm diameter can be removed with precleaning. Otherwise, the ESP would have to be much longer. Small-sized particles charge more slowly but, once they acquire a charge, they move rapidly to the collection plate. Particles with >1.0 mm diameters accumulate charged gas ions by locally disrupting the electrical \ufb01eld. As a result, the gas ions are momentarily directed to the particle surface rather than the collection plate, known as contact charging. Particles with <0.1 mm diameters have insuf\ufb01cient mass to disrupt the electrical \ufb01eld. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES Rather, very small particles accumulate charges as in their random walks through the gas ions, known appropriately as diffusion or ion charging. The combined effect of contact and diffusion charging creates a particle size collection ef\ufb01ciency relationship that is ef\ufb01cient for very small particles, dropping to a low of <70% for w0.5 mm diameter particles, and increasing in ef\ufb01ciency, nearing 100% for PM10. The high-collection ef\ufb01ciencies for PM > 1.0 mm diameter is due to the result of improved effectiveness of contact charging for large particles.", "Increased diffusion charging is the reason for good collection ef\ufb01ciencies for particles smaller than 0.1 mm diameter. The sub-optimal range between 0.1 and 1.0 mm diameter results from size-dependence limitations of both of these charging mechanisms. Electrostatic systems are notoriously weak in collecting particles in this size range. In a tube-type ESP, the tubes are 8e25 cm in diameter and 1e4 m long. They are arranged vertically in banks with the central wires, about 2 mm in diameter, suspended in the center with tension weights at the bottom. Many innovations, including square, triangular, and barbed wires, are used by different manufacturers. A plate-type ESP is similar in principle to the tubular type except that the air\ufb02ows across the wires horizontally, at right angles to them. The particles are collected on vertical plates, which usually have \ufb01ns or baf\ufb02es to strengthen them and prevent dust re-entrainment. Figure 30.17 illustrates a large plate-type precipitator. These precipitators are usually used to control and collect dry dusts. Problems with ESPs develop because the \ufb01nal unit does not operate at ideal conditions. Indeed, ESP operation is vulnerable to particle characteristics. Gas channeling through the unit can result in high dust loadings in one area and light loads in another. The end result is less than optimum ef\ufb01ciency because of much re-entrainment. The chemical composition of the dust cake affects conductance and resistance. Actually, electrons can \ufb02ow through the dust cake in two ways. Electrons can pass directly through each dust particle until reaching the metal surface (bulk conductance); or they can be conducted surface-to-surface (surface conductance), e.g. vapor-phase conductive compounds sorb to the particles. Obviously, bulk conductance requires that the particle material have suf\ufb01cient conductivity. The resistivity of the dust greatly affects its re-entrainment in the unit. If a high-resistance dust collects on the plate surface, the effective voltage across the gap is decreased. It should also be noted that resistance is temperature dependent. For example, resistivity of inorganic oxides is orders of magnitudes lower at gas temperatures <150 Cthan at 180 C. Resistivity is also orders of magnitudes lower at gas temperatures >200 Cthan at 180 C. Thus, the range between 150 and 200 C is to be avoided, with temperatures between 250 and 350 Cnearly optimal, depending on the speci\ufb01c dust material.22 Some power plants burning high-ash, low-sulfur coal have reported very low ef\ufb01ciency from the precipitator because the ash needed more SO2 to decrease its resistivity. The suggestion that precipitator ef\ufb01ciency could be greatly improved by adding SO2 or SO3 to the stack gases has met, not surprisingly, with skepticism given these compounds\u2019 reputations as potent air pollutants. However, combustion of coal and other fossil fuels often generate suf\ufb01cient H2SO4 and other particle surface conditioning agents that lower dust layer resistivities to allow for conductance through dust layers. Electrostatic precipitators work well in many settings; however some need to be avoided or at least customized to address certain unwanted properties of substances in gas streams. These include \ufb02y ash with extremely low resistivities, sticky PM, and \ufb02ammable and explosive substances. In addition, ESPs produce ozone (O3), so operators must ensure that waste streams do not produce unacceptable amounts of this pollutant, i.e. tradeoff between PM and O3. 30.6 SCRUBBERS Scrubbers, or wet collectors, have been used as gas cleaning devices for many years. They predominantly collect PM by applying two basic physical mechanisms already discussed, i.e. inertial impaction and Brownian motion. The wet-scrubbing process uses two processes to remove an aerosol from the gas stream. The \ufb01rst is to wet the particle by the scrubbing liquid. As shown in Figure 30.18, this process is essentially the same whether the system uses a spray to atomize the scrubbing liquid or a diffuser to break the gas into small bubbles. In either case, it is assumed that the particle is trapped when it travels from the supporting gaseous medium across the interface to the liquid scrubbing medium. Some relative motion is necessary for the particle and liquidegas interface to come into contact. In the spray chamber, this motion is provided by spraying the droplets through the gas so that they impinge on and make contact with the particles. In the bubbler, inertial forces and severe turbulence achieve this contact. In either cases, the smaller the droplet or bubble, the greater is the collection ef\ufb01ciency. In the scrubber, the smaller the droplet, the larger will be the surface area for a given weight of liquid, with a greater likelihood of wetting the particles.", "In a bubbler, smaller bubbles mean not only that more interface area is available but also that the particles have a shorter distance to travel before reaching an interface where they can be wetted. The second process employed by wet collectors is to remove the wetted particles on a collecting surface, V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION Surface of droplet Scrubber liquid Particle (In spray chamber) FIGURE 30.18 Wetting of aerosols in a spray chamber or bubbler. followed by their eventual removal from the device. The collecting surface can be in the form of a bed or simply a wetted surface. One common combination follows the wetting section with an inertial collector which then separates the wetted particles from the carrying gas stream. Thus, collection has two phases; \ufb01rst the particle is captured within a droplet; then the droplets aggregate into a slurry which must be removed and treated. Increasing either the gas velocity or the liquid droplet velocity in a scrubber will increase the ef\ufb01ciency because of the greater number of collisions per unit time. The ultimate scrubber in this respect is the venturi scrubber, which operates at extremely high gas and liquid velocities with a very high pressure drop across the venturi throat. Figure 30.19 illustrates a con\ufb01guration of a venturi scrubber unit. Large amounts of water are involved in scrubbings, so the scrubbing liquid is recirculated to minimize the amount of liquid needing to be treated and discharged. The scrubbing liquid is collected in the sump of the scrubber and mist eliminator delivered by gravity to a recirculation tank having a liquid residence time of several minutes. This provides suf\ufb01cient time to introduce alkali additives and to adjust the pH back to the proper range, if necessary. A centrifugal pump recirculates the liquid back to the scrubber vessel from the recirculation tank. Some scrubber systems use spray nozzles to atomize the scrubbing liquid. To project droplets across an entire circular area, a full-cone nozzle is used most frequently. This improves the effective gaseliquid contact. Full-cone nozzles usually provide mean diameters of 100e1000 mm that are log-normally distributed.23 The liquid-to-gas ratio (L:G) is the rate of liquid \ufb02ow to a scrubber, expressed as volume per volume (e.g. gallons of liquid per 1000 actual cubic feet of gas \ufb02ow). To collect PM, wet scrubber systems generally operate with L:G ratios between 4 and 20 gal:1000 actual cubic feet (acf). Higher ratios do not appear to improve performance. Plus, higher L:G changes the droplet distribution within the scrubber, which adversely affects collection ef\ufb01ciencies. Low L:G can dramatically decrease ef\ufb01ciency by decreasing the number of available target objects for particle impaction. At low L:G ratio conditions, a portion of the particle-laden gas stream may pass through the collection zone without encountering a liquid target. The L:G ratio can be de\ufb01ned based either on the inlet or outlet gas \ufb02ow rates, or based on either actual or standard gas \ufb02ow rates. A practical de\ufb01nition of L:G is: Qi l L:G \u00bc (30.63) Qog where, Qi-l is the the inlet liquid \ufb02ow (gallons per minute, gpm) and Qo-g, the outlet gas \ufb02ow (actual ft3 min 1, acfm). Qo-g is used because it is already measured as part of an emission test program and is considerably easier to obtain an accurate \ufb02ow measurement at the scrubber outlet, because this is where PM being loaded into the gas stream is decreased and where sampling ports are available. Indeed, most scrubber inlet ducts are not well suited for testing gas \ufb02ow rates. L:G ratios needs to be above the minimum level necessary to ensure proper gaseliquid distribution. In most gas-atomized scrubbers, this minimum value is approximately 4 gallons:1000 acf. In other type of scrubbers, the value can be as low as 2 gal:1000 acf. These calculations can be illustrated with an example. What is the design liquid-to-gas ratio for a scrubber system that has an outlet gas \ufb02ow rate of 10,000 acfm, a pump discharge rate of 110 gpm, and a liquid purge rate of 20 gpm?

In addition, CO2 formed in most combustion processes can also be absorbed, with the H2CO3* lowering the pH. The most common alkalis used in scrubbers are liming agents (e.g. CaCO3 or Ca(OH)2), soda ash (Na2CO3), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The amount of alkali needed depends on the quantities of acidic gases captured and the molar ratios necessary for the following reactions: SO3 \u00fe Ca\u00f0OH\u00de2/CaSO4 \u00fe H2O (30.64) 2HCl \u00fe Ca\u00f0OH\u00de2/CaCl2 \u00fe 2H2O (30.65) 2HF \u00fe Ca\u00f0OH\u00de2/CaF2 \u00fe 2H2O (30.66) For example,h assuming an HCl removal ef\ufb01ciency of 95%, what is the amount of calcium hydroxide (lime) needed to neutralize the HCl absorbed from a gas stream with 50 ppmv HCl and a \ufb02ow rate of 10,000 scfm?

Most contain captured particles that must be removed by mist eliminators from the gas stream before being emitted to the atmosphere. In addition to minimizing the carry-over of PM-containing droplets to the atmosphere, mist eliminators also protect downstream equipment, e.g. fans and other air movers, from PM-laden droplets, and minimize water losses. Solids accumulate as a result of the impaction of solids-laden water droplets, and due to the chemical precipitation of dissolved solids from the scrubbing liquid. Mist eliminators usually have at least one spray nozzle to remove these accumulated solids. The four most common types of mist eliminators are chevrons, mesh or woven pads, tube banks, and cyclones.i Static pressure drops across their surfaces range from 0.5 in. WC to more than 4 in. WC.23 30.6.2 Scrubber Performance Scrubber manufacturers have extensive databases regarding the performance of their commercial brands of scrubbers for removing pollutants from different types of industrial sources. While useful, these data must be augmented by additional site-speci\ufb01c and speci\ufb01c PM characterization information before installing a system, beginning with the site-speci\ufb01c inlet particle size distribution and uncertainties around this distribution (e.g. does the distribution vary according to certain operations and maintenance schedules?). Scrubber performance depends on many factors, including: 1. Particle size distribution 2. Mean and maximum gas \ufb02ow rates 3. Mean and maximum inlet gas temperatures 4. Chemical composition of PM and gas stream, including concentrations of corrosive materials present in the inlet gas stream 5. Concentrations of potentially explosive materials present in the inlet gas stream 6. Makeup water availability 7. Purge liquid treatment and disposal requirements 8. Process type, raw materials, and fuels 9. Source operating schedule 10. Area available for scrubber and wastewater treatment 11. Alkali supply requirements 12. Emission test data This site-speci\ufb01c information together with the historical performance data informs the decision of whether a scrubber is applicable to the pollutant stream and, if so, which type. The data also provide a basis for the design of the scrubber system components, including estimates of static pressure drops across the system. Scrubbers have distinct advantages and disadvantages. For example, venturi scrubbers have high-collection ef\ufb01ciencies, can handle mists and are capable i For a detailed discussion of these four systems, see: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. APTI 413: control of particulate matter emissions. Chapter 8: wet scrubbers. http://www.4cleanair.org/APTI/413Combined.pdf; 2012 [accessed 05.12.13]. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES of handling \ufb02ammable and explosive dusts (a distinct advantage over ESPs). Their design is simple, relatively easy to install and maintain. They provide cooling of hot gases and can neutralize corrosive PM and gases. 24 However, venturi scrubbers, like all wet scrubbers, produce large amounts of wastewater and sludge that must be treated. The \ufb01nal exhaust must be reheated.", "In addition, these systems have high-pressure drops and require protection from weather (e.g. freezing).25 30.6.3 Dry Scrubbers Gravel bed \ufb01lters that recirculate the gravel \ufb01lter medium using an external cleaning or washing system are known as dry scrubbers. Some units also use an electrostatic \ufb01eld across the gravel bed to enhance removal of the particulate material. The dry scrubber may have to be followed by a baghouse for the ef\ufb02uent to achieve acceptable emission standards. The advantage of dry scrubbers is their ability to remove large quantities of particulate pollutants, such as \ufb02y ash, from hot gas streams. 30.6.4 Bioscrubbers Bioscrubbers are an example of an integrated environmental control system. They have a suspended microbial population in a \ufb02owing water phase. Absorption takes place in typical wet-scrubbing equipment, e.g. spray towers, plate towers, or packed beds. The ef\ufb02uent from the wet scrubber is then transferred to a separate aerated vessel, where degradation of the contaminants is performed by suspended microbes. Nutrients, acids, or bases are added to the recirculated water to maintain conditions conducive to microbial populations that lead to optimal pollutant removal. This can be an enhancement to a scrubber and particularly useful in the enhancement of not only removing, but also biodegrading hazardous air pollutants, in both gas and particulate phases. 30.7 REMOVAL OF LIQUID DROPLETS AND MISTS The term mist generally refers to liquid droplets from submicron size to about 10 mm. If the diameter exceeds 10 mm, the aerosol is usually referred to as a spray or simply as droplets. Mists tend to be spherical because of their surface tension and are usually formed by nucleation and the condensation of vapors. 26 Larger droplets are formed by bursting bubbles, by entrainment from surfaces, by spray nozzles, or by splash-type liquid distributors. The large droplets tend to be elongated relative to their direction of motion because of the action of drag forces on the droplets.25 Mist eliminators are widely used in air pollution control systems to prevent free moisture from entering the atmosphere. Usually, such mist eliminators are found downstream from wet scrubbers. The recovered mist is returned to the liquid system, resulting in lowered liquid makeup requirements. As is the case for dry particles, mist aerosols and droplets differ substantially physically for the carrying gas stream, including diameter, density, and phase (e.g. gas versus liquid). Indeed, some particles in mist collection systems are the size of ordinary raindrops. Thus, most of the removal mechanisms are similar to those employed for the removal of dry particulates. Mist collection is further simpli\ufb01ed because the particles are spherical and tend to resist re-entrainment. In addition, mists tend to agglomerate after coming in contact with the surface of the collecting device. Control devices developed particularly for condensing mist are discussed separately. 30.7.1 Filtering Liquids Filters for mists and droplets have larger pores and open areas than those used for dry particles. If a \ufb01lter is made of many \ufb01ne, closely spaced \ufb01bers, it will become wet due to the collected liquid. Such wetting leads to matting of the \ufb01bers, retention of greater amounts of liquid, which leads eventually to a blocked \ufb01lter. Water droplets in the dust cake can severely increase the resistance to gas \ufb02ow. At the very least, the water \ufb01lls voids in the dust cake which would normally be the route of the carrying gas. At some point, the water-\ufb01lled pore space in the dust cake becomes suf\ufb01cient to pack the PM or to form a layer of mud, rendering the \ufb01lter impervious to air\ufb02ow. The problem is known as fabric blinding. Moisture can come from numerous sources, including entrained condensed droplets; droplets carried in with the compressed air, e.g. in pulse jet fabric \ufb01lters; or from excessive gas cooling in baghouses, e.g. those serving combustion sources that produce high vapor concentrations of water; and other compounds can cause water condensation in the dust cakes. Water is the most common but not the exclusive liquid that can cause blinding. Indeed, almost any liquid can cause or exacerbate fabric blinding. In addition to liquids formed from previously volatilized vapors mentioned above, liquids can be actually used in the pollution control equipment itself. For example, oil droplets can deposit in the upper, clean side surfaces of the fabric \ufb01lters and prevent air\ufb02ow. This means that proper O&M requires \ufb01ltering of the entire inlet gas stream in the unaffected lower portions of the part of the \ufb01lter (e.g. jet bag). Indeed, blinding agents do not even have to be \u201cwet\u201d.", "High-velocity carrying gas V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.7 REMOVAL OF LIQUID DROPLETS AND MISTS laden with ultra\ufb01ne particles can be driving these very small particles into the \ufb01lter fabric before a protective residual dust layer has formed. Newly installed in baghouse compartment with several seasoned bags are particularly vulnerable to such blinding. This is because the seasoned bags already have a residual dust cake layer; thus the gas velocities through the new bag are excessively high. The carrying gas will follow the path of least resistance, i.e. through the clean pores of the newly installed bags. Ultra\ufb01ne particle blinding is possible after installing new bags at sources that generate high concentrations of PM mm aerodynamic diameter. To ameliorate this problem, the new bags can be conditioned prior to service by passing through air containing resuspended coarse particulate.16 This is a major difference between dry and wet \ufb01ltration. Thus, rather than closely spaced \ufb01ber weaves, wet \ufb01ltration system is usually composed of either knitted wire or wire mesh packed into a pad. This looser \ufb01ltration medium yields a lower pressure drop than the media of the \ufb01lters used for dry PM. The reported pressure drop across wire mesh mist eliminators is 1e2 cm of water at face velocities of 5 m s 1. The essential collection mechanisms employed for \ufb01ltration of droplets and mists are inertial impaction and, to a lesser extent, direct interception. 30.7.2 Electrostatic Precipitators for Mists and Droplets ESPs for liquid droplets and mists are essentially of the wetted wall type. Figure 30.20 shows a wet-wall precipitator with tubular collection electrodes.1 In wet ESPs, the upper ends of the tubes form weirs, and water \ufb02ows over the tube ends to irrigate the collection surface. The collecting electrode becomes coated with a water \ufb01lm. The PM collected in the wet type electrostatic precipitator is discharged along with the collecting electrode washing liquid. Thus, wastewater treatment is necessary. Figure 30.21 shows an alternative type of wet precipitator with plate-type collection electrodes. In this design, sprays located in the ducts formed by adjacent collecting electrodes serve to irrigate the plates.1 These are often supplemented by overhead sprays to ensure that the entire plate surface is irrigated. The design of such precipitators is similar to that of conventional systems except for the means of keeping insulators dry, measures to minimize corrosion, and provisions for removing the slurry.j Gas flow in Water pipes High-voltage leads Oglesby Jr S, Nichols GB.

They include cyclone collectors, baf\ufb02e systems, and skimmers in ductwork. Inertial devices can be used as primary collection systems, precleaners for other devices, or mist eliminators. The systems are relatively inexpensive and reliable, and have low-pressure drops. Cyclone mist eliminators and collectors have virtually the same ef\ufb01ciency for both liquid aerosols and solid particles. To avoid re-entrainment of the collected liquid from the walls of the cyclone, an upper limit is set to the tangential velocity that can be used. The maximum tangential velocity should be limited to the inlet velocity. Even at this speed, the liquid \ufb01lm may creep to the edge of the exit pipe, from which the liquid is then re-entrained. Baf\ufb02e separators of the venetian blind, V, W, and wave types are widely used for spray removal. They j Oglesby Jr S, Nichols GB. Electrostatic precipitators. In: Stern AC, editor.

(For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) have small space requirements and low-pressure drops. They operate by diverting the gas stream and ejecting the droplets onto the collector baf\ufb02es. Ef\ufb01ciencies of single stages may be only 40e60%, but by adding multiple stages, ef\ufb01ciencies approaching 100% may be obtained. 30.7.4 Scrubbers for Mists and Droplets A widely used type of scrubber for mists and droplets is the venturi scrubber. It has been used for the collection of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid mists with very high ef\ufb01ciency.", "The scrubbing contact is made at the venturi throat, where very small droplets of the scrubbing liquid (usually water) are injected. At the throat, gas velocities as high as 130 m s 1 are used to increase collision ef\ufb01ciencies. Water, injected for acid mist control, ranges from 0.8 to 2.0 l m 3 of gas. Collection ef\ufb01ciencies approaching 100% are possible, but high ef\ufb01ciencies require a gas pressure drop of 60e90 cm of water across the scrubber. Normal operation, with a submicron mist, is reported to be in the 90e95% ef\ufb01ciency range.27 One problem in using scrubbers to control mists and droplets is that the scrubber also acts as a condenser for volatile gases. For example, a hot plume containing volatile hydrocarbon gases, such as the exhaust from a gas turbine, may be cooled several hundred degrees by passing through a scrubber. This cooling can cause extensive condensation of the hydrocarbons, resulting in a plume with a high opacity. For example, when jet engine exhaust is cooled in a test cell using water sprays, droplet loadings can be 10e100% greater than those measured from the plane\u2019s exhaust due to the condensation of hydrocarbons which were normally exhausted as gases. 27 30.7.5 Other Systems Many unique systems have been proposed, and some used, to control the release of mists and droplets. Ceramic candles are thimble-shaped, porous, acid-resistant ceramic tubes. Although ef\ufb01ciencies exceeding 98% have been reported, the candles have high maintenance requirements because they are very fragile. Electric cyclones utilize an electrode in the center of the cyclone to establish an electric \ufb01eld within the cyclone body. This device is more ef\ufb01cient than the standard cyclone. It is probably more applicable to mists and droplets than to dry particulates, due to possible \ufb01re or explosion hazards with combustible dusts. Sonic agglomerators have been used experimentally for sulfuric acid mists and as mist eliminators. Commercial development is not projected at this time because the energy requirements are considerably greater than those for venturi scrubbers of similar capacity. 30.8 COMPARISON OF PARTICULATE REMOVAL SYSTEMS When selecting a system to remove particulate from a gas stream, many choices concerning equipment can be made. The selection could be made on the basis of cost, gas pressure drop, ef\ufb01ciency, temperature, resistance, etc. Table 30.11 summarizes these factors for comparative purposes. The tabular values must not be considered absolute because great variations occur between types and manufacturers. No table is a substitute for a quali\ufb01ed consulting engineer or a reputable manufacturer\u2019s catalog. V.

V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES 30.9 REMOVAL OF GASEOUS POLLUTANTS Gaseous pollutants may be easier or more dif\ufb01cult to remove from the carrying gas stream than aerosols, depending on the individual situation.", "Certainly, the fact that the air stream and the pollutants are of the same physical phase removes some of the complexities of PM removal. Of course, any separation system relying on differences in inertial properties will not work for gases. Gases may be reactive to other chemicals, which is an important chemical property that can be used to collect vapor-phase pollutants. Four general methods of separating gaseous pollutants are currently in use. These are: (1) absorption in a liquid, (2) adsorption on a solid surface, (3) condensation to a liquid, and (4) conversion into a less polluting or nonpolluting gas. 30.9.1 Absorption Devices Absorption of pollutant gases is accomplished by using a selective liquid in a wet scrubber, packed tower, or bubble tower. Pollutant gases commonly controlled by absorption include sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sul\ufb01de, hydrogen chloride, chlorine, ammonia, oxides of nitrogen, and low-boiling hydrocarbons. The scrubbing liquid must be chosen with speci\ufb01c reference to the gas being removed. The gas solubility in the liquid solvent should be high so that reasonable quantities of solvent are required. The solvent should have a low vapor pressure to reduce losses, be noncorrosive, inexpensive, nontoxic, non\ufb02ammable, chemically stable, and have a low freezing point. It is no wonder that water is the most popular solvent used in absorption devices. The water may be treated with an acid or a base to enhance removal of a speci\ufb01c gas. If carbon dioxide is present in the gaseous ef\ufb02uent and water is used as the scrubbing liquid, a solution of carbonic acid will gradually replace the water in the system. In many cases, pure water is a poor scrubbing solvent, especially if the targeted vapor has low aqueous solubility. Sulfur dioxide, for example, is only slightly soluble in water, so a scrubber of very large liquid capacity would be required. SO2 is readily soluble in an alkaline solution, so scrubbing solutions containing ammonia or amines are used in commercial applications. Chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen \ufb02uoride are examples of gases that are readily soluble in water, so water scrubbing is very effective for their control. For years, hydrogen sul\ufb01de has been removed from re\ufb01nery gases by scrubbing with diethanolamine. More recently, the light hydrocarbon vapors at petroleum re\ufb01neries and loading facilities have been absorbed, under pressure, in liquid gasoline and returned to storage. All of the gases mentioned have economic importance when recovered and can be valuable raw materials or products when removed from the scrubbing solvent. This is another reminder of the need for a systems approach and to consider the entire life cycle of a process (see Chapter 5). 30.9.2 Adsorption Devices Adsorption of pollutant gases occurs when certain gases are selectively retained on the surface or in the pores or interstices of prepared solids. The process may be strictly a surface phenomenon with only molecular forces involved, or it may be combined with a chemical reaction occurring at the surface once the gas and adsorber are in intimate contact. The latter type of adsorption is known as chemisorption. The solid materials used as adsorbents are usually very porous, with extremely large surface-to-volume ratios. Activated carbon, alumina, and silica gel are widely used as adsorbents depending on the gases to be removed. Activated carbon, for example, is excellent for removing light hydrocarbon molecules, which may be odorous. Silica gel, being a polar material, does an excellent job of adsorbing polar gases. Its characteristics for removal of water vapor are well known. Solid adsorbents must also be structurally capable of being packed into a tower, resistant to fracturing, and capable of being regenerated and reused after saturation with gas molecules. Although some small units use throwaway canisters or charges, the majority of industrial adsorbers regenerate the adsorbent to recover not only the adsorbent but also the adsorbate, which usually has some economic value. The ef\ufb01ciency of most adsorbers is very near 100% at the beginning of operation and remains extremely high until a breakpoint occurs when the adsorbent becomes saturated with adsorbate. At this breakpoint, the slope of the percentage of mass of gaseous \ufb02uid that is not sorbed increases dramatically with time. It is at the breakpoint that the adsorber should be renewed or regenerated. This is shown graphically in Figure 30.22. Industrial adsorption systems are engineered so that they operate in the region before the breakpoint and are continually regenerated by units. Figure 30.23 shows a schematic diagram of such a system, with steam being used to regenerate the saturated adsorbent.", "Figure 30.24 illustrates the actual system shown schematically in Figure 30.23. 30.9.3 Condensers In many situations, the most desirable control of vapor-type discharges can be accomplished by condensation. Condensers may also be used ahead of other air V.

The reasons for using condensers include (1) recovery of economically valuable products, (2) removal of components that might be corrosive or damaging to other portions of the system, and (3) reduction of the volume of the ef\ufb02uent gases. Although condensation can be accomplished either by reducing the temperature or by increasing the pressure, in gas-removal practice it is usually done by temperature reduction only. Condensers may be of one or two general types depending on the speci\ufb01c application. Contact condensers operate with the coolant, vapors, and condensate intimately mixed. In surface condensers, the coolant does not come in contact with either the vapors or the condensate. The usual shell-and-tube condenser is of the surface type. Figure 30.25 illustrates a contact condenser which might be used to clean or preclean a hot corrosive gas. Table 30.12 lists several applications of condensers currently in use. For most operations listed, air and noncondensable gases should be kept to a minimum, as they tend to reduce condenser capacity. 30.9.4 Conversion to Less Polluting Substances A widely used system for the control of organic gaseous emissions is oxidation of the combustible components to water and carbon dioxide. The thermal processes discussed in Chapter 29 apply to all phases of hazardous substances, including the gas phase. In fact, thermal processes like incineration often work much better for homogenous gas-phase reactions as opposed to heterogenous reactions involving solids, liquids, and gases. Other systems such as the oxidation of H2StoSO2 and H2O are also used even though the SO2 produced is still considered a pollutant. The tradeoff occurs because the SO2 is much less toxic and undesirable than the H2S. The odor threshold for H2S is about three orders of magnitude less than that for SO2. For oxidation of H2S to SO2, the usual device is simply an open \ufb02are with a fuel gas pilot or auxiliary burner if the H2S is below the stoichiometric concentration. If the SO2 is above emission or other operation limits, it will also have to be treated (e.g. by scrubbing). Thermal oxidizers (also known as afterburners) are widely used as control devices for oxidation of undesirable combustible gases. The two general types are (1) direct-\ufb02ame thermal oxidizers, in which the gases are oxidized in a combustion chamber at or above the temperature of autogenous ignition and (2) catalytic combustion systems, in which the gases are oxidized at temperatures considerably below the autogenous ignition point. Direct-\ufb02ame thermal oxidizers are the most commonly used air pollution control device in which Adsorber regeneration V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES FIGURE 30.24 Pollution control facility in Milford foundry, New Hampshire includes an adsorption tower. Gaseous emissions are introduced at the base of the treatment column, where a gas diffuser ensures that they are evenly distributed through the system. The gas then contacts puri\ufb01cation liquid in the packing of sorbents (e.g. zeolite) in the absorption zone. A second diffuser ensures that the puri\ufb01cation liquid is evenly spread. Environ-Access, Inc. Environmental fact sheet. Treatment of air and gas: treatment of gaseous emissions through a wet scrubberdMESAR Environair Inc. (F2-03-96), Sherbrooke (Quebec, Canada). combustible aerosols, vapors, gases, and odors are to be controlled. The components of the thermal oxidizer are shown in Figure 30.26. They include the combustion chamber, gas burners, burner controls, and exit temperature indicator. Usual exit temperatures for the destruction of most organic materials are in the range of 650e825 C, with retention times of 0.3e0.5s at the elevated temperatures. Direct-\ufb02ame thermal oxidizers are ef\ufb01cient and economical when properly operated. Costs to operate and maintain these systems are similar to those of the auxiliary gas fuel systems. Operating and maintenance costs are essentially those of the auxiliary gas fuel. For larger industrial applications, the overall cost of the oxidizer operation may be considerably reduced by using heat recovery equipment as shown in Figure 30.27.", "In fact, this is an example of the sustainable engineering TABLE 30.12 Selected Condenser Applications for Gas-phase Air Pollutant Removal Petrochemical Basic Chemical Miscellaneous Petroleum Re\ufb01ning Manufacturing Manufacture Industries Gasoline accumulator Polyethylene gas vents Ammonia Dry cleaning Solvents Styrene Chlorine solutions Degreasers Storage vessels Copper napthenates Tar dipping Lube oil re\ufb01ning Insecticides Kraft paper Phthalic anhydride Resin reactors Solvent recover V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.9 REMOVAL OF GASEOUS POLLUTANTS Section A approach known as cogeneration. In some innovative schemes, heat recovery can provide heat for reactors in neighboring industries. Boilers and kilns also provide ef\ufb01cient pollutant destruction of volatile organic compounds and other vapor-phase pollutants in numerous industrial settings. Thermal processes are treated in greater detail in Chapter 29 [in particular, note the thermal oxidizing (afterburner) system following the rotary kiln in Figure 29.14]. Catalytic afterburners are currently used primarily in industry for the control of solvents and organic vapor emissions from industrial ovens. They are used as emission control devices for gasoline-powered automobiles. The main advantage of the catalytic afterburner is that the destruction of the pollutant gases can be accomplished at a temperature range of about 315e485 C, which results in considerable savings in fuel costs. However, the installed costs of the catalytic systems are higher than those of the direct-\ufb02ame afterburners because of the expense of the catalyst and Exhaust through stack Flue gas Flue gas 300 \u00b0F 800 \u00b0F Oxidizer exhaust associated systems, so the overall annual costs tend to balance out. In most catalytic systems there is a gradual loss of activity due to contamination or attrition of the catalyst, so the catalyst must be replaced at regular intervals. Other variables that affect the proper design and operation of catalytic systems include gas velocities through the system, amount of active catalyst surface, residence time, and preheat temperature necessary for complete oxidation of the emitted gases. 30.9.5 Biological Control Systems Waste streams with low to moderate concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may be treated with biological systems. These are similar to biological systems used to treat wastewater, classi\ufb01ed as three basic types: (1) bio\ufb01lters; (2) biotrickling \ufb01lters; and (3) bioscrubbers. Bio\ufb01lms of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) are grown on porous media in bio\ufb01lters and biotrickling Oxidizer exhaust Flue gas Fuel/air mix FIGURE 30.27 Thermal oxidizer schematic. This system employs a thermal oxidizer (burner) at one of the chambers. Other designs use tangentially \ufb01red burners and tangential fume inlets to lengthen residence time and enhance mixing.

AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES systems. The air or other gas containing the VOCs is passed through the biologically active media, where the microbes breakdown the compounds to simpler compounds, eventually to carbon dioxide (if aerobic), methane (if anaerobic), and water. The major difference between bio\ufb01ltration and trickling systems is how the liquid interfaces with the microbes. The liquid phase is stationary in a bio\ufb01lter (see Figure 30.7), but liquids move through the porous media of a biotrickling system (i.e. the liquid \u201ctrickles\u201d). A particularly valuable form of bio\ufb01ltration uses compost as the porous media. Compost contains numerous species of bene\ufb01cial microbes that are already acclimated to organic wastes. Industrial compost bio-\ufb01lters have achieved removal rates at the 99% level. Bio-\ufb01lters are also the most common method for removing VOCs and odorous compounds from air streams. In addition to a wide array of volatile chain and aromatic organic compounds, biological systems have successfully removed vapor-phase inorganics, such as ammonia, hydrogen sul\ufb01de, and other sul\ufb01des including carbon disul\ufb01de, as well as mercaptans. The operational key is the bio\ufb01lm. The gas must interface with the \ufb01lm. In fact, this interface may also occur without a liquid phase (see Figure 30.28). According to Henry\u2019s law, the compounds partition from the gas phase (in the carrier gas or air stream) to the liquid phase (bio\ufb01lm). Compost has been a particularly useful medium in providing this partitioning. The bioscrubber is a two-unit setup. The \ufb01rst unit is an adsorption unit (see previous discussion in this chapter). This unit may be a spray tower, bubbling scrubber, or packed column. After this unit, the air stream enters a bioreactor with a design quite similar to an activated sludge system in a wastewater treatment facility. Bio-scrubbers are much less common in the United States than bio\ufb01ltration systems.", "All three types of biological systems have relatively low operating costs since they are operated near ambient temperature and pressure conditions. Power needs are generally for air movement and pressure drops are low (<10cmH2Om 1 or <1.2 in. WC ft 1 of packed bed). Other costs include amendments (e.g. nutrients) and humidi\ufb01cation. Another advantage is the usual small amount of toxic byproducts, as well as low rates of emissions of greenhouse gases (oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide), compared to thermal systems. Success is highly dependent on the degradability of the compounds present in the air stream, their fugacity, and solubility needed to enter the bio\ufb01lm (see Figure 30.29), and pollutant loading rates. Care must be taken in monitoring the porous media for incomplete biodegradation, the presence of substances that may be toxic to the microbes, excessive concentrations of organic acids and alcohols, and pH. The system should H from: Ref. 29. also be checked for shock and the presence of dust, grease, or other substances that may clog the pore spaces of the media.28 30.9.6 Comparison of Gaseous Pollutant Removal Systems As with particulate removal systems, it is apparent that many choices are available for removal of gases from ef\ufb02uent streams. Table 30.13 presents some of the factors that should be considered in selecting equipment. For the control of SO2, several systems are currently in development and use. Table 30.14 brie\ufb02y explains these systems. Likewise, numerous systems are available for removing oxides of nitrogen (NOx). In this case, the removal includes gas phase N species other than NO and NO2, including the greenhouse gas, N2O. Generally oxides of N can be reduced by lowering peak operating V.

They are then removed with a dry particulate control system. Limestone or lime injection (wet) Calcined limestone or lime reacts with sulfur oxides, which are then removed by wet scrubbers. Sodium carbonate Sodium carbonate reacts with sulfur oxides in a dry scrubber to form sodium sul\ufb01te and CO2. Sodium sul\ufb01te is then removed with a baghouse. Citrate process Citrate is added to scrubbing water to enhance SO2 solution into water. Sulfur is then removed from the citrate solution. Copper oxide adsorption Oxides of sulfur react with copper oxide to form copper sulfate. Removal with a dry particulate control system follows. Caustic scrubbing Caustic neutralizes sulfur oxides. This method is used on small processes.

The wastes at the bottom of the system can be heated to increase the partitioning to the gas phase. Microbes in the bio\ufb01lm surrounding each individual compost particle metabolize the contaminants into simpler compounds, eventually converting them into carbon dioxide and water vapor. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES temperatures and decreasing the time at which operations are at peak temperatures. Also, these oxides can be reduced by burning and re-burning, as well as by chemical reduction reactions, both catalyzed and noncatalyzed. Other methods include substituting O2 for air in combustion processes, absorption, oxidation followed by sorption and various combinations of these approaches. Carbon dioxide removal, i.e. sequestration, processes are discussed in Chapter 21. 30.10 MERCURY REMOVAL Gas-phase mercury is a particularly important and dif\ufb01cult substance to remove from gas streams, including emissions from coal-\ufb01red power plants. When Hg-laden coal is burned, the Hg is vaporized in the furnace and exits as Hg0. Up to 98% of the Hg is then oxidized to Hg2\u00fe, which has high aqueous solubility. Factors that enhance mercury control are low temperature in the system (<150 C), the use of an effective mercury sorbent and a method to collect the sorbent.", "Generally, high concentrations of carbon in the \ufb02y ash enhance mercury sorption onto PM, with the ash then removed by the PM control device, e.g. an electrostatic precipitator, wet \ufb02ue gas desulfurization system (wFGD), and combinations of these and other technologies. Additionally, the presence of hydrogen chloride (HCl) in the \ufb02ue gas stream can result in the formation of mercuric chloride (HgCl2), which is readily adsorbed onto carbon-containing PM. Conversely, sulfur dioxide (SO2) in \ufb02ue gas can act as a reducing agent to convert oxidized mercury to elemental mercury, which is more dif\ufb01cult to collect.29 The most common techniques for removing Hg are carbon \ufb01lter beds, wet scrubbing, selenium \ufb01lters, and activated carbon injection. Gas-phase oxidized Hg can be collected by absorption to aqueous solution in the wFGD and removed with wFGD waste. Once captured from the gas phase, Hg2\u00fe can persist in wFGD liquids in a water-soluble form, partition to the solid phase or be reduced to Hg0. 30.10.1 Carbon Filter Beds Three carbon \ufb01lter designs have been used to remove Hg: cross \ufb02ow, counter current, and counter-cross \ufb02ow. The cross-\ufb02ow design has been applied to utility boilers and waste combustors, the counter current design to waste combustors and the counter-cross \ufb02ow design to utility boilers. In the cross-\ufb02ow \ufb01lters, the \ufb02ue gas \ufb02ows horizontally through the \ufb01lter bed, while the adsorbent migrates through the \ufb01lter from top to bottom. The bed is about 1 m thick and is divided into three layers. The \ufb01rst layer removes PM, heavy metals (including mercury), organic compounds, and SO2. Removal of HCl occurs primarily in the second layer. The third layer acts as a safety layer. The three layers are separated by perforated metal sheets. On the outlet side, there is a slotted sheet designed to prevent particles from being carried out of the \ufb01lter with the \ufb02ue gas. Additionally, an impact separator is located downstream of the slotted sheet, functioning as a safety barrier against particle emissions. Pressure drop is the primary rate-limiting factor for carbon removal from the bed. The designed pressure drop across the bed is 1.5e1.9 cm (6e7.5 in.) of water. The pressure drop across the whole system including fans and ducting is about 30 cm (12 in.) of water. Because of PM collection in and compaction of each layer, approximately 10e13cm (4e5 in.) of material is periodically sloughed from each layer. Because of greater vibration of particles and, thus, greater settling of the particles within the \ufb01rst layer, carbon is sloughed from this layer on the shortest time interval, typically once every 6e8 h. The second layer is sloughed once every day, and the third layer is sloughed once every 2 weeks. Based on these removal rates and bed thicknesses, the mass of carbon in the \ufb01lter is fully replaced at an average rate of once every year. 29 Spent carbon can be disposed of by combustion if the unit is equipped with a wet-scrubbing system. The combustion process degrades organic compounds captured in the carbon and the wet scrubber collects the heavy metals and acid gases. 30.10.2 Wet Scrubbing Wet-scrubbing controls acid gases, metals, PM, and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), e.g. chlorinated dioxins and furans. Single-stage scrubbers can be used to remove of acid gases. Two-stage scrubbers can be used for acid gases and metals. Three-stage systems having a two-stage scrubber followed by a high-ef\ufb01ciency wet particulate control system are designed for improved control of \ufb01ne particulates, metals, and SVOCs. Single-stage scrubbers can also be installed following other pollution controls for increased pollutant control (i.e. polishing scrubbers). Hydrophilic Hg compounds, e.g. HgCl and HgO, can be effectively captured (>90%) in the wet scrubber. If there is signi\ufb01cant Hg0 in the \ufb02ue gas, however, collection ef\ufb01ciencies will be limited. The captured mercury is precipitated out during wastewater treatment with additives (i.e. sodium sul\ufb01de and dithiocarbamate). Three-stage systems have shown Hg removal ef\ufb01ciencies of over 90%. The amount of hydrophilic Hg species in the gas stream is a major factor determining effectiveness of this control approach.29 V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30.11 REMOVAL OF ODORS 30.10.3 Selenium Filters Selenium (Se) \ufb01lters operate based on the af\ufb01nity between Hg and Se. The Hg-laden \ufb02ue gas passes through the \ufb01lter, which consists of ceramic grains impregnated with metallic selenium. The gas pathway through the \ufb01lter is tortuous, which increases the contact between the mercury and the selenium, forming mercury selenite (HgSe).", "Selenium \ufb01lters are effective on \ufb02ue gas streams with inlet mercury concentrations of up to 9 mg scm 1 (3900 g per million scf). At very low Hg concentrations, removal ef\ufb01ciency decreases due to the dramatic decrease in HgeSe molecular collisions. At higher Hg concentrations, the lifetime of the \ufb01lter is short. Because the removal of mercury in the \ufb01lter is based on the formation of HgSe, the selenium in the \ufb01lter is eventually exhausted. The selenium \ufb01lter is designed to convert approximately 50 kg of mercury to HgSe per cubic meter of \ufb01lter material (3 lbs ft 3). The combination of pressure drop, Hg content in the \ufb02ue gas, and the mechanical construction of the \ufb01lter drive \ufb01lter life. On average, the \ufb01lter lifetime is 5 years, after which the \ufb01lter element is replaced. Once the lifetime of the \ufb01lter mass has expired, the HgSe must be properly disposed as a hazardous waste. Se \ufb01lter Hg removal effectiveness has been shown for metal smelters and crematories, but not yet for a utility boiler. 30.10.4 Activated Carbon Injection Powdered activated carbon can be injected into the gas upstream of air pollution control devices. Since activated carbon has many internal pores and large surface area, it can adsorb a broad range of trace contaminants, including Hg. After injection into the \ufb02ue gas and adsorption of Hg and other contaminants, the activated carbon is captured in the PM control device. The factors affecting the performance of activated carbon injection are the temperature of the \ufb02ue gas, the amount of activated carbon injected, the concentration of each Hg species in the \ufb02ue gas, the extent of contact between the carbon and Hg, and the type of carbon used. Flue gas temperature is crucial because Hg volatilizes at temperatures above 150e200 C. The \ufb02ue gas temperature needs to be within, or preferably below, this range for the mercury to adsorb onto the carbon. The combustion device and the corresponding composition of the \ufb02ue gas will affect this temperature range. In an MWC, where there is a substantial amount of HCl resulting in the formation of HgCl2, temperatures within and below the noted range have proven to be effective when injecting carbon. Test data from an MWC retro\ufb01tted with activated carbon injection indicate mercury removals greater than 95%. Pilot testing on a coal-\ufb01red utility boiler indicated that a temperature under 90e120 C was necessary for effective mercury removal. With activated carbon injection, ef\ufb01cient distribution of the carbon in the \ufb02ue gas is also important. The amount of carbon needed to achieve a speci\ufb01c level of mercury removal will vary depending on the fuel being burned, the amount of carbon inherent to the system, and the type of PM control device. At a given carbon feed rate, a fabric \ufb01lter provides more Hg control than an ESP because of the additional Hg adsorption that occurs on the bags of the fabric \ufb01lter (due to the increased gas contact time). Mercury is predominately removed upstream of an ESP-equipped facility; however, the nominal residence time of 1 s or less limits the capture. In addition, Hg is not effectively collected across the ESP, further requiring substantially higher carbon feed rates than the fabric \ufb01lter-equipped facilities.29 30.11 REMOVAL OF ODORS An odor can be described as a physiological response to activation of the sense of smell.1 It can be caused by a chemical compound (e.g. H2S) or a mixture of compounds (e.g. coffee roasting). Generally, if an odor is objectionable, any perceived quantity greater than the odor threshold will be a cause for complaint. The control of odors, therefore, becomes a matter of reducing them to less than their odor thresholds, preventing them from entering the atmosphere, or converting them to a substance that is not odorous or has a much higher odor threshold. Odor masking is not recommended for a practical, long-term odor control system. 30.11.1 Odor Reduction by Dilution If the odor is not a toxic substance and has no harmful effects at concentrations below its threshold, dilution may be the least expensive control technique. Dilution can be accomplished either by using tall stacks or by adding dilution air to the ef\ufb02uent. Tall stacks may be more costly if only capital costs are considered, but they do not require the expenditure for energy that is necessary for dilution systems.", "In addition, if the emission contains other pollutants, taller stacks will increase the distance traveled by the pollutant and, thus, will contribute to the long-range transport and the potential cumulative effects of these pollutants. The odor threshold for most atmospheric pollutants may be found in the literature.1 By properly applying the diffusion equations, one can calculate the height of a stack necessary to reduce the odor to less than its V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 30. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES threshold at the ground or at a nearby structure. A safety factor of two orders of magnitude is suggested if the odorant is particularly objectionable. Odor control by the addition of dilution air involves a problem associated with the breakdown of the dilution system. If a dilution fan, motor, or control system fails, the odorous material will be released to the atmosphere. If the odor is objectionable, complaints will be noted immediately. Good operation and maintenance of the dilution system become an absolute requirement, and redundant systems should be considered. 30.11.2 Odor Removal It is sometimes possible to close an odorous system to prevent the release of the odor to the atmosphere. For example, a multiple-effect evaporator can be substituted for an open contact condenser on a process emitting odorous, noncondensable gases. Another possible solution to an odor problem is to substitute a less noxious or more acceptable odor within a process. An example of this type of control is the substitution of a different resin in place of a formaldehyde-based resin in a molding or forming process. Many gas streams can be deodorized by using solid adsorption systems to remove the odor before the stream is released to the atmosphere. Such procedures are often both effective and economical. 30.11.3 Odor Conversion Many odorous compounds may be converted to compounds with higher odor thresholds or to nonodorous substances. An example of conversion to another compound is the oxidation of H2S, odor threshold 0.5 ppb, to SO2, odor threshold 0.5 ppm. The conversion results in another compound with an odor threshold three orders of magnitude greater than that of the original compound. An example of conversion to a nonodorous substance would be the passage of a gas stream containing butyraldehyde, CH3CH2CH2CHO, with an odor threshold of 40 ppb, through a direct-\ufb01red afterburner which converts it to CO2 and H2O, both nonodorous compounds. It should be noted that using a direct-\ufb01red afterburner, particularly one without heat recovery, to destroy 40 ppb is not an economical use of energy, and some other odor control system may be more desirable. The next chapter describes how the technologies addressed in this chapter are applied in various industrial and transportation sectors. QUESTIONS 1.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31 Controlling Air Pollution from Sources 31.1 INTRODUCTION Control of sources of air pollution requires the application of the control concepts and approaches discussed in Chapter 30, but the control devices usually need to be adapted and tailored to the speci\ufb01c operations of various industrial and other economic sectors. In some cases, more than one system or device must be used to achieve satisfactory control. The general methods of control are: 1. modi\ufb01cations to a less polluting process; 2. changes in types of supplies (e.g. more ef\ufb01cient \ufb01lters, sorbants, catalysts, reagents, cartridges, and air movers); 3. improved operation and maintenance (O&M) that produce less emissions from the existing process by improved operation; 4. fuel change to a fuel which will give the desired level of emissions; and 5. installation of control equipment. Arguably the best approach is to integrate all of these methods into the life cycle perspective and design facilities in ways that achieve the same objectives, but in a manner that does not generate the pollution or at least in a way that decreases the amount of the pollutant or produces pollutants that are not as harmful as those that would be produced with the status quo. For example, each of these \ufb01ve steps could incorporate the principles of green chemistry, e.g. safer reagents, green engineering, and design for the environment (DfE). This applies to every stationary source discussed in this chapter (see Table 31.1). For example, health risks, social expectations, and environmental impacts and other societal risks and bene\ufb01ts associated with a device, structure, product, or activity can be visualized at various stages of the manufacturing, marketing, and application stages. These ideas were introduced in Chapter 5 and will be revisited in the next chapter. Many industrial, transportation, construction, and other sectors have embraced these ideas, so the approaches discussed in this chapter must be seen within a larger context of overall design, installation, O&M of speci\ufb01c equipment.", "With more sustainable practice, the need for some will be eliminated entirely, whereas others may be used for a smaller fraction of pollutants in the waste and gas streams. However, it has always been more ef\ufb01cient for the engineer to design air pollution control into the source when it is \ufb01rst considered, rather than to leave it until the process is operational and found to be in violation of emission standards.

CONTROLLING AIR POLLUTION FROM SOURCES As discussed in Chapter 29, emission standards are generally divided between stationary and mobile sources. Thus, this chapter addresses these separately. However, many of the same principles being applied at the larger, more centralized systems of stationary sources can be applied to smaller, more distributive mobile sources. There are, of course, scaling differences that need to be incorporated, but processes such as catalysis, \ufb01ltration, fuel mix, inertial impaction, and electrostatics can be applied in any air pollution setting, whether stationary or mobile. 31.2 STATIONARY SOURCE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES Most new large stationary sources of air pollution in the United States are regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and are legally required to comply with the Amendments. This is also true for most of the developed, industrialized world. Similar emission standards are being developed in rapidly developing areas of the world as well. Indeed, some of the world is experiencing air pollution levels similar to those experienced by Western urban areas during the worst episodes of the twentieth century. The rapid development of heavy chemical industries, energy consumption, and motor vehicle ownership in South Asia has resulted in substantial emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as the generation of secondary pollutants like by PM2.5,ground-level O3, and acidic deposition. In China in 2010, the annual average value from PM2.5 pilot monitoring stations in seven cities was 40e90 mgm 3, which is 14e157% higher than the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Ozone monitoring pilots show that O3 concentrations exceeded Grade II NAAQS for 20% of the days in the year in some cities, and the maximum O3 concentration per hour in some regions exceeded the European alert level (240 ppb). The pollution is visible to the naked eye, with complex air pollution diminishing visibility and creating haze for about 100 days per year in the BeijingeTianjineHebei, Yangtze Delta, and Pearl River Delta regions. In some cities haze occurs for more than 200 days a year. 1 Addressing these issues calls for steps to prevent the protracted path that the United States and Europe followed that eventually led to the Clean Air Act of 1970 and similar laws in Europe. The current and projected ambient air quality in these rapidly developing areas are leading to conditions similar to those that led to the high mortality episodes of in the Meuse Valley, Belgium,2 Donora, Pennsylvania3 Poza Rica, Mexico,4 and other urban areas of North America and Europe in the twentieth century. There is a growing appreciation of this problem. In 2012, China announced plans to require key regions (including the metropolitan areas) to decrease ambient concentration of SO2 and PM10 by 10%, NO2 by 7%, and PM2.5 by 5%. In addition, three key regions, i.e. BeijingeTianjineHebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta will have to reduce PM2.5 concentration by 6% by 2015. This means that if these plans are to be realized, substantial emission controls will need to be put into place for both particulate and gas phase pollutants released from both stationary and mobile sources. For example, the plan calls for lowering SO2,NOx, and stationary source emissions of particulates by 12%, 13%, and 10%, respectively. The SO2 target is 4% more stringent than the national target, i.e. 8%.", "The NOx emissions decrease would be 3% higher than the national target, i.e. 10%.5 Existing stationary sources may require modi\ufb01cation of existing systems or installation of newer, more ef\ufb01cient control devices to meet more restrictive emission standards. Such changes are often required by control agencies when it can be shown that a new control technology is superior to older systems or devices being used. This is usually referred to as application of the best available control technology (BACT). The BACT standards have been incrementally replaced with risk-based standards, meaning that sources may need to apply more stringent technologies as well as important measures to reduce emissions further (e.g. pollution prevention). Installation of control systems may have a positive economic bene\ufb01t, which will offset a portion of their cost. Such bene\ufb01ts include tax deduction provisions, recovery of materials previously emitted, depreciation schedules favoring the owner of the source and banking or sale of the emission offset credits if the source is in a nonattainment area, i.e. \ufb02exibly complying with traditional source-speci\ufb01c command and control standards, but with even less emissions to improve local air quality.5 31.2.1 Thermal Systems Thermal energy, power generation, and incineration have several factors in common. All rely on combustion, which causes the release of air pollutants; all exhaust their emissions at elevated temperatures; and all produce large quantities of ash when they consume solid or residual fuels. The ratio of the energy used to control pollution to the gross energy produced can be a deciding factor in the selection of the control system. These processes have important differences, which in\ufb02uence the selection of speci\ufb01c systems and devices for individual facilities. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.2 STATIONARY SOURCE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES Eliminating or reducing pollutant concentrations that would otherwise need to be destroyed thermally should be the \ufb01rst step in deciding which incinerator and other thermal process, if any is appropriate for the waste and gas streams. This begins by assessing the physical and chemical characteristics of each contaminant, and matching these characteristics with the appropriate control technology. The scienti\ufb01c concepts of Chapters 16 through 19 must be part of this decision. These especially include the kinetics and equilibria, e.g. solubility, fugacity, sorption, and bioaccumulation factors, which will determine the effectiveness of destruction, transformation, removal, and immobilization of these contaminants. In Chapter 32, these properties will be discussed within the context of sustainable approaches to address organic and inorganic contaminants typically found in air pollution scenarios, e.g. contaminated slurries and sludges. There can be synergies, e.g. innovative thermal approaches are available that not only effectively destroy organic contaminants, but in the process also destroys the inorganic cyanic compounds. Unfortunately, there are also antagonisms among approaches, such as the very effective incineration processes for organic contaminants that transform heavy metal species into more toxic and more mobile forms. The increased pressures and temperatures are good for breaking apart organic molecules and removing functional groups that lend them toxicity, but these same factors oxidize or in other ways transform the metals into worse forms. So, when mixtures of organic and inorganic contaminants are targeted, more than one technology may be required to accomplish project objectives, and care must be taken not to trade one problem (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs) for another (e.g. a more mobile species of cadmium).6 31.2.1.1 Energy-Producing Industries Stationary energy-producing systems are of two general types, residential and commercial space heating and industrial steam generation. The smaller systems (residential and commercial heating) are usually regulated only with respect to their smoke emission, even though they may produce appreciable amounts of other air pollutants.7 The large industrial systems which generate steam for process use and space heating (where superheated or high-temperature saturated steam is used for a process, e.g. cogeneration, exhausted from the process at a lower energy level, and then introduced into a space heating system, where it gives up a large amount of latent energy, condensing to hot water) are required to comply with rigid standards in most countries. Petroleum and coal supply the majority of the energy in all industrial countries. This fact gives an indication of the vast quantities of materials handled and also hints at the magnitude of the air pollution problems associated with obtaining the resource, transporting it, re\ufb01ning it, and transporting it again. The emission problems from burning fossil fuel have been previously discussed. Petroleum products are obtained from crude oil.", "In the process of getting the crude oil from the ground to the re\ufb01nery, many possibilities for emission of hydrocarbon and reduced sulfur gaseous emissions occur. In many cases, these operations take place in relatively remote regions and affect only those employed by the industry, so that little or no control is attempted. Control of atmospheric emissions from petroleum re\ufb01ning can be accomplished by process change, installation of control equipment, and improved housekeeping and maintenance. In many cases, recovery of the pollutants will result in economic bene\ufb01ts. Table 31.2 lists some of the control measures that can be used at petroleum re\ufb01neries. The amount of emissions from a petroleum re\ufb01nery varies according to type of operations, the amount and rate of crude oil being processed and the operations and management practices in and around the re\ufb01nery. A modern petroleum re\ufb01nery is a complex system of chemical and physical operations. The crude oil is \ufb01rst separated by distillation into fractions such as gasoline, kerosene, and fuel oil. Some of the distillate fractions are converted into more valuable products by cracking, polymerization, or reforming. The products are treated to remove undesirable components, such as sulfur, and then blended to meet the \ufb01nal product speci\ufb01cations. Some of the emission sources for these processes are listed in Table 31.3. Since re\ufb01neries are essentially closed processes, emissions are not normally considered a part of the operation. Re\ufb01neries do need pressure relief systems and vents, and emissions from them are possible. Most re\ufb01neries use very strict control measures for economic as well as regulatory reasons. The recovery of 1% or 2% of a re\ufb01nery throughput which was previously lost to the atmosphere can easily pay for the cost of the control equipment. The expense of the catalyst charge in some crackers and regenerators requires that the best possible control equipment be used to prevent catalyst emissions to the atmosphere. Potential air pollutants from a petroleum re\ufb01nery could include: hydrocarbons from all systems, leaks, loading, and sampling; sulfur oxides (SOx) from boilers, treaters, and regenerators; carbon monoxide (CO) from regenerators and incinerators; NOx from combustion sources and regenerators; odors from air and steam blowing, condensers, drains, and vessels; and particulate matter (PM) from boilers, crackers, regenerators, coking, and incinerators. Loading facilities must be designed to recover all vapors generated during \ufb01lling of tank trucks or tanker ships. Otherwise these vapors will be lost to the V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.

Since they may be both odorous and photochemically reactive, serious air pollution problems could result. The collected vapors must be returned to the process or disposed of by some means. An increasingly important concern is the likelihood of an uncontrolled \ufb01re caused by an accident or by a terrorist act at the re\ufb01nery. This can be the source of large and highly toxic plumes. Thus, re\ufb01neries need special measures for protection and security, coupled with vigorously diligent monitoring, operation, and maintenance. Every re\ufb01nery also needs an uptodate contingency plan. The air pollution problems associated with combustion of coal are of major concern. Combustion may occur near the mine, i.e. a mine mouth operation, or many miles away from the mine (e.g. with coal shipped to distant power plants via rail and barge). The problems of atmospheric emissions due to mining, cleaning, V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.2 STATIONARY SOURCE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES handling, and transportation of coal from the mine to the user are of lesser signi\ufb01cance as far as the overall air pollution problems are concerned. Whenever coal is handled, particulate emission becomes a problem. The emissions can be either coal dust or inorganic inclusions. Control of these emissions can be relatively expensive if the coal storage and transfer facilities are located near residential areas. This is particularly problematic in developing nations. For example, China\u2019s economic and industrial expansion over the past decade has been largely supported by coal combustion (about two-thirds of energy use). This leads to three types of problems: 1. Coal is among the worst fuels in terms of production of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2). 2. Coal often has high sulfur and ash content, so it is a major source of oxides of sulfur and particulate matter, respectively. 3. Coal contains heavy metals, particularly mercury, so it is also a major contributor to air toxics. Control of air pollution from energy-producing industries is a function of the fuel used and the other variables of the combustion process. The system must be thoroughly analyzed before a control system is chosen. The important variables are listed in Table 30.3 in Chapter 30. For particulate matter control, the variables of process control such as improved combustion, fuel cleaning, fuel switching, and load reduction through conservation should be considered before choosing an add-on control system. If the particulate matter emission is still found to be in excess of standards, then control devices must be used. These include inertial devices (such as multiple cyclones), baghouses, wet and dry scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), and some of the previously discussed novel devices. Series combinations of control devices may be necessary to achieve the required level of particulate matter emission. A commonly used system is a multiple cyclone followed by a \ufb01ne-particle control system, such as a baghouse, scrubber, or ESP. Opacity reduction is the control of \ufb01ne-particulate matter (<1 mm diameter). It can be accomplished through the application of the systems and devices discussed for control of particulate matter and by use of combustion control systems to reduce smoke and aerosol emission. In addition, operational practices such as continuous soot blowing and computerized fuel and air systems should be considered. Sulfur dioxide reduction to achieve required emission levels may be accomplished by switching to lower-sulfur fuels. Use of low-sulfur coal or oil, or even biomass such as wood residue as a fuel, may be less expensive than installing an SO2 control system after the process. This is particularly true in the wood products industry, where wood residue is often available at a relatively low cost. If an SO2 control device is necessary, the \ufb01rst decision is whether to use a wet or dry system. Many times this decision is based on the local situation regarding the disposal of the collected residue (sludge or dry material). Wet scrubbing systems, using chemical additions to the scrubbing liquid, are widely used. Various commercial systems have used lime or limestone, magnesium oxide, or sodium hydroxide slurries to remove the SO2. Dry removal of SO2 can be accomplished by adding the same chemicals used in wet scrubbers, but adding them in a spray drier and then removing the spent sulfates with a bag house or ESP. This results in the collection of a dry material which may be either disposed of by land \ufb01lling or used as a raw material for other processes. The electric power generating industry has had many years of experience with SO2 control systems.", "These methods are discussed in more detail in the next section. Control of oxides of nitrogen can be accomplished by catalysts or absorbents, but most control systems have concentrated on changing the combustion process to reduce the formation of NOx. Improved burners, change in burner location, staged combustion, and low-temperature combustion utilizing \ufb02uidized-bed systems are all currently in use. These combustion improvement systems do not generate waste products, so no disposal problems exist. 31.2.1.2 Power Generation In general, plants-producing electric power are much larger than those producing steam for space heating or process use. Therefore, the mass of emissions is much greater and the physical size of the control equipment larger. The extensive control of particulate matter, opacity, SO2, and NOx required on new power plants is very expensive. The high-projected cost of environmental control for a new coal-\ufb01red electric generating plant has made utility companies reluctant to risk the US billions of dollars necessary to use coal as a major fuel, particularly when they have perceived that emission standards are being rede\ufb01ned and changed.9 Figure 31.1 illustrates the complexity of the current technology for the various alternative systems. Figure 31.1(A) presents the integrated environmental control potential for maximum control of particulate matter and SO2. Cooling tower water blowdown and treatment by-products may be used to satisfy scrubber makeup requirements. Fly ash and scrubber sludge will be produced separately. If the catalytic NOx process is required, the integration issues will be increased signi\ufb01cantly. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.

Ref. 9. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.2 STATIONARY SOURCE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES Figure 31.1(B) is similar to Figure 31.1(A) except that an ESP is used for particulate control. This represents the most common approach for compliance when con\ufb01gured without a catalytic NOx unit. Figure 31.1(C) is distinctly different from the \ufb01rst two in the type of SO2 control processes used and the sequence of the particulate matter and SO2 controls. It is a promising approach for up to 90% SO2 control of western United States coal, and there is a single waste product. Other features include the collection of particulate matter at temperatures below 90 C and the possibility for spray dryer cooling tower water integration. This system may or may not include a catalytic NOx unit. Figure 31.1(D) represents the simplest, least expensive, and lowest water consumer of all the alternatives. There is a single solid waste product. The key element is the integrated SO2/particulate control process. Using sodium-based sorbants, compliance may be achievable for western United States coals. Figure 31.1(E) includes a hot ESP for \ufb02y ash collection prior to a catalytic NOx unit. Having a hot ESP dictates the use of a conventional wet scrubber and perhaps the need for a second particulate matter control device at the end of the system. Fly ash and scrubber sludge would be separate by-products, but sludge could be contaminated with NH4 from the catalytic NO process. Figure 31.2 illustrates a wet SO2 desulfurization system using a spray tower absorber. Figure 31.3 illustrates a rotary atomizer injecting an alkaline slurry into a spray dryer for SO2 control. Selection and installation of an integrated air pollution control system do not end the concern of the utility Stack Paral recycling Disposal V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31. CONTROLLING AIR POLLUTION FROM SOURCES industry. Maintenance and operational problems of the system are considered by many engineers to be the weak link in the chain of power generation equipment.10 This is particularly important for SO2 removal. Generally to treat SO2, the exhaust gas passes through a scrubber where a spray mixture of limestone and water reacts with the SO2. Newer scrubbers are typically being designed to remove 95% or more of the SO2 from the gas stream of fossil-fuel power plants. When SO2 combines with limestone, a primary by-product is calcium sulfate (CaSO4).", "This substance can be used as wallboard and cement, and as a soil amendment.11 Wet \ufb02ue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubbers can be classi\ufb01ed as either nonregenerable or regenerable. Nonregenerable FGD processes produce a sludge that must be disposed of properly. This does not mean that the scrubbing liquid cannot be recycled or regenerated, but that no directly useful product is obtained from the eventual sludge. Conversely, regenerable processes generate a product from the sludge that may be sold to partially offset the cost of operating the FGD system. Regenerated products include elemental S, H2SO4, and gypsum. Over 90% of FGD processes are nonregenerable, likely due to the greater simplicity and less costs, at least at present. About 80% of FGD systems in the United States are wet systems using lime or limestone as a reagent.12 The reliability of the FGD system is de\ufb01ned as the time the system operates properly divided by the time it should have operated. Wet limestone systems have been designed for high ef\ufb01ciency SO2 removal, up to 98%, but most wet limestone systems appear to be designed for 90% SO2 removal. All limestone forced oxidation (LSFO) systems installed after 1990 are designed to remove SO2 at a rate greater than 90%. The low ef\ufb01ciency designs are used generally for low-S fuel fossil fuel burning facilities.13 High velocity LSFO processes appear to be able to remove over 99% of SO2 under test conditions.14 The SO2 reduction ef\ufb01ciency at lime spray drying installations are about 90% for \ufb02ue gas from burning 2% S coal. The primary factors cited for low FGD reliability are (1) plugging, scaling, and corrosion of scrubber internals, mist eliminators, and reheaters; (2) need for open-loop operation and blowdown of scrubber liquor to reduce the corrosive substance concentration and dissolved solids content; (3) corrosion and failure of stack liners; and (4) plugging and failure of piping, pumps, and valves. Probably more critical are failures of dampers, ducts, and baf\ufb02es, because this may require plant shutdown to perform maintenance. Other methods, which should be mentioned because they show potential bene\ufb01ts for pollution reduction from utility stacks include (1) coal cleaning and treatment, (2) atmospheric pressure and pressurized \ufb02uidized-bed combustors, (3) conversion of solid fuels to liquid or gaseous fuels, and (4) combustion modi\ufb01cation through staged combustors or other systems. Tall stacks are no longer considered to be an acceptable alternative for controlling emissions from electric power generating plants. Although they may allow much of the pollution plume to miss nearby areas, they contribute to the long-range transport of these pollutants. This leads to acidic deposition and other regional, continental, and global pollution problems. 31.2.1.3 Incineration Thermal removal processes are discussed in detail in Chapter 29, but these techniques are applied in many industries other than hazardous waste destruction. Indeed, the principles employed for hazardous wastes were initially borrowed from industry, e.g. kilns for cement making. Incineration continues to be an important means of dealing with municipal waste. For example, it represents a substantial component of solid waste management in many countries (Table 31.4). Municipal waste incinerators are particularly problematic, since their waste streams include a wide range of materials. Some are already hazardous and others can become hazardous after the combustion processes involved in incinerators. Incineration is similar to combustion-generated energy and power processes in that fuel combines with oxygen. The incineration process, however, is designed as a waste disposal process, and if any energy is recovered, it is considered as a secondary system. Ideally, incineration will reduce the need for combustors,7 conversion of solid fuels to liquid or gaseous fuels, and combustion modi\ufb01cation through staged combustors or other systems. It is important to note that the term \u201cincineration\u201d is speci\ufb01cally reserved for oxidative thermal processes with excess air. However, in general use, the term often includes thermal processes in the absence of O2 (i.e. pyrolysis) and low O2 (e.g. gasi\ufb01cation). Indeed, this is not just a matter of thermodynamic theory, but is a factor in air pollution control. For example, pyrolytic processes produce H2, CO, hydrocarbons, ash, and pyrolysis oil; all of which need to be addressed in the gas stream. Below the stoichiometric air required for combustion, gasi\ufb01cation produces H2,CH4, methane (CO2), CO, slag, and ash. An incinerator will usually have a fuel of varying chemical composition and physical properties, as well as varying moisture content and heating value.", "In addition, the fuel \ufb01red in one locality may be vastly different from that \ufb01red by an incinerator of similar size and design in another locality. Refuse production in the United States has been estimated to average 2.5 g per person per day in 1970, increasing to 10 kg per person per day by the year 2000. The air pollutants from incinerators consist of particulate matter (e.g. \ufb02y ash, carbon, metals and metal oxides V.

The oxides of nitrogen are formed by two mechanisms: thermal NOx, in which atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen combine at high furnace temperatures, and fuel NOx, when nitrogen-bearing compounds are incinerated. Addressing emissions of NOx and SOx is an example of advancing the state-of-the-science of both stationary and mobile source controls. These emission standards of compounds, especially NOx, have continuously become more stringent for mobile sources, e.g. to address ground-level ozone and acid rain. This has led to improved mobile source control technologies that can be adapted to stationary source. These modify the combustion process to quench combustion gases and to shorten residence times at high temperatures and O2 availability. Other approaches include low excess air \ufb01ring, staged combustion, and \ufb02ue gas recirculation. These controls have been shown to decrease NOx emissions from electric utility boilers, oil \ufb01eld steam generators, and glass melting furnaces. Redesigned burners for boilers and heaters, water injection or dry low NOx combustors have been used on gas turbines. Prestrati\ufb01ed charge and precombustion chamber systems have been applied to reciprocating internal combustion engines. These combustion modi\ufb01cations can be used alone or in combination with other control technologies.15 Postcombustion NOx control methods include selective catalytic reduction (SCR), selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR), and nonselective catalytic reduction (NSCR). Selective NOx reduction methods inject ammonia (NH3) urea or other reductants into the post-combustion region. In the SCR approach, a catalyst is added to the injection, whereas in the SNCR approach the reductant is injected in the absence of a catalyst. For rich burning internal combustion engines, CO and hydrocarbons reduce NOx nonselectively atop a catalyst bed, i.e. NSCR. The NOx emission removal ef\ufb01ciency of these technologies can be as high as 95%.15 It is important to note that HCl\u2019s inherent toxicity is quite high even at low concentrations, and that, its emissions are compounded with increasing amounts of halogenated polymers, notably polyvinyl chloride (PVC), in the refuse; i.e. 1 kg of pure PVC yields about 0.6 kg of HCl. The POM emissions appear to be a function of the degree of combustion control, decreasing with increasing incinerator size (larger incinerators are more thoroughly instrumented and controlled). The measured emission rates for POM and CO vary considerably by type of incinerator and the amount and type of materials being incinerated. For example, a municipal incinerator burning 227 metric tons per day, before a settling chamber, is reported to emit 0.032 grams per metric ton (g Mg 1) POM and 0.35 grams per kilogram (g kg 1) CO, whereas a 45 metric ton per day incinerator is reported to emit 0.258 g Mg 1 POM and 2.00 g kg 1 CO. However, with a scrubber, the 45 metric ton per day incinerator\u2019s emissions decrease to 0.014 g Mg 1 POM and 1.00 g kg 1 CO.", "A commercial multiple chamber\u2019s emissions can be quite high, e.g. a 3 metric ton per day chamber without a control system has been reported to be 1.726 g Mg 1 POM and 12.50 g kg 1 CO.16 Air pollution control systems using wet scrubbers will remove some water-soluble gases, but the removal of particulate matter is the primary concern for a control system. The air pollution control system, therefore, is usually a single device such as a wet scrubber, small-diameter multiple cyclones, fabric \ufb01lters, or ESPs. The V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31. CONTROLLING AIR POLLUTION FROM SOURCES multicyclones are the least expensive system and the ESPs the most expensive. Some technological enhancements of incineration offer the possibility of reduced emissions. These include \u201cslagging\u201d (operating at such a high temperature that incombustible materials are melted and removed as a \ufb02uid slag); \ufb02uidized beds (which are useful only on homogeneous or well-classi\ufb01ed refuse); suspension burning in cylindrical combustion chambers, which may or may not result in slagging; and pyrolysis, which is destructive distillation in the absence of oxygen. The emission control requirements set for municipal incinerators are extensive and complex. They vary by type of waste being incinerated and by the rules of a particular jurisdiction. A thorough study of the regulations in a particular jurisdiction is necessary for incinerator technology and control. 31.2.2 Chemical and Metallurgical Industries The chemical and metallurgical industries of the world are so varied and extensive that it is impossible to cover all of the processes, emissions, and controls in a single chapter. 31.2.2.1 Chemical and Allied Industries The term chemical industry applies to a group of industries which range from small, single ownereemployee operations to huge complexes employing thousands of people. Indeed, a single facility can have myriad reactors, storage vessels and other structures, each with its own vents, stack and fugitive releases (Figure 31.4). The number of environmental regulations that the chemical industry must comply with is so extensive that specialized consulting \ufb01rms have been formed to aid the industry in handling them. The emissions from a chemical process can be related to the speci\ufb01c process. A plant manufacturing a resin might be expected to emit not only the resin being manufactured but also some of the raw material and some other products which may or may not resemble the resin. A plant manufacturing sulfuric acid can be expected to emit sulfuric acid fumes and SO2. A plant manufacturing soap products could be expected to emit a variety of odors. Depending on the process, the emissions could be any one or a combination of dust, aerosols, fumes, or gases. The emissions may or may not be odorous or toxic. Some of the primary emissions might be innocuous but later react in the atmosphere to form an undesirable secondary pollutant. A \ufb02owchart and material balance sheet for the particular process are very helpful in understanding and analyzing any process and its emissions.11 In any discussion of the importance of emissions from a particular process for an area, several factors must be consideredd(1) the percentage of the total emissions of the area that the particular process emits, (2) the degree of toxicity of the emissions, and (3) the obvious characteristics of the source (which can be related to either sight or smell). Each chemical in use today has a particular life cycle, beginning during extraction from the earth with releases to the environment along the way (Figure 31.5). Air pollutant emissions from these various processes must be controlled. 31.2.2.1.1 INORGANIC CHEMICAL PROCESSES Production of major inorganic chemicals in the United States exceeds 200 million metric tons per year produced in over 1300 plants.17 31.2.2.1.1.1 ACID AND BASE MANUFACTURE Acids are used as basic raw materials for many chemical processes and manufacturing operations. Figure 31.6 illustrates an acid plant with its \ufb02ow diagram. Sulfuric acid is one of the major inorganic chemicals in modern industry. The atmospheric discharges from a sulfuric V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.2 STATIONARY SOURCE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES Water acid plant can be expected to contain gases including SO2 and aerosol mists, containing SO3 and H2SO4,in the submicron to 10-mm size range. The aerosol mists are particularly damaging to paint, vegetation, metal, and synthetic \ufb01bers. Other processes producing acids, such as nitric, acetic, and phosphoric acids, can be expected to produce acid mists from the processes themselves as well as various toxic and nontoxic gases. The particular process must be thoroughly studied to obtain a complete listing of all the speci\ufb01c emissions.", "The major acids produced are hydrochloric, hydro\ufb02uoric, nitric, phosphoric, and sulfuric.

The PO4 in the rock may then be reacted with sulfuric acid to produce normal superphosphate fertilizer. Over 100 plants operating in the United States produce approximately a billion kilograms of phosphate fertilizer per year. Figure 31.7 is a \ufb02ow diagram for a normal superphosphate plant which notes the pollutants emitted. The particulate and gaseous \ufb02uoride emissions cause greatest concern near phosphate fertilizer plants. Fertilizer production is dependent on the production of phosphates and nitrates. Phosphate rock preparation generates some dry particulate matter during drying, grinding, and transferring of the rock. These emissions are controlled by wet scrubbers and baghouses. The atmospheric emissions and control methods for the production processes are shown in Table 31.7. Ammonium nitrate fertilizer is produced by the neutralization of nitric acid with ammonia. The primary emission is the dust or fume of ammonium nitrate from the prill tower. The material is of submicron size and, therefore, highly visible. Control is usually performed by a wet scrubber followed by a mist eliminator. Air pollutants can be emitted from several sites in Figure 31.7, including the reactor, the ammoniatorgranulator, the dryer and cooler, product sizing and material transfer. There is also water pollution and the opportunity for water-to-air emissions of compounds, such as slurries and gypsum ponds that contain scrubber waste. The reactor and ammoniator-granulator produce emissions of gaseous ammonia, gaseous \ufb02uorides such as hydrogen \ufb02uoride (HF) and silicon V.

These are commonly combined and passed through primary and secondary scrubbers. HF is listed as a hazardous air pollutant under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Exhaust gases from the dryer and cooler also contain ammonia, \ufb02uorides and PM, which are usually combined and passed through cyclones and primary and secondary scrubbers. The PM emissions and low ammonia and \ufb02uoride concentrations from product sizing and material transfer operations are controlled in this manner. Exhaust streams from the reactor and ammoniator-granulator pass through a primary scrubber, in which phosphoric acid is used to recover ammonia and particulate. Exhaust from the dryer, cooler and screen \ufb01rst are sent to cyclones for PM recovery, and next to primary scrubbers. Materials collected in the cyclone and primary scrubbers are recovered and returned to the process. The exhaust is sent to secondary scrubbers, where recycled gypsum pond water serves as a scrubbing liquid to control the emissions of F-compounds. The scrubber ef\ufb02uent recirculates to the gypsum pond.", "Primary scrubbing equipment at fertilizer plants commonly includes venturi and cyclonic spray towers, with impingement scrubbers and spray-cross\ufb02ow packed bed scrubbers serving as secondary controls. Mainly to recover ammonia, primary scrubbers often use phosphoric acid of 20 to 30 percent as scrubbing liquor. Secondary scrubbers generally use gypsum and pond water for F control. Although this is the general con\ufb01guration, any combinations and variations of the set-up exist, e.g. using reactor-feed concentration phosphoric acid (40 percent P2O5) in both primary and secondary scrubbers, and some use phosphoric acid near the dilute end of the 20 to 30 percent P2O5 range in only a single scrubber. Existing plants are equipped with ammonia recovery scrubbers on the reactor, ammoniatorgranulator and dryer, and particulate controls on the dryer and cooler. Emission control ef\ufb01ciencies for ammonium phosphate plant control equipment generally range from 94 to 99 percent for ammonium, 75 to 99.8 percent for particulates, and 74 to 94 percent for \ufb02uorides.18 31.2.2.1.1.3 HALOGEN PRODUCTION Most of the chlorine manufactured is produced by two electrolytic methods, the diaphragm cell and the mercury cell processes. Both processes emit chlorine to the atmosphere from various streams and from handling and loading V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.

If the gas streams contain over 10% chlorine, the chlorine is recovered by absorption. If the chlorine concentration is less, the usual practice is to scrub the vent gases with an alkaline solution. Mercury is emitted from the mercury cell process from ventilation systems and by-product streams. Control techniques include (1) condensation, (2) mist elimination, (3) chemical scrubbing, (4) activated carbon adsorption, and (5) molecular sieve absorption. Several mercury cell (chloralkali) plants in Japan have been converted to diaphragm cells to eliminate the poisonous levels of methyl mercury found in \ufb01sh. All of the bromine produced in the United States is extracted from naturally occurring brines using steam extraction. The major air pollution concern is H2S from the stripper if H2S is present in the brine. The H2S can either be oxidized to SO2 in a \ufb02are or sent to a sulfur recovery plant. 31.2.2.1.1.4 OTHER INORGANIC CHEMICALS Production of the large quantities of inorganic chemicals necessary for modern industrial processes can result in air pollutant emissions as undesirable byproducts. Table 31.8 lists some of the more common inorganic chemicals produced, along with the associated air pollutants potentially emitted from the speci\ufb01c 8 process. 31.2.2.1.2 ORGANIC CHEMICAL PROCESSES Most petrochemical processes are essentially enclosed and normally vent only a small amount of fugitive emissions. However, the petrochemical processes that use air-oxidation-type reactions normally vent large, continuous amounts of gaseous emissions to the atmosphere.19 Six major petrochemical processes employ reactions using air oxidation. Table 31.9 lists the atmospheric emissions from these processes along with applicable control measures. 31.2.2.1.2.1 RESINS AND PLASTICS Resins are solid or semisolid, water-insoluble, organic substances with little or no tendency to crystallize. They are the basic components of plastics and are also used for coatings on paper, particleboard, and other surfaces that require a decorative, protective, or special-purpose \ufb01nish. The common TABLE 31.9 Air Pollution Emissions and Controls: Petrochemical Processes Petrochemical Process Air Pollutant Emissions Control Methods in Use Ethylene oxide (most emissions from purge vents) Formaldehyde (most emissions from exit gas stream of scrubber) Phthalic anhydride (most emissions from off-gas from switch condensers) Acrylonitrile (most emissions from exit gas stream from product absorber) Carbon black (most emissions from exit gas stream from baghouse, some fugitive particulate) Ethylene dichloride (most emissions from exit gas-stream of solvent scrubber) Ethane, ethylene, ethylene oxide Formaldehyde, methanol, carbon monoxide, dimethyl ether Organic acids and anhydrides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter Carbon monoxide, propylene, propane, hydrogen cyanide, acrylonitrile, acetonitrile NOx from by-product incinerator Hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sul\ufb01de, sulfur dioxide, methane, acetylene Particulate matter (carbon black) Carbon monoxide, methane, ethylene, ethane, ethylene dichloride, aromatic solvent Catalytic afterburner Wet scrubber for formaldehyde and methanol only; after-burner for organic vent gases Venturi scrubber followed by cyclone separator and packed countercurrent scrubber Thermal incinerators (gas-\ufb01red afterburners or catalytic afterburners None Waste heat boiler or \ufb02are (no control for SO2)", "Baghouse None at present, but could use a waste heat boiler or after burner, followed by a caustic scrubber for hydrochloric acid generated by combustion V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.2 STATIONARY SOURCE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES characteristic of resins is that heat is used in their manufacture and application, and gases are exhausted from these processes. Some of the gases that are economically recoverable may be condensed, but a large portion is lost to the atmosphere. One operation, coating a porous paper with a resin to form battery separators, was emitting to the atmosphere about 85% of the resin purchased. This resin left the stacks of the plant as a blue haze, and the odor was routinely detected more than 2 km away. Since most resins and their by-products have low-odor thresholds, disagreeable odor is the most common complaint against any operation using them. 31.2.2.1.2.2 VARNISH, PAINTS, AND COATINGS In the manufacture of varnish, heat is necessary for formulation and puri\ufb01cation. The same may be true of operations preparing paints, shellac, inks, and other protective or decorative coatings. The compounds emitted to the atmosphere are gases, some with extremely low-odor thresholds. Acrolein, with an odor threshold of about 4000 mgm-3, and reduced sulfur compounds, with odor thresholds of 2 mgm-3, are both possible emissions from varnish cooking operations. The atmospheric emissions from varnish cooking appear to have little or no recovery value, whereas some of the solvents used in paint preparation are routinely condensed for recovery and returned to the process. If a paint \ufb01nish is baked to harden the surface by removal of organic solvents, the solvents must either be recovered, destroyed, or emitted to the atmosphere. The last course, emission to the atmosphere, is undesirable and may be prohibited by the air pollution control agency. 31.2.2.2 Metallurgical Industries The metallurgical industry offers some of the most challenging air pollution control problems encountered. The gas volumes are huge, and the gas may be at a high temperature. These large, hot gas volumes may convey large quantities of dust or metal oxide fumes, some of which may be highly toxic. Also, gaseous pollutants such as SO2 or CO may be very highly concentrated in the carrying stream. The process emissions to the atmosphere may have harmful effects on visibility, vegetation, animals, and inert materials, as well as being detrimental to human health. It is no wonder that the metallurgical industries have spent huge sums to control emissions. The emission pro\ufb01le for heavy metals has changed dramatically in recent decades, especially for the industrialized economies. For example, in 1990 the majority of lead emissions in many countries, both developed and developing, was from the transportation sector (Figure 31.8). This was mainly due to the use of lead additives to fuel. In the United Kingdom in 2011, transport-related emissions accounted for only 3% of the total lead emissions, compared to 74% of emissions in 1990. In recent years, the main sources of lead emissions in the United Kingdom are from combustion processes during iron and steel production, metal production and combustion of lubricants in industry.17 There has been a comparatively smaller decrease in emissions from iron and steel production processes due to improved abatement measures and the decreasing use of coal.20 (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Ref. 20. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31. CONTROLLING AIR POLLUTION FROM SOURCES Emissions of lead from industry rose in a few UK industries, dominated by metal production. Other UK lead sources include the chemical industry and solid fuel transformation. Between 1990 and 2011 emissions from metal production and the chemical industry have fallen by 95% and 96%, respectively.20 31.2.2.2.1 NONFERROUS METALLURGICAL OPERATIONS At the end of the nineteenth century, one of the most obvious environmental effects of industry was the complete destruction of vegetation downwind from copper, lead, and zinc smelters. This problem was caused by the smelting of the metallic sul\ufb01de ores. As the metal was released in the smelting process, huge quantities of sulfur were oxidized to SO2, which was toxic to much of the vegetation fumigated by the plume. Similarly, aluminum facilities emitted large amount of \ufb02uoride compounds which denuded vegetation and adversely affected farm animals. Present smelting systems go to great expense to prevent the uncontrolled release of SO2, but in many areas the recovery of the ecosystem will take years and possibly centuries. Emissions from other nonferrous metal facilities are primarily metal fumes or metal oxides of extremely small diameter.", "Zinc oxide fumes vary from 0.03 to 0.3 mm and are toxic. Lead and lead oxide fumes are extremely toxic and have been extensively studied. Arsenic, cadmium, bismuth, and other trace metals can be emitted from many metallurgical processes. Nonferrous metallurgy is as varied as the ores and \ufb01nished products. Almost every thermal, chemical and physical process known to engineers is in use. Extraction of ores generates metal-laden dust. In addition, transport of the ore also involves the release of particulates. Re\ufb01ning the ore generates both aerosols and vapors. Flue gases from furnaces (Figure 31.9) and air moving through ventilation systems are vented to cyclones, scrubbers, baghouses, and other air pollution controls to remove PM (Figure 31.10). Smelters are examples of multicompartmental polluters. For example, to prevent air pollution, the PM that is removed from the separator is subsequently transported to on-site storage area, recycle streams or to off-site disposal sites. Thus, PM collection systems can be a signi\ufb01cant source of heavy metal and other mineral exposures if not handled, operated, cleaned, and maintained adequately. Every nonferrous re\ufb01ning process emits pollutants and requires appropriate control systems, especially primary and secondary smelting of aluminum, beryllium, copper, lead, mercury, zinc, as well as the processing of alloys. Early aluminum reduction plants were responsible for air pollution because of the \ufb02uoride emissions from their operations. Fluoride emissions can cause severe damage to vegetation and to animals feeding on such vegetation. The end result was an area surrounding the plant devoid of vegetation. Such scenes are reminiscent of those downwind from some of the uncontrolled copper smelters. New aluminum reduction plants have invested considerable expense to control \ufb02uoride emissions. Some of the older plants have found that the cost of control exceeded the original capital investment in the entire facility. Where the problem is serious, control agencies have developed extensive sampling networks to monitor emissions from the plant of concern. The emissions from primary aluminum reduction plants may come from the primary control system, which vents the electrolytic cells through control devices, or from the secondary system, which controls the emissions from the buildings housing the cells. Hydrogen \ufb02uoride accounts for about 90% of the gaseous \ufb02uoride emitted from the electrolytic cell. Other gaseous emissions are SO2,CO2, CO, NO2,H2S, COS, CS2,SF6, and various gaseous \ufb02uorocarbons. Particulate \ufb02uoride is emitted directly from the process and is also formed from condensation and solidi\ufb01cation of the gaseous \ufb02uorides. The \ufb02uoride removal ef\ufb01ciency of the control equipment at primary aluminum reduction plants is shown in Table 31.10. The removal ef\ufb01ciency for total \ufb02uorides is a matter of great concern. Emission rates using the BACT on the three electrolytic cell types are shown in Table 31.11. Beryllium is extracted from the ore in the form of beryllium hydroxide, which is then converted to the desired product, metal, oxide, or alloy.21 Some of these products are extremely toxic. Table 31.12 lists the emissions from the various beryllium production steps, along with the control measures commonly used. Most copper is removed from low-grade sul\ufb01de ores using pyrometallurgical processes. The copper is \ufb01rst concentrated, then dewatered, and \ufb01ltered. The copper smelting process consists of roasters, reverberatory furnaces, and converters. Some copper is further re\ufb01ned electrolytically to eliminate impurities. Some fugitive particulate emissions occur around copper mines, concentrating, and smelting facilities, but the greatest concern is with emissions from the ore preparation, smelting, and re\ufb01ning processes. Table 31.13 lists the range of emissions of SO2 from primary copper smelters. Copper (Cu) ore can contain very high concentrations of sulfur compounds. In fact, Cu concentrations in ores averages only about 0.6%, with commercial V.

The emission of volatile trace elements from roasting, smelting, and converting processes is undesirable from both air pollution and economic standpoint. Gravity collectors, cyclones, and ESPs are used to attain collection ef\ufb01ciencies of up to 99.7% for dust and fumes. Treatment of slimes for economic recovery of silver, gold, selenium, tellurium, and other trace elements requires fusion and oxidation in a furnace. The furnace gases are exhausted through a wet scrubber followed by an ESP to recover the metals. Lead ores are crushed, ground, and concentrated in a manner similar to the processing of copper ores. Fugitive emissions from these processes include dusts, Process Emission (g of SO2 per kg of lead) Sintering 575e1075 Blast furnace 2.5e5 Dross reverberatory furnace 2.5e5 Source: Nelson KW, Varner MO, Smith TJ.

Smelting is usually accomplished in a blast furnace after the concentrated ore is sintered. Sintering removes up to 85% of the sulfur. Gases from the sintering process contain SO2, dust, and metal oxide fumes. The blast furnace gases contain similar particulates plus SO2 and CO. Table 31.14 indicates the expected SO2 emissions. Mercury is produced commercially by processing mercury sul\ufb01de (cinnabar). The mercury sul\ufb01de is thermally decomposed in a retort or roaster to produce elemental mercury and sulfur dioxide. The off-gases are cleaned by being passed through cyclonic separators, and the mercury is then condensed. The SO2 is removed by scrubbers before the exhaust gases are released to the atmosphere. Any mercury vapors that escape are collected in refrigerated units and, usually, recovered with a baghouse or ESP. Other systems use absorption with sodium hypochlorite and sodium chloride or adsorption on activated carbon or proprietary adsorbents. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed a limit of 2300 g of mercury emission per 24 h on any mercury smelter or process. Zinc is processed very similarly to copper and lead. The zinc is bound in the ore as ZnS, sphalerite. Zinc is also obtained as an impurity from lead smelting, in which it is recovered from the blast furnace slag. Dusts, fumes and SO2 are generated during sintering, retorting and roasting, as shown in Table 31.15. Particulate emissions from zinc processing are collected in baghouses or ESPs. SO2 in high concentrations is passed directly to an acid plant for production of sulfuric acid by the contact process.

The resulting ammonium sulfate is processed to the crystalline form and marketed as fertilizer. Other nonferrous metals and alloys: Nonferrous metals of lesser signi\ufb01cance include arsenic, cadmium, and refractory metals such as zirconium and titanium. Air pollution emissions from the manufacture of these metals do not constitute a major problem, although severe local problems may exist near the facility. Control of emissions is usually accomplished by a single device at the exit of the process. In many cases, the material removed by the control device has some value, either as the primary product or as a by-product. Table 31.16 shows some of the atmospheric emissions and control systems used on these metallurgical processes. Alloys of nonferrous metals, primarily the brasses (copper and zinc), and the bronzes (copper and tin), can cause an air pollution problem during melting and casting. The type and degree of emissions depend on the furnace and the alloy. Control systems consist of hoods over the furnaces and pouring stations to collect the hot gases, ducts and fans, and baghouses or ESPs. Secondary metals: These metals are those recovered from scrap. Copper (including brass and bronze), lead, zinc, and aluminum are the principal nonferrous secondary metals. Emissions from the recovery processes are similar to those from the primary metallurgical operations except that little or no SO2 or \ufb02uorides are evolved. Baghouses and ESPs are the commonly used control devices. 31.2.2.2.2 FERROUS METALLURGICAL OPERATIONS More than half of the total pollution control costs associated with iron and steel manufacturing relate to air emissions, and have been estimated to range from 1% to 3% of total production costs. Installation of pollution controls is about 10e20% of total plant investments. These costs are an obstacle to the global application of state-of-the-art controls in developing countries, as well as for older, \ufb01nancially strapped but less ef\ufb01cient operations.24 For example, the iron and steel sector is responsible for 37% of the lead emissionsinthe United Kingdomin2011, of whichsinter production accounts for 74%. Emissions from sinter production have reduced by around 48% since 1990, but the proportion of annual UK lead emissions it accounts for has increased due to the decline in emissions from sectors such as transport.20 Iron and steel industries have been concerned with emissions from their furnaces and cupolas since the industry started. Pressures for control have forced the companies to such a low level of permissible emissions that some of the older operations have been closed rather than spend the money to comply. Most of the companies controlling these operations have not gone out of business but rather have opened a new, controlled plant to replace each old plant. Table 31.17 illustrates the changes in the steelmaking processes that have occurred in the United States. Indeed, virtually all steel is produced using two processes, i.e. basic oxygen furnaces (BOF) or electric arc furnaces (EAF). Both processes can integrate varying amounts of scrap, but steel of very high quality must use virgin materials. This fact and the uneven availability of acceptable scrap iron means that BOF and electric processes are not completely interchangeable.", "Both processes use large amounts of energy, i.e. BOF integrated processes average about 16.5 million BTU per ton (MBtu ton 1) and EAF about 5.7 MBtu ton 1.25 V.

They may also include gases, both organic and inorganic. If steel scrap is melted, the charge may contain appreciable amounts of oil, grease, and other combustibles that further add to the organic gas and smoke loadings. If the ore used has appreciable \ufb02uoride concentrations, the emission of both gaseous and particulate \ufb02uorides can be a serious problem (see Section 31.2.5.4 Glass Manufacturing Plants for a discussion of \ufb02uorides). Emissions from foundry cupolas are relatively small but still signi\ufb01cant, in some areas. An uncontrolled 2-m cupola can be expected to emit up to 50 kg of dust, fumes, smoke, and oil vapor per hour. Carbon monoxide, NOx, and organic gases may also be expected. Control is possible, but the cost of the control may be prohibitive for the small foundry which only has one or two heats per week. Obviously, the volatilized gases are air pollutants. In fact, coke ovens are the source of thousands of compounds, many that are toxic. Coke facilities have recognized that many of these gases are also economically valuable, so technologies exist and are being applied to recover, separate, and sell them for pro\ufb01t. Some of the processes shown in Table 31.17 no longer need coke to produce steel. This is an example of green engineering. Air pollution occurs at numerous points in the manufacturing process (Figure 31.11), and the speci\ufb01c pollutants emitted vary according to a number of factors, including the particular re\ufb01nement process, the engineering and construction of the plant, the raw materials employed, the sources and amounts of the energy required, the extent to which waste products are recycled into the process, and the ef\ufb01ciency of the pollution controls. For example, the introduction of basic-oxygen steel making has permitted the collection and recycling of waste gases in a controlled manner, reducing the amounts to be exhausted, while the use of the continuous-casting process has reduced the consumption of energy, resulting in a reduction of emissions. This has increased product yield and improved quality. In 2012, total world crude steel production was 1547.8 million metric tons (mmt). By far China was the largest steel producer with about 717 mmt, accounting 46.3% of world steel production in 2012. The European Union, Japan and the U.S. produced about 160, 107, and 89 mmt, respectively, in 2012.26 Iron and steel industries are generally grouped as steel mills, which produce steel sheets or shapes, and foundries, which produce iron or steel castings. Some steel mills use electric arc furnaces with scrap steel as the raw material, but most are large, integrated mills with the following facilities: 1. Coke making:27 Coke is produced from blended coals by either the nonrecovery beehive process or the byproduct process. The by-product process produces the majority of the coke. Air pollutants from the coke-making process vary according to the point of release from the process and the time the process has been in operation. Table 31.18 shows the emissions, and their control, from the different stages of the by-product process. Coke is produced by blending and heating bituminous coals in coke ovens to 1000e1400 Cin the absence of oxygen. Light weight oils and tars are distilled from the coal, generating various gases during the heating process. Every half an hour or so, the \ufb02ows of gas, air, and waste gas are reversed to maintain uniform temperature distribution across the wall. In most modern coking systems, nearly half of the total coke oven gas produced from coking is returned to the heating \ufb02ues for burning after having passed through various cleaning and co-product recovery processes. Coke oven emissions are the benzene-soluble fraction of the particulate matter generated during coke production. They are known to contain human carcinogens.", "These emissions comprise a highly toxic mixture of gases and aerosols. Coke oven emissions are actually complex mixtures of gas, liquid, and solid phases, usually including a range of about 40 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as well as other PIC; notably formaldehyde, acrolein, aliphatic aldehydes, ammonia, CO NOx phenol, cadmium, arsenic, and mercury. More than 60 organic compounds have been collected near coke plants. A metric ton of coal yields up to 635 kg of coke, up to 90 kg of coke breeze (large coke V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.

Up to 35% of the initial coal charge is emitted as gases and vapors. Most of these gases and vapors are collected during by-product coke production. Coke oven gas is comprised of hydrogen, CH4, ethane, CO, CO2, ethylene, propylene, butylene, acetylene, hydrogen sul\ufb01de (H2S), ammonia, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coke oven gas tar includes pyridine, tar acids, naphthalene, creosote oil, and coal-tar pitch. Benzene, xylene, toluene, and solvent naphthas may be extracted from the light oil fraction. Coke production in the United States increased steadily between 1880 and the early 1950s, peaking at 65 mmt in 1951. In 1976, the United States was second in the world with 48 mmt of coke, i.e. 14.4% of the world production. By 1990, the United States produced 24 mmt, falling to fourth in the world. A gradual decline in production has continued; production has decreased from 20 mmt in 1997 to 15.2 mmt in 2002. Demand for blast furnace coke also has declined in recent years because technological improvements have reduced the amount of coke consumed per amount of steel produced by as much as 25%. Steel-making is commonly associated with coke ovens. Coke is coal that has undergone pyrolysis, i.e. heated up to 1000e1400 C in the absence of oxygen, so it is not burned. This process intentionally releases gaseous components of the coal to produce nearly pure carbon.28 2. Sintering: It consists of mixing moist iron ore \ufb01nes with a solid fuel, usually coke, and then \ufb01ring the mixture to eliminate undesirable elements and produce a product of relatively uniform size, physically and chemically stable, for charging the blast furnace. Air pollutants are emitted at different points in the process, as indicated in Table 31.19. 3. Iron making: It is the term used to describe how iron is produced in large, refractory-lined structures called blast furnaces. The iron ore, limestone, and coke are charged, heated, and then reacted to form a reducing gas, which reduces the iron oxide to metallic iron. The iron is tapped from the furnace along with the slag, which contains the impurities. A modern alternative to the blast furnace is continuous casting of iron instead of intermittent tapping. The blast furnace gas is exhausted from the top of the furnace, cooled, and cleaned of dust before it is used to \ufb01re the regenerative stoves for heating the blast furnace.

Steelmaking: The open-hearth steelmaking process produced 80e90% of the steel in the United States until the 1960s, when the basic oxygen process came into wide use. By 1990 less than 5% of U.S. steel was produced by the open-hearth process. Particulate emissions are highest during oxygen lancing with a hot metal charge in the furnace. Particulate matter loadings are reported to be in the range of 6e11 kg per metric ton of steel. Most of the particulate matter is iron or iron oxide. Control of the open-hearth particulate matter emissions is accomplished by ESPs or high-energy scrubbers. Only small quantities of SO2 are emitted, but if venturi scrubbers are used for particulate matter control, they will also reduce the SO2 emissions. However, severe corrosion problems have been reported for wet scrubbers on open-hearth furnaces.29 Basic oxygen furnaces (BOFs) have largely replaced open-hearth furnaces for steelmaking. A water-cooled oxygen lance is used to blow high-purity oxygen into the molten metal bath. This causes violent agitation and rapid oxidation of the carbon, impurities, and some of the iron. The reaction is exothermic, and an entire heat cycle requires only 30e50 min. The atmospheric emissions from the BOF process are listed in Table 31.21. The electric arc furnace process accounted for about 25% of the 1982 U.S. steelmaking capacity.29 Most of the raw material used for the process is steel scrap. Pollutants generated by the electric furnace process are primarily particulate matter and CO. The furnaces are hooded, and the gas stream containing the particulate matter is collected, cooled, and passed to a bag-house for cleaning. Venturi scrubbers and ESPs are used as control devices at some mills. Charging and tapping emissions are also collected by hoods and ducted to the particulate matter control device. After the steel is tapped from the furnace, it is poured into ingots or continuously cast into slabs or billets. Many metallurgical processes are required between the furnace and the \ufb01nished product. Reheat furnaces cause no air pollution problems. Scar\ufb01ng processes create a \ufb01ne iron oxide fume on the steel surface and also release the same fume, which must be controlled by wet scrubbers or ESPs before it reaches the atmosphere. Pickling may result in the release of acid mists. Scrubbing with special solutions may be required for control. Galvanizing is the process of applying a zinc coating and can result in release of zinc oxide emissions to the atmosphere. Control is accomplished through local collection hoods followed by ESPs, wet scrubbers, or baghouses. 5. Ferrous foundry operations: It produces castings of iron or steel. Many foundry air pollution problems are similar to those of steel mills but on a smaller scale. Potential emissions from foundry operations, along with the usual control methods, are shown in Table 31.22. 6. Ferroalloy production: Ferroalloys are used to add various elements to iron or steel for speci\ufb01c purposes. Examples are chromium (in the form of ferrochrome) and manganese (in the form of ferromanganese) added to steel to improve its strength or hardness, or nickel and chromium added to steel to increase its corrosion resistance. In the electrolytic production of nickel, iron is not removed from nickel because nickel will be used for the production of stainless steel.

Roasting and concentrating the ore prior to ferroalloy production produce particulate matter and oxide emissions; SO2 and CO are released during reduction; and casting produces metal oxides and fumes. 31.2.3 Agriculture and Forest Products Industries The agricultural and forest products industries are dependent on renewable resources for their existence. They are also acutely aware that air pollution can damage vegetation and, therefore threaten their existence. Both industries have been exempt from many air pollution regulations in the past, but now they are \ufb01nding these exemptions questioned and in some cases withdraw.30 The term agriculture refers to the operations involved in growing crops or raising animals. Dusts, smoke, gases, and odors are all emissions from various agricultural operations. 31.2.3.1 Agronomy The preparation of soils for crops, planting, and tilling raises dust as a fugitive emission. Such operations are still exempt from air pollution regulations in most parts of the world. The application of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides is also exempt from air pollution regulations, but other regulations may cover the drift of these materials or runoff into surface waters. This is particularly true of the materials are hazardous or toxic. 31.2.3.2 Open Burning A major source of PM, CO, and hydrocarbons is open burning of agricultural residue, as well as the cumulative emissions of smaller brush \ufb01res (Figure 31.12). National and local laws have curbed these emissions from intentional burning in several nations, but unintended wild\ufb01res, as well as controlled burning to maintain forests, woodlands, and other ecosystems. Indeed, \ufb01res are a natural part of many ecological cycles, with certain tree species depending on \ufb01re for germination, for example. In the conterminous United States, there is presently only about 10% of the land burned by wild\ufb01res as there was in the preindustrial era, with 8 times less biomass consumed, and 7 times lower emissions.31 Both legal and illegal biomass burning still occurs on large scales throughout the globe, releasing millions of metric tons of particulate matter per year are added to the atmosphere over the United States from cropland, rangeland, pastures, etc. An agricultural \ufb01eld releases about 8.5 kg of PM, 50 kg CO, 10 kg hydrocarbons (as CH4) and 1 kg NOx per metric ton of biomass burned.32 The most evident effect of such open burning is arguably the nuisance caused by the smoke, but health effects are noticed by sensitive individuals downwind from the burn. So-called biomass burning is currently a major area of interest for many countries, both in terms of local exposures and long-range, transcontinental, and transoceanic transport (Figure 31.13). As evidence, the international community has been concerned about the release of toxic compounds. For example, wood smoke is known to contain PAHs and other toxic organics, such as dioxins. Wild\ufb01res are also major source of mercury emissions. When plants grow, they move mercury and V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.

Light colored areas within the river channel are sand bars, which show that the river is in its annual low-\ufb02ow/low-water stage. The river channel is approximately 63 km long in this view. The rivers are the major route of transportation in Amazonia, so access may be the reason the \ufb01res are so near the river.

When burned, the Hg and other metals are released to the troposphere. The mean global Hg emission rate from biomass burning is estimated ata 675 240 mmt per 32 year. If the open burning of agricultural residue is permitted, it should be scheduled to minimize the effect on populated areas.", "This requires burning when the wind is blowing away from the population centers, not burning during inversion periods, burning dry residue to establish a strong convection column rather than a smoldering \ufb01re, and burning only a certain number of acres at a time, so that the atmosphere does not become overloaded. 31.2.3.3 Orchard Heating The practice of smudging is still carried out in many areas to protect orchards from frost. Petroleum products are burned in pots, producing both heat and smoke. Since the heat is the desirable product, smokeless heaters with return ducts to reburn the smoke are required by most air pollution control agencies. Some control agencies have passed regulations limiting the smoke to 0.5 or 1.0 g per minute per burner. Replacement of orchard heaters by wind machines is the most desirable control measure. These large propellers force the warmer air aloft to the ground, where it mixes with the cold air, minimizing frost formation. 31.2.3.4 Alfalfa Dehydration and Pelletizing Alfalfa dehydration is carried out in a direct-\ufb01red rotary dryer. The dried product is transported pneumatically to an air cooler and then to a collecting cyclone. The collected particles are ground or pelletized and then packaged for shipment. The major atmospheric emission from the process is particulate matter, which is controlled by baghouses. Odors may also be a problem, but they disperse rapidly and are no longer a problem at distances of over 1 km. 31.2.3.5 Animal Production Feeding of domestic animals on a commercial basis results in large quantities of excreta, both liquid and solid. This produces obnoxious odors, which, in turn, produce complaints from citizens of the area. If the animals are concentrated in a feedlot, the odors may become so extreme that odor counteractants are necessary. However, if the feedlots are paved and regularly a The large range of estimates is due to the variability and uncertainty associated with \ufb01re occurrence, Hg content in biomass and Hg release rates.

Manure is often recycled as a solid organic fertilizer or mixed with water and sprayed as a liquid fertilizer. If the manure is repeatedly used upwind of populated areas, complaints are sure to be \ufb01led with the air pollution control agency. Ammonia (NH3) is commonly released from animal operations. For example, in highly developed and industrialized England, emissions from livestock and their wastes comprised over 84% of the total ammonia emissions (Table 31.23). Indeed, ammonia emissions in England of ammonia were about 197 kt in 2011, a decline of 19% since 1990 and accounting for 68% of the United Kingdom total in 2011. Agricultural sources dominate the inventory with manure management representing 61% of total ammonia emissions in 2011 and 33% coming from cattle manure management alone. Ammonia emissions in England have increased in recent years, with a 3% increase between 2008 and 2011 driven by higher emissions from fertilizer application and increasing emissions from composting and biogas production via anaerobic digestion.20 Note the only other criteria pollutant emitted from agricultural activities is PM10. If uncontrolled, con\ufb01ned animal feeding operations (CAFOs), can cause a serious air pollution problem. The main problem is the odors associated with the process. Examples of such industries are tanning works, CAFOs, rendering plants, and many of the food processing plants such as \ufb01sh meal plants. In most cases, the emissions of particulates and gases from such plants are not of concern, only the odors. However, other air pollutants are also common (e.g. chromium [Cr6\u00fe]in tanning and nitric oxide [NO] near CAFOs).", "Requiring these industries to locate away from the business or residential areas is no longer acceptable as a means of control, given the possibility of transport and that vulnerable populations would fall within the plume from these sites, notwithstanding their locations. 31.2.3.6 Feed and Grain Milling and Handling All grain milling involves grinding and handling of dried grain. Air streams are used for transport of the raw material and the \ufb01nished products. The result is atmospheric emissions of grain dust. Originally, the control method used was cyclones; today most systems use baghouses following the cyclones. Caution must be exercised in all phases of baghouse construction, operation, cleaning, etc., as the grain dust is explosive and can cause \ufb01res accompanied by loss of property and even of lives. Particulate emissions from uncontrolled grain-processing plants range from 0.1 to 2.0 kg of particulate matter per metric ton of grain.33 31.2.3.7 Cotton Processing The processing of cotton, from the \ufb01eld to the cloth, releases both inorganic and organic particulate matter to the atmosphere. Also, adhering pesticide residues may be emitted at the cotton gin exhaust. Table 31.24 lists the emission factors for particulate matter from cotton ginning operations. V.

Since most of the emissions from the meat products industry are odorous organics, afterburners are used successfully as control devices. Some processors have tried to use wet scrubbers or ESPs, but the emissions are often sticky and can cause severe cleaning problems. Fish processing has similar problems and solutions. 31.2.3.9 Fruit and Vegetable Processing The most severe environmental problem of fruit and vegetable processors is the potential for water pollution if the liquid wastes are not handled properly. Cooking can cause odors, which are usually controlled by using furnaces as afterburners. One processing problem is presented by the roasting of coffee. This releases smoke, odor, and particulate matter. The particulate matter, primarily dusty and chaff, can be removed with a cyclone. The smoke and odors are usually consumed by passing the roaster exhaust gases through an afterburner. Heat recovery may be desirable if the afterburner is large enough to make it economical. 31.2.3.10 Miscellaneous Agricultural Industries Other industries of interest are (1) the manufacturing of spices and \ufb02avorings, which may use activated carbon \ufb01lters to remove odors from their exhaust stream; (2) the tanning industry, which uses afterburners or activated carbon for odor removal and wet scrubbers for dust removal; and (3) glue and rendering plants, which utilize sodium hypochlorite scrubbers or afterburners to control odorous emissions. 31.2.4 Forest Products Trees are classi\ufb01ed as a renewable resource which is being utilized in most portions of the world on a sustained yield basis. A properly managed forest will produce wood for lumber, \ufb01ber, and chemicals inde\ufb01nitely. Harvesting this resource can generate considerable dust and other particulates. Transportation over unpaved roads causes excessive dust generation. The cultural practice of burning the residue left after a timber harvest, called slash burning, is still practiced in some areas and is a major source of smoke, gaseous, and particulate air pollution in the localities downwind from the \ufb01re (Figure 31.13). Visibility reduction from such burning can be a serious problem. Processing the harvested timber into the \ufb01nished product may involve sawing, peeling, planning, sanding, and drying operations, which can release considerable amounts of wood \ufb01ber and lesser amounts of gaseous material to the atmosphere. Control of wood \ufb01ber emissions from the pneumatic transport and storage systems can be a major problem of considerable expense for a plywood mill or a particleboard plant. The forest products industry encompasses a broad spectrum of operations which range from the raising of trees, through cutting and removing the timber, to complete utilization of the wood residue.34 31.2.4.1 Open Burning The forest products industry (as well as governmental agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service) practices open, prescribed, burning of logging residue (slash) as a forest management tool and as an economical means of residue disposal.35 This burning is usually done when meteorological conditions and fuel variables, such as moisture content, can give as clean a burn as possible with a minimum effect on populated areas.", "On a worldwide basis, it has been estimated that approximately 90 million metric tons of particulate matter from wild and controlled forest and range \ufb01res enter the atmosphere each year. Table 31.25 lists the pollutant emissions from forest burning.33 31.2.4.2 Wood-Fired Power Boilers Wood-\ufb01red power boilers are generally found at the mills where wood products are manufactured. They are \ufb01red with waste materials from the process, such as \u201chogged wood\u201d, sander dust, sawdust, bark, or process trim. The major emission of concern from wood TABLE 31.25 Air Pollution Emission Factors from Forest Burning Pollutant Emission (kg metric tonL1) Particulate matter 8.5 Carbon monoxide 22 Hydrocarbons (as CH4) 2 Nitrogen oxides (as NO2) 1 Source: Ref. 33. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.2 STATIONARY SOURCE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES boilers is particulate matter (PM). The emission rates depend primarily on the composition of the residue fuel burned, and the particle control device. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) may also be emitted in signi\ufb01cant quantities when certain types of wood residue are combusted or when operating conditions are poor. 36 The lignin component of wood is expected in the reaction: wood constituents can be quite variable, such as the cellulose, lignin, and other carbohydrate compounds. As a general rule of combustion, wood can be assumed to have the composition of C6.9H10.6O3.5. However, it also contains many other elements, such as sulfur, phosphorous, and nitrogen, which are oxidized during the \ufb01ring processes. The most common control devices used to reduce PM emissions from wood-\ufb01red boilers are mechanical collectors, wet scrubbers, ESPs and fabric \ufb01lters. Often, two multicyclones are used in series, allowing the \ufb01rst collector to remove the bulk of the dust and the second to remove diameter PM. The ef\ufb01ciency of this con\ufb01guration varies from 25% to 65%.36 The most widely used wet scrubbers for wood-\ufb01red boilers are venturi scrubbers. With gas-side pressure drops exceeding 15 inches of water, particulate collection ef\ufb01ciencies 85% have been reported for venturi scrubbers operating on wood-\ufb01red boilers.36 ESPs are used when collection ef\ufb01ciencies above 90% are required. The ESPs are often used downstream of mechanical collector precleaners which remove larger-sized PM. Collection ef\ufb01ciencies of 90e99% for PM have been observed for ESPs operating on wood-\ufb01red boilers. A variation of the ESP is the electrostatic gravel bed \ufb01lter. Here, PM in \ufb02ue gases is removed by impaction with gravel media inside a packed bed; collection is augmented by an electrically charged grid within the bed. This gives collection ef\ufb01ciencies >80%.36 Fabric \ufb01lters have had limited applications to wood-\ufb01red boilers, due to perceptions of \ufb01re danger arising from the collection of combustible carbonaceous \ufb02y ash. Steps can be taken to reduce this hazard, including the installation of a mechanical collector upstream of the fabric \ufb01lter to remove large burning particles of \ufb02y ash (i.e. \u201csparklers\u201d). Despite these complications, fabric \ufb01lters are typically preferred for boilers \ufb01ring salt-laden wood. This fuel produces \ufb01ne particulates with a high salt content having a quenching effect, which decreases \ufb01re hazards. Particle collection ef\ufb01ciencies are typically 80%.36 Over\ufb01re air ports may be used with stoker and FBC boilers to stage the combustion process and lower NOx emissions. In those areas of the United States where NOx emissions must be reduced to very low concentrations, the application of SNCR to residue wood-\ufb01red boilers has been employed; the application of SCR is under consideration at this writing. Both systems are post-combustion NOx controls in which ammonia or urea is injected into the \ufb02ue gas to selectively reduce NOx to nitrogen and water. A SNCR in an industrial wood-\ufb01red boiler has demonstrated NOx reduction ef\ufb01ciencies between 35% and 75% as the ammonia-to-NOx ratio increased from 0.4 to 3.2. Collection devices for particulate matter from wood-\ufb01red boilers are shown in Table 31.26. The table refers to \ufb01lterable PM and condensable PM fractions. The \ufb01lterable fraction is comprised of the primary particles directly emitted by a source as a solid or liquid at the stack and captured on the \ufb01lter of a test train. The condensable fraction consists of gaseous emissions that form particles upon condensing under ambient conditions soon after release from the stack. The \ufb01lterable fraction is measured using EPA Method 5 (References: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2010. Field valuation of an Improved Method for Sampling and Analysis of Filterable and Condensable Particulate Matter.", "Research Triangle Park, NC 27711; and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Reference Methods 1 through 5 and Method 17, 40 CFR 60, Appendix A-1 through A-3 and A-6) and the condensable fraction using Method 202.37,38 31.2.4.3 Driers Driers are used in the forest products industry to lower the moisture content of the wood product being processed. Drying of dimension lumber gives it dimensional stability. This type of drying is done in steam kilns and is a batch process. No appreciable pollutants are released. Veneer for the manufacture of plywood is dried on a continuous line in a veneer drier to assure that only dry veneer goes to the layup and gluing process. Glue will not bond if the veneer contains too much moisture. Emissions from the veneer driers are \ufb01ne particulate and condensed organic material. The condensed organic material is of submicron size and appears as a blue haze coming from the stack. Control is accomplished by means of (1) a wet scrubber or (2) ducting the emissions to a wood-\ufb01red boiler, where they are burned. All of these systems must be carefully sized and operated in order to meet a 20% opacity regulation. Wood particle and \ufb01ber driers are used to dry the raw material for particle board and similar products.39 Just as with the veneer for plywood, the particles must be dried before being mixed with the resins and formed into board. Drying is accomplished in a gas-\ufb01red drier, a direct wood-\ufb01red drier, or steam coil driers. Many different types of driers are used in the industry. Emissions are \ufb01ne particles and condensable hydrocarbons, which produce a highly visible plume. Control is accomplished with multiple cyclones or wet scrubbers. Fires in the control equipment and ductwork are quite common and must be expected periodically. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31. CONTROLLING AIR POLLUTION FROM SOURCES V.

The demand for paper will continue as new uses are found for this product. Since most paper is manufactured from wood or wood residue, it provides an excellent use for this renewable resource.", "The most widely used pulping process is the kraft process (see Figure 29.12 in Chapter 29) which results in recovery and regeneration of the chemicals. This occurs in the recovery furnace, which operates with both oxidizing and reducing zones. Emissions from such recovery furnaces include particulate matter, very odorous reduced sulfur compounds, and oxides of sulfur. Bleaching has been a substantial source of dioxins, but many processors have now modi\ufb01ed their operations to use substantially less chlorine, greatly reducing the dioxin formation. If extensive and expensive control is not exercised over the kraft pulp process, the odors and aerosol emissions will affect a wide area. Odor complaints have been reported over 100 km away from these plants. A properly controlled and operated kraft plant will handle huge amounts of material and produce millions of kilograms of \ufb01nished products per day, with little or no complaint regarding odor or particulate emissions. The kraft process has become the dominant process for pulp production throughout the world, primarily because of the recovery of the pulping chemicals. Control of air pollutant emissions in modern kraft mills is accomplished by (1) proper operation of the entire mill, (2) high-ef\ufb01ciency ESPs on the recovery furnace (up to 99.7% ef\ufb01ciency for particulate matter, which is recovered and returned to the process), (3) collection of noncondensible gases from several vent points (digesters, blow tanks, washers) and ducting them to the lime kiln, where they are completely burned, and (4) high-energy wet scrubbers on the lime kiln exhaust to remove the particulate matter and sulfurous gases. 31.2.5 Other Industrial Processes Many industries operated throughout the world do not fall into the previous categories. Some of these are universal, such as asphalt batching plants, whereas others are regional, such as bagasse-\ufb01red boilers. Each has its own emission and control problems and requires knowledgeable analysis and engineering. Some of the more widely used processes are examined in this section. 31.2.5.1 Mineral Products Conversion of minerals to useful products is a major worldwide industry. Mining or quarrying of minerals can produce fugitive emissions, which may be controlled by paving work and traf\ufb01c areas, wetting the materials being removed or handled, or using collection and exhaust systems at the site where the particulate matter is being generated. The usual air pollution control device is a multiple cyclone or a baghouse at the system exit. The same control techniques can be applied at other points in the process where the minerals are transported, stored, crushed and ground, concentrated, dried, and mixed.40 31.2.5.2 Asphaltic Concrete Plants Hot mix asphalt (HMA) paving uses a mixture of size-graded, aggregate that can include reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), and liquid asphalt cement. To produce HMA, the aggregate is heated and mixed. If RAP is used, it and the aggregate constitute >92% total weight of the mixture. Fine aggregate (i.e. <74 mm in physical diameter) is required for the production of acceptable quality HMA. HMA paving materials can be manufactured by batch mix plants, by continuous mix (mix outside dryer drum) plant, by parallel-\ufb02ow drum-mix plants or by counter-\ufb02ow drum-mix plants. This order of listing re\ufb02ects the chronological order of use within the HMA industry.41 More than 500 million tons of HMA is produced each year in the United States by about 3600 asphalt plants. Of these, about 2300 are batch plants, 1000 are parallel-\ufb02ow drum-mix plants and 300 are counter\ufb02ow drum-mix plants. About 85% being manufactured today have the counter-\ufb02ow drum-mix design. Batch plants make up about 10% and parallel \ufb02ow drum-mix plants account 5%. Continuous mix plants represent less than 0.5%.41 An HMA plant can be constructed as a permanent plant or with a modular, skid-mounted design or a smaller, portable plant. All plants can and do have RAP processing capabilities.41 Figures 31.14e31.16 respectively shows the con\ufb01gurations for a batch mix plant, a parallel-\ufb02ow drum mix and a counter-\ufb02ow drum-mix plant. Fugitive emissions occur at the handling areas and at the bin loading facility. The emissions of greatest concern, however, occur at the rotary drier, hot aggregate elevator, and hot aggregate handling systems. Each has the potential for releasing large quantities of uncontrolled particulate matter. Table 31.27 illustrates the large range of emissions from uncontrolled and controlled asphaltic concrete plants. Emissions from batch mix HMA plants can be from ducted sources, i.e. those vented to the atmosphere through a stack, vent or other conveyance, or from fugitive sources.", "Ducted emissions are usually collected and transported by an industrial ventilation system with one or more air movers, eventually to be emitted to the V.

Source: Ref. 41. atmosphere through a stack. Fugitive emissions result from process and open sources and consist of a combination of gas-phase pollutants and PM. The rotary drum dryer is generally the largest source of emissions that include PM; CO, CO2,NOx,SOx, (CO), CH4, VOCs, and various hazardous air pollutants. The pollutants are also generated at other sites in the process, including hot-side conveyers, classi\ufb01ers and mixing equipment. The concentrations of organic aerosols emitted depend on the mixing temperature, with low-molecular compounds released \ufb01rst.41 In the parallel-\ufb02ow and counter\ufb02ow designs, the largest source is the rotary drum dryer, with similar pollutants as those produced the batch mix system. The type of material used in\ufb02uences emission rates.", "For example, in test plants, total organic carbon, benzene, 2-methyl phenol SO2,NOx, CO, PM, and Pb emissions were found to increase substantially when rubber is present in the asphalt, but PAHs and CO2 emissions decreased.41 Nearly all plants employ a primary dust collection system, e.g. large cyclones, for large PM, usually as a classi\ufb01er to return and use product that would otherwise escape. The controls of choice are appropriately selected dry mechanical collectors, scrubbers and fabric \ufb01lters. ESPs do not appear to work well for HMA. The capture of VOCs and other gas-phase pollutants can be limited by proper O&M of the burner.41 31.2.5.3 Cement Manufacturing Air pollution from cement manufacturing begins with extraction of limestone and other calcareous substances. These are typical extracted from open-face quarries. The less pure the calcareous, the more likely addition pollutants will be released. For example, if pyrite is included, SO2 emissions will increase during processing. If metals are present, e.g. Al and Fe, they will be found in the emissions. In addition, gypsum and anhydrite are extracted for the Portland cement \ufb01nishing process. The cement process has a high mass loss rate. For example, about 33% of the calcareous mass is lost as CO2. Portland cement manufacture accounts for about 98% of the cement production in the United States. The raw materials are crushed, processed, proportioned, ground, and blended before going to the \ufb01nal process, which may be either wet or dry. In the dry process, the moisture content of the raw material is reduced to less than 1% before the blending process occurs. The dry material is pulverized and fed to the rotary kiln. Further drying, decarbonating, and calcining take place as the material passes through the rotary kiln. The material leaves the kiln as clinker, which is cooled, ground, packaged, and shipped. For the wet process, a slurry is made by adding water during the initial grinding. The homogeneous wet mixture is fed to the kiln as a wet slurry (30e40% water) or as a wet \ufb01ltrate (20% water). The burning, cooling, grinding, packaging, and shipping are the same as for the dry process. Gas-phase and particulate matter emissions can occur at numerous points in the cement manufacturing process (Figure 31.17 and Table 31.28). The key component of cement manufacturing is the rotary kiln, which is a long, cylindrical, slightly inclined furnace that is lined with refractory to protect the steel shell and to retain heat. The raw material mix enters the kiln at the elevated end, and the combustion fuels generally are introduced into the lower end of the kiln in a counter-current manner. The materials move continuously to the lower end by rotation of the kiln. The raw materials become more \ufb02uid and cementitious form the kiln heating. The heat source is generally the combustion of coal, natural gas, and sometimes oil.42 Other supplemental fuels including waste solvents, inks, scrap rubber, and petroleum coke can be added. Indeed, the cement rotary kiln design has been emulated in hazardous waste incineration systems. Control of particulate matter emissions from the kilns, dryers, grinders, etc., is by means of standard devices and systems: (1) multiple cyclones (80% ef\ufb01ciency), (2) ESPs (95% ef\ufb01ciency), (3) multiple cyclones followed by ESPs (97.5% ef\ufb01ciency), and (4) baghouses (99.8% ef\ufb01ciency). 31.2.5.4 Glass Manufacturing Plants Fiberglass is manufactured primarily from borosilicate glass by drawing the molten glass into \ufb01bers. Two \ufb01berglass products are produced, textile, and glass wool. Soda-lime glass accounts for about 90% of the U.S. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.

It is produced in large, direct-\ufb01red, continuous-melting furnaces in which the blended raw materials are melted at 1480 C to form glass.", "The expected emissions from glass furnace \ufb01red with gaseous fuel are 100 mg of PM per container produced and for pressed and brown glass when produced using soda-lime and lead recipes. This method would emit 500 mg g 1 of glass produced for borosilicate recipes, and 250 mg g 1 of glass produced by other methods, such as opal and \ufb02uoride recipes. Wool \ufb01berglass recipes also have expected emission rates of 250 mg g 1. Flat glass emissions would be 225 mg g 1. A furnace \ufb01red with liquid fuel would have 30% higher PM emission rates, e.g. 130 mg g 1 for container glass and 650 mg g 1 for the borosilicate method.43 For effective control of the PM emissions, baghouses are used. During the manufacture of glass, considerable dust, with particles averaging about 300 mm in size, will be emitted. Some dusts may also be emitted from the handling of the raw materials involved. Control of this dust to prevent transport away from the plant is a necessity. When glass is blown or formed into the \ufb01nished product, smoke and gases can be released from the contact of the molten glass with lubricated molds. These emissions are quite dense but of a relatively short duration. Glass making also emits oxides of SOx,NOx, and CO. For example, a textile glass furnace using the regenerative method and gas would be expected to emit 15 kg SOx,10 kgNOx, and 15 kg CO per metric ton (Mg) of material processed, whereas an gas-recuperative furnace producing the same product would be expected to emit 1.5 kg SOx,10kg NOx,and 0.25 kg CO per Mg of material processed. When an electric furnace is available, emission rates of PM and gaseous pollutants decrease substantially. Fluorides are also commonly emitted during glass manufacturing, e.g. 0.06 kg 0.25 kg \ufb02uorides per Mg of material processed by either a regenerative or recuperative gas furnace. Other emissions include volatile organic compounds, phenolics, phenol, and formaldehyde.44 These and other emission factors for various glass manufacturing are published by the US EPA.45 The emissions from the two processes are shown in Table 31.29.33 Control is usually better achieved through proper design and operation of the manufacturing operations rather than by add-on devices. 31.2.5.5 Stone and Clay Product Manufacturing The industries which produce and handle various stone products emit considerable amounts of particulate matter at every stage of the operation. These particulates may include \ufb01ne mineral dusts of a size to cause damage to the lungs. Depending on the type of rock, mineral \ufb01bers can also be released, notably asbestos. The threshold values for such dusts have been set quite low to prevent TABLE 31.29 Air Pollution Emission Factors for Fiberglass Manufacturing without Controls Type of Process Particulate Matter Emissions (kg metric tonL1) Sulfur Oxides Carbon as SO2 Monoxide Nitrogen Oxides as NO2 Fluorides Textile products Glass furnace Regenerative 8.2 14.8 0.6 4.6 1.9 Recuperative 13.9 1.4 0.5 14.6 6.3 Forming 0.8 e e e e Curing ovens 0.6 e 0.8 1.3 e Wool products Glass furnace Regenerative 10.8 5.0 0.13 2.5 0.06 Recuperative 14.2 4.8 0.13 0.9 0.06 Electric 0.3 0.02 0.03 0.14 0.01 Forming 28.8 e e e e Curing ovens* 1.8 e 0.9 0.6 e Cooling* 0.7 e 0.1 0.1 e * In addition, 0.05 kg metric ton 1 for phenol and 1.7 kg metric ton 1 for aldehyde during curing and cooling.

CONTROLLING AIR POLLUTION FROM SOURCES disabling diseases for the worker, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, pleural diseases, asbestosis, and silicosis. In the production of clay, talc, cement, chalk, etc., an emission of particulate matter will usually accompany each process. These processes may involve grinding, drying, and sieving, which can be enclosed and controlled to prevent the emission of particles. In many cases, the recovered particles can be returned to the process for a net economic gain. 31.2.5.6 Sewage Treatment Plants The concern with atmospheric emissions from sewage treatment plants involves gases and odors from the plant itself, particulate matter and gaseous emissions from the sludge incinerator if one is used, and gases, odors, and particulate matter if sludge disposal is conducted at the site. The gases and odors are combustible, so afterburners or \ufb02ares are used. Some plants use the sewage gas to \ufb01re small stationary boilers or fuel gasediesel engines for plant energy. Particulate matter from sludge incinerators is usually scrubbed with treated water from the plant, and the ef\ufb02uent is returned to the incoming plant stream.", "If the odors are too persistent, masking agents are sometimes speci\ufb01ed to lessen the objections of the public. 31.2.5.7 Coal Preparation Plants Coal preparation plants are used to reduce noncombustibles and other undesirable materials in coal before it is burned. 31.2.5.8 Gas Turbines Gas turbines are used as prime movers for pumps, electric generators, and large rotating machinery. Their main economic advantage is driving high-horsepower, consistent loads. Many stationary gas turbines use the same core engine as their jet engine counterpart. 31.3 MOBILE SOURCE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES Because mobile sources of air pollution are capable of moving from one local jurisdiction to another, they are usually regulated by the national government. In the United States, state or local agencies can have more restrictive standards, if they choose. To date, only the state of California has established extensive standards more restrictive than the U.S. federal standards, and these only for gasoline-powered automobiles. 31.3.1 Gasoline-Powered Vehicles Gasoline-powered motor vehicles outnumber all other mobile sources combined in the number of vehicles, the amount of energy consumed, and the mass of air pollutants emitted. It is not surprising that they have received the greatest share of attention regarding emission standards and air pollution control systems. Currently, certain countries limit emissions gasoline-powered vehicles from crankcases, fuel tanks and, especially, exhaust from engines. In the United States, these emission standards for mobile sources have become increasingly lowered. As discussed in Chapter 29, the Tier 2 standards are presently in effect (Table 29.12), but newer standards, i.e. the Tier 3 program will soon replace them. Crankcase emissions in the United States have been effectively controlled since 1963 by positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) systems which take the gases from the crankcase, through a \ufb02ow control valve, and into the intake manifold. The gases then enter the combustion chamber with the fueleair mixture, where they are burned. Figure 31.18 shows a cross-section of a gasoline engine with the PCV system. In the United States, evaporative emissions from the fuel tank and carburetor have been controlled by either a vapor recovery system which uses the crankcase of the engine for the storage of the hydrocarbon vapors or an adsorption and regeneration system using a canister of activated carbon to trap the vapors and hold them until such time as a fresh air purge through the canister carries the vapors to the induction system for burning in the combustion chamber. The exhaust emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles are the most dif\ufb01cult to control. These emissions are in\ufb02uenced by such factors as gasoline formulation, airefuel ratio, ignition timing, compression ratio, engine speed and load, engine deposits, engine condition, coolant temperature, and combustion chamber con\ufb01guration. Consideration of control methods must be based PCV Closed at control valveoil filler cap Reversed installationIntake air of control valveBlowby gases can cause explosionBackflow gases in event of backfire FIGURE 31.18 Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system. V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.3 MOBILE SOURCE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES on elimination or destruction of unburned hydrocarbons, CO, and NOx. Methods used to control one pollutant may actually increase the emission of another requiring even more extensive controls. Control of exhaust emissions for unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide has followed three routes: 1. Fuel modi\ufb01cation in terms of volatility, hydrocarbon types, or additive content. Some of the fuels currently being used are lique\ufb01ed petroleum gas (LPG), lique\ufb01ed natural gas (LNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), fuels with alcohol additives, and unleaded gasoline. The supply of some of these fuels is very limited. Other fuel problems involving storage, distribution, and power requirements have to be considered. 2. Minimization of pollutants from the combustion chamber. This approach consists of designing the engine with improved fueleair distribution systems, ignition timing, fueleair ratios, coolant and mixture temperatures, and engine speeds for minimum emissions. The majority of automobiles sold in the United States now use an electronic sensor/control system to adjust these variables for maximum engine performance with minimum pollutant emissions. 3. Further oxidation of the pollutants outside the combustion chamber. This oxidation may be either by normal combustion or by catalytic oxidation. These systems require the addition of air into the exhaust manifold at a point downstream from the exhaust valve. An air pump is employed to provide this air. Figure 31.19 illustrates an engine with an air pump and distribution manifold for the oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons (HC) outside the engine. Beginning with the 1975 U.S. gasoline-powered automobiles, catalytic converters were added to nearly all models to meet the more restrictive emission standards.", "Since the lead used in gasoline is a poison to the catalyst used in the converter, a scheduled introduction of unleaded gasoline was also required. The U.S. petroleum industry simultaneously introduced unleaded gasoline into the marketplace. In order to lower emissions of oxides of nitrogen from gasoline engines, two general systems were developed. The \ufb01rst is exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), which mixes a portion of the exhaust gas with the incoming fueleair charge, thus reducing temperatures within the combustion chamber. This recirculation is controlled by valving and associated plumbing and electronics, so that it occurs during periods of highest NOx production, when some power reduction can be tolerated: a cruising condition at highway speed. Other alternatives are to use another catalytic converter, in series with the HC/CO converter, which decomposes the oxides of nitrogen to oxygen and nitrogen before the gases are exhausted from the tailpipe. A modi\ufb01ed internal combustion engine which shows promise is the strati\ufb01ed-charge engine. This is a spark ignition engine using fuel injection in such a manner as to achieve selective strati\ufb01cation of the air/fuel ratio in the combustion chamber. The air/fuel ratio is correct for ignition at the spark plug, and the mixture is fuel lean in other portions of the combustion chamber. Only air enters the engine on the intake stroke, and the power output is controlled by the amount of fuel injected into the cylinder. Strati\ufb01ed-charge engines have been operated experimentally and used in some production vehicles. They show promise as relatively low-emission engines. The hydrocarbon emission levels from this engine are quire variable, the CO levels low, and the NOx levels variable but generally high. An external combustion engine that has been widely supported as a low-emission power source is the Rankine cycle steam engine. Many different types of expanders can be used to convert the energy in the working \ufb02uid into rotary motion at a drive shaft. Expanders that have been tried or proposed are reciprocating piston engines, turbines, helical expanders, and all possible combinations of these. The advantage of the steam engine is that the combustion is continuous and takes place in a combustor with no moving parts. The result is a much lower release of air pollutants, but emissions are still not completely zero. Present technology is capable of producing a satisfactory steam-driven car, truck, or bus, but costs, operating problems, warm-up time, and weight and size must be considered in the total evaluation of the system. A simple Rankine cycle steam system is shown diagrammatically in Figure 31.20. 31.3.2 Diesel-Powered Vehicles The diesel, i.e. compression ignition, cycle is regulated by fuel \ufb02ow only, with air \ufb02ow remaining constant V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31. CONTROLLING AIR POLLUTION FROM SOURCES Exhaust Expander Vapor Throttle Outshaft Boiler Liquid Condenser Fuel Air Water tank with engine speed. Because the diesel engine is normally operated well on the lean side of the stoichiometric mixture (40:1 or more), emission of unburned hydrocarbons and CO is minimized. The actual emissions from a diesel engine are (1) oxides of nitrogen, as for spark ignition engines; (2) particulate matter, mainly unburned carbon, which at times can be excessive; (3) partially combusted organic compounds, many of which cause irritation to the eyes and upper respiratory system; and (4) oxides of sulfur from the use of sulfur-containing fuels. A smoking diesel engine indicates that more fuel is being injected into the cylinder than is being burned and that some of the fuel is being only partially burned, resulting in the emission of unburned carbon. Control of emissions from diesel-powered vehicles has received much attention in recent years. This is partially accomplished by fuel modi\ufb01cation to obtain reduced sulfur content and cleaner burning and by proper tuning of the engine using restricted fuel settings to prevent overfueling. Diesel fuel has begun to evolve in another, more sustainable, way. An increasing number of vehicles are running on so-called \u201cbiodiesel\u201d fuel. This is re\ufb01ned from plant-based hydrocarbons, especially from waste residues (e.g. from used cooking oils). With operational adjustments, biodiesel is currently in use in buses as part of urban transit and college transportation systems. Effective with the 1982 model year, particulate matter from diesel vehicles was regulated by the U.S. EPA for the \ufb01rst time, at a level of 0.37 g km 1 traveled.17 Diesel vehicles were allowed to meet an NOx level of 0.93 g km 1 17 under an EPA waiver. These standards were met by a combination of control systems, primarily EGR and improvements in the combustion process.", "For the 1985 model year, the standards decreased to 0.12 g of particulate matter per kilometer and 0.62 g of NOx per kilometer. Boiler feed pump After 2005, the attention to both gaseous pollutants and PM from diesel engines has accelerated. Diesel PM is part of a complex mixture that makes up diesel exhaust. The gas phase of diesel exhaust is composed of many hazardous air pollutants, e.g. acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, and PAHs. The particle phase also has many different types of particles that can be classi\ufb01ed by size or composition. The composition of \ufb01ne and ultra\ufb01ne diesel particles contain elemental carbon (EC) into and onto which numerous compounds are sorbed, e.g. organic compounds, sulfate, nitrate, and heavy metals.46 Controlling the combustion process is key to controlling emissions. Diesel control technologies include oxidation catalysts, particulate \ufb01lters and closed crankcase ventilation for PM and EGR, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), lean catalysts and lean traps for NOx. Slowing ignition timing that allows certain hydrocarbons to pass through the exhaust and trigger the catalyst sooner can be effective in generating exothermic heat over the catalyst and regenerate soot. Variable valve timing similarly introduces some of the exhaust into the combustion process to lower hydrocarbon and NOx emissions. EGR can also dilute intake air to decrease combustion temperatures and to decrease NOx emissions. Direct versus port injection of fuel to the cylinders can also improve combustion ef\ufb01ciency.47 Catalytic mechanisms can greatly decrease numerous emissions. For example, prior to seeing the catalyst, the gas stream contains CO, hydrocarbons, PAHs, SO2,NOx, and PM (including the soluble organic fraction, SOF). The \ufb02ow-through diesel oxidation catalyst\u2019s (DOCs) honeycomb stainless steel substrate is coated with the metal catalyst, e.g. platinum or palladium. The catalyzed oxidative process converts the incoming pollutants to more oxidized and less toxic compounds, especially CO2,H2O. The PM entering the DOC consists of EC and gaseous and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs). Exiting the catalyst, most of the volatile SOF in the PM has been oxidized, along with some of the EC. The decrease in PM concentration is affected by the SOF in the particulate. For example, an oxidation catalyst can lower the SOF of the particulate by 90% under certain operating conditions, which would decrease PM emissions by up to 40e50%. PM reductions of 20e35% is common for newer model year engines. Destruction of the SOF is important given that this component of PM often contains a number of compounds of concern, including PAHs and dioxins. The catalyst technology has advanced to include \ufb01lter regeneration catalysts. In 2007, every heavy-duty diesel-powered vehicle had to include a diesel particulate \ufb01lter (DPF) to decrease PM to <0.01 g per braking horsepower-h (g php 1 h 1). The DPF ef\ufb01ciency V. ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 31.3 MOBILE SOURCE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES depends on a prescribed regeneration to burn soot that has accumulated on the \ufb01lter. The regeneration process \ufb01rst oxidizes unburned hydrocarbons and CO, using the heat that is generated to raise the temperature of the exhaust gas, which combusts carbonaceous soot. The second regeneration oxidizes NOx to NO2, which in turn, oxidizes C. Oxidation catalyst ef\ufb01ciency can be diminished by the presence of S. In fact, SOF catalysts may also oxidize SO2 to form H2SO4 and water, thereby increasing acidic PM (sulfate) concentrations. This is a main reason for the lower S content required for diesel fuel. Close crankcase ventilation consists of a multistage \ufb01lter that collects, coalesces and returns emitted lubrication oil to the engine sump. The \ufb01ltered gases are returned to the intake system, so that differential pressures are balanced. This can be combined with DOC and DPF systems for increased ef\ufb01ciencies. These technologies are summarized in Table 31.30. 31.3.3 Gas Turbines and Jet Engines The modi\ufb01ed Brayton cycle is used for both gas turbines and jet engines. The turbine is designed to produce a usable torque at the output shaft, while the jet engine allows most of the hot gases to expand into the atmosphere, producing usable thrust. Emissions from both turbines and jets are similar, as are their control methods. The emissions are primarily unburned hydrocarbons, unburned carbon which results in the visible exhaust, and oxides of nitrogen. Control of the unburned hydrocarbons and the unburned carbon may be accomplished by redesigning the fuel spray nozzles and reducing cooling air to the combustion chambers to permit more complete combustion. U.S. airlines have converted their jet \ufb02eets to lower-emission engines using these control methods.", "NOx emissions may be minimized by reduction of the maximum temperature in the primary zone of the combustors. U.S. EPA regulations for commercial, jet and turbine-powered aircraft7 are based on engine size (thrust) and pressure ratio (compressor outlet/compressor inlet) for the time in each mode of a standardized takeoff and landing cycle. Once the aircraft exceeds an altitude of 914 m, no regulations apply. This does not mean that emissions are not important and do not contribute to atmospheric pollution above this level. Indeed, about 60e80% of the air space contribution of NOx results from emissions above this altitude. Similarly, 80e90% of SO2 and 20e40% of VOCs in the air space comes at higher altitude.48 The gas turbine engine for automotive or truck use could be either a simple turbine, a regenerative turbine, a free turbine, or any combination. Figure 31.21 shows the basic types which have been successfully tried in automotive and truck use. 31.3.4 Alternatives to Existing Mobile Sources The atmosphere of the world cannot continue to accept greater and greater amounts of emissions from mobile sources as our transportation systems expand. Although the emissions have fallen in recent decades, present emissions from all transportation sources in the United States still exceed 80 million tons of CO per year, 8 million tons of VOCs, 12 million tons of NOx, 0.4 million tons of PM10 and 0.5 million tons of PM10.49 TABLE 31.30 Typical Improvements and Costs for Retro\ufb01tted Diesel Pollution Control Equipment Percentage Decrease in Pollutant Emission Diesel Retro\ufb01t Technology PM NOx HC CO Cost (In 2013 U.S. Dollars) Diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) 20e40 40e70 40e60 Material: $600e$4000 Installation: 1e3h Diesel particulate \ufb01lter (DPF): 85e95 85e95 50e90 Material: $8000e$50,000 active or passive Installation: 6e8h Partial diesel particulate \ufb01lter: Up to 60 40e75 10e60 Material: $4000e$6000 partial or \ufb02ow-through Installation: 6e8h Selective catalytic reduction* 75 $10,000e$20,000 1Urea $0.80 gal Closed crankcase ventilation* Varies Exhaust gas recirculation* 25e40 Lean NOx catalyst* 5e40 $6500e$10,000 * Table note: May be combined with diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) or diesel particulate \ufb01lter (DPF) systems to reduce PM, HC, and CO emissions.

All alternatives should be considered simultaneously to achieve the desired result, an acceptable transportation system with a minimum of air pollution. Electric drive systems have been tried as a means of achieving propulsion without harmful emissions. Currently, most battery-operated vehicles use leadeacid batteries, which give low power, limited range, and require frequent recharging. In power shortage areas this could be a severe additional load on the electrical system. Sulfuric acid, hydrogen, and oxygen emissions from millions of electric vehicles using leadeacid storage batteries for an energy source would be appreciable. Other types of batteries offer some promise, but their manufacture and costs present obstacles to their widespread automotive use. In fact, the nickel (Ni) based battery systems installed in many hybrid vehicles detract from the vehicles\u2019 overall environmental attractiveness. Viewed from a life cycle perspective, the mining of the Ni ore (e.g. from the extensive area near Sudbury, Ontario), the processing of the ore and manufacture of Ni foam, and the shipping of the foam and other components many thousands of kilometers to vehicle assembly plants present large costs and make for a rather unsustainable network to support the batteries. Hybrid systems consisting of two or more energy-conversion processes are now being increasingly used in very low-emission vehicles. A constant speed and load internal combustion engine driving a generator with a small battery for load surges could be made to emit less hydrocarbons, CO, and NOx than a standard automobile engine, but the cost would be much higher. Other hybrid systems which have been proposed are steameelectric and turbineeelectric. The problem associated with hybrid systems is the cost of the two engines plus the cost of the added controls and system integration.9 However, the prices are beginning to equilibrate, and they have become more attractive to a broader consumer base since they provide a \u201cgreen\u201d alternative to ordinary internal combustion vehicles.", "Fuel cells, which rely on electrochemical generation of electric power, could be used for nonpolluting sources of power for motor vehicles. Since fuel cells are not heat engines, they offer the potential for extremely low emissions with a higher thermal ef\ufb01ciency than internal combustion engines. Basically, a fuel cell converts chemical energy directly into electricity by combining oxygen from the air with hydrogen gas. The cell can keep producing electricity so long as hydrogen is available. The space program has used fuel cells for many decades. However, there are still obstacles to overcome before fuel cells attain widespread use. The federal government and others, especially California, have recently stated strong interests in making fuel cells more mainstream, in the interests of energy savings (and national security), as well as for improvements in air quality. Probably the ultimate answer to the problem of emissions from millions of private automobiles is an intelligent mix of transportation systems. It must be remembered, however, that even rail systems and bus systems do emit some air pollution. Rail systems are expensive to construct and lack \ufb02exibility. A quick calculation of the number of passengers carried per minute past a single point on a freeway in private automobiles will illustrate the dif\ufb01culties of a rail system in replacing the automobile. Buses offer much greater \ufb02exibility at lower cost than rail systems, but in order to operate ef\ufb01ciently and effectively, they would require separate roadway systems and loading stations apart from automobile traf\ufb01c. Of course, walking and biking should be encouraged, where appropriate. This requires thoughtful city and regional land use and transportation planning, as well as innovative engineering and architectural designs (e.g. improve bike lanes) that optimize for safety, environmental quality, economic feasibility and energy ef\ufb01ciency.

ADDRESSING AIR POLLUTION 32 Sustainable Approaches 32.1 INTRODUCTION The immediacy and urgency of the pollution problems in the 1950s and 1960s led to an air quality strategy that focused mainly on cleaning up existing problems. There were numerous episodes in which people were suffering from the acute problems associated with high concentrations of what are now known as conventional or criteria pollutants, especially particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), as well as what was collectively known as \u201csmog\u201d. The remediation that was needed allowed little time and effort devoted to preventing the pollution in the frst place. As engineers so often do, they dedicated their skills and creativity to fnding ways to remove and treat the pollutants. Their success in this effort over that past half-century is nothing short of phenomenal. The technologies described in Chapters 29, 30, and 31 for the most part did not exist in 1960 and, if they did, they were rudimentary means of testing for and cleaning up air pollution. Indeed, when this effort started, only the most noticeable and easily measured pollutants were even addressed. And, when this was done, it was at detection levels at several orders of magnitude higher than health and environmental thresholds. As measurement, control technologies, and predictive and descriptive models have improved, there has been a growing, commensurate capacity to begin to think about ways to address problems before they begin. This can be traced to an evolution of engineering air pollution controls. This evolution was not just in better methods, but also in a new engineering and science ethos. The end-of-stack technologies continue to be as important as ever and continue to improve in effciency and effectiveness. However, the ethos today also includes a more systematic view of the pollutant, the environment and the receptors of the pollutant (see Figure 32.1). There are numerous industrial, commercial, and governmental green initiatives, including design for the environment (DfE), design for disassembly (DfD) and design for recycling (DfR).2a,2b As shown in Figure 32.1, adhering to a systems view begins with concern about future generations, i.e. it is not only important to achieve an acceptable condition but that the level of acceptability be sustained. Solving an immediate problem may well be unacceptable if it leads to consequences in time. It is preferable to avoid air pollution than to treat it. DfD is a mindset that is akin to the engineering concept of reliability. Sustainable engineering must consider the time horizon before and after the useful life of a device or system. Engineering reliability is based on a \u201cfailure density\u201d, or f(t), which is a function of the likelihood that an adverse outcome will occur, but note that it is not a function of the severity of the outcome. The f(t) is not affected by whether the outcome is very severe (complete shutdown of all pollution control equipment) or relatively benign (unforeseen need for cartridge replacement).", "The likelihood that something will fail at a given time interval can be found by integrating the hazard rate over a defned time interval: Z t2 no Pt1 Tf t2 \u00bc f\u00f0t\u00dedt (32.1) t1 where Tf \u00bctime of failure. Thus, the reliability function R(t) of a system at time t is the cumulative probability that the system has not failed in the time interval from t0 to tt: t Z no R\u00f0t\u00de\u00bcPTf t \u00bc1 f\u00f0x\u00dedx (32.2) 0 Reliability can be improved by extending the time (increasing tt), thereby making the system more resistant to failure. For example, proper engineering design of a cyclone by limiting the number of moving parts may extend the expected life for decades. However, the design cannot completely eliminate failure, i.e. R(t) \u00bc0; Fundamentals of Air Pollution 929 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00032-3 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Even with the simple cyclone, it can be damaged by natural catastrophes or, more likely, by corrosion from chemicals in the gas stream. Equation (32.2) illustrates built-in vulnerabilities, such as unscientifcally sound facility siting practices or the inclusion of inappropriate design criteria, e.g. cheapest land. Such mistakes or malpractice shortens the time before a failure. Thus, reliability is also a term of effciency. Lack of insight to recognize these ineffciencies upfront leads to premature failures (e.g. power failures to the electrostatic precipitator, unexpected chemical compounds in the gas stream that foul a catalytic converter, or operator errors). The common graphical representation of engineering reliability is the so-called bathtub curve (Figure 32.2). The U-shape indicates that failure will more likely occur at the beginning and near the end of the life of a system, process, or equipment. The faw of the reliability curve is that it implies that the process only begins after we are VI.

Indeed, failure can occur even before the proposals for control equipment are written. Perhaps, given corporate inertia, the optimal approach had been eliminated for reasons of immediacy and initial costs. In this case, the engineer may not have even considered what would have been the best option. When selecting pollution control equipment, for example, one of the selection criteria should be to have a strategy to address what remains after the equipment\u2019s function has ceased, e.g. will long-term disposal or special handling be needed (such as radioactive isotopes in monitoring equipment and potentially toxic materials in control equipment flters and cartridges). Obviously, the best strategy is to have nothing to address, i.e. zero waste at end-of-life. The DfD and DfR approaches require that the entire life cycle be considered before installation, especially the times near the end of useful life of the system. For example, is the control device merely shifting the environmental burden to another part of the environment, e.g. making an air pollutant into a solid waste or water pollutant? These rubrics sometimes replace, but often are integrated with the traditional pollution control paradigms. Thus, the present era of air pollution control is transitional between the traditional, retroactive \u201ccollection and treatment\u201d approach and a fully regenerative and sustainable approach. The application of the control technologies discussed in Chapters 30 and 31 involves numerous variables. Some are objective and science based. Others concern costs and feasibility. Still others are policy and rules based.", "The cost of controlling any given air pollution source is usually an exponential function of the percentage of control and therefore becomes an important consideration in the level of control required. Figure 32.3 shows a typical cost curve for control equipment. If the material recovered has some economic value, the picture is different. Figure 32.4 shows the previous cost of control with the value recovered curve Quantity of material removed (%) superimposed on it. The plant manager looking at such a curve will strive to operate in the region to the left of the intersection of the two curves, whereas the local air pollution forces would insist on operation as far to the right of the graph as the best available control technology would allow. Control of any air pollution source requires a complete knowledge of the contaminant and the source. Preventing the formation of a pollutant also requires an understanding of the physical and chemical properties of the precursors of that pollutant and the conditions that promote or inhibit its formation. Thus, the engineers controlling the source must be thoroughly familiar with all available physical and chemical data on the effuent from the source. They must know the rules and regulations of the control agencies involved, including not only the Air Pollution Control Agency but also any agencies that may have jurisdiction over the construction, operation, and fnal disposal of the waste from the source.3 In many cases, heating or cooling of the gaseous effuent will be required before it enters the control device. To develop a satisfactory design, the engineer must be thoroughly aware of the gas laws, thermodynamic properties, and reactions involved. For example, if a gas is cooled there will be condensation when the temperature drops below the dew point. If water is sprayed into the hot gas for cooling, it adds greatly to the specifc volume of the mixture. As the gases pass through hoods, ducts, fans, and control equipment, temperatures and pressures change and hence, also, specifc volumes and velocities.4 32.2 UTILITY AND THE BENEFITeCOST ANALYSIS On the surface, the choice of whether to pursue an air pollution control option is a simple matter of benefts vs VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32. SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES costs. Is it more or less costly to control the emissions of air pollutant \u201cA\u201d using approach \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, or \u201cn\u201d? Engineers make much use of the beneftecost ratio (BCR), owing to a strong affnity for objective measures of successes. Thus, utility is an engineering measure of success of any successful engineering enterprise. After all, engineers are expected to provide reasonable and useful products. Two useful engineering defnitions of utilitarianism (Latin utilis, useful) are imbedded in BCR and life cycle analysis (LCA): 1. The belief that the value of a thing or an action is determined by its utility. 2. The concept that effort should be directed toward achieving the most beneft for the greatest number. The BCR is a useful metric due to its simplicity and seeming transparency. To determine whether a project is worthwhile, one simply sums all of the benefts and puts them in the numerator and sums all of the costs and puts them in the denominator. If the ratio is greater than 1, the option\u2019s benefts exceed its costs. One obvious problem with the BCR is that some costs and benefts are much easier to quantify than others. Some, like those associated with quality of life, are nearly impossible to quantify and monetize accurately. Further, the comparison of action vs no-action alternatives cannot always be captured within a BCR. Opportunity costs and risks are associated with taking no action and staying with the status quo (e.g. not applying a new technology may miss an opportunity for improved effciency). Simply comparing the status quo to costs and risks associated with a new technology may be biased toward no action or proven technologies. Costs in time and money are not the only reasons for avoiding action. The new technology may have problems over time that are not yet apparent from experience with limited applications. Often, selecting a critical path, including various waste streams, is a matter of optimization, which is proven analytical tool in engineering. However, the greater the number of contravening risks that are possible, the more complicated such optimization routines become.", "As seen in Chapter 5, the product fows, critical paths, and life cycle inventories of various options can become quite complicated for complex problems, such as decisions about the optimal sources of energy. Alternative fuels provide an illustrative example of these complexities. The greater availability of ethanol may introduce unforeseen risks that, if not managed properly, could interfere with quality of life of distant and future populations and could add costs to the public (e.g. air pollutants and topsoil loss) with little or no net beneft. So it is not simply a matter of benefts versus cost; it is often a matter of trading one risk for another. Generally, addressing a contravening risk is a matter of optimization, which is a proven analytical tool in engineering. However, the greater the number of contravening risks that are possible, the more complicated such optimization routines become. The product fows, critical paths, material manifests, and inventories can become quite large and uncertain for complex issues like selecting fuels that meet environmental, societal, and economic demands. Indeed, one of the present challenges of LCA approaches discussed in Chapter 5 is having a reliable life cycle inventory (LCI). To date, LCIs have often been proprietary, limited in available material and energy data for numerous processes, and devoid of general standards for quality. In particular, LCIs contain very little information about product usage and potential exposure to the ingredients in products. There is progress in this area; such as the establishment of the US LCI Database by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. This effort is fnding ways to develop publicly available LCI data modules for commonly used materials, products, and processes. These data will support efforts to develop product LCA-based decision support systems and tools. It will also provide benchmark data for generating or assessing company, plant, or new technology data, as well as to provide for a broad data resource base for conducting LCAs generally.5 Risk trade-off is likely to occur in ethanol and biofuel decisions. For example, when regulatory agencies mandate more ethanol usage, they must also enforce new air pollution laws associated with the fuel. These added regulations can be associated with indirect, countervailing risks. As a result, new facilities will likely need to be constructed (see Figure 32.5), each with its costs and pollution emissions. These costs and emission may not be well understood since the technologies are either new or scaled up substantially. In addition, the price of feedstock (especially corn in the case of corn-based ethanol) may increase safety risks via \u201cincome\u201d and \u201cstock\u201d effects. The income effect results from decreasing funds for other fuel ventures to pay the capital costs associated with ethanol, which makes it more diffcult for a company or backers to invest in other services that would have provided improved fuel effciency. The stock effect results when the capital costs increase to a point where companies have to wait to purchase new facilities, so they are left with substandard manufacturing. Thus, the engineer is frequently asked to optimize for two or more conficting variables in many situations. The success of ethanol in displacing fossil fuels depends on the effciency with which it can be produced and used. Complicating matters, the use of fossil fuels in their production and/or operation is part of ethanol production, as it is for all biofuels. Societal benefts and costs are tied to ethanol\u2019s energy balances. VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32.2 UTILITY AND THE BENEFITeCOST ANALYSIS Another accountability challenge is whether losses are included in calculations. From a thermodynamics standpoint, the nation\u2019s increased ethanol use could actually increase demands for fossil fuels, such as the need for crude oil-based infrastructures, including farm chemicals derived from oil, farm vehicle, and equipment energy use (planting, cultivation, harvesting, and transport to markets) dependent on gasoline and diesel fuels, and even embedded energy needs in the ethanol processing facility (crude oil-derived chemicals needed for catalysis, purifcation, fuel mixing, and refning). A comprehensive LCA is a vital tool for ascertaining the actual effciencies.a The questions surrounding alternative fuels and ethanol, specifcally, can be addressed using a three-step methodology. First, the effciency calculations must conform to the physical laws, especially those of thermodynamics and motion. Second, the \u201cgreenness\u201d, as a metric of sustainability and effectiveness can be characterized by LCAs. Third, the policy and geopolitical options and outcomes can be evaluated by decision force feld analyses. In fact, these three approaches are sequential. The frst must be satisfed before moving to the second.", "Likewise, the third depends on the frst two methods. No matter how politically attractive or favorable by society, an alternative fuel must comport with the conservation of mass and energy. Further, each step in the life cycle (e.g. extraction of raw materials, value-added manufacturing, use, and disposal) must be considered in any beneftecost or riskebeneft analysis. Finally, the societal benefts and risks must be viable for an alternative fuel to be accepted. Thus, even a very effcient and effective fuel may be rejected for societal reasons (e.g. religious, cultural, historical, or ethical). The challenge of the scientist, engineer, and policy maker is to sift through the myriad data and information to ascertain whether ethanol truly presents a viable alternative fuel. Of the misrepresentations being made, some clearly violate the physical laws. Many ignore or do not provide correct weights to certain factors in the life cycle. There is always the risk of mischaracterizing the social good or costs, a common problem with the use of beneftecost relationships. Industrial ecology employs the life cycle, including the technical intricacies involved in manufacturing, using and decommissioning of a product or system, the infrastructure technologies need to support the product, and the social structure in which the product is made and used (see Figure 32.6). The factory or other facility must be viewed within the context of spheres of infuence; the processes infuence and are infuenced by each adjacent sphere. Decision force felds can be adapted specifcally to sustainable designs. For example, if the primary concern is managing the emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), decision force felds can be based on the various physical and chemical properties of a substance using a multiple objective plot (see Figure 32.7). Here, two different products can be visually compared in terms of the sustainability, based on toxicity (carcinogenicity), mobility, and partitioning a Another indirect impact of ethanol fuel switching involves operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Very commonly, O&M is not effectively valued in cost and risk comparisons. For example, ethanol may be much more damaging to fuel systems, such as clogging jets in carburetors and fuel lines, especially in small engines. These additional costs must be part of any LCA, beneft/cost ratios, or other decision tool. VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32.

Both reagents appear to have an affnity for the air. Product #1 (open squares) has a larger half-life (i.e. is more persistent), whereas product #2 (closed squares) is more carcinogenic, fammable, and likely to be taken up by the lungs. Based on these factors, it appears, at least at the screening level, that product #1 is comparatively better from a sustainability standpoint.

THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32.2 UTILITY AND THE BENEFITeCOST ANALYSIS (e.g. sorption, vapor pressure, and Henry\u2019s law constants), persistence, and treatability by different methods (e.g. wastewater treatment facilities, pump andtreat,etc.).The shapeofthe curveand the sizeof the peaks are relative indicators of toxicity and persistence of a potential problem (the inverse of sustainability of healthy conditions). The plot criteria are selected to provide an estimate of the comparative sustainability of candidate products. It is important to tailor the criteria to the design needs. In the instance of Figure 32.7, this is mainly addressing the toxic hazard and risk of the substances6: Vapor pressuredThis sector is a chemical property that tells us the potential of the chemical to become airborne. The low end of the scale is 10 8 mmHg; high end is 102 mmHg and above. Henry\u2019s lawdThis property tells us how the chemical partitions in air and water. Nonvolatile substances have a value of 4 10 7 (unitless), moderate volatility is between 4 10 4 and 4 10 2, and volatile chemicals are at or above 4. The values are limitless because they are a ratio of concentration in air and water.", "SolubilitydThis property alludes to the potential of the chemical to enter water. Very soluble chemicals are on the order of 10,000 ppm and nonsoluble entities have aqueous solubility less than 0.1 ppm. BioconcentrationdThis sector specifes the tendency/ potential of the chemical to be taken up by biological entities (algae, fsh, animals, humans, etc.). A low potential is defned as 250 (unitless) or less, while a high potential is found at 1000 or above. Atmospheric oxidation, half-life (days)dThis property helps to defne the fate of the chemical once it enters the atmosphere. A short half-life is desirable as the chemical will have little time to cause adverse effects. A rapid half-life would be on the order of 2 h or less. A slow half-life is between 1 and 10 days; longer than 10 days is a persistent chemical. BiodegradationdThis sector defnes the ability of the environment to break down the chemical. A short biodegradation time is ideal so that the chemical does not persist. There are two sectors of biodegradation; one is dimensionless and one has units of time. A biodegradation factor on the order of hours is very quick, whereas a factor on the order of years is long. HydrolysisdThis describes the potential of the chemical to be broken down into a by-product and water. It has units of time for a pH of 7. A long hydrolysis time is on the order of many years. FlammabilitydThis describes the chemical\u2019s fash point (degrees Centigrade). Human inhalationdThis defnes the threshold limit for inhalation of the chemical below which there will be no observed effect in humans; 500 mg m 3 and above is a high concentration for which there is little effect. The chemical becomes more of a problem when the limit is 50mg m 3orless. CarcinogenicitydThis is the potential for the chemical to cause cancer. This data is usually somewhat uncertain due to inaccurate doseeresponse curves. Sewage treatment plant (STP) total removaldThis is the percentage of the chemical that is removed in a wastewater treatment process; 90e100% removal is desirable, whereas 0e10% removal describes a chemical that is tough to treat. STP sludge sorptiondThis is a percentage of how much of the chemical will adsorb to the sludge in a wastewater treatment plant. This can be important when the sludge is disposed in a landfll or agriculturally land applied. About 0e10% sorption is ideal so that the chemical does not get recycled back to the environment; 90e100% sorption to sludge solids makes disposal diffcult. STP air removaldA percentage of the chemical that is removed to the air from waste water treatment. About 0e10% is ideal so that little extra air treatment is needed; 90e100% air removal requires signifcant air treatment. Aquatic toxicity (green algae) (parts per million)dThis sector defnes the chemical\u2019s toxicity to green algae. A toxic effect on algae can disrupt the entire food chain of an ecosystem. Toxicity is measured on a concentration scale. A low toxicity would be at high concentrations (>100 ppm). A high toxicity would be at concentrations on the parts per billion or parts per trillion scale. Aquatic toxicity (fsh) (parts per million)dThis defnes the toxicity of the chemical to a specifc fsh species. For example, in the Pacifc Northwest, a chemical that is toxic to salmon can cause millions of dollars in economic damage. A low toxicity would be at high concentrations (>100 ppm). A high toxicity would be at concentrations on the parts per billion or parts per trillion scale. Certainly, green design considers more than toxicity. The ecosystem view calls for a search for materials and processes that improve recycling and reuse, avoid consumer misuse and consider disassembly. These can also be evaluated using multiple objective plots. The best of these can be considered the benchmark, which is a type of index that conveniently displays numerous factors with appropriate weightings. A weakness of this approach is the reliance on inherent human and aquatic toxicity, rather than cumulative risk. Although inhalation is one of the criteria, other exposure routes and pathways, e.g. ingestion and dermal, must be included in a comprehensive LCA. A way to visualize the interrelationships within and between factors represented by such complex data is the decision matrix. The matrix helps to ensure that all of the right factors are considered in the planning and design phase and that these factors are properly VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32. SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES implemented and monitored throughout the project.", "Integrated engineering approaches require that the engineer\u2019s responsibilities extend well beyond the construction, operation, and maintenance stages. This approach has been articulated by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The integrated matrix helps DfE to be visualized, which allows for the engineer to see the technical and other factors associated with each component of the design, as well as the relationships among these components. For example, health risks, social expectations and environmental impacts, and other societal risks and benefts associated with a device, structure, product, or activity can be visualized at various stages of the manufacturing, marketing, and application stages. This yields a number of two-dimensional matrices (see Figure 32.8) for each relevant design component. Indoor and microenvironmental air impacts Local air impacts Regional air impacts Global air impacts Surface water impacts Ground water impacts Ocean impacts And, each respective cell indicates both the importance of that component but the confdence (expressed as scientifc certainty) that the engineer can have about the underlying information used to assess the importance (see legend to Figure 32.8). The matrix approach is qualitative or at best semiquantitative, but like the multiple objective plots, provides a benchmark for comparing alternatives that would otherwise be incomparable. To some extent, even numerical values can be assigned to each cell to compare them quantitatively, but the results are at the discretion of the analyst, who determines how different areas are weighted. The matrix approach can also focus on design for a more specifc measure, such as energy effciency or product safety, and can be extended to corporate activities as a system.

In this case, the product is associated with personal and regional air pollution, as well as with other environmental impacts. Note: This fgure differs substantially, but was inspired by one previously used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in a professional development course on sustainable design. (For color version of this fgure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) American Society of Mechanical Engineers; http://www. professionalpractice.asme.org/communications/sustainability/2.htm; [accessed 25.05.06]. VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32.2 UTILITY AND THE BENEFITeCOST ANALYSIS The key point about benchmarking is the importance of a systematic and prospective viewpoint in design. Whatever tools we can use to help us to model and to predict consequences of available alternatives is an important aspect of green design. The emissions trading programs, e.g. netting, offsets, bubbles, and banking, mentioned in Chapter 29 have been tested and work well for some pollutants. In many cases, less pollution is produced using these innovative methods than with the traditional \u201cstackby-stack\u201d and \u201cpipe-by-pipe\u201d approach, i.e. pollution command and control. Such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology-based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches, such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the frst large bulk of pollutants, followed by higher operations and maintenance (O&M) technologies for the more diffcult to treat stacks and pipes. But, the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effuents than treating each stack or pipe as an independent entity. This is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches, i.e. conducting a LCA, prioritizing the most important problems, and matching the technologies and operations to address them. The problems will vary by size (e.g. pollutant loading), diffculty in treating, and feasibility. The easiest ones are the big ones that are easy to treat (so-called low hanging fruit). By doing the frst successfully, good will and confdence grows, which may help overcome the corporate inertia need to address the more diffcult problems. However, the most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and diffcult to treat, i.e. less feasible. This is a common problem in pollution control. The frst increments of removal or treatment are relatively inexpensive and achievable with off-the-shelf technologies, but the cost-effciency ratio increases substantially and becomes quasi-asymptotic with each increment of removal (see Figure 32.9, which modifes the typical cost curve discussed in Chapter 4 to show the combination of technical and cost constraints when selecting pollution control equipment).", "Thus, the environmental science requires that expectations be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective. The selection of any pollution control technology is based on the intrinsic characteristics of the contaminants and on the substrate in which they reside. The choice must factor in all of the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the contaminant with respect to the matrices and substrates (e.g. if sorbed to PM, the particle shape and diameter) and the characteristics of the gas stream (air and other gases and suspended PM). Eliminating or reducing pollutant concentrations begins with assessing the physical and chemical characteristics of each contaminant, and matching these characteristics with the appropriate treatment technology. Allofthe kinetics andequilibria discussedin Part II, such as solubility, fugacity, sorption, and bio-accumulation factors, will determine the effectiveness of destruction, transformation, removal, and immobilization of these contaminants. There can be synergies (e.g. innovative incineration approaches are available that not only effectively destroy organic contaminants, but in the process also destroys the inorganic cyanic compounds). Unfortunately, there are also antagonisms among certain approaches, such as the very effective incineration processes for organic contaminants that transform heavy metal species into more toxic and more mobile forms. Increasing pressures and temperatures not only degrade organic molecules and remove functional groups that make for more toxic and bioaccumulating compounds, but may also oxidize or in other ways transform the metals into more toxic forms. Thus, elevated concentrations of organic compounds or heavy metals are an example of a constraint in selecting controls or changing processes. Certainly, proper air 100% Gap between 100% efficiency and 95% Removal efficiency Cost FIGURE 32.9 Hypothetical cost-ef\ufb01ciency curve of an advanced air pollution removal device following precleaning (e.g. by a cyclone). The initially 96% removal effciency is achieved at much less cost than the remaining 4%. In this case, removal >99% is not only expensive but also unattainable technically, i.e. removal effciency has reached an asymptote. (For color version of this fgure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32. SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES pollution prevention and control must account for the entire life cycle of a potential hazard.7 Off-the-shelf models can be used for simple process operations, such as extraction or thermal vaporization applied to single contaminants in relatively pure systems. However, such models have not been appropriately evaluated for a number of other technologies because of the limited database on treatment technologies for many pollutants. This requires a comprehensive review of the state-ofthe-science to ensure the data and models indeed apply to the setting and treatment scenarios at hand. If very similar scenarios and data are not available, testing under the actual manufacturing conditions is likely need. The emerging discipline of industrial ecology acknowledges this need for a more encompassing, systems view. The entire manufacturing process can be viewed as an ecosystem. This manufacturing ecosystem perspective has a very different set of environmental performance metrics than the tradition compartmental approach. This is based on fnding opportunities for improvement across the breadth of the entire enterprise, including devices, installation, operations, cleaning, upkeep, change-outs, and other operations and processes across all facilities and buildings. Traditionally, such elements have been typically considered separately and often independently, including span of control of the people. This view calls for the integration of the fows of resources spanning the disciplines of manufacturing engineers, energy and facility engineers, building architects, O&M personnel and managers. This systems perspective of a factory can be measured and predicted using models of the material, energy, and waste (MEW) fows. The MEW fows integrate manufacturing operations, supporting facilities, and operations.8 The MEW perspective is also useful for occupational safety and health. Segregation of processes from humans may be accomplished by designing sections of the facility to be operated without the need for humans to habitate them. Obviously, this is done in the heavy industrial sections where temperature, pressure, and chemical concentrations are very high. However, it could also include other functions that are aligned. These areas would not only be able to have higher concentrations of PM and gas-phase compounds, but could even be free of oxygen, e.g. pure N2 assembly areas that would eliminate oxidation and improve fre safety while also lowering the likelihood of product contamination.1 The control of atmospheric emissions from a process will generally take one of three forms depending on the process, fuel, types, availability of control equipment, etc.", "The three general methods are (1) process change to a less polluting process or to lowered emission from the existing process through a modifcation or change in operation, (2) change to a fuel that will give the desired level of emissions, and (3) installation of control equipment between the point of pollutant generation and its release to the atmosphere. Control may consist of either removal of the pollutant or conversion to a less polluting form.9 32.3 PROCESS CHANGE One of the steps toward a sustainable approach toward air quality was attention to the industrial processes that lead to the generation of the pollutant. Plant managers, engineers, and even fnancial offcers, not to mention regulators, began to ask, \u201cAre there ways that we can get the same product or service with less pollution?\u201d Actually, the engineer and environmental offcers may have asked that question, but the others might have asked it somewhat differently, \u201cAre there things we can do to prevent so much of our valuable matter and energy exiting the facility in places other than in our product?\u201d Thus, pollution was seen as an indicator of ineffciency in the process, which can be described using both environmental and economic metrics. A process change can be either a change in operating procedures for an existing process or the substitution of a completely different process. In recent years, this has been labeled \u201cpollution prevention\u201d. Consider a plant manager who for years has been using solvent A for a degreasing operation. By past experimentation, it has been found that with the conveyor speed at 100 units per hour, with a solvent temperature of 80 C, one gets maximum cleaning with solvent a loss that results in the lowest overall operating cost for the process. A new regulation is passed requiring greatly reduced atmospheric emissions of organic solvents, including solvent A. The manager has several alternatives: 1. Change to another more expensive solvent, which by virtue of its lower vapor pressure would emit less organic matter. 2. Reduce the temperature of the solvent and slow down the conveyor to get the same amount of cleaning. This may require the addition of another line or another 8 h shift. 3. Put in the necessary hooding, ducting, and equipment for a solvent recovery system, which will decrease the atmospheric pollution and also result in some economic solvent recovery. 4. Put in the necessary hooding, ducting, and equipment for an after-burner system, which will burn the organic solvent vapors to a less polluting emission, but with no solvent recovery. VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32.3 PROCESS CHANGE In some cases, the least expensive control is achieved by abandoning the old process and replacing it with a new, less polluting one. Any increased production and/or recovery of material may help offset a portion of the cost. It has proved to be cheaper to abandon old steel mills and to replace them with completely new furnaces of a different type than to modify the old systems to meet pollution regulations. Kraft pulp mills found that the least costly method of meeting stringent regulations was to replace the old, high-emission recovery furnaces with a new furnace of completely different design. Process change is often incentivized if it is deemed to have a societal value even greater than the specifc value to a company. For example, some of the Kraft mills at frst received some relief and support to provide additional plant capacity to offset partially the cost of thenew furnacetype. The initial costsof a complete process change can be quite high, but is often paid back with time. Another way to compare options, e.g. energy production, is the payback ratio, which is the ratio of total costs, mass, or energy produced during a system\u2019s normal lifespan, divided by the costs, mass, or energy needed to build, install, maintain, and operate that system. A high ratio indicates good environmental performance or effectiveness. If a system has an energy-payback ratio between 1 and 1.5, its costs are about the same as the savings or it consumes nearly as much energy as it generates. This would mean the net gain in energy production is zero, so this not a viable energy source. Another useful and similar metric is known as the energy return on the energy investment (EROEI). Energy production and use can never been 100% effcient, given the second law of thermodynamics and losses with each conversion.", "For instance, the chemical energy of crude oil well is diminished during extraction, processing, and transport on its way to the end use, and is further diminished by losses at the end use, e.g. ineffciencies within the internal combustion engine. The EROEI is the ratio of the energy obtained from the resource to the energy expended in production, but is actually an enhancement of the expression of net energy, i.e. the energy produced minus the energy expended. Thus, an EROEI 1 means that the net energy 0. Thus, the problems with ethanol mentioned above can be expressed as an EROEI. Arguably, for corn-based ethanol production, if the fossil fuel life cycles are included in the calculation, EROEI is lower than if this is calculated later in the life cycle, since farming and handling of corn is so fossil fuel dependent. Thus, ethanol\u2019s EROEI can be substantially improved with a whole plant-type method versus the fruit-only fermentation process. The EROEI is also a useful tool for comparing stationary and mobile sources. For example, one could describe electric cars as being either nuclear or coal-fred vehicles, since most electricity is generated from these two stationary source types. Thus, the life cycles of an electric versus gasoline fueled vehicle could be compared using the EROEI. Indeed, the process change is seldom a choice between two process types, but often includes numerous options, each with its own crossover and combinations of process change options with their own collective crossover. Sometimes, combining options is synergistic. That is, one option may be to use less toxic raw materials and another option may be to change the operating temperature in reactor to decrease the generation of a caustic and toxic substance. However, the combination of these two options may not only lead to the elimination of the substance in the gas stream, but also may greatly increase the effciency of fabric flters downstream, as well as extend the time needed for cleaning and replacement. This is not only benefcial fnancially, but also could greatly lower the amount of PM released. Recall from Chapter 30, that each flter cleaning and/or replacement is followed by an increase in PM until the dust cake is formed. Thus, the combined process option changes could obviate the need to add pollution control equipment for the caustic pollutant, improve fltration effciency, and reduce PM emissions. Conversely, some option combinations can be antagonistic. Solving a problem in one part of the system, e.g. installing complicated, high O&M control technologies, could introduce problems downstream if the line is shut down too often. Another example would be to add a sorbant to improve an upstream technology that generates particles with low electrical conductance, thus interfering with and lowering effciencies of electrostatic precipitators downstream. Thus, when evaluating and considering process change options, it is important to consider the systematic effects of each option and the combinations of various options. As engineers often fnd, the technical aspects of redesigning a process may well be the easiest part. For many industries, this may be the only way to improve effciency (e.g. steel making will always require the iron, carbon, and energy, but the process leading to a particular grade of steel can vary). Inventories and data bases already exist, since the raw materials and energy use are part of the fnancial bottom line. Such information is available for the engineer\u2019s mass and energy balance calculations (input and output). The chemistry and physics are also well understood. Good industrial practice minimizes the \u201cblack boxes\u201d of a process; otherwise, VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32. SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES adjustments in production and output of products would be very risky (i.e. a catalyst concentration may have a very tight tolerance range, outside of which the process does not work well or at all). Finally, the loss term in the thermodynamic balances are well understood. If (raw material A) \u00fe (raw material B) (losses of A and B) \u00bc (Product C losses), the plant manager needs precise and accurate data on these loss terms. These data document what leaves the process through vents, stacks, pipes, and other conveyances, as well as via fugitive emissions. Many of these losses are indeed air pollutants. Thus, the engineer can recommend process changes that can eliminate and decrease pollution, with attendant cost predictions. The hardest part of process change may be the ability to predict success.", "Many excellent emerging technologies work well at the bench or microcosm scale, but when scaled up under real-world conditions are much less effcient. Or, if they do work, can be infeasible in terms of production rate or product quality. Often, companies do not have the luxury of time and resources to conduct the needed developmental work to apply the new technology to their process. They may also be leery of possible risks and liabilities of new processes, especially if the status quo is working, albeit not perfectly. Each company has a unique threshold for risk and uncertainty. The engineer needs to recommend process changes with these thresholds in mind. There is also the phenomenon of \u201ccorporate inertia\u201d. Every organization fears change to varying extents. The maxim is often, \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fx it\u201d. 32.4 FUEL CHANGE In the past, for many air pollution control situations, a change to a less polluting fuel offered the ideal solution to the problem. If a power plant was emitting large quantities of SO2 and fy ash, conversion to natural gas was cheaper than installing the necessary control equipment to reduce the pollutant emissions to the permitted values. If the drier at an asphalt plant was emitting 350 mg of PM per standard cubic meter of effuent when fred with heavy oil of 4% ash, it was probable that a switch to either oil of a lower ash content or natural gas would allow the operation to meet an emission standard of 250 mg m 3. Fuel switching based on meteorological or air pollution forecasts was, in the past, a common practice to reduce the air pollution burden at critical times. Some control agencies allowed power plants to operate on residual oil during certain periods of the year when pollution potential was low. Some large utilities for years have followed a policy of switching from their regular coal to a more expensive but lower sulfur coal when stagnation conditions were forecast. Caution should be exercised when considering any change in fuels to reduce emissions. This is particularly true considering today\u2019s fuel costs. Specifc considerations might be the following: 1. What are current and potential fuel supplies? In many areas natural gas is already in short supply. It may not be possible to convert a large plant with current allocations or pipeline capacity. 2. Most large boilers use a separate fuel for auxiliary or standby purposes. One actual example was a boiler fred with wood residue as the primary fuel and residual oil as the standby. A change was made to natural gas as the primary fuel, with residual oil kept for standby. This change was made to lower particulate emissions and to achieve a predicted slightly lower cost. Because of gas shortages, the plant now operates on residual oil during most of the cold season, and the resulting particulate emission greatly exceeds that of the previously burned wood fuel. In addition, an SO2 emission problem exists with the oil fuel that never occurred with the wood residue. Overall costs have not been lowered because natural gas rates have increased since the conversion. 3. Charts or tables listing supplies or reserves of low-sulfur fuel may not tell the entire story. For example, a large percentage of low-sulfur coal is owned by steel companies and is therefore not generally available for use in power-generating stations even though it is listed in tables published by various agencies. 4. Strong competition exists for low-pollution fuels. While one area may be drawing up regulations to require use of natural gas or low-sulfur fuels, it is probable that other neighboring areas are doing the same. Although there may have been suffcient premium fuel for one or two areas, if the entire region changes, not enough exists. Such a situation has resulted in extreme fuel shortages during cold spells in some large cities. The supply of low-sulfur fuels has been exhausted during period of extensive use. The use of nuclear reactors to generate electricity has been questioned from several environmental points of view. This approach appears to be relatively pollution free compared to the more familiar fossil fuel-fred plant, which emits carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, hydrocarbons, and fy ash. However, waste and spent-fuel disposal problems may offset the apparent advantages. These problems, as well as steam generator leaks and natural disasters (such as the recent tsunami aftermath in VI.", "THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32.6 DISPOSAL AND WASTE MINIMIZATION OF POLLUTANTS Japan), have led to concerns about nuclear power plants throughout the world. 32.5 REMOVAL OF POLLUTANTS In many situations, suffcient control over emissions cannot be obtained exclusively by fuel or process change. In cases such as these, the concentrations of the pollutants of concern in the exhaust gases or process stream must be decreased to allowable values before they are released to the atmosphere. This is the prototypical approach to air pollution and is the focus of Chapters 30 and 31. In the foreseeable future, depending on the pollutant, facility, and environmental setting, variations of combinations of these approaches will have to be used to address air pollutants, but with a movement toward prevention, waste minimization, and interventions earlier in the life cycle. The equipment for the pollutant removal system includes all hoods, ducting, controls, fans, and disposal or recovery systems that might be necessary. Even a seemingly insignifcant component can be very important if its function is rate limiting. For example, a valve that is mismatched to the gas stream and fouls at a much faster rate than another valve, can lead to substantial and avoidable emissions and costs. Indeed, a systems approach would include a review of each component to decide if a better one exists or, preferably, to \u201cdesign out\u201d any problematic component. A useful engineering pedagogy is to ask students how they can improve a series of switches in a system. Students often jump into an assignment with vigor and start looking for better materials in terms of conductance and durability. They may even do some research to see if a particular part of the switch is composed of toxic materials or fnd substitutes that could be more recyclable. However, they are less likely to remove some or all of the switches, even if they have no purpose. For example, there may never be access to a room, or the equipment is designed to stay on in every scenario. Indeed, the switch could even be a safety hazard if it were shut off, e.g. a backup pump to move hazardous materials to reserve tank in the event of an overfow. In such cases, the component can and should be designed out of the process. Obviously, before removing a component, the engineer must be quite certain about the intended function. The entire system should be engineered as a unit for maximum effciency and economy. Many systems operate at less than maximum effciency because a portion of the system was designed or adapted without consideration of the other portions.9 In a manner of speaking, this requires a sensitivity analysis of every component of the entire process, not just the air pollution control equipment. That is, if a small change somewhere in the process can lead to substantially decreased concentrations of a pollutant or its precursor, this is an opportunity for improved effciency. This means that the persons addressing air pollution controls at a facility must have a working knowledge not only of all of the environmental compartments (air, water, solid waste, radiation, etc.), but also of the manufacturing process. Again, this is the only way to calculate a meaningful mass and energy balance. Effciency of the control equipment is normally specifed before the equipment is purchased. If a plant is emitting a pollutant at 500 kg h 1 and the regulations allow an emission of only 25 kg h 1, it is obvious that at least 95% effciency is required of the pollution control system. This situation requires the regulation to state \u201cat least 95% removal on a weight basis\u201d. The regulation should further specify how the test would be made to determine the effciency. The thermodynamic effciency for the device shown in Figure 32.4 may be calculated in several ways: C Efficiency; % \u00bc 100 (32.3) A However, since A \u00bc B \u00fe C: C Efficiency; % \u00bc 100 B \u00fe C A B or A B 100 or 100 A B \u00fe C (32.4) The fnal acceptance test would probably be made by measuring two of the three quantities and using the appropriate equation. For a completely valid effciency test the effect of holdup (D) and loss (E) must also be taken into account. To remove a pollutant from the carrying stream, some property of the pollutant that is different from the carrier must be exploited. The pollutant may have different size, inertia, electrical, or absorption properties.", "Removal requires that the equipment be designed to apply the scientifc principles necessary to perform the separation. 32.6 DISPOSAL AND WASTE MINIMIZATION OF POLLUTANTS If a pollutant is removed from the carrying gas stream, disposal of the collected material becomes of vital concern. If the collected material is truly inert, it may be disposed of in a sanitary landfll. If it is at the other end of the scale, it is probably considered as a toxic waste and strict laws governing its disposal apply. Disposal of hazardous wastes is regulated by governmental agencies. Thus, in addition to effciency VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32. SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES calculations, the fow in Figure 32.4 is also useful for green engineering and waste minimization. For example, a pollutant can be degraded in the device, e.g. thermally, to decrease the amount of a toxic substance that reaches the waste (C), the need for disposal is eased. In the United States, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 is the major legislation covering the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.10 This act provides a multifaceted approach to solving the problems associated with the generation of approximately 5 109 metric tons (5 1012 kg) of solid waste each year in the United States. It places particular emphasis on the regulation of hazardous wastes. This law established the Offce of Solid Waste within the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and directed the agency to publish hazardous waste characteristics and criteria. If a waste is designated as hazardous under the RCRA, regulations are applied to generators, transporters, and those who treat, store, or dispose of that waste. Regulations regarding hazardous wastes are enforced by the federal government, while the individual states are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the RCRA that apply to nonhazardous wastes. The act also provides for research, development, and demonstration grants for waste disposal. The general purpose of ultimate disposal of hazardous wastes is to prevent the contamination of susceptible environments. Surface water runoff, groundwater leaching, atmospheric volatilization, and biological accumulation are processes that should be avoided during the active life of the hazardous waste. As a rule, the more persistent a hazardous waste is (i.e. the greater its resistance to breakdown), the greater the need to isolate it from the environment. If the substance cannot be neutralized by chemical treatment or incineration and still maintains its hazardous qualities, the only alternative is usually to immobilize and bury it in a secure chemical burial site. 32.7 GREEN PRINCIPLES AND AIR QUALITY From a thermodynamics standpoint, a sustainable system is one that is in equilibrium or changing at a tolerably slow rate. In the food chain, for example, plants are fed by sunlight, moisture, and nutrients, and then become food themselves for insects and herbivores, which in turn act as food for larger animals. The waste from these animals replenishes the soil, which nourishes plants, and the cycle begins again.11 At the largest scale, manufacturing, transportation, commerce, and other human activities that promote high consumption and wastefulness of fnite resources cannot be sustained. At the individual designer scale, the products and processes must be considered for their entire lifetimes and beyond. The operationalizing of the quest for sustainability is defned as green engineering, a term that recognizes that engineers are central to the practical application of the principles sustainability to everyday life.12 Green engineering treats environmental quality as an end in itself. The US EPA has defned green engineering as . the design, commercialization, and use of processes and products, which are feasible and economical while minimizing (1) generation of pollution at the source and (2) risk to human health and the environment. The discipline embraces the concept that decisions to protect human health and the environment can have the greatest impact and cost effectiveness whenapplied early to the design and development phase of a process or product.13 Green engineering approaches are benefting from the phenomenal improvements in computational abilities (see Table 32.1) and other tools that were not available at the outset of the environmental movement, or even at the turn of the 21st century. Increasingly, companies and governmental agencies have come to recognize that improved effciencies save time, money, and other resources in the long run.", "Hence, decision makers are thinking systematically about the entire product stream in numerous ways: \u0081 applying sustainable development concepts, including the framework and foundations of \u201cgreen\u201d design and engineering models; \u0081 applying the design process within the context of a sustainable framework: including considerations of commercial and institutional infuences; \u0081 considering practical problems and solutions from a comprehensive standpoint to achieve sustainable products and processes; \u0081 characterizing waste streams resulting from designs; \u0081 understanding how frst principles of science, including thermodynamics, must be integral to sustainable designs in terms of mass and energy relationships, including reactors, heat exchangers, and separation processes; \u0081 applying creativity and originality in group product and building design projects. Traditionally, air pollution considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs. For example, hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream (including releases and emissions from vents and stacks) that must be contained and treated to fall below a designated concentration in the emission or other release fuid (i.e. air or water). The pollutant VI.

Low-hazard chemical synthesis Design syntheses to use and generate substances with little or no toxicity to humans and the environment. Select chemical synthesis with toxicity of the reagents in mind upfront. If a reagent ordinarily required in the synthesis is acutely or chronically toxic, fnd another reagent or new reaction with less toxic Computational chemistry can help predict unintended product formation and reaction rates of optional reactions. reagents. Renewable material use Use raw materials and feedstocks that are renewable rather than those that deplete nonrenewable natural resources. Renewable feedstocks are often made from agricultural products or are the wastes of other processes; depleting feedstocks are made from fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, or coal) or that must be extracted by mining. Construction materials can be from renewable and depleting sources. Linoleum fooring, for example, is highly durable, can be maintained with nontoxic cleaning products, and is manufactured from renewable resources amenable to being recycled. Upon demolition or refooring, the linoleum can be composted. Systems biology, informatics, and \u201comics\u201d technologies can provide insights into the possible chemical reactions and toxicity of the compounds produced when switching from depleting to renewable materials. Catalysis Minimize waste by using catalytic reactions. Catalysts are used in small amounts and can carry out a single reaction many times. They are preferable to stoichiometric reagents, which are used in excess and work only once. The Brookhaven National Laboratory recently reported that it has found a \u201cgreen catalyst\u201d that works by removing one stage of the reaction, eliminating the need to use solvents in the process by which many organic compounds are synthesized. The catalyst dissolves into the reactants. Also, the catalyst has the unique ability of being easily removed and recycled because, at the end of the reaction, the catalyst precipitates out of products as a solid material, allowing it to be separated from the products without using additional chemical solvents.* Computation chemistry can help to compare rates of chemical reactions using various catalysts. 32.7 GREEN PRINCIPLES AND AIR QUALITY VI.

Other factors, e.g. pressure, catalysis, photovoltaics, and Computational methods and natural products chemistry can help scientists start with a better synthetic framework. The same amount of value, e.g. information storage and application, is available on a much smaller scale. Thus, devices are smarter and smaller, and more economical in the long-term. Computational toxicology enhances the ability to make product decisions with better predictions of possible adverse effects, based on the logic. Improved, systematic catalysis in emission reductions, e.g. large sources like power plants and small sources like automobile exhaust systems. Zeolite and other sorbing materials used in air pollution treatment and emergency response situations can be better designed by taking advantage of surface effects; this decreases the volume of material used. To date, most of the progress has been the result of wet chemistry and bench research. Computational methods will streamline the process, including quicker \u201cscale-up\u201d.

SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES generation had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types, increasing waste handling facilities, and if these were not completely effective, limiting rates of production. Green engineering emphasizes that these processes are often ineffcient fnancially and environmentally, calling for a comprehensive, systematic life cycle approach.b Green engineering attempts to achieve four goals: 1. Waste minimization or dematerialization 2. Materials management 3. Pollution prevention 4. Product enhancement Waste reduction involves fnding effcient material uses. It is compatible with other engineering effciency improvement programs, such as total quality management and real-time or just-in-time manufacturing. The overall rationale for waste reduction is that if materials and processes are chosen intelligently at the beginning, less waste will result. In fact, a relatively new approach to engineering is to design and manufacture a product simultaneously rather than sequentially, known as concurrent engineering. Combined with DfE and industrial ecology, concurrent engineering approaches may allow air quality improvements under real-life, manufacturing conditions. However, changes made in any step must consider possible effects on the rest of the design and implementation. As mentioned, there is a formal process for answering questions of material and product use and waste production. This is known as the LCA, short for life cycle assessment or life cycle analysis. Such an assessment is a comprehensive approach to pollution prevention by analyzing the entire life of a product, process, or activity, encompassing raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, use, maintenance, recycling, and fnal disposal. In other words, assessing its life cycle should yield a complete picture of the environmental impact of a product. The frst step in the LCA is to gather data on the fow of a material. Once the quantities of various components of such a fow are known, the environmental effect of each step in the production, manufacture, use, and recovery/disposal is estimated. LCAs are performed for several reasons, including the comparison of products for purchasing and a comparison of products by industry. In the former case, the total environmental effect of glass returnable bottles, for example, could be compared to the environmental effect of nonrecyclable plastic bottles. If all of the factors going into the manufacture, distribution, and disposal of both types of bottles are considered, one container might be shown to be clearly superior. LCAs often suffer from a dearth of data. Some of the information critical to the calculations is virtually impossible to obtain. For example, something as simple as the tonnage of solid waste collected in the United States is not readily calculable or measurable. And even if the data were there, the procedure suffers from the unavailability of a single accounting system. Is there an optimal level of pollution, or must all pollutants be removed 100% (a virtual impossibility)? If there is air pollution and water pollution, how must these be compared? Once the life cycle of a material or product has been analyzed, the next engineering step is to manage the life cycle. If the objective is to use the least energy and to cause the least detrimental effect on the environment, then it is clear that much of the onus is on the manufacturers of these products. The users of the products can have the best intentions for reducing adverse environmental effects, but if the products are manufactured in such a way as to make this impractical or diffcult, then the fault is with the manufacturers. On the other hand, if the manufactured materials are designed to be used with little environmental insult and easy to separate and recycle, then most likely energy is saved, wastes are reduced, and the environment is protected. Many examples can be found of industrial frms decreasing emissions or the production of other wastes, or of facilitating the recovery of waste products, which in the process saved money. Some automobile manufacturers, for example, are modularizing the engines so that junked parts can be easily reconditioned and reused. There are various, but similar defnitions of \u201cpollution prevention\u201d including: The use of materials, processes, or practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants or wastes at the source. It includes practices that reduce the use of hazardous materials, energy, water, or other resources and practices that protect natural resources through conservation or more effcient use.14 In the broadest sense, pollution prevention is the idea of eliminating waste, regardless of how this might be done.", "Originally, pollution prevention was applied to industrial operations to reduce either the amount of the wastes being produced or to change the wastes\u2019 characteristics in order to make them more readily disposable. Many industries changed to water-soluble paints, for example, thereby eliminating organic solvents, cleanup time, etc., and often in the process saving considerable b This is another reminder that amount of pollution is most often an indicator of ineffciency. This ineffciency is in the context of both thermodynamics (i.e. mass and energy balances) and economics (e.g. supply and demand and willingness to pay). VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32.7 GREEN PRINCIPLES AND AIR QUALITY money. In fact, the concept was frst introduced as \u201cpollution prevention pays\u201d, emphasizing that many of the changes would actually save the companies money. In addition, the elimination or reduction of hazardous and otherwise diffcult wastes also has a longterm effectdit reduces the liability the company carries as a consequence of its disposal operations. Much of Europe had already directly or indirectly codifed life cycle approaches, when with the passage of the Pollution Prevention Act in 1990, the United States offcially joined the cadre of nations that encourage pollution prevention by setting appropriate standards for pollution prevention activities, to assist federal agencies in reducing wastes generated, to work with industry and to promote the elimination of wastes by creating waste exchanges and other programs, seek out and eliminate barriers to the effcient transfer of potential wastes, and to do this with the cooperation of the individual states. In general, the procedure for the implementation of pollution prevention activities is to 1. recognize a need, 2. assess the problem, 3. evaluate the alterative, and 4. implement the solutions. Many industries and industry groups have welcomed this governmental action, recognizing that pollution prevention can and often does result in the reduction of costs to the industry. Thus, recognition of the need quite often is internal and the prerogative of the company to initiate pollution prevention actions. A frst step is to assess the processes within an industrial operation. During the assessment phase, a common procedure is to perform a \u201cwaste audit\u201d, which is the black box mass balance, using the company as the black box. An example of such an audit is provided in the Example Box: Water Audit. EXAMPLE BOX: WASTE AUDIT15 A manufacturing company is concerned about the air emissions of volatile organic carbons. These chemicals can volatilize during the manufacturing process, but the company is not able to estimate accurately the rate of volatilization, or even which chemicals are going to the vapor phase. The company conducts an audit of three of their most widely used volatile organic chemicals with the following record of fndings: Material Purchase quantity (barrels) PURCHASING DEPARTMENT RECORDS: 48 Carbon tetrachloride* (CCl4) Methyl chloridex (CH2Cl3) 228 Trichloroethylene (C2HCl3) 505 Material Average concentration (mg lL1) WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT INFLUENT: Carbon tetrachloride 0.343 Methylene chloride 4.04 Trichloroethylene 3.23 * The correct name is tetrachloromethane, but the compound was in such common use throughout the twentieth century and was referred to as carbon tetrachloride that the name is still frequently used in the engineering and environmental professions. xAlso known as chloromethane.

Note that Aprod and Acons together comprise the typical net loss or gain term in a thermodynamic mass balance equation, e.g. designated as r in Eqn (18.34) in Chapter 18. Barrels must be converted to cubic meters and the density of each chemical must be known.", "Each barrel is 0.12 m2, and the density of the three chemicals is 1548, 1326, and 1476 kg m 3.

If a similar balance is done on the other chemicals, it appears that the loss to air of methyl chloride is about 16,000 kg year 1 and the trichloroethylene is about 7800 kg year 1. If the intent is to cut total VOC emissions, it is clear that the frst target should be the methyl chloride, at least in terms of the mass released. But, another important consideration in preventing pollution is relative risk. Materials changes often involve the substitution of one chemical for another, which is less toxic or requires less hazardous materials for cleanup. The use of trivalent chromium (Cr3\u00fe) for chrome plating instead of the much more toxic hexavalent chrome has found favor, as has the use of water-soluble dyes and paints. Although methyl chloride is two orders of magnitude more volatile than the other pollutants, all three compounds are likely to be found in the atmosphere. Thus, inhalation is a likely exposure pathway. Since risk is the product of exposure times hazard (R \u00bc E H), we can compare the risks by applying a hazard value (e.g. cancer potency). We can use the air emissions calculated above as a reasonable approximation of exposure via the inhalation pathwaya and the inhalation cancer slope factors to represent the hazard. These slope factors are published by the US EPA and are found to be Carbon tetrachloride \u00bc 0.053 kg day mg 1 Methyl chloride \u00bc 0.0035 kg day mg 1 Trichloroethylene \u00bc 0.0063 kg day mg 1 The relative risk for the three compounds can be estimated by removing the units (i.e. we are not actually calculating the risk, only comparing the three compounds against each other, so we do not need units). If we were calculating risks, the units for exposure would be mass of contaminant per body mass per time, e.g. milligrams per kilogram per day, whereas the slope factor unit is the inverse of this kilogram day per milligram so risk itself is a unitless probability. Carbon tetrachloride \u00bc 0.053 775 \u00bc 41 Methyl chloride \u00bc 0.0035 16,000 \u00bc 56 Trichloroethylene \u00bc 0.0063 7800 \u00bc 49 Thus, in terms of relative risk, methyl chloride is again the most important target chemical, but the other two are much closer. In fact, given the uncertainties and assumptions, from a relative risk perspective, the importance of removing the three compounds is nearly identical, owing to the much higher cancer potency of CCl4. a Even without calculating the releases, it is probably reasonable to assume that the exposures will be similar since the three compounds have high vapor pressures (more likely to be inhaled): carbon tetrachloride \u00bc 115 mmHg. methyl chloride \u00bc 4300 mmHg, trichloroethylene \u00bc 69 mmHg. Process modifcations usually involve the greatest investments, and can result in the most rewards. For example, a countercurrent wash water use instead of a once-through batch operation can signifcantly reduce the amount of wash water needing treatment, but such a change requires pipes, valves, and a new process protocol. In industries where materials are dipped into VI.

The most obvious costs are those normally documented in company and departmental records, such as direct labor, raw materials, energy use, capital equipment, site preparation, tie-ins, employee training, and regulatory recordkeeping (e.g. permits).16 However, there are numerous other savings, including those resulting from not having to spend time on submitting compliance permits and suffering potential fnes for noncompliance. Future liabilities weigh heavily where hazardous wastes have to be buried or injected, as well as air pollution control equipment that cannot meet prospective emission standards. Additionally, there are the intangible benefts of employee relations and safety (see Table 32.2). In many ways, the transition from command and control approaches to prevention has been incremental; an evolution rather than a revolution. Regulatory requirements and good engineering practice will continue to call for better approaches in both areas. Control technologies and pollution prevention are not separate endeavors. In fact, the life cycle view prohibits such dichotomies. They are both crucial tools in green design. The advances will continue toward sustainability and beyond, e.g. regenerative materials and technologies. By focusing on the function and eliminating ineffciencies, we can expect even better results will be attained. Engineers and other designers are dedicated to continuous improvement and total quality. As such, regenerative strategies for design, manufacturing, use, and reuse will increasingly be embraced. Process modifcations usually involve the largest investments of human and fnancial resources, and can result in the most rewards. For example, using wash water countercurrently instead of a once-through batch operation can signifcantly reduce the amount of wash water needing treatment. However, such a change requires new and redirect conduits, pipes, and valves; all necessitating a new process protocol. In industries where materials are dipped into solutions, such as in metal plating, the use of drag-out recovery tanks as an intermediate step has TABLE 32.2 Pollution Cost Categories Cost Category Typical Cost Components Usual/normal Direct labor Raw materials Energy and fuel Capital equipment and supplies Site preparation Tie-ins Training Permits: administrative and scientifc Hidden or direct Monitoring Permitting fees Environmental transformation Environmental impact analyses and assessments Health and safety assessments Service agreements and contracts Legal Control instrumentation Reporting and recordkeeping Quality assurance planning and oversight Future liabilities Environmental cleanup, removal, and remedial actions Personal injury Health risks and public insults More stringent compliance requirements Infation Less tangible Consumer reaction and loss of investor confdence Employee relations Lines of credit (establishing and extending) Property values Insurance premiums and insurability Greater regulatory oversight (frequency, intensiveness, onus) Penalties Rapport and leverage with regulators Adapted from: Ref. 16. resulted in the savings of the plating solution and reduction in the volume of waste generated. Pollution prevention has the distinct advantage over stack controls in that most of the time the company not VI. THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 32. SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES only eliminates or greatly reduces the release of hazardous materials, and may also reduce energy requirements. The potential for future costs and liabilities weigh heavily on decisions about air pollution prevention and control. Indeed, solving an air pollution problem is a systems problem. Removing a contaminant from the gas stream, only to have be concentrated in solid or liquid phase, must include a plan for addressing this new problem, i.e. where and how to handle this new hazardous wastes. Additionally, there are intangible benefts, such as employee relations, occupational safety, and trust from the public. A company or departmental ethos must be one of stewardship and concern for the next generations. Green engineering and sustainable approaches to prevent air pollution must be part of that ethos.

The mayor of a city in northern Ontario, Canada, is recommending the city change its fuel from conventional diesel for its 10 buses to B100 biodiesel.

Is he correct? 24. On average, a city\u2019s buses currently emit 2.2 g km 1 CO, 0.5 g km 1 of hydrocarbons, and 0.2 g km 1 PM.

THE FUTURE FOR AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 33 Grand Challenges 33.1 INTRODUCTION The number of \u201cexperts\u201d in air pollution in the middle of the twentieth century was quite small. Indeed, they likely would not have even referred to themselves as air pollution experts; preferring to be called meteorologist, engineer, physicist, chemist, or earth scientist. The disciplines of atmospheric science and more specifically, those of the atmospheric physicist or chemist or environmental engineer, have grown in expertise and confdence exponentially since the frst edition of this book. In the years since, the information on air quality and knowledge of how and why the atmosphere becomes polluted have allowed for continuously improving decisions that have led to a much cleaner atmosphere. Air pollution was a seemingly intractable problem for most of the developed world in the twentieth century. The improvement has been remarkable, especially for the health-related criteria air pollutants. More recently, substantial and sustained progress has also been made in decreasing atmospheric concentrations of hazardous air pollutants, i.e. the air toxics. Unfortunately, much of this progress has been in the developed and richest parts of the world. Millions of people live in the developing and poorer parts of the world that have seen little improvement. Indeed, in those countries with the fastest growing economies and increasing industrialization, the problems have worsened dramatically. In fact, these growing economies in many instances are retracing the steps taken by the United States, Japan, and Europe during the petrochemical revolution after the Second World War, which led to so many pollution problems, episodes, and disasters. In 2008, the US National Academy of Engineering announced the \u201cGrand Challenges\u201d facing the engineering profession in the twenty-frst century. The 14 challenges fall into four themes that are essential for humankind: sustainability, health, reducing vulnerability, and enhancing the joy of living. The Academy\u2019s list of challenges included a wide range of goals that engineers can help to meet.1 Improving and sustaining environmental quality is a key part of almost every challenge. Addressing air pollution is a direct need for several of the challenges, e.g. designing means of managing the hydrologic, nitrogen, and carbon biogeochemical cycles (see Chapters 20, 21, and 22). Air pollution science and engineering have their own grand challenges for this century. Some are scientifc and technical. Some are policy-driven and political. Some are educational and informational. There are challenges at every scale, with threats ranging from those causing harm to an individual cell to those endangering living things on the entire planet. Cancer is an example of the former. Climate change is an example of the latter. All of the challenges are, in a way, responses to a moral imperative to protect the health and wellbeing of humans, to sustain a livable environment, and to protect the quality of ecosystems. In mere decades, the cadres of air pollution experts have been blessed in being able to witness the remarkable paradigm shift in attitudes from almost complete exploitation to empathy. Unfortunately, many of these same experts are frustrated in what seems de\u00b4ja` vu in other parts of the world, with tradeoffs between clean air and growing economies. This is particularly frustrating in that this is actually often a false choice. The transition of air quality strategies from \u201ccommand and control\u201d to pollution prevention to sustainable and regenerative approaches belies the belief that economic improvement must be accompanied by a modicum of environmental damage. Indeed, one of the great thermodynamic lessons of sustainable design and life cycle perspectives is that pollution is almost always an indication of wastefulness and ineffciency. If something is leaking out of a vessel or exiting a stack, it has gone from being a resource to becoming a pollutant.", "One means of avoiding the mistakes of the past in these growing economies is to apply the lessons learned that have led to substantial improvement of air quality in the West. The growth in reliable data and information has fueled the expansion of scientifc and engineering knowledge and, yes, even wisdom. This all needs to be shared with those nations that are in the process of Fundamentals of Air Pollution 953 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00032-3 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved 33. GRAND CHALLENGES repeating the missteps. This is the frst grand challenge for the air pollution scientifc community. 33.2 GRAND CHALLENGE #1: SHARED KNOWLEDGE OF LESSONS LEARNED The information age is either rife with Pandora\u2019s Boxes or treasure troves, depending on one\u2019s perception and the topic at hand. For the air pollution expert, it is endowed with treasure troves. What would have taken months to transfer technologies across the oceans via meetings, symposia, conferences, and on-site visits, can now be shared in nanoseconds via the Internet. Another asset is the international air quality science community that has grown substantially from the middle of the previous century to present day. As air pollution knowledge has grown, so has the willingness of the science pioneers to share their expertise and technologies. Throughout the last quarter of the twentieth century, emerging technologies were shared among Western nations, with Eastern Europe and the previous Soviet Union states, and with south Asia and with many other parts of the world, notwithstanding the geopolitical obstacles and cultural differences. a These transfers included exponential advances in the state-of-the science in both conventional pollutants and air toxics. The advances must continue and increase to address the air pollution problems throughout the world, but with sensitivity to the socioeconomics and uniqueness of other cultures. For example, many of the new applications and sensors work well only within a strong telecommunications network, which is not universally available. This leads to the next grand challenge. 33.3 GRAND CHALLENGE #2: EXTENDING AIR POLLUTION INFORMATION Computational tools have grown rapidly. Data on air pollutant concentrations, air pollution exposures, and health status of populations and individuals can be mined to provide insights that were simply not possible before. Informatic tools are available to interpret data and to observe patterns of air pollutants to make heretofore impossible associations with effects on humans and ecosystems. Computational methods are being applied to fuid dynamics, toxicology, and other sciences to build models that explain the movement and change of pollutants, to assess potential exposures, and to explain the kinetics and dynamics of these pollutants and their metabolites in humans and other organisms. Computational and informatics tools can also be applied in new ways to inform and to select options for controlling the emissions, including the expected change to ambient air quality with each option. Better statistical tools are also needed to compare options, e.g. Bayesian approaches that update outcomes (i.e. posterior distributions) with various control strategies. Spatiotemporal tools are also becoming increasingly reliable. Air pollution curricula are increasing the use of geographic information systems, geostatistical methods (e.g. kriging), and land use regression techniques. Such tools can be very useful in preliminary screening of air pollution exposures and in linking potential sources to measured concentrations. All of these tools already exist, but they need to continue to be ftted to air pollution needs. This may be particularly challenging for complicated mixtures, e.g. urban air toxics and coke oven emissions, as well as real-world indoor pollutant mixtures. These tools are only now being applied to human activities and the use of products. Such psychosocial predictions are diffcult given the many variables of humans in various microenvironments, but this is a much better depiction of how a person comes into contact with an air pollutant compared to the commonly used measures of a population\u2019s central tendencies (e.g. means and medians). This brings up the next grand challenge, i.e. addressing indoor and microenvironmental exposures to air pollutants. 33.4 GRAND CHALLENGE #3: NEED TO CHARACTERIZE REAL-WORLD EXPOSURES It is tempting to conclude that the measurements of a few air pollutants at a few hundred monitoring sites accurately explain air pollution. Indeed, these are a great improvement over having no such sites, or a few that have been sited near a likely source of a known pollutant or in a highly polluted urban area. However, these measurements are dedicated mainly to criteria pollutants and to a handful of the many possible hazardous air pollutants.", "Even if the data were accurate and representative of ambient air, this would not represent a person\u2019s actual a Robert Stevens, a prolifc air pollution expert formerly with the U.S. EPA, recounted how two scientists from a Baltic nation were clandestinely able to develop a method for measuring airborne mercury, basically in their \u201cgarage\u201d. VI. THE FUTURE OF AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 33.5 GRAND CHALLENGE #4: IMPROVEMENTS AND ADAPTATIONS TO CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES exposure. For this, measurements are needed in each place and for each activity for that person every day. Thus, there is a need for measurements of pollutants indoors, in vehicles and in other microenvironments that can be aggregated to show the entire pollutant exposure profle for the individual. This calls for improved sensors, e.g. passive monitors, and applications (e.g. tablet and smart phone programs). From these databases, more reliable models can be built. These models must account for at least three modes of personal exposure: (1) outdoor, which is quite likely different from the measurements at a central site, given micrometeorology and nearby sources; (2) indoor, which is a function of indoor sources and penetration of outdoor concentrations; and (3) other microenvironments, each with its own air pollution loading and mixing terms. Indoor exposures to air pollutants in poorer regions can be at much higher concentrations than in those in higher socioeconomic status (SES) areas. For example, more wood and biomass fueled cooking and heating occur indoors in lower SES areas in many parts of the world. These can be large sources of particulate matter, carbon monoxide and air toxics, such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Thus, a highly exposed population is less likely to have the means to provide accurate measurements with today\u2019s technologies. Interestingly, the challenge will probably need advances in both very low-tech and very high-tech portable, remote measurement systems. The existing system of collecting a sample and conducting laboratory analysis may not work well for remote areas. This calls for low-maintenance adaptive technologies (e.g. passive monitors with no need for a pump) and low-maintenance high-technology systems (e.g. solar powered, long-life battery powered systems, with satellite links). Sophisticated analyses, e.g. organic chemical analysis, will have to be conducted in many of these areas using portable and open-path technologies. These are currently in use, but are limited in the number of chemicals detected and have transport and other logistical challenges, which will need to be improved for wider use. The next challenge is how to use these more reliable data to improve air quality. 33.5 GRAND CHALLENGE #4: IMPROVEMENTS AND ADAPTATIONS TO CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES Measuring and modeling of what is in the air is very important, but only the beginning. When something harmful is found in the air, the logical question is what can be done to decrease these concentrations to a \u201csafe\u201d level. Thus, helping emerging nations document air quality using the proven measurement and modeling must be followed by improved means of treatment and removal of myriad compounds in air emissions. Actually, this can be said for every nation, especially for air toxics. As detection limits decrease, it becomes more likely that additional troublesome air pollutants will be found in what was before considered to be relatively unpolluted air. The sources of both criteria and hazardous air pollutants are expected to continue and likely to increase in many parts of the world. For example, it is presently unlikely that the emerging nations will diminish the use of coal in the coming decades. Indeed, the use is likely to increase. Thus, the typical pollutants released during the combustion of coal, including mercury and sulfur dioxide, will increase in concentrations in many of the world\u2019s most populated urban areas. Of course, the technologies for removing particulate and gaseous pollutants discussed in Chapters 31 and 32 can and should be applied in China, India, and other regions with increasing coal combustion. Even if the stationary sources burning coal and other fossil fuels in these areas comply with regulated and recommended control technologies, this is likely to be insuffcient to ensure healthful air quality given the large and rapidly growing number of mobile sources (i.e. vehicles) and the highly distributive system of heating and other combustion sources in these countries. In most of Europe, Japan, and North America, heating is often by electricity from centralized, stationary sources that burn coal. Thus, control technologies against coal\u2019s pollutants can be applied at the power plant.", "In many other countries, coal and other combustibles are burned at myriad buildings throughout the region. Control technologies in these cases would have to be at the point-of-use, which would be much more diffcult to install, to maintain, and to ensure compliance. This calls for adapting and miniaturizing successful large-scale stationary sources. In addition, these must be low-maintenance, long-lasting, and cost-effective. Another important aspect of this challenge is building a knowledge base on when and how to intervene when pollution occurs. This is akin to an anthropological approach, where the air pollution scientist or engineer places himself or herself into the setting. For example, if in the process of studying a neighborhood for possible sources of air pollution, an air pollution expert who observes exposures or potential exposures could recommend control and prevention methods on the spot, e.g. installation of air cleaning equipment or training on furnace and stove maintenance or reductions in sources of pollutants like lead from paint. It is proper for scientists, especially research scientists, to keep an arms-length relationship to maintain VI. THE FUTURE OF AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 33. GRAND CHALLENGES objectivity and validity of fndings. However, addressing an immediate indoor or other microenvironmental exposure and recommending avoidance behaviors to reduce exposure takes primacy over data quality. 33.6 GRAND CHALLENGE #5: SYSTEMS AND SUSTAINABLE THINKING Human populations and ecosystems are highly complex. They are threatened by complicated and multifaceted hazards. Thus, they must be viewed systematically. Every hazard exists within a milieu of life cycles. Every substance released into the environment has a life cycle. It is during this life cycle that the substance has become a pollutant. The process can be likened to a sensitivity analysis, i.e. identifying and giving weights to the factors that lead to an outcome, i.e. greater weighted factors will change the outcome more dramatically than will lesser weighted factors. For example, if one particular species of plant is eliminated from a habitat, the weight of the loss of that species would be very high if it were the exclusive prey of a predator. Its weight would be lower if all the consumers in the niche were not selective in their prey. Such sensitivities can be documented for any habitat and be part of any vulnerability assessment prior to stresses and certainly before these stresses reach disaster thresholds. Unfortunately, there will undoubtedly be future air pollution problems that are not presently foreseen. Preventing or ameliorating them when they happen is an exercise in prediction. Models are used to predict an event or series of events. The processes that led to an actual environmental problem are diffcult enough to identify completely; but predicting how events in the causal chain will interrelate is impossible to predict with much accuracy. Identifying the factors that have contributed to the occurrence of air pollution problem is complicated. Indeed, the interaction of variables that lead to an environmental problem is almost always chaotic. Few credible information sources are available about what was occurring during/at any given period of time. Almost always, measured data are not suffcient to characterize the movement and change of materials in the environment in a way that fully explains air pollution; so scientists and engineers must rely on models to extrapolate and interpolate to fnd meaning. Global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Numerous toxic compounds continue to be released. Risks to human health persist. Sensitive ecosystems are threatened. As mentioned, such problems are not readily nor completely resolved by the \u201ccommand and control\u201d approaches. Innovations and market forces (e.g. incentives and emissions banking and trading) must also be part of the solution. Hopefully, this book is among the resources for preserving and extending what we have learned in the past few decades. Ideally, it is also a baseline for the next generation of air pollution prevention and control systems. The problems will best be addressed by new thinking that is underpinned by sound science. The fundamentals of air pollution are based in the physical sciences, but their application to address present and future air pollution problems must also rely on the innovations from every aspect of contemporary society.", "Philosopher Immanuel Kant is famous for the categorical imperative, which says that the right thing to do requires that a person must \u201c.act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law\u201d.2 In other words, in deciding whether an act is right or wrong, it is our duty to think about what would happen if everyone acted in the same way. This should sound familiar to those of us concerned about the environment and public health. In fact, it is the essence of sustainability. The only way to ensure that something is protected for the future is to think through all of the possible outcomes and select only those that will sustain a better world. Kant\u2019s imperative is the rationale that underpins environmental mottos and quotations: \u0081 Think globally, act locally. \u0081 We are not going to be able to operate our spaceship earth successfully nor for much longer unless we see it as a whole spaceship and our fate as common. It has to be everybody or nobody. (R. Buckminster Fuller) \u0081 Now, as never before, the old phrase has a literal meaning: We are all in the same boat. (Jacques Cousteau) \u0081 When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he fnds it attached to the rest of the world. (John Muir) \u0081 A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise. (Aldo Leopold) \u0081 Nothing ever goes away. (Barry Commoner) \u0081 Only within the moment of time represented by the present century has one speciesdmandacquired signifcant power to alter the nature of his world. (Rachel Carson) The philosopher gives us reasons to act, but the scientist and engineer must give us credible ways to act. The air pollution expert now requires a deep understanding of systems that operate once the design is implemented and, ideally, forms a foundation for the exploration and discovery of innovative ways to minimize risks to health VI. THE FUTURE OF AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 33.7 GRAND CHALLENGE #6: TRANSDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE and safety, increase design reliability, and improve the environment. With a better understanding of sustainable processes, new stewardship strategies will emerge to supplant old ways of thinking, especially replacing those antiquated templates that depend on the subjugation of nature to achieve human ends. Actually, it may not be correct to classify these approaches as \u201cnew\u201d, since it was only within the past couple of centuries that we abandoned many sustainable views of how humans are to care for the environment. A quick perusal of the words of Saint Francis of Assisi or Chief Seattle remind us of this responsibility. Understanding air quality depends on a foundation in the laws of thermodynamics and motion. All engineering and science curricula are built on this foundation. It is encouraging that over the past few decades, air pollution strategies have become more integrated. Simply shifting an air pollutant from the atmosphere to the hydrosphere is neither a systematic nor a sustainable solution. This is done, for example, when arsenic, mercury or another toxic substance is removed from the gas stream, caught in a slurry, which is then regularly delivered to a pit or pile. This may indeed be the best approach in terms of air pollution, but the sustainable approach would also address the new, more concentrated As-or Hg-laden slurry. The good news is that multicompartmental solutions are happening and must continue.b Fewer experts draw a \u201cbright line\u201d that considers the job completed once the pollutant leaves the atmosphere. 33.7 GRAND CHALLENGE #6: TRANSDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE The motivation behind the systematic view and the sustainability framework is actually quite familiar to engineers, even if the terms themselves are not. Both are manifestations of the \u201ccritical path\u201d and \u201creverse engineering\u201d. The critical path is used by designers to ensure that all the necessary steps are included in the fow toward the completed design. Even a problem with a seemingly small step in this path can mean failure. Delays in any of the critical components can propagate to a level in which the design is threatened in quality or the design objectives are compromised or missed. The \u201cperfect\u201d design is worthless if it is too late to matter. Reverse engineering is simply the critical path in reverse.", "It is a structured way to keep the end in mind and to ascertain all the steps that have led to a success or failure. In addition, reverse engineering shows which steps are essential, which steps are desirable but not necessarily essential (e.g. improving timeliness or quality, but their absence does not truncate the critical path), which steps are unnecessary and which steps are counterproductive. Interestingly, many things scientists and engineers do fall outside of the frst two types. Often, however, the steps that are unnecessary from a scientifc standpoint may well be essential and desirable from a policy or feasibility standpoint. For example, if control technology X has a 95% removal effciency and control technology Z\u2019s removal effciency is 90% for the same air pollutant, there is no technical need to justify choosing control technology X. However, if the cost is prohibitively higher, X may not be chosen, unless it is the only way to meet emission limits. The systems view even affects the critical path. In the example above, if the more effcient technology is less costly, that would be ideal from an air pollution control perspective. However, if this technology leads to the generation of a hazardous waste that is very diffcult and costly to handle, store, and reuse, this would detract from this option. Indeed, the generation of the waste is an example of a step that is counterproductive to achieve a sustainable solution to the air pollution problem. Systems scientists are now comfortable with reaching out to other scientifc disciplines in their research. Indeed, that is the essence of systems science. Similarly, practitioners are becoming more comfortable with such multidisciplinary efforts, e.g. systems engineering and systems medicine that include all of the physical, chemical, and biological sciences. As evidence, recent Nobel prizes and other science awards have been shared among physicists, chemists, engineers, and physicians. Including nontechnical stakeholders in the critical path is more challenging. Often, however, a step that appears to be technically \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201ccounterproductive\u201d may actually be essential from a feasibility and implementation perspective. Such steps obviously will not change the scientifc principles, but will be needed to educate and involve those affected by the design. The step also helps to ensure that technically feasible options are also culturally appropriate. For example, the best place to site a noisy piece of air pollution equipment from an emissions standpoint may not be the best place from a neighborhood quality standpoint, or a chain link b As this book went to print, North Carolina was addressing a massive spill in to the Dan River. Its source was one of several large coal ash piles near power plants. Arsenic and heavy metals were found in the water; not surprising, since ash remains after the volatile components are emitted during combustion. Thus, ash is actually a means of \u201crefning\u201d the coal\u2019s metals and metalloids, which will be mobilized either slowly (e.g. leaching into ground water) or rapdly (e.g. a spill into the adjacent river). VI. THE FUTURE OF AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 33. GRAND CHALLENGES fence may be a perfectly acceptable barrier between industrial operations and residences from an access perspective, but not aesthetically. The truly unnecessary steps that occur during air pollution prevention and control efforts can be limited or eliminated by monitoring the critical paths. The key question is always, \u201cIs this the best and only step to meet this sub-objective on the path to the fnal objective, e.g. an emission limit?\u201d A corollary question would be, \u201cIf a previous step were changed, would this step even be needed to meet the objective?\u201d Thus, future solutions to air pollution will increasingly rely on multidisciplinary teams. These teams will have to go beyond each member simply providing information to a team lead. They must be \u201ctransdisciplinary\u201d. That is, each member retains the knowledge of his or her feld, but actually works across and beyond this discipline. Transdisciplinary teams include every necessary scientifc discipline, plus other nontechnical stakeholders, so that the solutions automatically are systematic.3 This prevents the need to have to translate and adapt the scientifcally sound approach, i.e. \u201cretroft\u201d the solution to accommodate cultural, social, economic, and other perspectives. The transdisciplinary team will have already designed the solution accordingly. This is particularly crucial when trying to adapt a design or technology that works well in one culture to another cultural setting. Indeed, this was a major faw that led to the Bhopal toxic plume disaster (see discussion in Chapter 4).", "For the disaster to occur, there had to be several essential steps leading to the explosion and emission of the toxin, e.g. critical mass of chemical product, an overflled reserve tank and possibly even sabotage. The damage incurred by the disaster was exacerbated by other cultural factors, especially a lack of appreciation of squatting and allowing so many people to build makeshift housing so near the factory, which increased the magnitude and duration of their exposure to the toxin. Any failsafe mechanism and control technology can only work well with hands-on management, which always exists within a specifc social milieu and context. In the Bhopal case, the context included cultural differences that obviated a suffcient understanding of the written and unwritten codes of Western civilization (e.g. safety manuals written only in English; different perspectives of land ownership and squatting). The lesson here is that when control technologies and other air pollution strategies are adopted and adapted in different cultural settings, air pollution experts will need to appreciate that what is the standard of practice in one country or state is likely to be at least somewhat different in another. Of course, this does not allow the practitioner to violate any of his or her codes of ethics or other professional canons and standards, but it does mean that a \u201cone size fts all\u201d solution will not work without at least some customization in other settings. 33.8 GRAND CHALLENGE #7: TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE In addition to the synergies of a transdisciplinary team approach, the scientifc fundamentals of air pollution have to be translated to be understood by various audiences. Translational science is a metaphorical two-way street. Science from one discipline is translated to others for some common purpose. In return, the common purpose advances the specifc discipline. For example, biochemistry contributes to medicine and ecology, which help to explain concepts and to enhance hypotheses and models that would be restricted by pure reductionism. Explaining lung cancer, for example, needs not only reductionist biochemistry (e.g. DNAepollutant interactions), but also the contribution of reductionist physics (e.g. diffusion into the cell), reductionist mechanics (e.g. respiratory responses), and other assimilations of \u201cpure\u201d science. In return, each of these felds advances with enhancements to the understanding of genetic molecular structures and substitutions, biochemical gradients, respiration mechanics, etc. that could not be understood outside of this translational system. Social and cultural factors are usually more complex than physical and biological scientifc factors. For example, the uncertain, yet looming threat of global climate change can be attributed in part to technological and industrial progress. But using straight-line trends or even sophisticated climatological models will be insuffcient to predict the extent and degree of damage. The number of variables necessary to defne climate is so large and the interrelationships among them so complex, even the highly advanced computational methods and climatological models have large uncertainties when used to predict climate change. Even more complicated are the predictions of human behavior and decision making. For example, to what extent will future people engage in avoidance behaviors, such as spending more time indoors, exposing them to different array of pollutants? How will human populations respond to any shifts of insect vector-borne diseases? How will companies respond to emission reductions in their siting decisions? The good news is that emergent technologies are beginning to assuage some of the contributing factors, e.g. improvements to alternative sources of energy, such as wind and solar, which in turn could lead to less global demand for fossil fuels. Conversely, these same factors could lead to complacencies or even lead to other, previously unknown and unexpected VI. THE FUTURE OF AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 33.8 GRAND CHALLENGE #7: TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE environmental problems, e.g. changes in migratory patterns if wind turbines interfere with bird habitats.4 For centuries, societal momentum has been toward urbanization and increasing the size of economies, which is indicated by higher rates of industrial output. Society also demands the control of the consequences caused by these same endeavors, including air pollution emission limits after the fact. These seemingly conficting demands are often quite rational at a personal level. For example, radiation is both a cause and a cure for cancer. Advances in radioisotope technology are part of the arsenal to treat cancer, but exposure to these same radioactive wastes leaving hospitals can increase the risk of contracting cancer.", "Likewise, cleanup of polluted waters and sediments can be accomplished using combustion and incineration to break down some very persistent contaminants, but combustion in general is problematic in its release of products of complete combustion (carbon dioxide) or incomplete combustion (e.g. dioxins, furans, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide). In almost every discussion in this book, air pollution has emerged as a byproduct of an enterprise that is deemed useful and is in demand, at least for some period of time, by large sectors of the population. This apparent dichotomy between societal aspirations and problems calls for advances in science and technology. Unfortunately, these very same technologies may lead to a whole new set of problems.5 Sting, the singere philosopher, sums up this dichotomy as his having never seen a \u201cmiracle of science that did not go from a blessing to a curse\u201d.6 While the lyrics are apparently intended to be overly pessimistic, e.g. it is likely that Sting uses electricity, wireless communications, nanotechnologies, and other miracles of science that not so long ago seemed impossible, his sentiments are instructive. Every technological advancement has some degree of uncertainty and the potential for downstream problems. Cross-cultural transport of environmental problems is continuing and growing in certain parts of the globe. For example, computer materials and other wastes are shipped from the Western Hemisphere to Bangladesh for recycling that exposes unprotected workers to contaminants at extraordinarily high concentrations of pollutants; well above levels acceptable in the West. Beyond moral problems associated with such practices, this is also a reminder of the interconnectedness of all people. This is evident in the banning of substances. A number of pesticides, including DDT, have been banned in Europe, Canada, and the United States. People in the West, however, continue to be exposed to several of these substances by importing food that has been grown where these pesticides are not banned. In fact, Western nations may still allow the pesticides to be formulated at home, but do not allow their application and use. So, the pesticide comes back in the imported products; known as the \u201ccircle of poisons\u201d. In addition to products, these very persistent and toxic substances also fnd their way back to the banning nations from long-range atmospheric transport and residual concentrations in the food chain. Products that contain dangerous materials like asbestos, lead, mercury, polybrominated compounds, and polychlorinated biphenyls were once considered acceptable and were even required by law or policy to protect the public safety and health, such as asbestos-containing and polybrominated materials to prevent fres; DDT, and other persistent pesticides for vector control in an effort to prevent disease; and methyl tert-butyl ether as a fuel additive to prevent air pollution. Subsequently, these products were all found to cause environmental and health problems. Global problems include climate change, acid rain, and the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. They affect everyone on the planet to some degree. The good news is that nations have been reasonably successful in improvements in several cross-boundary problems. Notably, the United States has decreased emissions of acid-forming pollutants that have harmed ecosystems in Canada and Scandinavia. Most of the world has banned and required substitutes for ozone-depleting substances, like the most chemically active chlorofuorocarbons. There have been dramatic decreases in lead emissions from vehicles, frst in developed economies and increasingly in developing nations. Western nations have taken actions that have lowered the emissions or at least the rate of increase of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Europe has made substantial reductions in GHG emissions and the US has slowed the rate of growth of these emissions. Unfortunately, even if all countries meet their most ambitious formal commitments, there will still be a shortfall in emission reductions that would be needed to reduce climate change threats suffciently. Meanwhile, the mix of nations contributing has changed. Indeed, the West may soon no longer be the largest contributor to GHG emissions (see Figure 33.1).7 Developing countries generally emit CO2 at higher rates per unit of GDP than developed countries, especially if the share of forestry emissions is high (e.g. Brazil and Indonesia). The GHG emission rates, i.e. all GHGs combined and expressed as a CO2 equivalent, are growing at a rapid rate in China, India, Brazil, and Indonesia. Regarding CO2 specifcally, its emissions grew by 1.0 Gt from 2010 to 2011, or 3.2%. Coal accounted for 45% of total energy-related CO2 emissions in 2011, followed by oil (35%) and natural gas (20%).", "This yearly increase was 6.1% in countries outside the most developed economies, but was slightly offset by a 0.6% reduction in emissions by the developed nations. China was the VI. THE FUTURE OF AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 33. GRAND CHALLENGES FIGURE 33.1 Regional year 1990, 2005, 2010, and 2020 greenhouse gas emissions for G20 countries (and European Union countries as a group) that have made pledges to reduce emission. Emissions are reported in units of annual gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e per year). Carbon dioxide equivalents of non-CO2 gases are computed from the 100-year global warming potentials. Note: * \u00bc where available; ** \u00bc based on median of modeling results. Ref. 7. (For color version of this fgure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) biggest source of the global increase in emissions, i.e. 720 million tonnes (Mt) or an increase of 9.3%, primarily due to higher coal consumption. India\u2019s emissions grew by 140 Mt, or 8.7%, displacing Russia as the fourth largest emitter behind China, the United States, and the European Union. Despite these increases, per-capita CO2 emissions in China and India still remain just 63% and 15% of the CO2 released, respectively, of that released per-capita in the developed nations.8 Total CO2 emissions in the United States in 2011 fell by 92 Mt, or 1.7%, mainly due to fuel switching from coal to natural gas in power generation and a mild winter, which decreased demand for electrical auxiliary heating. US emissions fell by 430 Mt (7.7%) between 2006 and 2011, the largest reduction of all countries or regions, which can be linked to effciency improvements, higher oil prices, and the economic downturn leading to fewer vehicle miles traveled, along with a substantial shift from coal to gas in the power sector. CO2 emissions in the EU in 2011 were lower by 69 Mt, or 1.9%, due largely to the economic recession and attendant drop in industrial production and a relatively warm winter that reduced heating needs. By contrast, Japan\u2019s emissions increased by 28 Mt or 2.4%, as a result of a substantial increase in a switch from nuclear to fossil fuels for power generation due to taking the Fukushima plant off-line.9 The transfer of GHG and other pollutant control and prevention strategies among nations is complicated and dynamic, as indicated above. The grand challenge for the air pollution experts will be how to do this in a scientifcally sound and culturally effective way. 33.9 GRAND CHALLENGE #8: FUTURE GENERATIONS The previous discussion addressed distant peoples. Another challenge is to address the temporal aspect of sustainable air quality, i.e. future human populations and future ecosystems. There are two basic ways of achieving acceptable air quality, i.e. risk-based decision making and precaution-based decision making. Much of this book has been devoted to the former, i.e. use of scientifcally sound information to assess the risk and to use this assessment to select appropriate means of reducing that risk. Indeed, this is the major paradigm for conventional and hazardous air pollution control strategies. However, when the risks are highly uncertain and outcomes are substantial, severe, and potentially irreversible, then a modicum of precaution is needed beyond the confnes of the risk assessment process. Many scientists and policy makers have recommended taking the precautionary approach to climate change. That is, even if the data are uncertain, corrective actions that do not have suffcient risks themselves should be taken. The caveat is needed since corrective actions often have their own risks, e.g. fuel additives to improve air emissions but that have been subsequently found to damage other parts of the environment. Another aspect of future people is education. This book, for example, is a part of air pollution education within an engineering or science framework. However, air pollution education begins long before and continues well after formal education at the university level. This book also serves as a manual for careers after the formal education. However, there is a dearth of useful educational tools for the next generation, i.e. those before advanced placement high school courses. This need is not for lack of demand. The author has met with very young students (e.g. 3-year-old preschoolers), who have an amazing grasp of some very technical air pollution topics. For example, more than half of the control technologies discussed in this book addresses particulates. Young children understand texture (Figure 33.2). From this understanding, with some prodding and guidance, they can extrapolate this VI.", "THE FUTURE OF AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING knowledge to an understanding of the particles shown in Figure 3.2 in Chapter 3. The lesson here is that the fundamentals of air pollution can begin to be grasped and taught at increasingly complex levels from a very early age. New pedagogies are needed to reach presently ignored groups, especially those who are being exposed and will be exposed and who will be affected by the air quality decisions that are being made now. Thus, it is the hope of the author that the investment made by the reader will not only lead to cleaner air but also that the propagation of this expertise will expand to recruit the next generation of experts. Each generation is morally obligated to invest in the next. Certainly, their challenges will be great, but the author is convinced that today\u2019s 4-year olds will be the new experts to build on today\u2019s knowledge to realize opportunities for a cleaner environment that today\u2019s air pollution experts cannot even conceive. QUESTIONS 1. List three ways that science lessons learned in addressing air pollution can be transferred to developing countries. How about engineering lessons? Policy and regulatory lessons? 2. Consider how computational fuid dynamics has changed meteorology in recent years? How can similar computational methods in other sciences be used to estimate, predict, and address air pollution? 3. Since the highest levels of exposure to some of the most dangerous air pollutants occur indoors, how do means of decreasing exposures differ from those employed for the criteria air pollutants in ambient air? 4. Choose an environmental motto mentioned in this chapter. How does systems thinking relate to it? 5. What is the difference between multidisciplinary science and transdisciplinary science as they related to air pollution prevention and control? 6. Compare a risk-based approach to a precautionary approach to address global environmental and air pollution problems. Describe a problem best addressed with each. 7. Identify a pollution problem that the previous generation had thought would be diffcult or impossible to address, but which is now being addressed. Explain how the paradigm shifted. 8. Identify a pollution problem that is presently thought by many to be diffcult or impossible to address. How can the paradigm be shifted? References 1. National Academy of Engineering.
