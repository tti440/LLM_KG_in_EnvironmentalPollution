Once thought to have an almost unlimited buffering capacity against the perturbations of humankind, the geosphere is now known to be rather fragile and subject to harm from human activities. For example, some billions of tons of earth material are mined or otherwise disturbed each year in the extraction of minerals and coal. Two atmospheric pollutant phenomena\u2014excess carbon dioxide and acid rain (see Chapter 14)\u2014have the potential to cause major changes in the geosphere. Too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may cause global heating (\u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d), which could significantly alter rainfall patterns and turn currently productive areas of Earth into desert regions. The low pH characteristic of acid rain can bring about drastic changes in the solubilities and oxidation\u2013reduction rates of minerals. Erosion caused by intensive cultivation of land is washing away vast quantities of topsoil from fertile farmlands each year. In some areas of industrialized countries, the geosphere has been the dumping ground for toxic chemicals. Ultimately, the geosphere must provide disposal sites for the nuclear wastes of the more than 400 nuclear reactors that have operated worldwide. It may be readily seen that the preservation of the geosphere in a form suitable for human habitation is one of the greatest challenges facing humankind. The interface between the geosphere and the atmosphere at the Earth\u2019s surface is very important to the environment. Human activities on the Earth\u2019s surface may affect climate, most directly through the change of surface albedo, defined as the percentage of incident solar radiation refl ected by a land or water surface. For example, if the sun radiates 100 units of energy per minute to the outer limits of the atmosphere, and the Earth\u2019s surface receives 60 units per minute of the total, then reflects 30 units upward, the albedo is 50%. Some typical albedo values for different areas on the Earth\u2019s surface are: evergreen forests, 7-15%; dry, plowed fi elds, 10-15%; deserts, 25-35%; fresh snow, 85-90%; asphalt, 8%. In some heavily developed areas, anthropogenic (human- produced) heat release is comparable to the solar input. The anthropogenic energy release over the 60 km2 of Manhattan Island averages about four times the solar energy falling on the area; over the 3500 km2 of Los Angeles the anthropogenic energy release is about 13% of the solar fl ux. One of the greatest impacts of humans on the geosphere is the creation of desert areas through abuse of land with marginal amounts of rainfall. This process, called desertifi cation, is manifested by declining groundwater tables, salinization of topsoil and water, reduction of surface waters, unnaturally high soil erosion, and desolation of native vegetation. The problem is severe in some parts of the world, particularly Africa\u2019s Sahel (southern rim of the Sahara), where the Sahara advanced southward at a particularly rapid rate during the period 1968\u20131973, contributing to widespread starvation in Africa during the 1980s. Large, arid areas of the western United States are experiencing at least some desertification as the result of human activities and severe droughts. As the populations of the western United States increase, one of the greatest challenges facing the residents is to prevent additional conversion of land into desert. The most important part of the geosphere for life on Earth is soil. It is the medium upon which plants grow, and virtually all terrestrial organisms depend upon it for their existence. The productivity of soil is strongly affected by environmental conditions and pollutants. Because of the importance of soil, all of Chapter 16 is devoted to its environmental chemistry. With increasing population and industrialization, one of the more important aspects of human use of the geosphere has to do with the protection of water sources. Mining, agricultural, chemical, and radioactive wastes all have the potential for contaminating both surface water and groundwater. Sewage sludge spread on land may contaminate water by release of nitrate and heavy metals. Landfills may likewise be sources of contamination. Leachates from unlined pits and lagoons containing hazardous liquids or sludges may pollute drinking water. It should be noted, however, that many soils have the ability to assimilate and neutralize pollutants. Various chemical and biochemical phenomena in soils operate to reduce the harmful nature of pollutants. These phenomena include oxidation\u2013reduction processes, hydrolysis, acid\u2013base reactions, precipitation, sorption, and biochemical degradation.", "Some hazardous organic chemicals may be degraded to harmless products on soil, and heavy metals may be sorbed by it. In general, however, extreme care should be exercised in disposing of chemicals, sludges, and other potentially hazardous materials on soil, particularly where there is a possibility of water contamination. 15.2 THE NATURE OF SOLIDS IN THE GEOSPHERE Earth is divided into layers, including the solid iron-rich inner core, molten outer core, mantle, and crust. Environmental chemistry is most concerned with the lithosphere, which consists of the outer mantle and the crust. The crust is the Earth\u2019s outer skin that is accessible to humans. It is extremely thin compared to the Earth\u2019s diameter, ranging from 5 to 40 km thick. Most of the solid earth crust consists of rocks. Rocks are composed of minerals, where a mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic solid with a definite internal crystal structure and chemical composition. A rock is a solid, cohesive mass of pure mineral or an aggregate of two or more minerals. 15.2.1 STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MINERALS The combination of two characteristics is unique to a particular mineral. These characteristics are a defined chemical composition, as expressed by the mineral\u2019s chemical formula, and a specifi c crystal structure. The crystal structure of a mineral refers to the way in which the atoms are arranged relative to each other. It cannot be determined from the appearance of visible crystals of the mineral, but requires structural methods such as x-ray structure determination. Different minerals may have the same chemical composition, or they may have the same crystal structure, but may not be identical for truly different minerals. Physical properties of minerals can be used to classify them. The characteristic external appearance of a pure crystalline mineral is its crystal form. Because of space constraints on the ways that minerals grow, the pure crystal form of a mineral is often not expressed. Color is an obvious characteristic that can vary widely due to the presence of impurities. The appearance of a mineral surface in reflected light describes its luster, which may be metallic, partially metallic (submetallic), vitreous (like glass), dull or earthy, resinous, or pearly. The color observed when a mineral is rubbed across an unglazed porcelain plate is known as streak. Hardness is expressed on the Mohs scale, which ranges from 1 to 10 and is based upon 10 minerals that vary from talc, hardness 1, to diamond, hardness 10. Cleavage denotes the manner in which minerals break along planes and the angles in which these planes intersect. For example, mica cleaves to form thin sheets. Most minerals fracture irregularly, although some fracture along smooth curved surfaces or into fibers or splinters. Specifi c gravity\u2014density relative to that of water\u2014is another important physical characteristic of minerals. 15.2.2 KINDS OF MINERALS Although over 2000 minerals are known, only about 25 rock-forming minerals make up most of the Earth\u2019s crust.1 The nature of these minerals may be better understood with a knowledge of the elemental composition of the crust. Oxygen and silicon make up 49.5% and 25.7% by mass of the Earth\u2019s crust, respectively. Therefore, most minerals are silicates such as quartz, SiO2, or orthoclase, KAlSi3O8. In descending order of abundance; the other elements in the Earth\u2019s crust are aluminum (7.4%), iron (4.7%), calcium (3.6%), sodium (2.8%), potassium (2.6%), magnesium (2.1%), and other (1.6%). Table 15.1 summarizes the major kinds of minerals in the Earth\u2019s crust. Secondary minerals are formed by alteration of parent mineral matter. Clays are silicate minerals, usually containing aluminum, that constitute one of the most significant classes of secondary minerals. Olivine, augite, hornblende, and feldspars all form clays. Clays are discussed in detail in Section 15.7. 15.2.3 EVAPORITES Evaporites are soluble salts that precipitate from a solution under special arid conditions, commonly as the result of the evaporation of seawater. The most common evaporite is halite, NaCl. Other simple evaporite minerals are sylvite (KCl), thenardite (Na2SO4), and anhydrite (CaSO4). Many evaporites are hydrates, including bischofi te (MgCl2 \u22c5 6H2O), gypsum (CaSO4 \u22c5 2H2O), kieserite (MgSO4 \u22c5 H2O), and epsomite (MgSO4 \u22c5 7H2O). Double salts, such as carnallite (KMgCl3 \u22c5 6H2O), kainite (KMgClSO4 \u22c5 114 H2O), glaserite (K3Na(SO4)2), polyhalite (K2MgCa2(SO4)4 \u22c5 2H2O), and loeweite (Na12Mg7(SO4)13 \u22c5 15H2O), are very common in evaporites. The precipitation of evaporites from marine and brine sources depends upon a number of factors. Prominent among these are the concentrations of the evaporite ions in the water and the solubility products of the evaporite salts.", "The presence of a common ion decreases solubility; for example, CaSO4 is precipitated more readily from brine containing Na2SO4 than from a solution containing no other source of sulfate. The presence of other salts that do not have a common ion increases solubility because it decreases activity coefficients. Differences in temperature result in signifi cant differences in solubility. TABLE 15.1 Major Mineral Groups in the Earth\u2019s Crust Mineral Group Examples Formula Silicates Quartz SiO2 Olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 Potassium feldspar KAlSi3O8 Oxides Corundum Al2O3 Magnetite Fe3O4 Carbonates Calcite CaCO3 Dolomite CaCO3 \u22c5 MgCO3 Sulfi des Pyrite FeS2 Galena PbS Sulfates Gypsum CaSO4 \u22c5 2H2O Halides Halite NaCl Fluorite CaF2 Native elements Copper Cu Sulfur S The nitrate deposits that occur in the hot and extraordinarily dry regions of northern Chile are chemically unique because of the stability of highly oxidized nitrate salts. The dominant salt, which has been mined for its nitrate content for use in explosives and fertilizers, is Chile saltpeter, NaNO3. Traces of highly oxidized CaCrO4 and Ca(ClO4)2 are also encountered in these deposits, and some regions contain enough Ca(IO3)2 to serve as a commercial source of iodine. 15.2.4 VOLCANIC SUBLIMATES A number of mineral substances are gaseous at the magmatic temperatures of volcanoes and are mobilized with volcanic gases. These kinds of substances condense near the mouths of volcanic fumaroles and are called sublimates. Elemental sulfur is a common sublimate. Some oxides, particularly of iron and silicon, are deposited as sublimates. Most other sublimates consist of chloride and sulfate salts. The cations most commonly involved are monovalent cations of ammonium ion, sodium, and potassium; magnesium; calcium; aluminum; and iron. Fluoride and chloride sublimates are sources of gaseous HF and HCl formed by their reactions at high temperatures with water, such as the following: 2H2O + SiF4 \u2192 4HF + SiO2 (15.1) 15.2.5 IGNEOUS, SEDIMENTARY, AND METAMORPHIC ROCK At elevated temperatures deep beneath the Earth\u2019s surface, rocks and mineral matter melt to produce a molten substance called magma. Cooling and solidification of magma produces igneous rock. Common igneous rocks include granite, basalt, quartz (SiO2), pyroxene ((Mg,Fe)SiO3), feldspar ((Ca,Na,K)AlSi3O8), olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4), and magnetite (Fe3O4). Igneous rocks are formed under water-deficient, chemically reducing conditions of high temperature and high pressure. Exposed igneous rocks are under wet, oxidizing, low-temperature, and low-pressure conditions. Since such conditions are the opposite of those conditions under which igneous rocks were formed, they are not in chemical equilibrium with their surroundings when they become exposed. As a result, such rocks disintegrate by a process called weathering. Weathering tends to be slow because igneous rocks are often hard, nonporous, and of low reactivity. Erosion from wind, water, or glaciers picks up materials from weathering rocks and deposits it as sediments or soil. A process called lithifi cation describes the conversion of sediments to sedimentary rocks. In contrast to the parent igneous rocks, sediments and sedimentary rocks are porous, soft, and chemically reactive. Heat and pressure convert sedimentary rock into metamorphic rock. Sedimentary rocks may be detrital rocks consisting of solid particles eroded from igneous rocks as a consequence of weathering; quartz is the most likely to survive weathering and transport from its original location chemically intact. A second kind of sedimentary rocks consists of chemical sedimentary rocks produced by the precipitation or coagulation of dissolved or colloidal weathering products. Organic sedimentary rocks contain residues of plant and animal remains. Carbonate minerals of calcium and magnesium\u2014limestone or dolomite\u2014are especially abundant in sedimentary rocks. Important examples of sedimentary rocks are the following: \u2022 Sandstone produced from sand-sized particles of minerals such as quartz \u2022 Conglomerates made up of relatively larger particles of variable size \u2022 Shale formed from very fine particles of silt or clay \u2022 Limestone, CaCO3, produced by the chemical or biochemical precipitation of calcium carbonate: Ca2++ CO32-\u2192 CaCO3(s) Ca2++ 2HCO3 + h\u03bd (algal photosynthesis) \u00c6 {CH2O} (biomass) + CaCO3(s) + O2(g) \u2022 Chert consisting of microcrystalline SiO2 Under heat and pressure, igneous rock deforms and recrystallizes 15.2.5.1 Rock Cycle The interchanges and conversions among igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks, as well as the processes involved therein, are described by the rock cycle. A rock of any of these three types may be changed to a rock of any other type. Or a rock of any of these three kinds may be changed to a different rock of the same general type in the rock cycle. The rock cycle is illustrated in Figure 15.1. 15.2.5.2 Stages of Weathering Weathering can be classifi ed into early, intermediate, and advanced stages.", "The stage of weathering to which a mineral is exposed depends upon time; chemical conditions, including exposure to air, carbon dioxide, and water; and physical conditions such as temperature and mixing with water and air. Reactive and soluble minerals such as carbonates, gypsum, olivine, feldspars, and iron(II)-rich substances can survive only early weathering. This stage is characterized by dry conditions, low leaching, absence of organic matter, reducing conditions, and limited time of exposure. Quartz, vermiculite, and smectites can survive the intermediate stage of weathering manifested by retention of silica, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and iron(II) not present in iron(II) oxides. These substances are mobilized in advanced-stage weathering, other characteristics of which are intense leaching by freshwater, low pH, oxidizing conditions [iron(II) \u2192 iron(III)], presence of hydroxy polymers of aluminum, and dispersion of silica. 15.3 PHYSICAL FORM OF THE GEOSPHERE The most fundamental aspect of the physical form of the geosphere has to do with the Earth\u2019s shape and dimensions. Earth is shaped as a geoid defined by a surface corresponding to the average sea level of the oceans and continuing as hypothetical sea levels under the continents. This shape is not a perfect sphere because of variations in the attraction of gravity at various places on the Earth\u2019s surface. This slight irregularity in shape is important in surveying to precisely determine the locations of points on the Earth\u2019s surface according to longitude, latitude, and elevation above sea level. Of more direct concern to humans is the nature of landforms and the processes that occur on them. This area of study is classifi ed as geomorphology. 15.3.1 PLATE TECTONICS AND CONTINENTAL DRIFT The geosphere has a highly varied, constantly changing physical form. Most of the Earth\u2019s land mass is contained in several massive continents separated by vast oceans. Towering mountain ranges span across the continents, and in some places the ocean bottom is at extreme depths. Earthquakes, which often cause great destruction and loss of life, and volcanic eruptions, which sometimes throw enough material into the atmosphere to cause temporary changes in climate, serve as reminders that Earth is a dynamic, living body that continues to change. There is convincing evidence, such as the close fit between the western coast of Africa and the eastern coast of South America, that suggest that widely separated continents were once joined and have moved relative to each other. This ongoing phenomenon is known as continental drift. It is now believed that 200 million years ago much of the Earth\u2019s land mass was all part of a supercontinent, now called Gowandaland. This continent split apart to form the present-day continents of Antarctica, Australia, Africa, and South America, as well as Madagascar, the Seychelle Islands, and India. The observations described above are explained by the theory of plate tectonics.2 This theory views the Earth\u2019s solid surface as consisting of several rigid plates that move relative to each other. These plates drift at an average rate of several centimeters per year atop a relatively weak, partially molten layer that is part of the Earth\u2019s upper mantle called the asthenosphere. The science of plate tectonics explains the large-scale phenomena that affect the geosphere, including the creation and enlargement of oceans as the ocean floors open up and spread, the collision and breaking apart of continents, the formation of mountain chains, volcanic activities, the creation of islands of volcanic origin, and earthquakes. The boundaries between these plates are where most geological activity such as earthquakes and volcanic activity occur. These boundaries are of the three following types: \u2022 Divergent boundaries, where the plates are moving away from each other. Occurring on ocean floors, these are regions in which hot magma flows upward and cools to produce new solid lithosphere. This new solid material creates ocean ridges. \u2022 Convergent boundaries, where plates move toward each other. One plate may be pushed beneath the other in a subduction zone in which matter is buried in the asthenosphere and eventually remelted to form new magma. When this does not occur, the lithosphere is pushed up to form mountain ranges along a collision boundary. \u2022 Transform fault boundaries in which two plates slide past each other. These boundaries create faults that result in earthquakes. The phenomena described above are parts of the tectonic cycle, a geological cycle that describes how tectonic plates move relative to each other, magma rises to form new solid rocks, and solid lithospheric rocks sink to become melted thus forming new magma.", "The tectonic cycle is illustrated in Figure 15.2. 15.3.2 STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY The Earth\u2019s surface is constantly being reshaped by geological processes. The movement of rock masses during processes such as the formation of mountains results in substantial deformation of rock. At the opposite extreme of the size scale are defects in crystals at a microscopic level. Structural geology addresses the geometric forms of geological structures over a wide range of sizes, the nature of structures formed by geological processes, and the formation of folds, faults, and other geological structures. Primary structures are those that have resulted from the formation of a rock mass from its parent materials. Primary structures are modified and deformed to produce secondary structures. A basic premise of structural geology is that most layered rock formations were deposited in a horizontal configuration. Cracking of such a formation without displacement of the separate parts Oceanic temperature and pressure of the formation relative to each other produces a joint, whereas displacement produces a fault (Figure 15.3). A key relationship in structural geology is that between the force or stress placed upon a geological formation or object and the deformation resulting from it, called the strain. An important aspect of structural geology, therefore, is rheology, which deals with the deformation and flow of solids and semisolids. Whereas rocks tend to be strong, rigid, and brittle under the conditions at the Earth\u2019s surface, their rheology changes such that they may become weak and pliable under the extreme conditions of temperature and pressure at significant depths below the Earth\u2019s surface. 15.4 INTERNAL PROCESSES The preceding section addressed the physical form of the geosphere. Related to the physical configuration of the geosphere are several major kinds of processes that occur that change this configuration and that have the potential to cause damage and even catastrophic effects.3 These can be divided into the two main categories: internal processes that arise from phenomena located signifi cantly below the Earth\u2019s surface and surface processes that occur on the surface. Internal processes are addressed in this section, and surface processes in Section 15.5. 15.4.1 EARTHQUAKES Earthquakes usually arise from plate tectonic processes and originate along plate boundaries occurring as motion of ground resulting from the release of energy that accompanies an abrupt slippage of rock formations subjected to stress along a fault. Basically, two huge masses of rock tend to move relative to each other, but are locked together along a fault line. This causes deformation of the rock formations, which increases with increasing stress. Eventually, the friction between the two moving bodies is insufficient to keep them locked in place, and movement occurs along an existing fault, or a new fault is formed. Freed from constraints on their movement, the rocks undergo elastic rebound, causing Earth to shake. The serious earthquake damage that may ensue is discussed further in Section 15.10. In addition to shaking of ground, which can be quite violent, earthquakes can cause the ground to rupture, subside, or rise. Liquefaction is an important phenomenon that occurs during earthquakes with ground that is poorly consolidated and in which the water table may be high. Liquefaction results from separation of soil particles accompanied by water infiltration. When this occurs, the ground behaves like a fl uid. The location of the initial movement along a fault that causes an earthquake to occur is called the focus of the earthquake. The surface location directly above the focus is the epicenter. Energy is transmitted from the focus by seismic waves. Seismic waves that travel through the interior of Earth are called body waves and those that traverse the surface are surface waves. Body waves are further categorized into P-waves, compressional vibrations that result from the alternate compression and expansion of geospheric material, and S-waves, consisting of shear waves manifested by sideways oscillations of material. The motions of these waves are detected by a seismograph, often at great distances from the epicenter. The two types of waves move at different rates, with P-waves moving faster. From the arrival times of the two kinds of waves at different seismographic locations, it is possible to locate the epicenter of an earthquake. 15.4.2 VOLCANOES In addition to earthquakes, the other major subsurface process that has the potential to massively affect the environment consists of emissions of molten rock (lava), gases, steam, ash, and particles due to the presence of magma near the Earth\u2019s surface. This phenomenon is called a volcano (Figure 15.4). Volcanoes can be very destructive and damaging to the environment.", "Aspects of the potential harm from volcanoes are discussed in Section 15.11. Volcanoes take on a variety of forms, which are beyond the scope of this chapter to cover in detail. Basically, they are formed when magma rises to the surface. This frequently occurs in subduction zones created where one plate is pushed beneath another (see Figure 15.2). The downward movement of solid lithospheric material subjects it to high temperatures and pressures that cause the rock in it to melt and raise to the surface as magma. Molten magma issuing from a volcano at temperatures usually in excess of 500\u00b0C and often as high as 1400\u00b0C, is called lava, and is one of the most common manifestations of volcanic activity. 15.4.3 SURFACE PROCESSES Surface geological features are formed by upward movement of materials from the Earth\u2019s crust. With exposure to water, oxygen, freeze\u2013thaw cycles, organisms, and other influences on the surface, surface features are subject to two processes that largely determine the landscape: weathering and erosion. As noted earlier in this chapter, weathering consists of the physical and chemical breakdown of rock and erosion is the removal and movement of weathered products by the action of wind, liquid water, and ice. Weathering and erosion work together in that one augments the other in breaking down rock and moving the products. Weathered products removed by erosion are eventually deposited as sediments and may undergo diagenesis and lithification to form sedimentary rocks. One of the most common surface processes that can adversely affect humans consists of landslides that occur when soil or other unconsolidated materials slide down a slope. Related phenomena include rockfalls, mudflows, and snow avalanches. Destructive surface processes are discussed further in Section 15.12. 15.5 SEDIMENTS Vast areas of land, as well as lake and stream sediments, are formed from sedimentary rocks. The properties of these masses of material depend strongly upon their origins and transport. Water is the main vehicle of sediment transport, although wind can also be significant. Hundreds of millions of tons of sediment are carried by major rivers each year. The action of flowing water in streams cuts away stream banks and carries sedimentary materials for great distances. Sedimentary materials such as the following may be carried by fl owing water in streams: \u2022 Dissolved load from sediment-forming minerals in solution \u2022 Suspended load from solid sedimentary materials carried along in suspension \u2022 Bed load dragged along the bottom of the stream channel The transport of calcium carbonate as dissolved calcium bicarbonate provides a straightforward example of dissolved load and is the most prevalent type of such a load. Water with a high dissolved carbon dioxide content (usually present as the result of bacterial action) in contact with calcium carbonate formations contains Ca2+ and HCO3\u2212 ions. Flowing water containing calcium as the HCO3\u2212 salt has temporary hardness but may become more basic by loss of CO2 to the atmosphere, consumption of CO2 by algal growth, or contact with dissolved base, resulting in the deposition of insoluble CaCO3: - Ca2++ 2HCO3 \u00c6 CaCO3(s) + CO2( g) + H2O (15.2) Most flowing water that contains dissolved load originates underground, where the water has had the opportunity to dissolve minerals from the rock strata that it has passed through. Most sediments are transported by streams as suspended load, obvious in the observation of \u201cmud\u201d in the flowing water of rivers draining agricultural areas or finely divided rock in Alpine streams fed by melting glaciers. Under normal conditions, finely divided silt, clay, or sand makes up most of the suspended load, although larger particles are transported in rapidly fl owing water. The degree and rate of movement of suspended sedimentary material in streams are functions of the velocity of water flow and the settling velocity of the particles in suspension. Bed load is moved along the bottom of a stream by the action of water \u201cpushing\u201d particles along. Particles carried as bed load do not move continuously. The grinding action of such particles is an important factor in stream erosion. Typically, about two-third of the sediment carried by a stream is transported in suspension, about one-fourth in solution, and the remaining relatively small fraction as bed load. The ability of a stream to carry sediment increases with both the overall rate of flow of the water (mass per unit time) and the velocity of the water. Both of these are higher under flood conditions, so fl oods are particularly important in the transport of sediments.", "Streams mobilize sedimentary materials through erosion, transport the materials along with stream flow, and release them in a solid form during deposition. Deposits of stream-borne sediments are called alluvium. As conditions such as lowered stream velocity begin to favor deposition, larger, more settleable particles are released first. This results in sorting such that particles of a similar size and type tend to occur together in alluvial deposits. Much sediment is deposited in fl ood plains where streams overflow their banks. 15.6 CLAYS Clays are extremely common and important in mineralogy. Furthermore, in general, clays predominate in the inorganic components of most soils (see Chapter 16) and are very important in holding water and in plant nutrient cation exchange. All clays contain silicate and most contain aluminum and water. Physically, clays consist of very fine grains having sheet-like structures. For the purposes of the discussion here, clay is defined as a group of microcrystalline secondary minerals consisting of hydrous aluminum silicates that have sheet-like structures. Clay minerals are distinguished from each other by general chemical formula, structure, and chemical and physical properties. The three major groups of clay minerals are the following: \u2022 Montmorillonite, Al2(OH)2Si4O10 \u2022 Illite, K0\u20132Al4(Si8\u20136Al0\u20132)O20(OH)4 \u2022 Kaolinite, Al2Si2O5(OH)4 Many clays contain large amounts of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and iron, as well as trace quantities of other metals. Clays bind cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, and NH4 +, which protects the cations from leaching by water but keeps them available in soil as plant nutrients. Since many clays are readily suspended in water as colloidal particles, they may be leached from soil or carried to lower soil layers. Olivine, augite, hornblende, and feldspars are all parent minerals that form clays. An example is the formation of kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4) from potassium feldspar rock (KAlSi3O8): 2KAlSi3O8(s) + 2H++ 9H2O \u00c6 Al2Si2O5(OH)4(s) + 2K+(aq) + 4H4SiO4(aq) (15.3) The layered structures of clays consist of sheets of silicon oxide alternating with sheets of aluminum oxide. The silicon oxide sheets are made up of tetrahedra in which each silicon atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms. Of the four oxygen atoms in each tetrahedron, three are shared with other silicon atoms that are components of other tetrahedra. This sheet is called the tetrahedral sheet. The aluminum oxide is contained in an octahedral sheet, so named because each aluminum atom is surrounded by six oxygen atoms in an octahedral configuration. The structure is such that some of the oxygen atoms are shared between aluminum atoms and some are shared with the tetrahedral sheet. 0.72 nm Structurally, clays may be classified as either two-layer clays in which oxygen atoms are shared between a tetrahedral sheet and an adjacent octahedral sheet, or three-layer clays in which an octahedral sheet shares oxygen atoms with tetrahedral sheets on either side. These layers composed of either two or three sheets are called unit layers. A unit layer of a two-layer clay typically is around 0.7 nm thick, whereas that of a three-layer clay exceeds 0.9 nm in thickness. The structure of the two-layer clay kaolinite is represented in Figure 15.5. Some clays, particularly the montmorillonites, may absorb large quantities of water between unit layers, a process accompanied by swelling of the clay. As described in Section 5.4, clay minerals may attain a net negative charge by ion replacement, in which Si(IV) and Al(III) ions are replaced by metal ions of similar size but lesser charge. Compensation must be made for this negative charge by association of cations with the clay layer surfaces. Since these cations need not fi t specific sites in the crystalline lattice of the clay, they may be relatively large ions, such as K+, Na+, or NH4 +. These cations are called exchangeable cations and are exchangeable for other cations in water. The amount of exchangeable cations, expressed as milliequivalents (of monovalent cations) per 100 g of dry clay, is called the CEC of the clay and is a very important characteristic of colloids and sediments that have cation-exchange capabilities. 15.7 GEOCHEMISTRY Geochemistry deals with chemical species, reactions, and processes in the lithosphere and their interactions with the atmosphere and hydrosphere. The branch of geochemistry that explores the complex interactions among the rock/water/air/life systems that determine the chemical characteristics of the surface environment is environmental geochemistry. Obviously, geochemistry and its environmental subdiscipline are very important areas of environmental chemistry with many applications related to the environment. 15.7.1 PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF WEATHERING Defined in Section 15.2, weathering is discussed here as a geochemical phenomenon.", "Rocks tend to weather more rapidly when there are pronounced differences in physical conditions\u2014alternate freezing and thawing and wet periods alternating with severe drying. Other mechanical aspects are swelling and shrinking of minerals with hydration and dehydration, as well as growth of roots through cracks in rocks. Temperature is involved in that the rates of chemical weathering (below) increase with increasing temperature. 15.7.2 CHEMICAL WEATHERING As a chemical phenomenon, weathering can be viewed as the result of the tendency of the rock/water/ mineral system to attain equilibrium. This occurs through the usual chemical mechanisms of dissolution/precipitation, acid\u2013base reactions, complexation, hydrolysis, and oxidation\u2013reduction. Weathering occurs extremely slowly in dry air but is many orders of magnitude faster in the presence of water. Water itself is a chemically active weathering substance and it holds weathering agents in solution such that they are transported to chemically active sites on rock minerals and contact the mineral surfaces at the molecular and ionic levels. Prominent among such weathering agents are CO2, O2, organic acids (including humic and fulvic acids, see Section 3.17), sulfur acids (SO2(aq) and H2SO4), and nitrogen acids (HNO3 and HNO2). Water provides the source of H+ ion needed for acid-forming gases to act as acids as shown by the following: - CO2 + H2O \u00c6 H++ HCO3 (15.4) - SO2 + H2O \u00c6 H++ HSO3 (15.5) Rainwater is essentially free of mineral solutes. It is usually slightly acidic due to the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide or more highly acidic because of acid-rain-forming constituents. As a result of its slight acidity and lack of alkalinity and dissolved calcium salts, rainwater is chemically aggressive (see Section 8.7) toward some kinds of mineral matter, which it breaks down by chemical weathering processes. Because of this process, river water has a higher concentration of dissolved inorganic solids than does rainwater. The processes involved in chemical weathering may be divided into the following major categories: \u2022 Hydration/dehydration, for example: CaSO4(s) + 2H2O \u00c6 CaSO4 \u22c5 2H2O(s) 2Fe(OH)3 \u22c5 xH2O(s) \u00c6 Fe2O3(s) + (3 + 2x)H2O \u2022 Dissolution, for example: \u2022 Oxidation, such as occurs in the dissolution of pyrite: CaSO4 \u22c5 2H2O(s) (water) \u00c6 Ca2+(aq) + SO42\u2212(aq) + 2H2O 4FeS2(s) + 15O2( g) + (8 + 2x)H2O \u00c6 2Fe2O3 \u22c5 xH2O + 8SO42-(aq) + 16H+(aq) or in the following example in which dissolution of an iron(II) mineral is followed by oxidation of iron(II) to iron(III): Fe2SiO4(s) + 4CO2(aq) + 4H2O \u2192 2Fe2++ 4HCO3 -+ H4SiO4 4Fe2++ 8HCO3 -+ O2( g) \u2192 2Fe2O3(s) + 8CO2 + 4H2O The second of these two reactions may occur at some distance from the first, resulting in net transport of iron from its original location. Iron, manganese, and sulfur are the major elements that undergo oxidation as part of the weathering process. \u2022 Dissolution with hydrolysis as occurs with the hydrolysis of carbonate ion when mineral carbonates dissolve: CaCO3(s) + H2O \u2192 Ca2+(aq) + HCO3 -(aq) + OH-(aq) Hydrolysis is the major means by which silicates undergo weathering as shown by the following reaction of forsterite: Mg2SiO4(s) + 4CO2 + 4H2O \u2192 2Mg2++ 4HCO3 -+ H4SiO4 The weathering of silicates yields soluble silicon as species such as H4SiO4, and residual silicon-containing minerals (clay minerals). \u2022 Acid hydrolysis, which accounts for the dissolution of significant amounts of CaCO3 and CaCO3 \u22c5 MgCO3 in the presence CO2-rich water: CaCO3(s) + H2O + CO2(aq) \u00c6 Ca2+(aq) + 2HCO3 -(aq) \u2022 Complexation, as exemplified by the reaction of oxalate ion, C2O42\u2212, with aluminum in muscovite, K2(Si6Al2)Al4O20(OH)4: K2(Si6Al2)Al4O20(OH)4(s) + 6C2O42-(aq) + 20H+\u00c6 6AlC2O4 +(aq) + 6Si(OH)4 + 2K+ Reactions such as these largely determine the kinds and concentrations of solutes in surface water and groundwater. Acid hydrolysis, especially, is the predominant process that releases elements such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+ from silicate minerals. 15.7.3 BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF WEATHERING Organisms may play a strong role in weathering processes and formation of soil. Cavities on top of rock formations and boulders in some areas accumulate water, mineral debris, and organic debris. These cavities may serve as sites of miniature ecosystems, supporting initially cyanobacteria, green algae, fungi, bacteria, and insects. Organic acids released by the organisms and humic matter produced by degradation of vegetable matter in the cavities tend to dissolve the rock and enlarge the cavities. Small rock crystals are released that eventually weather to produce secondary minerals such as clays. Eventually, vascular plants begin to grow in the miniature ecosystems and embryonic soils develop.", "15.8 GROUNDWATER IN THE GEOSPHERE Groundwater (Figure 15.6) is a vital resource in its own right that plays a crucial role in geochemical processes, such as the formation of secondary minerals. The nature, quality, and mobility of groundwater are all strongly dependent upon the rock formations in which the water is held. Physically, an important characteristic of such formations is their porosity, which determines the percentage of rock volume available to contain water. Another important physical characteristic is permeability, which describes the ease of fl ow of the water through the rock. High permeability is usually associated with high porosity. However, clays tend to have low permeability even when a large percentage of the volume is filled with water. Most groundwater originates as meteoric water from precipitation in the form of rain or snow. If water from this source is not lost by evaporation, transpiration, or to stream runoff, it may infi ltrate into the ground. Initial amounts of water from precipitation onto dry soil are held very tightly as a film on the surfaces and in the micropores of soil particles in a belt of soil moisture. At intermediate levels, the soil particles are covered with films of water, but air is still present in larger voids in the soil. The region in which such water is held is called the unsaturated zone or zone of aeration and the water present in it is vadose water. At lower depths in the presence of adequate amounts of water, all voids are filled to produce a zone of saturation, the upper level of which is the water table. Water present in a zone of saturation is called groundwater. Because of its surface tension, water is drawn somewhat above the water table by capillary-sized passages in soil in a region called the capillary fringe. The water table (Figure 15.7) is crucial for explaining and predicting the flow of wells and springs and the levels of streams and lakes. It is also an important factor in determining the extent to which pollutant and hazardous chemicals underground are likely to be transported by water. The water table can be mapped by observing the equilibrium level of water in wells, which is essentially the same as the top of the saturated zone. The water table is usually not level, but tends to follow the general contours of the surface topography. It also varies with differences in permeability and water infiltration. The water table is at surface level in the vicinity of swamps and frequently above the surface where lakes and streams are encountered. The water level in such bodies may be maintained by the water table. Infl uent streams or reservoirs are located above the water table; they lose water to the underlying aquifer and cause an upward bulge in the water table beneath the surface water. well drawdown elevated from influent stream FIGURE 15.7 The water table and influences of surface features on it. Groundwater fl ow is an important consideration in determining the accessibility of the water for use and transport of pollutants from underground waste sites. Various parts of a body of groundwater are in hydraulic contact so that a change in pressure at one point will tend to affect the pressure and level at another point. For example, infiltration from a heavy, localized rainfall may affect the water table at a point remote from the infiltration. Groundwater flow occurs as the result of the natural tendency of the water table to assume even levels by the action of gravity. Groundwater flow is strongly influenced by rock permeability. Porous or extensively fractured rock is relatively highly pervious, meaning that water can migrate through the holes, fi ssures, and pores in such rock. Because water can be extracted from it, such a formation is called an aquifer. By contrast, an aquiclude is a rock formation that is too impermeable or unfractured to yield groundwater. Impervious rock in the unsaturated zone may retain water infiltrating from the surface to produce a perched water table that is above the main water table and from which water may be extracted. However, the amounts of water that can be extracted from such a formation are limited and the water is vulnerable to contamination. 15.8.1 WATER WELLS Most groundwater is tapped for use by water wells drilled into the saturated zone. The use and misuse of water from this source have a number of environmental implications.", "In the United States, about two-third of the groundwater pumped is consumed for irrigation; lesser amounts of groundwater are used for industrial and municipal applications. As water is withdrawn, the water table in the vicinity of the well is lowered. This drawdown of water creates a zone of depression. In extreme cases the groundwater is severely depleted and surface land levels can even subside (which is one reason why Venice, Italy is now very vulnerable to flooding). Heavy drawdown can result in infiltration of pollutants from sources such as septic tanks, municipal refuse sites, and hazardous waste dumps. When soluble iron(II) or manganese(II) is present in groundwater, exposure to air at the well wall can result in the formation of deposits of insoluble Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides produced by bacterially catalyzed processes: 4Fe2+(aq) + O2(aq) + 10H2O \u00c6 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 8H+ (15.6) 2Mn2+(aq) + O2(aq) + (2x + 2)H2O \u00c6 2MnO2\u22c5xH2O(s) + 4H+ (15.7) Deposits of iron(III) and manganese(IV) that result from the processes outlined above line the surfaces from which water flows into the well with a coating that is relatively impermeable to water. The deposits fill the spaces that water must traverse to enter the well. As a result, they can seriously impede the flow of water into the well from the water-bearing aquifer. This creates major water source problems for municipalities using groundwater for water supply. As a result of this problem, chemical or mechanical cleaning, drilling of new wells, or even acquisition of new water sources may be required. 15.8.2 QANATS An interesting ancient technology for utilizing groundwater is the qanat (Figure 15.8). Basically the qanat consists of a tunnel drilled into an aquifer and leading to an outflow located below the elevation of the aquifer. Typical lengths of the conduits in qanats are 10\u201316 km, although they have reached almost 30 km in length. Iran is the world\u2019s center of qanat technology dating back to ancient Persia some 3000 years ago. There are about 22,000 qanat units containing over 270,000 km of conduits in Iran that supply about 75% of the nation\u2019s water for irrigation and domestic use. Now the system in Iran is threatened by tube wells drilled into the aquifers that are lowering water tables and draining water from the qanats. 15.9 ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE GEOSPHERE Most of the remainder of this chapter deals specifically with the environmental aspects of geology and human interactions with the geosphere. It discusses how natural geological phenomena affect the environment through occurrences such as volcanic eruptions that may blast so much particulate matter and acid gas into the atmosphere that it may have a temporary effect on global climate, or massive earthquakes that disrupt surface topography and disturb the flow and distribution of groundwater and surface water. Also discussed are human influences on the geosphere and the strong connection between the geosphere and the anthrosphere.4 Going back several billion years to its formation as a ball of dust particles collected from the universe and held together by gravitational forces, Earth has witnessed constant environmental change and disruption. During its earlier eons, Earth was a most inhospitable place for humans and, indeed, for any form of life. Heat generated by gravitational compression of primitive earth and by radioactive elements in its interior caused much of the mass of the planet to liquefy. Relatively high density iron sank into the core, and lighter minerals, primarily silicates, solidified and floated to the surface. Although in the scale of a human lifetime, Earth changes almost imperceptibly; the planet is in fact in a state of constant change and turmoil. It is known that continents have formed, broken apart, and moved around. Rock formations produced in ancient oceans have been thrust up onto continental land and huge masses of volcanic rock exist where volcanic activity is now unknown. Today the angry bowels of Earth unleash enormous forces that push molten rock to the surface and move continents continuously as evidenced from volcanic activity, and from earthquakes resulting from the movement of great land masses relative to each other. The Earth\u2019s surface is constantly changing as new mountain ranges are heaved up and old ones are worn down. Humans have learned to work with, against, and around natural earth processes and phenomena to exploit the Earth\u2019s resources and to make these processes and phenomena work for the benefi t of humankind.", "Human efforts have been moderately successful in mitigating some of the major hazards posed by natural geospheric phenomena, although such endeavors often have had unforeseen detrimental consequences, sometimes many years after they were first applied. The survival of modern civilization and, indeed, of humankind will depend upon how intelligently humans work with Earth. That is why it is so important for humans to have a fundamental understanding of the geospheric environment. An important consideration in human interaction with the geosphere is the application of engineering to geology. Engineering geology takes account of the geological characteristics of soil and rock in designing buildings, dams, highways, and other structures in a manner compatible with the geological strata on which they rest. Engineering geology must consider a large number of geological factors including type, strength, and fracture characteristics of rock, tendency for landslides to occur, susceptibility to settling, and likelihood of erosion. Engineering geology is an important consideration in land-use planning. 15.9.1 NATURAL HAZARDS Earth presents a variety of natural hazards to the creatures that dwell on it. Some of these are the result of internal processes that arise from the movement of land masses relative to each other and from heat and intrusions of molten rock from below the surface. The most common such hazards are earthquakes and volcanoes. Whereas internal processes tend to force matter upward, often with detrimental effects, surface processes are those that generally result from the tendency of matter to seek lower levels. Such processes include erosion, landslides, avalanches, mudfl ows, and subsidence. A number of natural hazards result from the interaction and conflict between solid earth and liquid and solid water. Perhaps the most obvious such hazard consists of floods when too much water falls as precipitation and seeks lower levels through stream flow. Wind can team with water to increase destructive effects, such as beach erosion and destruction of beachfront property resulting from wind-driven seawater. Ice, too, can have some major effects on solid earth. Evidence of such effects of the Ice Age times include massive glacial moraines left over from deposition of till from melting glaciers, and landscape features carved by advancing ice sheets. 15.9.2 ANTHROPOGENIC HAZARDS All too often, attempts to control and reshape the geosphere to human demands have been detrimental to the geosphere and dangerous to human life and well-being. Such attempts may exacerbate damaging natural phenomena. A prime example of this interaction occurs when efforts are made to control the flow of rivers by straightening them and building levees. The initial results can be deceptively favorable in that a modified stream may exist for decades, flowing smoothly and staying within the confi nes imposed by humans. But eventually, the forces of nature are likely to overwhelm the efforts of humans to control them, such as when a record flood breaks levees and destroys structures constructed in flood-prone areas. Landslides of mounds of earthen material piled up from mining can be very destructive. Destruction of wetlands in an effort to provide additional farmland can have some detrimental effects on wildlife and on the overall health of ecosystems. 15.10 EARTHQUAKES The loss of life and destruction of property by earthquakes makes them some of nature\u2019s more damaging natural phenomena.5 The destructive effects of an earthquake are due to the release of energy. The released energy moves from the quake\u2019s focus as seismic waves, discussed in Section 15.4. Literally millions of lives have been lost in past earthquakes, and damage from an earthquake in a developed urban area can easily run into billions of dollars. Earthquakes may cause catastrophic secondary effects, especially large, destructive ocean waves called tsunamis (discussed below). Adding to the terror of earthquakes is their lack of predictability. An earthquake can strike at any time\u2014during the calm of late night hours or in the middle of busy rush hour traffi c. Although the exact prediction of earthquakes has so far eluded investigators, the locations where earthquakes are most likely to occur are much more well known. These are located in lines corresponding to boundaries along which tectonic plates collide and move relative to each other, building up stresses that are suddenly released when earthquakes occur. Such interplate boundaries are locations of preexisting faults and breaks. Occasionally, however, an earthquake will occur within a plate, made more massive and destructive because for it to occur the thick lithosphere has to be ruptured. The scale of earthquakes can be estimated by the degree of motion that they cause and by their destructiveness.", "The former is termed the magnitude of an earthquake and is commonly expressed by the Richter scale. The Richter scale is open-ended, and each unit increase in the scale refl ects a 10-fold increase in magnitude. Several hundred thousand earthquakes with magnitudes from two to three occur each year; they are detected by seismographs, but are not felt by humans. Minor earthquakes range from four to five on the Richter scale, and earthquakes cause damage at a magnitude greater than about five. Great earthquakes, which occur about once or twice a year, register over eight on the Richter scale. The intensity of an earthquake is a subjective estimate of its potential destructive effect. On the Mercalli intensity scale, an intensity III earthquake feels like the passage of heavy vehicles; one with an intensity of VII causes difficulty in standing, damage to plaster, and dislodging of loose brick, whereas a quake with an intensity of XII causes virtually total destruction, throws objects upward, and shifts huge masses of earthen material. Intensity does not correlate exactly with magnitude. Distance from the epicenter, the nature of underlying strata, and the types of structures affected may all result in variations in intensity from the same earthquake. In general, structures built on bedrock will survive with much less damage than those constructed on poorly consolidated material. Displacement of ground along a fault can be substantial, for example, up to 6 m along the San Andreas fault during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Such shifts can break pipelines and destroy roadways. Highly destructive surface waves can shake vulnerable structures apart. The shaking and movement of ground are the most obvious means by which earthquakes cause damage. In addition to shaking it, earthquakes can cause the ground to rupture, subside, or rise. Liquefaction is an important phenomenon that occurs during earthquakes with ground that is poorly consolidated and in which the water table may be high. It results from separation of soil particles accompanied by water infiltration such that the ground behaves like a fl uid. Another devastating phenomenon consists of tsunamis, large ocean waves resulting from earthquake-induced movement of ocean floor. Tsunamis sweeping onshore at speeds up to 1000 km/h have destroyed many homes and taken many lives, often large distances from the epicenter of the earthquake itself. This effect occurs when a tsunami approaches land and forms huge breakers, some as high as 10\u201315 m, or even higher. On April 1, 1946, an earthquake off the coast of Alaska generated a Tsunami estimated to be more than 30 m high that killed five people on a nearby lighthouse. About 5 h later, a Tsunami generated by the same earthquake reached Hilo, Hawaii, and killed 159 people with a wave exceeding 15 m high. The March 27, 1964, Alaska earthquake generated a tsunami over 10 m high that hit a freighter docked at Valdez, tossing it around like matchwood. Miraculously, nobody on the freighter was killed, but 28 people on the dock died. Literally millions of lives have been lost in past earthquakes, and damage from an earthquake in a developed urban area can easily run into billions of dollars. As examples, a massive earthquake in Egypt and Syria in 1201 ad took over 1 million lives, one in Tangshan, China, in 1976 killed about 650,000, and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California cost about $7 billion. Significant progress has been made in designing structures that are earthquake resistant. As evidence of that, during a 1964 earthquake in Niigata, Japan, some buildings tipped over on their sides due to liquefaction of the underlying soil, but remained structurally intact! Other areas of endeavor that can lessen the impact of earthquakes are the identification of areas susceptible to earthquakes, discouraging development in such areas, and educating the public about earthquake hazards. Accurate prediction would be a tremendous help in lessening the effects of earthquakes, but so far has been generally unsuccessful. Most challenging of all is the possibility of preventing major earthquakes. One unlikely possibility would be to detonate nuclear explosives deep underground along a fault line to release stress before it builds up to an excessive level. Fluid injection to facilitate slippage along a fault has also been considered. There is some evidence to suggest that human activities can contribute to the occurrence of earthquakes in rare cases.", "On May 12, 2008, the 7.9 magnitude Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan Province, China, that left 80,000 people dead or missing may have been triggered by the mass of water contained in the Zipingpu reservoir completed in 2004. Containing about 300 million metric tons of water, this reservoir, which was built <2 km from a major fault line, has been estimated to have increased pressure on underlying strata as much as 25-fold. The Wenchuan earthquake originated only about 5 km from the reservoir and spread in a direction that seismologists believe is consistent with a quake triggered by the reservoir. As the reservoir was filling, from 2004 to 2005 the area registered about 730 minor earthquakes of a magnitude of three or less, likely caused in part by increasing pressure from the impounded water. In addition to the pressure from the mass of the water, water infiltration from the reservoir may have lubricated the underlying strata making them more prone to movement. Seismologists emphasize that the Wenchuan earthquake would have taken place eventually without the added pressure of the impounded water, but the construction may have hastened the quake by several hundred years. 15.11 VOLCANOES Volcanic eruptions can be terrifying and extremely destructive events.6 On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens, a volcano in Washington State, erupted, blowing out about 1 km3 of material. This massive blast spread ash over half of the United States, causing about $1 billion in damages and killing an estimated 62 people, many of whom were never found. Many volcanic disasters have been recorded throughout history. Perhaps the best known of these is the 79 ad eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which buried the Roman city of Pompei with volcanic ash. Temperatures of lava, molten rock flowing from a volcano, typically exceed 500\u00b0C and may get as high as 1400\u00b0C or more. Lava flows destroy everything in their paths, causing buildings and forests to burn and burying them under rock that cools and becomes solid. Often more dangerous than a lava flow are the pyroclastics produced by volcanoes and consisting of fragments of rock and lava. Some of these particles are large and potentially very damaging, but they tend to fall quite close to the vent. Ash and dust may be carried for large distances and, in extreme cases, as was the case in ancient Pompei, may bury large areas to some depth with devastating effects. The explosion of Tambora volcano in Indonesia in 1815 blew out about 30 km3 of solid material. The ejection of so much solid into the atmosphere had such a devastating effect on global climate that the following year was known as \u201cthe year without a summer,\u201d causing widespread hardship and hunger because of global crop failures. A special kind of particularly dangerous pyroclastic consists of nu\u00e9eardente. This term, French for \u201cglowing cloud,\u201d refers to a dense mixture of hot toxic gases and fine ash particles reaching temperatures of 1000\u00b0C that can flow down the slopes of a volcano at speeds of up to 100 km/h. In 1902, a nu\u00e9eardente was produced by the eruption of Mont Pel\u00e9e on Martinique in the Caribbean. Of as many as 40,000 people in the town of St. Pierre, the only survivor was a terrifi ed prisoner shielded from the intense heat by the dungeon in which he was imprisoned. One of the more spectacular and potentially damaging volcanic phenomena is a phreatic eruption that occurs when infiltrating water is superheated by hot magma and causes a volcano to literally explode. This happened in 1883 when uninhabited Krakatoa in Indonesia blew up with an energy release of the order of 100 megatons of TNT. Dust was blown 80 km into the stratosphere, and a perceptible climatic cooling was noted for the next 10 years. As is the case with earthquakes, volcanic eruptions may cause the devastating tsunamis. Krakatoa produced a tsunami 40 m high that killed 30,000\u201340,000 people on surrounding islands. Some of the most damaging health and environmental effects of volcanic eruptions are caused by gases and particulate matter. Possible effects are discussed in Sections 14.8 and 15.18. 15.11.1 MUD VOLCANOES Mud volcanoes consist of eruptions of mud, water, and gas from underground reservoirs of mud pressurized by overlying rock formations. The largest mud volcano on Earth formed in 2008 in the Sidoario district of East Java in Indonesia.", "It appeared at the site of an oil and gas exploration well drilled into the mud formation at a depth of 3000 m and it is suspected that the well caused the volcano to form. Large quantities of petroleum-contaminated mud along with some methane and toxic hydrogen sulfide have been issuing from the volcano since it was formed. Although no humans have been injured, more than 12,000 had to be evacuated and 20 factories, 15 mosques, and 18 schools have been inundated. As the mud has been disgorged, an area of surrounding land surface has subsided, in places by as much as 100 m. More than 1100 mostly small mud volcanoes from natural sources have been observed worldwide. Some large ones in Azerbaijan emit large amounts of methane gas and have been burning for centuries. Worldwide, mud volcanoes emit 10\u201320 million metric tons of methane to the atmosphere each year. 15.12 SURFACE EARTH MOVEMENT Mass movements are the result of gravity acting upon rock and soil on the Earth\u2019s surface. This produces a shearing stress on earthen materials located on slopes that can exceed the shear strength of the material and produce landslides and related phenomena involving the downward movement of geological materials. Such phenomena are affected by several factors, including the kinds and, therefore, strengths of materials, slope steepness, and degree of saturation with water. Usually, a specific event initiates mass movement. This can occur when excavation by humans makes the slopes steeper, by the action of torrential rains, or by earthquakes. Illustrated in Figure 15.9, landslides refer to events in which large masses of rock and dirt move down the slope rapidly. Such events occur when material resting on a slope at an angle of repose is acted upon by gravity to produce a shearing stress. This stress may exceed the forces of friction or shear strength. Weathering, fracturing, water, and other factors may induce the formation of slide planes or failure planes such that a landslide results. Loss of life and property from landslides can be substantial. In 1970, a devastating avalanche of soil, mud, and rocks initiated by an earthquake slid down Mount Huascaran in Peru killing an estimated 20,000 people. Sometimes the effects are indirect. In 1963, a total of 2600 people were killed near the Vaiont Dam in Italy when a sudden landslide filled the reservoir behind the dam with earthen material. Although the dam held, the displaced water spilled over its abutments as a wave 90 m high, wiping out structures and lives in its path. Although often ignored by developers, the tendency toward landslides is predictable and can be used to determine areas in which homes and other structures should not be built. Slope stability maps based upon the degree of slope, the nature of underlying geological strata, climatic conditions, and other factors can be used to assess the risk of landslides. Evidence of a tendency for land to slide can be observed from effects on existing structures, such as walls that have lost their alignment, cracks in foundations, and poles that tilt. The likelihood of landslides can be minimized by moving material from the upper to the lower part of a slope, avoiding the loading of slopes, and avoiding measures that might change the degree and pathways of water infi ltration into slope materials. In cases where the risk is not too severe, retaining walls may be constructed that reduce the effects of landslides. Several measures can be used to warn of landslides. Simple visual observations of changes in the surface can be indicative of an impending landslide. More sophisticated measures include tilt meters and devices that sense vibrations accompanying the movement of earthen materials. In addition to landslides, there are several other kinds of mass movements that have the potential to be damaging. Rockfalls occur when rocks fall down slopes so steep that at least part of the time the falling material is not in contact with the ground. The fallen material accumulates at the bottom of the fall as a pile of talus. A much less spectacular event is creep, in which movement is slow and gradual. The action of frost\u2014frost heaving\u2014is a common form of creep. Though usually not life-threatening, over a period of time creep may ruin foundations and cause misalignment of roads and railroads with significant property damage often being the result. Sinkholes are a kind of Earth movement resulting when surface earth falls into an underground cavity.", "They rarely injure people but may cause spectacular property damage. Cavities that produce sinkholes may form by the action of water containing dissolved carbon dioxide on limestone (see Chapter 3, Reaction 3.7); loss of underground water during drought or from heavy pumping, thus removing support that previously kept soil and rock from collapsing; heavy underground water flow; and other factors that remove solid material from underground strata. Special problems are presented by permanently frozen ground in arctic climates such as Alaska or Siberia. In such areas the ground may remain permanently frozen, thawing to only a shallow depth during the summer. This condition is called permafrost. Permafrost poses particular problems for construction, especially where the presence of a structure may result in thawing such that the structure rests in a pool of water-saturated muck on top of a slick surface of frozen water and soil. The construction and maintenance of highways, railroads, and pipelines, such as the Trans-Alaska pipeline in Alaska, can become quite difficult in the presence of permafrost. Some types of soils, particularly the so-called expansive clays, expand and shrink markedly as they become saturated with water and dry out. Although essentially never life-threatening, the movement of structures and the damage caused to them by expansive clays can be very high. Aside from years when catastrophic fl oods and earthquakes occur, the monetary damage done by the action of expansive soil exceeds that of earthquakes, landslides, floods, and coastal erosion combined! 15.13 STREAM AND RIVER PHENOMENA A stream consists of water flowing through a channel. The area of land from which water is drawn that flows into a stream is the stream\u2019s drainage basin. The sizes of streams are described by discharge defined as the volume of water flowing past a given point on the stream per unit time. Discharge and gradient, the steepness of the downward slope of a stream, determine the stream velocity. Internal processes raise masses of land and whole mountain ranges, which in turn are shaped by the action of streams. Streams cut down mountain ranges, create valleys, form plains, and produce great deposits of sediment, thus playing a key role in shaping the geospheric environment. Streams spontaneously develop bends and curves by cutting away the outer parts of stream banks and depositing materials on the inner parts. These curved features of streams are known as meanders. Left undisturbed, a stream forms meanders across a valley in a constantly changing pattern. The cutting away of material by the stream and the deposition of sediment eventually form a generally fl at area. During times of high stream flow, the stream leaves its banks, inundating parts or all of the valley, thus creating a fl oodplain. A fl ood occurs when a stream develops a high flow such that it leaves its banks and spills out onto the floodplain. Floods are arguably the most common and damaging of surface phenomena in the geosphere. Though natural and in many respects beneficial occurrences, floods cause damage to structures located in their paths, and the severity of their effects is greatly increased by human activities. A number of factors determine the occurrence and severity of floods. One of these is the tendency of particular geographic areas to receive large amounts of rain within short periods of time. One such area is located in the middle of the continental United States where warm, moisture-laden air from the Gulf of Mexico is carried northward during the spring months to collide with cold air from the north; the resultant cooling of the moist air can cause torrential rains to occur, resulting in severe flooding. In addition to season and geography, geological conditions have a strong effect on fl ooding potential. Rain falling on a steep surface tends to run off rapidly, creating flooding. A watershed can contain relatively massive quantities of rain if it consists of porous, permeable materials that allow a substantial rate of infiltration, assuming that it is not already saturated. Plants in a watershed tend to slow runoff and loosen soil, enabling additional infiltration. Through transpiration (see Chapter 16, Section 16.2), plants release moisture to the atmosphere quickly, enabling soil to absorb more moisture. Several terms are used to describe flooding. When the stage of a stream, that is, the elevation of the water surface, exceeds the stream bank level, the stream is said to be at fl ood stage. The highest stage attained defines the fl ood crest.", "Upstream fl oods occur close to the infl ow from the drainage basin, usually the result of intense rainfall. Whereas upstream floods usually affect smaller streams and watersheds, downstream floods occur on larger rivers that drain large areas. Widespread spring snowmelt and heavy, prolonged spring rains, often occurring together, cause downstream fl oods. Floods are made more intense by higher fractions and higher rates of runoff, both of which may be aggravated by human activities. This can be understood by comparing a vegetated drainage basin to one that has been largely denuded of vegetation and paved over. In the former case, rainfall is retained by vegetation, such as grass cover. Thus the potential flood water is delayed, the time span over which it enters a stream is extended, and a higher proportion of the water infiltrates into the ground. In the latter case, less rainfall infi ltrates, and the runoff tends to reach the stream quickly and to be discharged over a shorter time period, thus leading to more severe flooding. These factors are illustrated in Figure 15.10. The conventional response to the threat of flooding is to control a river, particularly by the construction of raised banks called levees. In addition to raising the banks to contain a stream, the stream channel may be straightened and deepened to increase the volume and velocity of water fl ow, a process called channelization. Although effective for common floods, these measures may exacerbate extreme floods by confining and increasing the flow of water upstream such that the Water volume per unit time High crest, capacity to handle water downstream is overwhelmed. Another solution is to construct dams to create reservoirs for flood control upstream. Usually such reservoirs are multipurpose facilities designed for water supply, recreation, and to control river flow for navigation in addition to fl ood control. The many reservoirs constructed for fl ood control in recent decades have been reasonably successful. There are, however, conflicts in the goals for their uses. Ideally, a reservoir for fl ood control should remain largely empty until needed to contain a large volume of fl oodwater, an approach that is obviously inconsistent with other uses. Another concern is that of exceeding the capacity of the reservoir, or dam failure, the latter of which can lead to catastrophic fl ooding. 15.14 PHENOMENA AT THE LAND/OCEAN INTERFACE The coastal interface between land masses and the ocean is an important area of environmental activity. The land along this boundary is under constant attack from the waves and currents from the ocean, so that most coastal areas are always changing. The most common structure of the coast is shown in cross section in Figure 15.11. The beach, consisting of sediment, such as sand formed by wave action on coastal rock, is a sloping area that is periodically inundated by ocean waves. Extending from approximately the high tide mark to the dunes lining the landward edge of the beach is a relatively level area called the berm, which is usually not washed over by ocean water. The level of water to which the beach is subjected varies with the tides. Through wind action the surface of the water is in constant motion as undulations called ocean waves. As these waves reach the shallow water along the beach, they \u201ctouch bottom\u201d and are transformed to breakers, characterized by crested tops. These breakers crashing onto a beach give it much of its charm, but can also be extremely destructive. Coastlines exhibit a variety of features. Steep valleys carved by glacial activity, then fi lled with rising seawater, constitute the fjords along the coast of Norway. Valleys, formerly on land, now fi lled with seawater, constitute drowned valleys. Estuaries occur where tidal saltwater mixes with infl owing freshwater. Erosion is a constant feature of a beachfront. Unconsolidated beach sand can be shifted readily\u2014sometimes spectacularly through great distances over short periods of time\u2014by wave action. Sand, pebbles, and rock in the form of rounded cobbles constantly wear against the coast by wave action, exerting a continuous abrasive action called milling. This action is augmented by the chemical weathering effects of seawater, in which the salt content may play a role. Some of the more striking alterations to coastlines occur during storms, such as hurricanes and typhoons. The low pressure that accompanies severe storms tends to suck ocean water upward.", "This effect, usually combined with strong winds blowing onshore and coinciding with high tide, can cause ocean water to wash over the berm on a beach to attack dunes or cliffs inland. Such a storm surge can remove large quantities of beach, damage dune areas, and wash away structures unwisely constructed too close to the shore. A storm surge associated with a hurricane washed away most of the structures in Galveston, Texas, in 1900, claiming 6000 lives, and, despite the protection of a large floodwall constructed after the 1900 hurricane, Galveston was largely destroyed by Hurricane Ike in September 2008. A major concern with respect to coastal storms is loss of beaches, which are highly prized for their recreational value. An especially vulnerable part of the coast consists of barrier islands\u2014long, low strips of land roughly paralleling the coast some distance offshore. High storm surges may wash completely over barrier islands, partially destroying them and shifting them around. Many dwellings unwisely constructed on barrier islands, such as the outer banks of North Carolina, have been destroyed by storm surges during hurricanes. 15.14.1 THE THREAT OF RISING SEA LEVELS Large numbers of people live at a level near, or in some cases below, sea level. As a result, any significant temporary or permanent rise in sea level poses significant risks to lives and property. Such an event occurred on February 1, 1953 when high tides and strong winds combined to breach the system of dikes protecting much of the Netherlands from seawater. About one-sixth of the country was flooded as far inland as 64 km from the coast, killing about 2000 people and leaving approximately 100,000 without homes. Although isolated instances of flooding by seawater caused by combinations of tidal and weather phenomena will continue to occur, a much more long-lasting threat is posed by long-term increases in sea level. These could result from global warming due to the greenhouse gas emissions discussed in Chapter 14. Several factors could raise ocean levels to destructive highs, also a result of greenhouse warming. Simple expansion of warmed oceanic water could raise sea levels by about 1/3 m over the next century. The melting of glaciers, such as those in the Alps, has probably raised ocean levels by about 5 cm during the last century, and the process is continuing. The greatest concern, however, is that global warming could cause the great West Antarctic ice sheet to melt, which would raise sea levels by as much as 6 m. In February and March 2002, a mass of ice larger than the state of Rhode Island became detached from the Antarctic Peninsula, raising fears that the Antarctic ice sheet may be melting relatively rapidly. The measurement of sea levels has proven to be a difficult task because the levels of the surface of land keep changing. Land most recently covered with Ice Age glaciers in areas such as Scandinavia is still \u201cspringing back\u201d from the immense mass of the glaciers, so that sea levels measured by gauges fixed on land actually appear to be dropping by several millimeters per year in such locations. An opposite situation exists on the east coast of North America where land was pushed outward and raised around the edge of the enormous sheet of ice that covered Canada and the northern United States about 20,000 years ago and is now settling back. Factors such as these illustrate the advantages of remarkably accurate satellite technology now used in the determination of sea levels. 15.15 PHENOMENA AT THE LAND/ATMOSPHERE INTERFACE The interface between the atmosphere and land is a boundary of intense environmental activity. The combined effects of air and water tend to cause significant changes to the land materials at this interface. The top layer of exposed land is especially susceptible to physical and chemical weathering. Here, air laden with oxidant oxygen contacts rock, originally formed under reducing conditions, causing oxidation reactions to occur. Acid naturally present in rainwater as dissolved CO2 or present as pollutant sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, or hydrochloric acid can dissolve portions of some kinds of rocks. Organisms such as lichens, which consist of fungi and algae growing symbiotically on rock surfaces, drawing carbon dioxide, oxygen, or nitrogen from air can grow on rock surfaces at the boundary of the atmosphere and geosphere, causing additional weathering to take place. One of the most significant agents affecting exposed geospheric solids at the atmosphere/geosphere boundary is wind.", "Consisting of air moving largely in a horizontal fashion, wind both erodes solids and acts as an agent to deposit solids on geospheric surfaces. The infl uence of wind is especially pronounced in dry areas. A major factor in wind erosion is wind abrasions in which solid particles of sand and rock carried by wind tend to wear away exposed rock and soil. Loose, unconsolidated sand and soil may be removed in large volumes by wind, a process called defl ation. The potential for wind to move matter is illustrated by the formation of large deposits of loess, consisting of finely divided soil carried by wind. Loess particles are typically several tens of micrometers in size, small enough to be carried great distances by wind. Especially common are loess deposits that originated with matter composed of rock ground to a fi ne flour by ice age glaciers. This material was first deposited in river valleys by flood waters issuing from melting glaciers and then blown some distance from the rivers by strong winds after drying out. One of the more common geospheric features created by wind is a dune, consisting of a mound of debris, usually sand, dropped when wind slows down. When a dune begins to form, it forms an obstruction that slows wind even more, so that more sediment is dropped. The result is that in the presence of sediment-laden wind, dunes several meters or more high may form rapidly. In forming a dune, heavier, coarser particles settle first so that the matter in dunes is sorted according to size, just like sediments deposited by flowing streams. In areas where winds are prevalently from one direction, as is usually the case, dunes show a typical shape as illustrated in Figure 15.12. It is seen that the steeply sloping side, called the slip face, is downwind. Some of the environmental effects of dunes result from their tendency to migrate with the prevailing winds. Migration occurs as matter is blown by the wind up the gently sloping face of the dune and falls down the slip face. Migrating sand dunes have inundated forest trees, and dust dunes in drought-stricken agricultural areas have filled road ditches, causing sharply increased maintenance costs. 15.16 EFFECTS OF ICE The power of ice to alter the geosphere is amply demonstrated by the remains of past glacial activity from the Ice Age. Those large areas of the Earth\u2019s surface that were once covered with layers of glacial ice 1 or 2 km in thickness show evidence of how the ice carved the surface, left massive piles of rock and gravel, and left rich deposits of freshwater. The enormous weight of glaciers on the Earth\u2019s surface compressed it, and in places it is still springing back 10,000 or so years after the glaciers retreated. Today the influence of ice on the Earth\u2019s surface is much less than it was during Migration ofdune crest Wind Sand movement the Ice Age, and there is substantial concern that melting of glaciers by greenhouse warming will raise sea levels so high that coastal areas will be inundated. Glaciers form at sufficiently high latitudes and altitudes such that snow does not melt completely each summer. This occurs when snow becomes compacted over several years to several thousand years such that the frozen water turns to crystals of true ice. Huge masses of ice with areas of several thousand square kilometers or more, and often around 1 km thick, occur in polar regions and are called continental glaciers. Both Greenland and the Antarctic are covered by continental glaciers. Alpine glaciers occupy mountain valleys. Glaciers on a slope flow as a consequence of their mass. This rate of flow is usually only a few meters per year, but may reach several kilometers per year. If a glacier flows into the sea, it may lose masses of ice as icebergs, a process called calving. Ice may also be lost by melting along the edges. The processes by which ice is lost are termed ablation. Glacial ice affects the surface of the geosphere by both erosion and deposition. It is easy to imagine that a flowing mass of glacial ice is very efficient in scraping away the surface over which it flows, a process called abrasion. Adding to the erosive effect is the presence of rocks frozen into the glaciers, which can act like tools to carve the surface of the underlying rock and soil.", "Whereas abrasion tends to wear rock surfaces away producing a fine rock powder, larger bits of rock can be dislodged from the surface over which the glacier flows and be carried along with the glacial ice. When glacial ice melts, the rock that has been incorporated into it is left behind. This material is called till, or if it has been carried for some distance by water running off the melting glacier it is called outwash. Piles of rock left by melting glaciers produce unique structures called moraines. Although the effects of glaciers described above are the most spectacular manifestations of the action of ice on the geosphere, at a much smaller level ice can have some very substantial effects. Freezing and expansion of water in pores and small crevices in rock are a major contributor to physical weathering processes. Freeze/thaw cycles are also very destructive to some kinds of structures, such as stone buildings. 15.17 EFFECTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES Human activities have profound effects on the geosphere. Such effects may be obvious and direct, such as strip mining, or rearranging vast areas for construction projects, such as roads and dams. Or the effects may be indirect, such as pumping so much water from underground aquifers that the ground subsides, or abusing soil such that it no longer supports plant life well and erodes. As the source of minerals and other resources used by humans, the geosphere is dug up, tunneled, stripped bare, rearranged, and subjected to many other kinds of indignities. The land is often severely disturbed, air can be polluted with dust particles during mining, and water may be polluted. Many of these effects, such as soil erosion caused by human activities, are addressed elsewhere in this book. 15.17.1 EXTRACTION OF GEOSPHERIC RESOURCES: SURFACE MINING Many human effects on the geosphere are associated with the extraction of resources from the Earth\u2019s crust. This is done in a number of ways, the most damaging of which can be surface mining. Surface mining is employed in the United States to extract virtually all of the rock and gravel that is mined, well over half of the coal, and numerous other resources. Properly done, with appropriate restoration practices, surface mining does minimal damage and may even be used to improve surface quality, such as by the construction of surface reservoirs where rock or gravel have been extracted. In earlier times before strict reclamation laws were in effect, surface mining, particularly of coal, left large areas of land scarred, devoid of vegetation, and subject to erosion. Several approaches are employed in surface mining. Sand and gravel located under water are extracted by dredging with draglines or chain buckets attached to large conveyers. In most cases resources are covered with an overburden of earthen material that does not contain any of the resource that is being sought. This material must be removed as spoil. Open-pit mining is, as the name implies, a procedure in which gravel, building stone, iron ore, and other materials are simply dug from a big hole in the ground. Some of these pits, such as several from which copper ore has been taken in the United States, are truly enormous in size. The most well-known (sometimes infamous) method of surface mining is strip mining, in which strips of overburden are removed by draglines and other heavy earth-moving equipment to expose seams of coal, phosphate rock, or other materials. Heavy equipment is used to remove a strip of overburden, and the exposed mineral resource is removed and hauled away. Overburden from a parallel strip is then removed and placed over the previously mined strip, and the procedure is repeated numerous times. Older practices left the replaced overburden as relatively steep erosion-prone banks. On highly sloping terrain, overburden is removed on progressively higher terraces and placed on the terrace immediately below. 15.17.2 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF MINING AND MINERAL EXTRACTION Some of the environmental effects of surface mining have been mentioned above. Although surface mining is most often considered for its environmental effects, subsurface mining may also have a number of effects, some of which are not immediately apparent and may be delayed for decades. Underground mines have a tendency to collapse, leading to severe subsidence. Mining disturbs groundwater aquifers. Water seeping through mines and mine tailings may become polluted.", "One of the more common and damaging effects of mining on water occurs when pyrite, FeS2, commonly associated with coal, is exposed to air and becomes oxidized to sulfuric acid by bacterial action to produce acid mine water (see Section 6.14). Some of the more damaging environmental effects of mining are the result of the processing of mined materials. Usually, ore is only part, often a small part, of the material that must be excavated. Various benefi ciation processes are employed to separate the useful fraction of ore, leaving a residue of tailings. A number of adverse effects can result from environmental exposure of tailings. For example, residues left from the beneficiation of coal are often enriched with pyrite, FeS2, which is oxidized microbiologically and chemically to produce damaging acidic drainage (acid mine water). Uranium ore tailings unwisely used as fill material have contaminated buildings with radioactive radon gas. 15.18 AIR POLLUTION AND THE GEOSPHERE The geosphere can be a significant source of air pollutants. Of these geospheric sources, volcanic activity is one of the most common. Volcanic eruptions, fumaroles, hot springs, and geysers can emit toxic and acidic gases, including carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen sulfi de. Greenhouse gases that tend to increase global climatic warming\u2014carbon dioxide and methane\u2014 can come from volcanic sources. Massive volcanic eruptions may inject huge amounts of particulate matter into the atmosphere. The incredibly enormous 1883 eruption of the East Indies volcano Krakatoa blew about 2.5 km3 of solid matter into the atmosphere, some of which penetrated well into the stratosphere. This material stayed aloft long enough to circle Earth several times, causing red sunsets and a measurable lowering of temperature worldwide. The 1982 eruption of the southern Mexico volcano El Chic\u00f3n showed the importance of the type of particulate matter in determining effects on climate. The matter given off by this eruption was unusually rich in sulfur, so that an aerosol of sulfuric acid formed and persisted in the atmosphere for about 3 years, during which time the mean global temperature was lowered by several tenths of a degree due to the presence of atmospheric sulfuric acid. By way of contrast, the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington State in the United States 2 years earlier had little perceptible effect on climate, although the amount of material blasted into the atmosphere was about the same as that from El Chic\u00f3n. The material from the Mount St Helens eruption had comparatively little sulfur in it, so the climatic effects were minimal. Thermal smelting processes used to convert metal fractions in ore into usable forms have caused a number of severe air pollution problems that have affected the geosphere. Many metals are present in ores as sulfides, and smelting can release large quantities of sulfur dioxide, as well as particles that contain heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, or lead. The resulting acid and heavy metal pollution of surrounding land can cause severe damage to vegetation so that devastating erosion occurs. One such area is around a large nickel smelter in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, where a large area of land has become denuded of vegetation. Similar dead zones have been produced by copper smelters in Tennessee and in eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union. Soil and its cultivation produce significant quantities of atmospheric emissions. Waterlogged soil, particularly that cultivated for rice, generates significant quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas. The microbial reduction of nitrate in soil releases nitrous oxide, N2O, to the atmosphere. However, soil and rock can also remove atmospheric pollutants. It is believed that microorganisms in soil account for the loss from the atmosphere of some carbon monoxide, which some fungi and bacteria can metabolize. Carbonate rocks, such as calcium carbonate, CaCO3, can neutralize acid from atmospheric sulfuric acid and acid gases. As discussed in Section 9.6, masses of atmospheric air can become trapped and stagnant under conditions of a temperature inversion in which the vertical circulation of air is limited by the presence of a relatively warm layer of air overlaying a colder layer at ground level. The effects of inversions can be aggravated by topographical conditions that tend to limit circulation of air. Figure 15.13 shows such a condition in which surrounding mountain ridges limit horizontal air movement. Air pollutants may be forced up a mountain ridge from a polluted area to signifi cantly higher altitudes than they would otherwise reach.", "Because of this \u201cchimney effect,\u201d air pollutants may reach mountain pine forests that are particularly susceptible to damage from air pollutants such as ozone formed along with photochemical smog. 15.19 WATER POLLUTION AND THE GEOSPHERE Water pollution is addressed in detail elsewhere in this book. Much water pollution arises from interactions of groundwater and surface water with the geosphere.7 These aspects are addressed briefl y here. The relationship between water and the geosphere is twofold. The geosphere may be severely damaged by water pollution. This occurs, for example, when water pollutants produce contaminated sediments, such as those polluted by heavy metals or PCBs. In some cases the geosphere serves as a source of water pollutants. Examples include acid produced by exposed metal sulfides in the geosphere or synthetic chemicals improperly discarded in landfills and leaking into groundwater. Confining topography Warmer The sources of water pollution are divided into two main categories. The first of these consists of point sources, which enter the environment at a single, readily identified entry point. An example of a point source would be a sewage water outflow. Point sources tend to be those directly identifi ed as having their origins from human activities. Nonpoint sources of pollution are those from broader areas. Such a source is water contaminated by fertilizer from fertilized agricultural land, or water contaminated with excess alkali leached from alkaline soils. Nonpoint sources are relatively harder to identify and monitor. Pollutants associated with the geosphere are usually nonpoint sources. An especially common and damaging geospheric source of water pollutants consists of sediments carried by water from land into the bottoms of bodies of water. Most such sediments originate from agricultural land that has been disturbed such that soil particles are eroded from land into water. The most common manifestation of sedimentary material in water is opacity, which seriously detracts from the esthetics of the water. Sedimentary material deposited in reservoirs or canals can clog them and eventually make them unsuitable for water supply, flood control, navigation, and recreation. Suspended sediment in water used as a water supply can clog filters and add signifi cantly to the cost of treating the water. Sedimentary material can devastate wildlife habitats by reducing food supplies and ruining nesting sites. Turbidity in water can severely curtail photosynthesis, thus reducing primary productivity necessary to sustain the food chains of aquatic ecosystems. 15.20 WASTE DISPOSAL AND THE GEOSPHERE The geosphere receives many kinds and large amounts of wastes. Its ability to cope with such wastes with minimal damage is one of its most important characteristics and is dependent upon the kinds of wastes disposed of on it. A variety of wastes, ranging from large quantities of relatively innocuous municipal refuse to much smaller quantities of potentially lethal radioactive wastes, are deposited on land or in landfills. These are addressed briefly in this section. 15.20.1 MUNICIPAL REFUSE The currently favored method for disposing of municipal solid wastes\u2014household garbage\u2014is in sanitary landfills (Figure 15.14) consisting of refuse piled on top of the ground or into a depression such as a valley, compacted, and covered at frequent intervals by soil. This approach permits frequent covering of the refuse so that loss of blowing trash, water contamination, and other undesirable effects are minimized. A completed landfill can be put to beneficial uses, such as a recreational area; because of settling, gas production, and other factors, landfill surfaces are generally not suitable for building construction. Modern sanitary landfills are much preferable to the open dump sites that were once the most common means of municipal refuse disposal. Although municipal refuse is much less dangerous than hazardous chemical waste, it still poses some hazards. Despite prohibitions against the disposal of cleaners, solvents, lead storage batteries, and other potentially hazardous materials in landfills, materials that pose some environmental hazards do find their way into landfills and can contaminate their surroundings. Landfills produce both gaseous and aqueous emissions. Biomass in landfi lls quickly depletes oxygen by aerobic biodegradation of microorganisms in the landfi ll, {CH2O} (biomass) + O2 \u00c6 CO2 + H2O (15.8) emitting carbon dioxide. Over a period of many decades the buried biodegradable materials undergo anaerobic biodegradation 2{CH2O} \u00c6 CO2 + CH4 (15.9) releasing methane as well as carbon dioxide. Although often impractical and too expensive, it is desirable to reclaim the methane as fuel, and some large sanitary landfills are major sources of methane. Released methane is a greenhouse gas and can pose significant explosion hazards to structures built on landfills.", "Although produced in much smaller quantities than methane, hydrogen sulfi de, H2S, is also generated by anaerobic biodegradation. This gas is toxic and has a bad odor. In a properly designed sanitary landfill, hydrogen sulfide releases are small and the gas tends to oxidize before it reaches the atmosphere in signifi cant quantities. Water infiltrating into sanitary landfills dissolves materials from the disposed refuse and runs off as leachate. Contaminated leachate is the single greatest potential pollution problem with refuse disposal sites, so it is important to minimize its production by designing landfills in a way that keeps water infiltration as low as possible. The anaerobic degradation of biomass produces organic acids that give the leachate a tendency to dissolve acid-soluble solutes, such as heavy metals. Leachate can infiltrate into groundwater posing severe contamination problems. This is minimized by siting sanitary landfills over formations of poorly permeable clay or depositing layers of clay in the landfi ll before refuse is put in it. In addition, impermeable synthetic polymer liners may be placed in the bottom of the landfill. In areas of substantial rainfall, infiltration into the landfill exceeds its capacity to hold water so that leachate flows out. In order to prevent water pollution downstream, this leachate should be controlled and treated. Hazardous chemical wastes are disposed of in the so-called secure landfills, which are designed to prevent leakage and geospheric contamination of toxic chemicals disposed of in them. Such a landfill is equipped with a variety of measures to prevent contamination of groundwater and the surrounding geosphere. The base of the landfill is made of compacted clay that is largely impermeable to leachate. An impermeable polymer liner is placed over the clay liner. The surface of the landfill is covered with material designed to reduce water infiltration, and the surface is designed with slopes that also minimize the amount of water running in. Elaborate drainage systems are installed to collect and treat leachate. The most pressing matter pertaining to geospheric disposal of wastes involves radioactive wastes. Most of these wastes are low-level wastes, including discarded radioactive laboratory chemicals and pharmaceuticals, filters used in nuclear reactors, and ion-exchange resins used to remove small quantities of radionuclides from nuclear reactor cooler water. Disposed of in properly designed landfills, such wastes pose minimal hazards. Of greater concern are the high-level radioactive wastes, primarily fission products of nuclear power reactors and by-products of nuclear weapons manufacture. Many of these wastes are currently stored as solutions in tanks, many of which have outlived their useful lifetimes and pose leakage hazards, at sites such as the federal nuclear facility at Hanford, Washington, where plutonium was generated in large quantities during post-World War II years. Eventually, such wastes must be placed in the geosphere such that they will pose no hazards. Numerous proposals have been advanced for their disposal, including disposal in salt formations, subduction zones in the seafl oor, and ice sheets. The most promising sites appear to be those in poorly permeable formations of igneous rock. Among these are basalts, which are strong, glassy igneous types of rock found in the Columbia River plateau. Granite and pyroclastic welded tuffs fused by past high-temperature volcanic eruptions are other possibilities as sites for disposing of nuclear wastes and keeping them isolated for tens of thousands of years.

One way in which coal and other fossil fuels may be used without contributing to higher levels of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is through carbon sequestration by pumping carbon dioxide into mineral strata. Explain with a chemical reaction how formations of limestone (calcium carbonate) might be used for this purpose. Suggest how this might cause problems on the surface. 18. Deposits of iron minerals are often found where groundwater flows to the surface. Use a chemical reaction to explain this observation. 16 Soil and Agricultural Environmental Chemistry 16.1 SOIL AND AGRICULTURE Because of its role in supporting plant growth, soil is a crucial part of the geosphere. Like the very sparse layer of stratospheric ozone that is essential to protect terrestrial organisms from destructive solar ultraviolet radiation, the layer of soil on the earth\u2019s surface is extremely thin. If Earth were the size of a geography-class globe, the average thickness of productive soil on its surface would be less than that of a human cell! Because of its importance in sustainability and its fragile nature, soil and production of food and materials from it are discussed in some detail in this chapter. Soil and agricultural practices are strongly tied with the environment and sustainability. Some of these considerations are addressed later in this chapter along with a discussion of soil erosion and conservation. Cultivation of land and agricultural practices along with other anthrospheric activities strongly influence the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the biosphere. Although this chapter deals primarily with soil, the topic of agriculture in general is introduced for perspective. Although the most obvious use of soil is for plant growth leading to food production, it serves many functions in the maintenance of sustainability. It holds water, regulates water supplies, and serves as a medium to filter and conduct water from precipitation into groundwater aquifers. It serves to recycle raw materials and nutrients. It is a habitat for a large variety of organisms, especially fungi and bacteria. Soil interfaces with the anthrosphere as an engineering medium that is dug up, moved, and smoothed over to make roads, dams, and other engineering constructs. The study of soil is called pedology or, more simply, soil science. To humans and most terrestrial organisms, soil is the most important part of the geosphere. Though only a tissue-thin layer compared to the earth\u2019s total diameter, soil is the medium that produces most of the food required by most living things. Good soil\u2014and a climate conducive to its productivity\u2014is the most valuable asset a society can have. In addition to being the site of most food production, soil is the receptor of large quantities of pollutants, such as particulate matter from power plant smokestacks. Fertilizers, pesticides, and some other materials applied to soil often contribute to water and air pollution. Therefore, soil is a key component of environmental chemical cycles. It is a valuable part of the earth\u2019s natural capital. Soil itself can become an air or water pollutant, especially when it has been abused by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, or desertification. Fine soil particles make up a large fraction of the matter in yellow clouds described as massive air pollution phenomena in Chapter 15. Furthermore, topsoil washed into streams and bodies of water by water erosion can be deposited as damaging sediments. 16.1.1 AGRICULTURE Agriculture, the production of food by growing crops and livestock, provides for the most basic of human needs. No other industry impacts as much as agriculture does on the environment. Agriculture is absolutely essential for the maintenance of the huge human populations now on Earth. The displacement of native plants, destruction of wildlife habitat, erosion, pesticide pollution, and other environmental aspects of agriculture have enormous potential for environmental damage. Survival of humankind on Earth demands environmentally friendly and sustainable agricultural practices. On the other hand, growth of domestic crops removes (at least temporarily) greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and provides potential sources of renewable resources of energy and fiber that can substitute for petroleum-derived fuels and materials. Agriculture can be divided into the two main categories of crop farming, in which plant photosynthesis is used to produce food and fi ber, and livestock farming, in which domesticated animals are grown for meat, milk, and other animal products.", "Crop farming produces food consumed directly by humans, food for livestock, and fiber. Livestock farming involves the raising of animals for meat, dairy products, eggs, wool, and hides. Freshwater fish and even crayfish are raised on \u201cfi sh farms.\u201d Beekeeping provides honey. Agriculture is based on domestic plants engineered by early farmers from their wild plant ancestors. Without perhaps much of an awareness of what they were doing, early farmers selected plants with desired characteristics for the production of food. This selection of plants for domestic use brought about evolutionary change so profound that the products often barely resembled their wild ancestors. Plant breeding based on scientific principles of heredity is a very recent development dating from around 1900. One of the major objectives of plant breeding has been to increase yield. Yields of crops can also be increased by selecting for resistance to insects, drought, and cold. In some cases, the goal is to increase nutritional value, such as raising the content of essential amino acids. The development of hybrids has vastly increased yields and other desired characteristics of a number of important crops. Basically, hybrids are the offspring of crosses between two different true-breeding strains. Often quite different from either parent strain, hybrids tend to exhibit \u201chybrid vigor\u201d and to have significantly higher yields. The most success with hybrid crops has been obtained with corn (maize). Corn is one of the easiest plants to hybridize because of the physical separation of the male flowers, which grow as tassels on top of the corn plant, from female flowers, which are attached to incipient ears on the side of the plant. Despite past successes by more conventional means and some early disappointments with \u201cgenetic engineering,\u201d application of recombinant DNA technology (Section 16.13) will probably eventually overshadow all the advances ever made in plant breeding. In addition to plant strains and varieties, numerous other factors are involved in crop production. Weather is an obvious factor and shortages of water, chronic in many areas of the world, are mitigated by irrigation. Here, automated techniques and computer control can play an important, more environmentally friendly role by minimizing the quantities of water required. The application of chemical fertilizer has vastly increased crop yields. The judicious application of pesticides, especially herbicides, but including insecticides and fungicides as well, has increased crop yields and reduced losses greatly. Use of herbicides has had an environmental benefit in reducing the degree of mechanical cultivation of soil required. Indeed, \u201cno-till\u201d and \u201clow-till\u201d agriculture (conservation tillage) are now widely practiced on a large scale. The rearing of domestic animals may have significant environmental effects. Effluent from waste lagoons associated with concentrated livestock feeding operations can cause serious water pollution problems. Goats and sheep have destroyed pastureland in the Near East, Northern Africa, Portugal, and Spain. Of particular concern are the environmental effects of raising cattle. Signifi cant amounts of forest land have been converted to marginal pasture land to raise beef. Production of one pound of beef requires about four times as much water and four times as much feed as does production of one pound of chicken. An interesting aspect of the problem is emission of greenhouse-gas methane by anaerobic bacteria in the digestive systems of cattle and other ruminant animals; cattle rank right behind wetlands and rice paddies as producers of atmospheric methane. However, because of the action of specialized bacteria in their stomachs, cattle and other ruminant animals are capable of converting otherwise unusable cellulose to food. 16.1.2 PESTICIDES AND AGRICULTURE Pesticides, particularly insecticides and herbicides, are an integral part of modern agricultural production. In the United States, agricultural pesticides are regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), first passed in 1947, revised in a major way in 1972, and subjected to several amendments since then. Pesticides are responsible for much of the high productivity of modern agriculture as well as some of the major pollution problems associated with agriculture. An interesting development regarding the use of herbicides in the late 1990s was the production of transgenic crops resistant to specific herbicides. The Monsanto company pioneered this approach with the development of \u201cRoundup Ready\u201d crops that resist the herbicidal effects of Monsanto\u2019s fl agship Roundup\u00ae herbicide (glyphosate). The seedlings of crops resistant to the herbicide are not harmed on exposure to it, whereas competing weeds are killed.", "Although sales of glyphosate have been greatly increased by Roundup Ready crops, especially soybeans, increased plantings of these crops has reduced the use of herbicides overall with a net overall benefit to the environment. The use on transgenic crops of glyphosate, for which the structural formula is shown in Chapter 7, Figure 7.14, has made it a uniquely important product, the most widely produced pesticide in the world. Glyphosate binds strongly to soil colloids and is readily degraded by soil microorganisms. The properties of glyphosate make it difficult to measure in soil and water samples. The molecule is very polar and soluble in water, but not soluble in organic solvents commonly used to extract pollutants for analysis. It binds strongly to metal ions as well as organic, mineral, and clay solids making its isolation difficult. Because of glyphosate\u2019s structural similarity to naturally occurring amino acids and other plant biomolecules, there are numerous interferences in its determination. 16.2 NATURE AND COMPOSITION OF SOIL Soil, a variable mixture of minerals, organic matter, and water capable of supporting plant life on the earth\u2019s surface, is the most fundamental requirement for agriculture. It is the final product of the weathering action of physical, chemical, and biological processes on rocks, which largely produces clay minerals. The organic portion of soil consists of plant biomass in various stages of decay. High populations of bacteria, fungi, and animals such as earthworms may be found in soil. Soil contains air spaces and generally has a loose texture (Figure 16.1). Adsorbed water layer Soil solid particle Air space Soil saturated with water O horizon from decayed and decaying plant biomass A horizon, topsoil, rich in partiallydecayed organic matter (humus),plant roots, high biological activity E horizon, layer of elution of clayand aluminum and iron oxides,generally weathered, leached B horizon, subsoil, accumulationof organic matter, salts, and clayseluted from upper layers C horizon, weatheredparent rock Bedrock The solid fraction of typical productive soil is approximately 5% organic matter and 95% inorganic matter. Some soils, such as peat soils, may contain as much as 95% organic material. Other soils contain as little as 1% organic matter. Typical soils exhibit distinctive layers called horizons, with increasing depth (Figure 16.2). Horizons form as a result of complex interactions among processes that occur during weathering. Rainwater percolating through soil carries dissolved and colloidal solids to lower horizons where they are deposited. Biological processes, such as bacterial decay of residual plant biomass, produce slightly acidic CO2, organic acids, and complexing compounds that are carried by rainwater to lower horizons where they interact with clays and other minerals, altering the properties of the minerals. The top layer of soil, typically several inches in thickness, is known as the A horizon, or topsoil. This is the layer of maximum biological activity in the soil, contains most of the soil organic matter, and is essential for plant productivity. Various soils may have a variety of horizons, the main ones of which are described in Figure 16.2. Soils exhibit a large variety of characteristics that are used for their classification for various purposes, including crop production, road construction, and waste disposal. Soil profiles are discussed above. The parent rocks from which soils are formed obviously play a strong role in determining the composition of soils. Other soil characteristics include strength, workability, soil particle size, permeability, and degree of maturity. 16.2.1 WATER AND AIR IN SOIL Large quantities of water are required for the production of most plant materials. For example, several hundred kilograms of water are required to produce 1 kg of dry hay. Water is part of the three-phase, solid\u2212liquid\u2212gas system making up soil. It is the basic transport medium for carrying essential plant nutrients from solid soil particles into plant roots and to the farthest reaches of the plant\u2019s leaf structure (Figure 16.3). The water in a plant evaporates into the atmosphere from the plant\u2019s leaves, a process called transpiration. Normally, because of the small size of soil particles and the presence of small capillaries and pores in the soil, the water phase is not totally independent of soil solid matter. The availability of water to plants is governed by gradients arising from capillary and gravitational forces. The availability of K+, NO3\u2013, HPO4 2\u2013, other nutrients nutrient solutes in water depends upon concentration gradients and electrical potential gradients. Water present in larger spaces of soil is relatively more available to plants and readily drains away.", "Water held in smaller pores or between the unit layers of clay particles is held much more strongly. Soils high in organic matter may hold appreciably more water than other soils, but it is relatively less available to plants because of physical and chemical sorption of the water by the organic matter. There is a very strong interaction between clays and water in soil. Water is absorbed on the surfaces of clay particles. Because of the high surface/volume ratio of colloidal clay particles, a great deal of water may be bound in this manner. Water is also held between the unit layers of the expanding clays, such as the montmorillonite clays. As soil becomes waterlogged (water-saturated), it undergoes drastic changes in physical, chemical, and biological properties. Oxygen in such soil is rapidly used up by the respiration of microorganisms that degrade soil organic matter. In such soils, the bonds holding soil colloidal particles together are broken, which causes disruption of soil structure. Thus, the excess water in such soils is detrimental to plant growth, and the soil does not contain the air required by most plant roots. Most useful crops, with the notable exception of rice, cannot grow on waterlogged soils. One of the most marked chemical effects of waterlogging is a reduction of pE by the action of organic reducing agents acting through bacterial catalysts. Thus, the redox condition of the soil becomes much more reducing, and the soil pE may drop from that of water in equilibrium with air (+13.6 at pH 7) to 1 or less. One of the more significant results of this change is the mobilization of iron and manganese as soluble iron(II) and manganese(II) through reduction of their insoluble higher oxides: MnO2 + 4H++ 2e -\u00c6 Mn2++ 2H2O (16.1) Fe2O3 + 6H++ 2e -\u00c6 2Fe2++ 3H2O (16.2) Although soluble manganese is generally found in soil as Mn2+ ion, soluble iron(II) occurs frequently as negatively charged iron\u2212organic chelates. Strong chelation of iron(II) by soil fulvic acids (Chapter 3) apparently enables reduction of iron(III) oxides at more positive pE values than would otherwise be possible. This causes an upward shift in the Fe(II)\u2212Fe(OH)3 boundary as shown in Figure 4.4. Some soluble metal ions such as Fe2+ and Mn2+ are toxic to plants at high levels. Their oxidation to insoluble oxides may cause formation of deposits of Fe2O3 and MnO2, which clog tile drains in fi elds. Roughly 35% of the volume of typical soil is composed of air-filled pores. Whereas the normal dry atmosphere at sea level contains 21% O2 and 0.04% CO2 by volume, these percentages may be quite different in soil air because of the decay of organic matter: {CH2O} + O2 \u00c6 CO2 + H2O (16.3) This process consumes oxygen and produces CO2. As a result, the oxygen content of air in soil may be as low as 15% and the carbon dioxide content may be several percent higher. Thus, the decay of organic matter in soil increases the equilibrium level of dissolved CO2 in groundwater. This lowers the pH and contributes to weathering of carbonate minerals, particularly calcium carbonate (see Reaction 3.7). As discussed in Section 16.3, CO2 also shifts the equilibrium of the process by which roots absorb metal ions from soil. 16.2.2 THE INORGANIC COMPONENTS OF SOIL The weathering of parent rocks and minerals to form the inorganic soil components results ultimately in the formation of inorganic colloids. These colloids are repositories of water and plant nutrients, which may be made available to plants as needed. Inorganic soil colloids often absorb toxic substances in soil, thus playing a role in detoxification of substances that otherwise would harm plants. The abundance and nature of inorganic colloidal material in soil are obviously important factors in determining soil productivity. The uptake of plant nutrients by roots often involves complex interactions with the water and inorganic phases. For example, a nutrient held by inorganic colloidal material has to traverse the mineral/water interface and then the water/root interface. This process is often strongly infl uenced by the ionic structure of soil inorganic matter. As noted in Section 15.2, the most common elements on the earth\u2019s crust are oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Therefore, minerals composed of these elements\u2014particularly silicon and oxygen\u2014constitute most of the mineral fraction of the soil. Common soil mineral constituents are finely divided quartz (SiO2), orthoclase (KAlSi3O8), albite (NaAlSi3O8), epidote (4CaO . 3(AlFe)2O3 . 6SiO2 . H2O), geothite (FeO(OH)), magnetite (Fe3O4), calcium and magnesium carbonates (CaCO3, CaCO3 .", "MgCO3), and oxides of manganese and titanium. 16.2.3 ORGANIC MATTER IN SOIL Though typically comprising <5% of a productive soil, organic matter largely determines soil productivity. It serves as a source of food for microorganisms, undergoes chemical reactions such as ion exchange, and infl uences the physical properties of soil. Some organic compounds even contribute to the weathering of mineral matter, the process by which soil is formed. For example, C2O42-, oxalate ion, produced as a soil fungi metabolite, occurs in soil as the calcium salts whewellite and weddelite. Oxalate in soil water dissolves minerals, thus speeding the weathering process and increasing the availability of nutrient ion species. This weathering process involves oxalate complexation of iron or aluminum in minerals, represented by the reaction 3H++ M(OH)3(s) + 2CaC2O4(s) \u00c6 M(C2O4)2 -(aq) + 2Ca2+(aq) + 3H2O (16.4) in which M is Al or Fe. Some soil fungi produce citric acid and other chelating organic acids that react with silicate minerals and release potassium and other nutrient metal ions held by these minerals. The strong chelating agent, 2-ketogluconic acid, H OHO H H C C C HO C C OH H H OH OH O 2-Ketogluconic acid is produced by some soil bacteria. By solubilizing metal ions, it may contribute to the weathering of minerals. It may also be involved in the release of phosphate from insoluble phosphate compounds. Biologically active components of the organic soil fraction include polysaccharides, amino sugars, nucleotides, and organic sulfur and phosphorus compounds. Humus, a water-insoluble material that biodegrades very slowly, makes up the bulk of soil organic matter. The organic compounds in soil are summarized in Table 16.1. The accumulation of organic matter in soil is strongly influenced by temperature and by the availability of oxygen. Since the rate of biodegradation decreases with decreasing temperature, organic matter does not degrade rapidly in colder climates and tends to build up in soil. In water and in waterlogged soils, decaying vegetation does not have easy access to oxygen, and organic matter accumulates. The organic content may reach 90% in areas where plants grow and decay in soil saturated with water. The presence of naturally occurring polynuclear aromatic (PAH) compounds is an interesting feature of soil organic matter. These compounds, some of which are carcinogenic, are discussed as air pollutants in Chapters 10 and 12. PAH compounds found in soil include fl uoranthene, pyrene, and chrysene. PAH compounds in soil result from combustion from both natural sources (grass fires) or pollutant sources. Terpenes and plant pigments, such as b-carotene, also occur in soil organic matter. TABLE 16.1 Major Classes of Organic Compounds in Soil Compound Type Composition Signif cance Humus Degradation-resistant residue from plant Most abundant organic component, improves decay, largely C, H, and O soil physical properties, exchanges nutrients, reservoir of fi xed N Fats, resins, and waxes Lipids extractable by organic solvents Generally, only several percent of soil organic matter, may adversely affect soil physical properties by repelling water, perhaps phytotoxic Saccharides Cellulose, starches, hemi cellulose, gums Major food source for soil microorganisms, help stabilize soil aggregates N-containing organics Nitrogen bound to humus, amino acids, Provide nitrogen for soil fertility amino sugars, other compounds Phosphorus compounds Phosphate esters, inositol phosphates Sources of plant phosphate (phytic acid), phospholipids 16.2.4 SOIL HUMUS Of the organic components listed in Table 16.1, soil humus is by far the most signifi cant.1 Humus, composed of a base-soluble fraction called humic and fulvic acids (described in Section 3.17), and an insoluble fraction called humin, is the residue left when bacteria and fungi biodegrade plant material. The bulk of plant biomass consists of relatively degradable cellulose and degradation-resistant lignin, which is a polymeric substance with a higher carbon content than cellulose. Among lignin\u2019s prominent chemical components are aromatic rings connected by alkyl chains, methoxyl groups, and hydroxyl groups. These structural artifacts occur in soil humus and give it many of its characteristic properties. The process by which humus is formed is called humifi cation. Soil humus is similar to its lignin precursors, but has more carboxylic acid groups. Part of each molecule of humic substance is non-polar and hydrophobic, and part is polar and hydrophilic. Such molecules are called amphiphiles, and they form micelles (see Section 5.4 and Figure 5.4) in which the nonpolar parts compose the inside of small colloidal particles and the polar functional groups are on the outside. Amphiphilic humic substances probably also form bilayer surface coatings on mineral grains in soil.", "During the humification process, the nitrogen/carbon ratio of the organic matter increases as carbon is lost to CO2 evolved during biodegradation and nitrogen fixed by nitrogen-fixing bacteria is incorporated into the humic residue. Humic substances infl uence soil properties to a degree out of proportion to their small percentage in soil. They strongly bind metals and serve to hold micronutrient metal ions in soil. Because of their acid\u2013base character, humic substances serve as buffers in soil. The water-holding capacity of soil is significantly increased by humic substances. These materials also stabilize aggregates of soil particles and increase the sorption of organic compounds by soil. Humic materials in soil strongly sorb many solutes in soil water and have a particular affi nity for heavy polyvalent cations. Soil humic substances may contain levels of uranium more than 104 times that of the water with which they are in equilibrium. Thus, water becomes depleted of its cations (or purified) in passing through humic-rich soils. Humic substances in soils also have a strong affi nity for organic compounds with low water solubility such as DDT or atrazine, a herbicide widely used to kill weeds in corn fields (see structural formula in Chapter 7, Figure 7.12). In some cases, there is a strong interaction between the organic and inorganic portions of soil. This is especially true of the strong complexes formed between clays and humic (fulvic) acid compounds. In many soils, 50\u2212100% of soil carbon is complexed with clay. These complexes play a role in determining the physical properties of soil, soil fertility, and stabilization of soil organic matter. One of the mechanisms for the chemical binding between clay colloidal particles and humic organic particles is probably of the flocculation type (see Chapter 5) in which anionic organic molecules with carboxylic acid functional groups serve as bridges in combination with cations to bind clay colloidal particles together as a floc. Support is given to this hypothesis by the known ability of NH4 +, Al3+, Ca2+, and Fe3+ cations to stimulate clay\u2212organic complex formation. The synthesis, chemical reactions, and biodegradation of humic materials are affected by interaction with clays. The lower-molecular-mass fulvic acids may be bound to clay, occupying spaces in layers in the clay. 16.2.5 THE SOIL SOLUTION The soil solution is the aqueous portion of soil that contains dissolved matter from soil chemical and biochemical processes in soil and from exchange with the hydrosphere and biosphere. This medium transports chemical species to and from soil particles and provides intimate contact between the solutes and the soil particles. In addition to providing water for plant growth, it is an essential pathway for the exchange of plant nutrients between roots and solid soil. A major challenge with respect to soil solution is obtaining a sample of it. The most straightforward means is collection of drainage water, but that may miss soil solution bound in capillaries and on surface films. Pressure/vacuum treatment, centrifugation, or displacement with another liquid may be employed. Most of the solutes in soil are present as salts composed of H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+ cations (with lower levels of Fe2+, Mn2+, and Al3+) and HCO3 -, CO32-, HSO4 -, SO42-, Cl-, and F- anions. The Fe2+, Mn2+, and Al3+ cations are generally present in hydrolyzed forms or bound with humic substances. - Some anions become bound with H+ (e.g., HCO3 formed from CO32-). Multicharged ions tend to form ion pairs in solution such as CaSO4(aq). 16.3 ACID\u2013BASE AND ION-EXCHANGE REACTIONS IN SOILS One of the more important chemical functions of soils is the exchange of cations. As discussed in Chapter 5, the capacity of a sediment or soil to exchange cations is expressed as the CEC, the number of meq of monovalent cations that can be exchanged per 100 g of soil (on a dry-weight basis). The CEC should be looked upon as a conditional constant since it may vary with soil conditions such as pE and pH. Both the mineral and organic portions of soils exchange cations. Clay minerals exchange cations because of the presence of negatively charged sites on the mineral, resulting from the substitution of an atom of lower oxidation number for one of higher number, for example, magnesium for aluminum. Organic materials exchange cations because of the presence of the carboxylate group and other basic functional groups. Humus typically has a very high CEC.", "The CEC of peat may range from 300 to 400 meq/100 g. Values of CEC for soils with more typical levels of organic matter are around 10\u221230 meq/100 g. Cation exchange in soil is the mechanism by which potassium, calcium, magnesium, and essential trace-level metals are made available to plants. When nutrient metal ions are taken up by plant roots, hydrogen ion is exchanged for the metal ions. This process, plus the leaching of calcium, magnesium, and other metal ions from the soil by water containing carbonic acid, tends to make the soil acidic: - {Soil}Ca2++ 2CO2 + 2H2O \u00c6 {Soil}(H+)2 + Ca2+(root) + 2HCO3 (16.5) Soil acts as a buffer and resists changes in pH. The buffering capacity depends upon the type of soil. The oxidation of pyrite, FeS2, in soil causes formation of acid-sulfate soils, sometimes called \u201ccat clays\u201d: 72++ 2 FeS + O + HO \u00c6 Fe + 2H + 2SO (16.6) 2222 4 Cat clay soils may have pH values as low as 3.0. These soils, which are commonly found in Delaware, Florida, New Jersey, and North Carolina, are formed when neutral or basic marine sediments containing FeS2 become acidic upon oxidation of pyrite when exposed to air. For example, soil reclaimed from marshlands and used for citrus groves has developed high acidity detrimental to plant growth. In addition, H2S released by reaction of FeS2 with acid is very toxic to citrus roots. Soils are tested for potential acid-sulfate formation using a peroxide test. This test consists of oxidizing FeS2 in the soil with 30% H2O2, 3++ 2 FeS + 15H O \u00c6 Fe + H + 2SO + 7H O (16.7) 2222 42 then testing for acidity and sulfate. Appreciable levels of sulfate and a pH below 3.0 indicate potential to form acid-sulfate soils. If the pH is above 3.0, either little FeS2 is present or suffi cient CaCO3 is in the soil to neutralize the H2SO4 and acidic Fe3+. Pyrite-containing mine spoils (residue left over from mining) also form soils similar to acid-sulfate soils of marine origin.2 In addition to producing acid, pyrite wastes can evolve phytotoxic H2S. A phytotoxic agent associated with acidic soils is aluminum as the Al3+ ion.3 As the third most abundant element in the Earth\u2019s crust and a major component of clays, aluminum is present in most soils. It poses no problem in alkaline or neutral soils in which aluminum is bound as insoluble forms such as Al(OH)3, but becomes toxic to plants in acidic soils that liberate soluble Al3+ ion. Aluminum toxicity to plants is a problem for the cultivation of approximately 8 billion acres of land worldwide that suffer from excess acidity, including about 86 million acres in the United States. It is believed that aluminum is toxic to plants because of its adverse effects on root tips. Barley is especially susceptible to the toxic effects of aluminum whereas wheat and corn tolerate the metal relatively well. These aluminum-tolerant plants apparently secrete an organic acid at their root tips that complexes Al3+ and prevents it from adversely affecting the roots. Through genetic engineering it may be possible to develop plant varieties that are aluminum-tolerant and make possible the cultivation of land that is otherwise unusable due to aluminum toxicity. 16.3.1 ADJUSTMENT OF SOIL ACIDITY Most common plants grow best in soil with a pH near neutrality. If the soil becomes too acidic for optimum plant growth, it may be restored to productivity by liming, ordinarily through the addition of calcium carbonate: {Soil}(H+)2 + CaCO3 \u00c6 {Soil}Ca2++ CO2 + H2O (16.8) In areas of low rainfall, soils may become too basic (alkaline) due to the presence of basic salts such as Na2CO3. Alkaline soils may be treated with aluminum or iron sulfate, which release acid on hydrolysis: 2Fe3++ 3SO42-+ 6H2O \u00c6 2Fe(OH)3(s) + 6H++ 3SO42-(16.9) Sulfur added to soils is oxidized by bacterially mediated reactions to sulfuric acid: 3 + 2 S + O + HO \u00c6 2H + SO (16.10) 222 4 and sulfur is used, therefore, to acidify alkaline soils. The huge quantities of sulfur now being removed from fossil fuels to prevent air pollution by sulfur dioxide may make the treatment of alkaline soils by sulfur much more attractive economically. 16.3.2 ION-EXCHANGE EQUILIBRIA IN SOIL Competition of different cations for cation-exchange sites on soil cation exchangers may be described semiquantitatively by exchange constants.", "For example, soil reclaimed from an area fl ooded with seawater will have most of its cation-exchange sites occupied by Na+, and restoration of fertility requires binding of nutrient cations such as K+: ++ ++ {Soil}Na + K {Soil}K + Na (16.11) The exchange constant for this reaction is Kc, NK[Na+] Kc =+ (16.12) NNa[K ] which expresses the relative tendency of soil to retain K+ and Na+. In this equation, NK and NNa are the equivalent ionic fractions of potassium and sodium, respectively, bound to soil, and [Na+] and [K+] are the concentrations of these ions in the surrounding soil water. For example, a soil with all cation-exchange sites occupied by Na+ would have a value of 1.00 for NNa; with one-half of the cation-exchange sites occupied by Na+, NNa is 0.5; and so on. The exchange of anions by soil is not so clearly defined as is the exchange of cations. In many cases, the exchange of anions does not involve a simple ion-exchange process. This is true of the strong retention of orthophosphate species by soil. At the other end of the scale, nitrate ion is very weakly retained by the soil. Anion exchange may be visualized as occurring at the surfaces of oxides in the mineral portion of soil. A mechanism for the acquisition of surface charge by metal oxides is shown in Chapter 5, Figure 5.5, using MnO2 as an example. At low pH, a metal oxide surface may have a net positive charge enabling it to hold anions, such as chloride, by electrostatic attraction as shown below where M represents a metal: O H+Cl\u2013 M OH2 At higher pH values, the metal oxide surface has a net negative charge due to the formation of OH-ion on the surface caused by loss of H+ from the water molecules bound to the surface: O M OH\u2013 In such cases, it is possible for anions such as HPO42- to displace hydroxide ion and bond directly to the oxide surface: O O M OH\u2013 + HPO42\u2013 M OPO3H2\u2013 + OH\u2013 (16.13) 16.4 MACRONUTRIENTS IN SOIL One of the most important functions of soil in supporting plant growth is to provide essential plant nutrients\u2014macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are those elements that occur in substantial levels in plant biomass and fluids. Micronutrients (Section 16.6) are elements that are essential only at very low levels and generally are required for the functioning of essential enzymes. The elements generally recognized as essential macronutrients for plants are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are obtained from the atmosphere. The other essential macronutrients must be obtained from soil. Of these, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are the most likely to be lacking and are commonly added to soil as fertilizers. Because of their importance, these elements are discussed separately in Section 16.5. Calcium-deficient soils are relatively uncommon. Application of lime, a process used to treat acid soils (see Section 16.3), provides a more than adequate calcium supply for plants. However, calcium uptake by plants and leaching by carbonic acid (Reaction 16.5) may produce a calcium deficiency in soil. Acid soils may still contain an appreciable level of calcium which, because of competition by hydrogen ion, is not available to plants. Treatment of acid soil to restore the pH to near neutrality generally remedies the calcium deficiency. In alkaline soils, the presence of high levels of sodium, magnesium, and potassium sometimes produces calcium deficiency because these ions compete with calcium for availability to plants. Most of the 2.1% of magnesium in the earth\u2019s crust is rather strongly bound in minerals. Exchangeable magnesium held by ion-exchanging organic matter or clays is considered available to plants. The availability of magnesium to plants depends upon the calcium/magnesium ratio. If this ratio is too high, magnesium may not be available to plants and magnesium defi ciency results. Similarly, excessive levels of potassium or sodium may cause magnesium defi ciency. Sulfur is assimilated by plants as the sulfate ion, SO42-. Soils deficient in sulfur do not support plant growth well, largely because sulfur is a component of some essential amino acids and of thiamin and biotin. Sulfate ion is generally present in the soil as immobilized insoluble sulfate minerals or as soluble salts that are readily leached from the soil and lost as soil water runoff.", "Unlike the case of nutrient cations such as K+, little sulfate is adsorbed to the soil (i.e., bound by ion-exchange binding), where it is resistant to leaching while still available for assimilation by plant roots. Soil sulfur deficiencies have been found in a number of regions of the world. Whereas most fertilizers used to contain sulfur, its use in commercial fertilizers has declined. With continued use of sulfur-deficient fertilizers, it is possible that sulfur will become a limiting nutrient in more cases. As noted in Section 16.3, the reaction of FeS2 with acid in acid-sulfate soils may release H2S, which is very toxic to plants and which also kills many beneficial microorganisms. Toxic hydrogen sulfide can also be produced by reduction of sulfate ion through microorganism-mediated reactions with organic matter. Production of hydrogen sulfide in flooded soils may be inhibited by treatment with oxidizing compounds, one of the most effective of which is KNO3. 16.5 NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS, AND POTASSIUM IN SOIL Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are plant nutrients that are obtained from soil. They are so important for crop productivity that they are commonly added to soil as fertilizers. The environmental chemistry of these elements is discussed here and their production as fertilizers in Section 16.7. 16.5.1 NITROGEN Figure 16.4 summarizes the primary sinks and pathways of nitrogen in soil. In most soils, over 90% of the nitrogen content is organic. This organic nitrogen is primarily the product of the biodegrada - tion of dead plants and animals. It is eventually hydrolyzed to NH4 +, which can be oxidized to NO3 by the action of bacteria in the soil. Nitrogen bound to soil humus is especially important in maintaining soil fertility. Unlike potassium or phosphate, nitrogen is not a significant product of mineral weathering. Nitrogen-fi xing organisms ordinarily cannot supply sufficient nitrogen to meet peak demand. Inorganic nitrogen Leaching loss from fertilizers and rainwater is often largely lost by leaching. Soil humus, however, serves as a reservoir of nitrogen required by plants. It has the additional advantage that its rate of decay, hence its rate of nitrogen release to plants, roughly parallels plant growth\u2014rapid during the warm growing season, slow during the winter months. Nitrogen is an essential component of proteins and other constituents of living matter. Plants and cereals grown on nitrogen-rich soils not only provide higher yields, but are often substantially richer in protein and, therefore, more nutritious. Nitrogen is most generally available to plants as nitrate ion, NO3 -. Some plants such as rice may utilize ammonium nitrogen; however, other plants are poisoned by this form of nitrogen. When nitrogen is applied to soils in the ammonium form, nitrifying bacteria perform an essential function in converting it to available nitrate ion. Plants may absorb excessive amounts of nitrate nitrogen from soil. This phenomenon occurs particularly in heavily fertilized soils under drought conditions. Forage crops containing excessive amounts of nitrate can poison ruminant animals such as cattle or sheep. Plants having excessive levels of nitrate can endanger people when used for ensilage, an animal food consisting of fi nely chopped plant material such as partially matured whole corn plants, fermented in a structure called silo. Under the reducing conditions of fermentation, nitrate in ensilage may be reduced to toxic NO2 gas, which can accumulate to high levels in enclosed silos. There have been many cases reported of persons being killed by accumulated NO2 in silos. Nitrogen fixation is the process by which atmospheric N2 is converted to nitrogen compounds available to plants. Human activities are resulting in the fixation of a great deal more nitrogen than would otherwise be the case. Artificial sources now account for 30\u221240% of all nitrogen fi xed. These include chemical fertilizer manufacture, nitrogen fixed during fuel combustion, combustion of nitrogen-containing fuels, and the increased cultivation of nitrogen-fixing legumes (see the following paragraph). Of some concern with this increased fixation of nitrogen is the possible effect upon the atmospheric ozone layer by N2O released during denitrification of fi xed nitrogen. Before the widespread introduction of nitrogen fertilizers, soil nitrogen was provided primarily by legumes. These are plants such as soybeans, alfalfa, and clover, which contain on their root structures bacteria capable of fi xing atmospheric nitrogen. Leguminous plants have a symbiotic (mutually advantageous) relationship with the bacteria that provide their nitrogen. Legumes may add significant quantities of nitrogen to soil, up to 10 pounds per acre per year, which is comparable to amounts commonly added as synthetic fertilizers.", "Soil fertility with respect to nitrogen may be maintained by rotating plantings of nitrogen-consuming plants with plantings of legumes, a fact recognized by agriculturists as far back as the Roman era. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legumes exist in special structures on the roots called root nodules (see Figure 16.5). The rod-shaped bacteria that fix nitrogen are members of a special genus, Rhizobium. These bacteria may exist independently, but cannot fix nitrogen except in symbiotic combination with plants. Although all species of Rhizobium appear to be very similar, they exhibit a great deal of specificity in their choice of host plants. Curiously, legume root nodules also contain a form of hemoglobin, which must somehow be involved in the nitrogen-fixation process. Some studies suggest that some kinds of Rhizobium bacteria secrete substances near plant roots that promote plant growth by secreting or causing the plants to release substances that facilitate the uptake of nutrients or inhibit plant pathogens.4 Nitrate pollution of some surface waters and groundwater has become a major problem in some agricultural areas (see Chapter 7). Although fertilizers have been implicated in such pollution, there is evidence that feedlots are a major source of nitrate pollution. The growth of livestock populations and the concentration of livestock in feedlots have aggravated the problem. Such concentrations of cattle, coupled with the fact that a steer produces approximately 18 times as much waste material as a human, have resulted in high levels of water pollution in rural areas with small human populations. Streams and reservoirs in such areas frequently are just as polluted as those in densely populated and highly industrialized areas. Nitrate in farm wells is a common and especially damaging manifestation of nitrogen pollution from feedlots because of the susceptibility of ruminant animals to nitrate poisoning. The stomach contents of ruminant animals such as cattle and sheep constitute a reducing medium (low pE) and contain bacteria capable of reducing nitrate ion to toxic nitrite ion: NO3 + 2H++ 2e -\u00c6 NO2 + H2O (16.14) The origin of most nitrate produced from feedlot wastes is amino nitrogen present in nitrogen-containing waste products. Approximately, one-half of the nitrogen excreted by cattle is contained in the urine. Part of this nitrogen is proteinaceous and the other part is in the form of urea, NH2CONH2. As a first step in the degradation process, the amino nitrogen is probably hydrolyzed to ammonia or ammonium ion: RNH2 + H2O \u00c6 R-OH + NH3 (NH4 +) (16.15) This product is then oxidized through microorganism-catalyzed reactions to nitrate ion: - NH3 + 2O2 \u00c6 H++ NO3 + H2O (16.16) Under some conditions, an appreciable amount of the nitrogen originating from the degradation of feedlot wastes is present as ammonium ion. Ammonium ion is rather strongly bound to soil (recall that soil is a generally good cation exchanger), and a small fraction is fixed as nonexchangeable ammonium ion in the crystal lattice of clay minerals. Because nitrate ion is not strongly bound to soil, it is readily carried through soil formations by water. Many factors, including soil type, moisture, and level of organic matter, affect the production of ammonia and nitrate ion originating from feedlot wastes, and a marked variation is found in the levels and distributions of these materials in feedlot areas. 16.5.2 PHOSPHORUS Although the percentage of phosphorus in plant material is relatively low, it is an essential component of plants. Phosphorus, like nitrogen, must be present in a simple inorganic form before it can be taken up by plants. In the case of phosphorus, the utilizable species is some form of orthophosphate ion. In the pH range that is present in most soils, H2PO4 - and HPO42- are the predominant orthophosphate species. Orthophosphate is most available to plants at pH values near neutrality. It is believed that in relatively acidic soils, orthophosphate ions are precipitated or sorbed by species of Al(III) and Fe(III). In alkaline soils, orthophosphate may react with calcium carbonate to form relatively insoluble hydroxyapatite: 3HPO42-+ 5CaCO3(s) + 2H2O \u00c6 Ca5(PO4)3(OH)(s) + 5HCO3 -+ OH-(16.17) In general, because of these reactions, little phosphorus applied as fertilizer leaches from the soil. This is important from the standpoint of both water pollution and utilization of phosphate fertilizers. 16.5.3 POTASSIUM Relatively high levels of potassium are utilized by growing plants. Potassium activates some enzymes and plays a role in the water balance in plants. It is also essential for some carbohydrate transformations. Crop yields are generally greatly reduced in potassium-deficient soils.", "The higher the productivity of the crop, the more the potassium removed from soil. When nitrogen fertilizers are added to soils to increase productivity, removal of potassium is enhanced. Therefore, potassium may become a limiting nutrient in soils heavily fertilized with other nutrients. Potassium is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth\u2019s crust, of which it makes up 2.6%; however, much of this potassium is not easily available to plants. For example, some silicate minerals such as leucite, K2O \u2022 Al2O3\u2022 4SiO2, contain strongly bound potassium. Exchangeable potassium held by clay minerals is relatively more available to plants. 16.6 MICRONUTRIENTS IN SOIL Boron, chlorine, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum (for N-fixation), and zinc are considered essential plant micronutrients. These elements are needed by plants only at very low levels and frequently are toxic at higher levels. There is some chance that other elements will be added to this list as techniques for growing plants in environments free of specific elements improve. Most of these elements function as components of essential enzymes. Manganese, iron, chlorine, and zinc may be involved in photosynthesis. It is possible that sodium, silicon, nickel, and cobalt may also be essential nutrients for some plants. Iron and manganese occur in a number of soil minerals. Sodium and chlorine (as chloride) occur naturally in soil and are transported as atmospheric particulate matter from marine sprays (see Chapter 10). Some of the other micronutrients and trace elements are found in primary (unweathered) minerals that occur in soil. Boron is substituted isomorphically for Si in some micas and is present in tourmaline, a mineral with the formula NaMg3Al6B3Si6O27(OH,F)4. Copper is isomorphically substituted for other elements in feldspars, amphiboles, olivines, pyroxenes, and micas; it also occurs as trace levels of copper sulfides in silicate minerals. Molybdenum occurs as molybdenite (MoS2). Vanadium is isomorphically substituted for Fe or Al in oxides, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas. Zinc is present as the result of isomorphic substitution for Mg, Fe, and Mn in oxides, amphiboles, olivines, and pyroxenes and as trace zinc sulfide in silicates. Other trace elements that occur as specifi c minerals, sulfi de inclusions, or by isomorphic substitution for other elements in minerals are chromium, cobalt, arsenic, selenium, nickel, lead, and cadmium. The trace elements listed above may be coprecipitated with secondary minerals (see Section 15.2) that are involved in soil formation. Such secondary minerals include oxides of aluminum, iron, and manganese (precipitation of hydrated oxides of iron and manganese very efficiently removes many trace metal ions from solution); calcium and magnesium carbonates; smectites; vermiculites; and illites. Micronutrient deficiencies have developed in some soils. In some cases, deficiencies are the result of soil factors including pH, pE, biological activity, CEC, and soil contents of organic matter and clay. Factors involving the plants and their root systems cause variations in micronutrient uptake. These include root and root hair morphology and surface area and association of roots with microorganisms. Also involved are root secretions including H+, OH-, HCO3 - ions; citric, oxalic, and other acids; and enzymes, such as phosphatases. Major factors involved in micronutrient defi ciency include loss of topsoil, leaching of nutrients from soil, liming of acid soils (Ca2+ from lime competes with micronutrient metal ions for root uptake), more intensive cultivation, and intense use of more purifi ed fertilizers. Some plants accumulate extremely high levels of specific trace metals.5 Those accumulating more than 1.00 mg/g of dry weight are called hyperaccumulators. Nickel and copper both undergo hyperaccumulation in some plant species. As an example of a metal hyperaccumulator, Aeolanthus biformifolius DeWild growing in copper-rich regions of Shaba Province, Zaire, contains up to 1.3% copper (dry weight) and is known as a \u201ccopper fl ower.\u201d The hyperaccumulation of metals by some plants has led to the idea of phytoremediation in which plants growing on contaminated ground accumulate metals, which are then removed with the plant biomass. Plants used for phytoremediation should be deep rooted and produce large quantities of biomass that has accumulated pollutants. A plant that is promising for its potential to perform phytoremediation is Thlaspicaerulescans (alpine pennycress), a member of the broccoli and cabbage family that can grow on soils with high levels of zinc and cadmium and accumulate these metals in the plant shoots and leaves. Phytoremediation of uranium-contaminated soils is facilitated by adding citrate to the soil to mobilize the uranium in a form that can be taken up by plant roots. 16.7 FERTILIZERS Crop fertilizers contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as major components.", "Magnesium, sulfate, and micronutrients may also be added. Fertilizers are designated by numbers, such as 6-12-8, showing the respective percentages of nitrogen expressed as N (in this case 6%), phosphorus as P2O5 (12%), and potassium as K2O (8%). Farm manure corresponds to an approximately 0.50.24-0.5 fertilizer. The organic fertilizers such as manure must undergo biodegradation to release the simple inorganic species (NO3 -, HxPO4 x-3, K+) assimilable by plants. Most modern nitrogen fertilizers are made by the Haber process, in which N2 and H2 are combined over a catalyst at temperatures of approximately 500\u00b0C and pressures up to 1000 atm: N2 + 3H2 \u00c6 2NH3 (16.18) The anhydrous ammonia product has a very high nitrogen content of 82%. It may be added directly to the soil, for which it has a strong affinity because of its water solubility and formation of ammonium ion: NH3(g)(water) \u00c6 NH3(aq), (16.19) NH3(aq) + H2O \u00c6 NH4 ++ OH- (16.20) Special equipment is required, however, because of the toxicity of ammonia gas. Aqua ammonia, a 30% solution of NH3 in water, may be used with much greater safety. It is sometimes added directly to irrigation water. It should be pointed out that ammonia vapor is toxic and NH3 is reactive with some substances. Improperly discarded or stored ammonia can be a hazardous waste. Ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3, is a common solid nitrogen fertilizer. It is made by oxidizing ammonia over a platinum catalyst, converting the nitric oxide product to nitric acid and reacting the nitric acid with ammonia. The molten ammonium nitrate product is forced through nozzles at the top of a prilling tower and solidifies to form small pellets while falling through the tower. The particles are coated with a water repellent. Ammonium nitrate contains 33.5% nitrogen. Although convenient to apply to soil, it requires considerable care during manufacture and storage because it is explosive. Ammonium nitrate also poses some hazards. It is mixed with fuel oil to form an explosive that serves as a substitute for dynamite in quarry blasting and construction. This mixture was used to devastating effect in the dastardly bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995. Urea, O HNCNH 22 is easier to manufacture and handle than ammonium nitrate. It is now the favored solid nitrogen-containing fertilizer. The overall reaction for urea synthesis is CO2 + 2NH3 \u00c6 CO(NH2)2 + H2O (16.21) involving a rather complicated process in which ammonium carbamate, chemical formula NH2CO2NH4, is an intermediate. Other compounds used as nitrogen fertilizers include sodium nitrate (obtained largely from Chilean deposits, see Section 15.2), calcium nitrate, potassium nitrate, and ammonium phosphates. Ammonium sulfate, a byproduct of coke ovens, used to be widely applied as fertilizer. The alkali metal nitrates tend to make soil alkaline whereas ammonium sulfate leaves an acidic residue. Phosphate minerals are found in several states, including Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Florida. The principal mineral is fl uorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F. The phosphate from fluorapatite is relatively unavailable to plants, and fl uorapatite is frequently treated with phosphoric or sulfuric acids to produce superphosphates: 2Ca5(PO4)3F(s) + 14H3PO4 + 10H2O \u00c6 2HF(g) + 10Ca(H2PO4)2\u2022 H2O (16.22) 2Ca5(PO4)3F(s) + 7H2SO4 + 3H2O \u00c6 2HF(g) + 3Ca(H2PO4)2\u2022 H2O + 7CaSO4 (16.23) The superphosphate products are much more soluble than the parent phosphate minerals. The HF produced as a byproduct of superphosphate production can create air pollution problems. Phosphate minerals are rich in trace elements required for plant growth, such as boron, copper, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc. Ironically, these elements are lost to a large extent when the phosphate minerals are processed to make fertilizer. Ammonium phosphates are excellent, highly soluble phosphate fertilizers. Liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizers consisting of ammonium salts of pyrophosphate, triphosphate, and small quantities of higher polymeric phosphate anions in aqueous solution work very well as phosphate fertilizers. The polyphosphates are believed to have the additional advantage of chelating iron and other micronutrient metal ions, thus making the metals more available to plants. Potassium fertilizer components consist of potassium salts, generally KCl. Such salts are found as deposits in the ground or may be obtained from some brines. Very large deposits are found in Saskatchewan, Canada. These salts are all quite soluble in water. One problem encountered with potassium fertilizers is the luxury uptake of potassium by some crops, which absorb more potassium than is really needed for their maximum growth.", "In a crop where only the grain is harvested, leaving the rest of the plant in the field, luxury uptake does not create much of a problem because most of the potassium is returned to the soil with the dead plant. However, when hay or forage is harvested, potassium contained in the plant as a consequence of luxury uptake is lost from the soil. 16.7.1 FERTILIZER POLLUTION One of the more troublesome problems that has arisen from increased fertilizer use in recent times is water pollution from agricultural land runoff enriched in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium from fertilizers. On a local scale, lakes and reservoirs have become eutrophied as the result of fertilizer runoff. The nutrients in fertilizer cause excessive algal growth, the algal biomass decays and consumes oxygen, and bodies of water are seriously damaged by oxygen depletion. As a non-point source of pollution, fertilizer runoff presents challenging control problems. One of the more spectacular manifestations of agricultural fertilizer pollution is the Gulf of Mexico dead zone, which develops and grows in size each summer in a region of the Gulf receiving Mississippi River runoff. It is attributed to runoff of water enriched in agricultural fertilizers, especially nitrogen, from the fertile Mississippi river watershed, which enables excessive growth of photosynthetic microorganisms (phytoplankton) in the Gulf. The biomass of these organisms along with the bodies of zooplankton and their waste products that feed on them settle to the bottom of the Gulf where microbial decay results in depletion of DO (hypoxia) that kills fish and other marine animal life. Aggravating the effect of low oxygen is the production in anoxic sediments of toxic, odorous hydrogen sulfide. The formation of this zone is intensified by the layer of less dense freshwater from the Mississippi river that tends to prevent mixing with the seawater that it overlays, preventing penetration of oxygen to bottom layers. In 2002 the dead zone of eutrophied, oxygen-depleted water grew to 8500 square miles, the largest ever recorded. Because of severe fl ooding in agricultural regions of the Mississippi River watershed that washed large amounts of fertilizer residues into the river, the Gulf dead zone was projected to reach a record area in 2008, but was reduced to 8000 square miles by the churning effect of Hurricane Dolly. Efforts have been made to persuade agricultural interests to use less fertilizer to reduce the area of the dead zone. More frequent, lighter applications of fertilizer should also reduce runoff. 16.8 POLLUTANTS FROM LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION As it is currently practiced, livestock production generates significant amounts of environmental pollutants. Livestock manure has a very high BOD and can rapidly deplete water of oxygen when it gets into waterways. Decomposition of animal waste products produces inorganic nitrogen that can contaminate water with potentially toxic nitrate. Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus released to water from the decomposition of livestock wastes can cause eutrophication of water. Nitrous oxide, N2O, released to the atmosphere from livestock waste degradation can be an air pollutant. Methane generated in the anaerobic degradation of livestock wastes is a potent greenhouse gas. Several organoarsenic compounds, especially roxarsone, OH Roxarsone (3-nitro-4-hydroxy-phenylarsonic acid) have been added to poultry feed to control disease (coccidiosis), enhance the efficiency of feed utilization, stimulate growth and egg production, and improve meat appearance. Roxarsone and its degradation products have been found in chicken litter and arsenic has been detected in soils fertilized with chicken litter. Although roxarsone has a relatively low toxicity, its inorganic biodegradation products are rather toxic. By 2008 arsenic compounds in chicken feed had been reduced significantly and some major producers had discontinued these additives. 16.9 PESTICIDES AND THEIR RESIDUES IN SOIL The following are four major concerns regarding pesticides in soil that need to be considered with respect to their licensing and regulation: \u2022 Carryover of pesticides and biologically active degradation products to crops grown in later seasons \u2022 Biological effects on organisms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including bioaccumulation and transfer through food chains \u2022 Groundwater contamination \u2022 Effects on soil fertility Herbicides are the most common chemicals that influence soil and the organisms that it supports because to be effective they must generally come into direct contact with soil and persist long enough to be effective.", "An important environmental characteristic of chemicals such as herbicides in soil is the formation of bound residues, which are parent compounds or metabolites in soil or in the organisms that inhabit soil and that are not extractable by common extraction procedures.6 A common way of studying bound residues consists of spiking soil with compounds labeled with radioactive carbon-14 and subjecting the spiked soil to extraction. It is possible to measure the radiolabeled carbon in the extracts, in carbon dioxide respiration product, and in the soil residue. However, this kind of procedure does not necessarily reflect the bioavailability of a substance in soil and its related characteristics of biodegradation, bioaccumulation, or mineralization. It is well established that as pesticides and other foreign compounds remain in soil for longer periods of time the following occur: \u2022 The substances become increasingly resistant to extraction and desorption processes \u2022 They become significantly less bioavailable to organisms \u2022 Overall toxicity is decreased These bioavailability and extractability effects are usually attributed to interaction of the contaminant compound with soil organic matter and are more pronounced for soils with high organic matter content. Molecules become trapped within micropores of the organic matter and are thus rendered less environmentally reactive. The apparent increase in binding with time may be due to slow migration of the molecules into more remote and smaller micropores and perhaps formation of covalent bonds to organic matter. The bioavailability of foreign compounds in soil has traditionally been estimated by extraction of the materials from soil by various solvent compositions. However, it is generally believed that this overstates the environmental and biological availability of bound residues. As alternatives, tests involving microbial mineralization and uptake by earthworms using compounds radiolabeled with carbon-14 to follow the fate of residues have been used. The extent to which soil bacteria convert bound residues to inorganic carbon is a reasonably good measure of bioavailability. Uptake of bound residues by earthworms provides evidence of bioavailability to multicelled organisms capable of ingesting soil. 16.9.1 SOIL FUMIGANTS Soil fumigants are volatile substances applied to soil to combat bacteria, fungi, nematodes, arthropods, and weeds, primarily on fi elds used to grow potatoes, tomatoes, strawberries carrots, and peppers. Because of fumigants\u2019 use on food crops and the potential for exposure of workers who tend and harvest these crops, the safety of these substances has been a matter of considerable concern. Structural formulas of the most common soil fumigants are shown in Figure 16.6. The most widely accepted soil fumigant has been methyl bromide, H3CBr, but it was phased out of use in most industrialized countries including the United States in 2005 except for some very limited \u201ccritical use exemptions.\u201d Metam sodium is the most widely applied fumigant and the third most widely used pesticide in the United States, primarily on potato fields. In soil it breaks down to methyl isothiocyanate, which is the active agent (shown in Figure 16.6). In 2007 the U.S. EPA approved limited use of methyl iodide, H3CI. Dimethyl disulfide is a relatively new fumigant that is commonly applied along with chloropicrin. Although it has been assumed that because of their volatility soil fumigants do not persist in soil or cause groundwater pollution problems, studies with carbon-14 labeled fumigants has shown bound residues of these substances in soil. The levels of these residues in soil are strongly correlated with organic matter in the soil and they are apparently bound with fulvic acid (see discussion of H H H Cl H H H CBr H Methyl bromide CC C Cl H H 1,3-Dichloropropene Cl C NO2 Cl Chlorpicrin H C SS C H H H Dimethyldisulfide CH3 H H HHS N S HCCCBr HCNCS HCNCS\u2013+NA N S HHH H3C Propargyl bromide Methyl isothiocyanate Metam sodium Dazomet FIGURE 16.6 Soil fumigants. Methyl bromide was once the most commonly used soil fumigant, but it is now banned because of its potential to destroy stratospheric ozone. humic substances in Section 3.17) in soil.7 Soil fumigants are believed to act as toxicants to pests in soil by alkylating biological macromolecules including DNA and proteins. It has been suggested that the bound residues of soil fumigants form in soil as the result of alkylation of fulvic acid molecules, thus effectively removing and detoxifying the fumigants. 16.10 WASTES AND POLLUTANTS IN SOIL Soil receives large quantities of waste products. Much of the sulfur dioxide emitted in the burning of sulfur-containing fuels ends up as soil sulfate.", "Atmospheric nitrogen oxides are converted to nitrates in the atmosphere, and the nitrates eventually are deposited on soil. Soil sorbs NO and NO2, and these gases are oxidized to nitrate in the soil. Carbon monoxide is converted to CO2 and possibly to biomass by soil bacteria and fungi. Particulate lead from automobile exhausts is found at elevated levels in soil along heavily traveled highways. Elevated levels of lead from lead mines and smelters are found on soil near such facilities. Soil is the receptor of many hazardous wastes from landfill leachate, lagoons, and other sources (see Chapter 20). In some cases, land farming of degradable hazardous organic wastes is practiced as a means of disposal and degradation. The degradable material is worked into the soil, and soil microbial processes bring about its degradation. As discussed in Chapter 8, sewage and fertilizer-rich sewage sludge may be applied to soil. The various constituents of soil have different affinities for organic contaminants. Natural organic matter, primarily humic substances, have a relatively high affinity for organic contaminants and heavy metal ions. Many soils contain elemental carbon, black carbon, material in the ash left over from the burning of crop residues, including sugarcane trash, wheat straw, and rice straw. This material is probably an important repository of organic contaminants in soil. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, dichloromethane, trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene, may contaminate soil in industrialized and commercialized areas, particularly in countries in which enforcement of regulations is not very stringent. One of the more common sources of these contaminants is leaking underground storage tanks. Landfills built before current stringent regulations were enforced and improperly discarded solvents are also signifi cant sources of soil VOCs. Measurements of levels of PCBs in soils that have been archived for several decades provide interesting insight into the contamination of soil by pollutant chemicals and subsequent loss of these substances from soil.8 Analyses of soils from the United Kingdom dating from the early 1940s to 1992 showed that the PCB levels increased sharply from the 1940s, reaching peak levels around 1970. Subsequently, levels fell sharply and now are back to early 1940s concentrations. This fall was accompanied by a shift in distribution to the more highly chlorinated PCBs, which was attributed by those doing the study to volatilization and long-range transport of the lighter PCBs away from the soil. These trends parallel levels of PCB manufacture and use in the United Kingdom from the early 1940s to the present. This is consistent with the observation that relatively high concentrations of PCBs have been observed in remote Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, attributed to condensation in colder climates of PCBs volatilized in warmer regions. Some pollutant organic compounds are believed to become bound with humus during the humification process that occurs in soil. This largely immobilizes and detoxifies the compounds. Binding of pollutant compounds by humus is particularly likely to occur with compounds that have structural similarities to humic substances, such as phenolic and anilinic compounds illustrated by the following two examples: Cl Cl Such compounds can become covalently bonded to humic substance molecules as bound residues. Soil receives enormous quantities of pesticides as an inevitable result of their application to crops. The degradation and eventual fate of these pesticides on soil largely determines their ultimate environmental effects. Detailed knowledge of these effects are now required for licensing of a new pesticide (in the United States under the FIFRA). Among the factors to be considered are the sorption of the pesticide by soil; leaching of the pesticide into water, as related to its potential for water pollution; effects of the pesticide on microorganisms and animal life in the soil; and possible production of relatively more toxic degradation products. Adsorption by soil is a key aspect of pesticide degradation and plays a strong role in the speed and degree of degradation. The degree of adsorption and the speed and extent of ultimate degradation are influenced by a number of other factors. Some of these, including solubility, volatility, charge, polarity, and molecular structure and size, are properties of the medium. Adsorption of a pesticide by soil components may have several effects. Under some circumstances, it retards degradation by separating the pesticide from the microbial enzymes that degrade it, whereas under other circumstances the reverse is true. Purely chemical degradation reactions may be catalyzed by adsorption. Loss of the pesticide by volatilization or leaching is diminished. The toxicity of a herbicide to plants may be reduced by sorption on soil.", "The forces holding a pesticide to soil particles may be of several types. Physical adsorption involves van der Waals forces arising from dipole\u2212dipole interactions between the pesticide molecule and charged soil particles. Ion exchange is especially effective in holding cationic organic compounds, such as the herbicide paraquat, to anionic soil particles. Some neutral pesticides become cationic by protonation and are bound as the protonated positive form. Hydrogen bonding is another mechanism by which some pesticides are held to soil. In some cases, a pesticide may act as a ligand coordinating with metals in soil mineral matter. The three primary ways in which pesticides are degraded in or on soil are chemical degradation, photochemical reactions, and, most important, biodegradation. Various combinations of these processes may operate in the degradation of a pesticide. Chemical degradation of pesticides has been observed experimentally in soils and clays sterilized to remove all microbial activity. A number of purely chemical hydrolytic reactions of pesticides occur in soil. For example, clays have been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of o,o-dimethyl-o2,4,5-trichlorophenyl thiophosphate (also called trolene, ronnel, etrolene, or trichlorometafos), an effect attributed to \u2013OH groups on the mineral surface: S Cl + P(OH)3 + 2CH3OH (16.24) Cl Cl A number of pesticides have been shown to undergo photochemical reactions, that is, chemical reactions brought about by the absorption of light (see Chapter 9). Frequently, isomers of the pesticides are formed as products. Many of the studies reported apply to pesticides in water or on thin films, and relatively less is known about the photochemical reactions of pesticides on soil and plant surfaces. 16.10.1 BIODEGRADATION AND THE RHIZOSPHERE Although insects, earthworms, and plants may play roles in the biodegradation of pesticides and other pollutant organic chemicals, microorganisms have the most important role. Several examples of microorganism-mediated degradation of organic chemical species are given in Chapter 6. The rhizosphere, the layer of soil in which plant roots are especially active, is a particularly important part of soil with respect to biodegradation of wastes. It is a zone of increased biomass and is strongly influenced by the plant root system and the microorganisms associated with plant roots. The rhizosphere may have more than 10 times the microbial biomass per unit volume compared to nonrhizospheric zones of soil. This population varies with soil characteristics, plant and root characteristics, moisture content, and exposure to oxygen. If this zone is exposed to pollutant compounds, microorganisms adapted to their biodegradation may also be present. Plants and microorganisms exhibit a strong synergistic relationship in the rhizosphere, which benefits the plant and enables highly elevated populations of rhizospheric microorganisms to exist. Epidermal cells sloughed from the root as it grows and carbohydrates, amino acids, and root-growthlubricant mucigel secreted from the roots all provide nutrients for microorganism growth. Root hairs provide a hospitable biological surface for colonization by microorganisms. The biodegradation of a number of synthetic organic compounds has been demonstrated in the rhizosphere. Understandably, studies in this area have focused on herbicides and insecticides that are widely used on crops. Among the organic species for which enhanced biodegradation in the rhizosphere has been demonstrated are 2,4-d herbicide, parathion, carbofuran, atrazine, diazinon, volatile aromatic alkyl and aryl hydrocarbons, chlorocarbons, and surfactants. 16.11 SOIL LOSS AND DEGRADATION Soil is a fragile resource that can be lost by erosion or become so degraded that it is no longer useful to support crops. Soil degradation is discussed here and measures to prevent and reverse it in Section 16.12. The physical properties of soil and, hence, its susceptibility to erosion, are strongly affected by the cultivation practices to which the soil is subjected. Desertifi cation refers to the process associated with drought and loss of fertility by which soil becomes unable to grow signifi cant amounts of plant life. Desertification caused by human activities is a common problem globally, occurring in diverse locations such as Argentina, the Sahara, Uzbekistan, the U.S. Southwest, Syria, and Mali. It is a very old problem dating back many centuries to the introduction of domesticated grazing animals to areas where rainfall and groundcover were marginal. The most notable example is desertification aggravated by domesticated goats in the Sahara region. Desertification involves a number of interrelated factors, including erosion, climate variations, water availability, loss of fertility, loss of soil humus, and deterioration of soil chemical properties. A related problem is deforestation, loss of forests. The problem is particularly acute in tropical regions, where the forests contain most of the existing plant and animal species.", "In addition to extinction of these species, deforestation can cause devastating deterioration of soil through erosion and loss of nutrients. Soil erosion is the loss of soil by the action of both water and wind; water is the primary source of erosion. Millions of tons of topsoil are carried by the Mississippi River and swept from its mouth each year. About one-third of the U.S. topsoil has been lost since cultivation began in the continent. Figure 16.7 shows the pattern of soil erosion in the continental United States in 1977. Wind erosion, such as occurs on the generally dry, high plains soils of eastern Colorado, poses another threat. After the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s, much of this land was allowed to revert to grassland, and the topsoil was held in place by the strong root systems of the grass cover. However, in an effort to grow more wheat and improve the sale value of the land, much of it was later returned to cultivation. Although freshly cultivated grassland may yield well for one or two years, the nutrients and soil moisture are rapidly exhausted and the land becomes very susceptible to wind erosion. 16.11.1 SOIL SUSTAINABILITY AND WATER RESOURCES The conservation of soil and the protection of water resources are strongly interrelated. Most freshwater falls initially on soil, and the condition of the soil largely determines the fate of the water and how much is retained in a usable condition. The land area upon which rainwater falls is called a watershed. In addition to collecting the water, the watershed determines the direction and rate of flow and the degree of water infiltration into groundwater aquifers (see the hydrologic cycle in Figure 3.1). Excessive rates of water flow prevent infiltration, lead to fl ash floods, and cause soil erosion. Measures taken to enhance the utility of land as a watershed also fortunately help prevent erosion. Some of these measures, which are discussed in Section 16.12, involve modifi cation of the contour of the soil, particularly terracing, construction of waterways, and construction of water-retaining ponds. Waterways are planted with grass to prevent erosion, and water-retaining crops and bands of trees can be planted on the contour to achieve much the same goal. Reforestation and control of damaging grazing practices conserve both soil and water. Covering soil with impermeable paving can prevent water infiltration to groundwater and increase the extent and rate of runoff. To help alleviate that problem Chicago has started an innovative \u201cGreen Alley\u201d program in which alleys are paved with a porous concrete that allows water infi ltration and eventual percolation into groundwater. This helps maintain groundwater levels and serves to reduce the burden on the stormwater collection system. Microorganisms that become embedded in the porous concrete serve to degrade organic matter including petroleum products that are carried by the infi ltrating water. 16.12 SAVING THE LAND With food as the most basic need that humans have, the sustainability of means to produce food is a top priority. The most basic part of food sustainability is the preservation of soil and its ability to support plant life, especially in the protection of soil from erosion. The preservation of soil from erosion is commonly termed soil conservation. There are a number of solutions to the soil erosion problem. Some are old, well-known agricultural practices, such as terracing, contour plowing (Figure 16.8), and periodically planting fields with cover crops, such as clover. For some crops conservation tillage (no-till agriculture) greatly reduces erosion. This practice consists of planting a crop among the residue of the previous year\u2019s crop, without plowing. Weeds are killed in the newly planted crop row by application of a herbicide prior to planting. The surface residue of plant material left on top of the soil prevents erosion. Operators of at least one vinyard in the Napa Valley of California plant clover, oats, peas, and mustard as winter cover between the rows of vines. The clover and peas are legumes that fi x atmospheric nitrogen and add to soil fertility. The crops are cut at the beginning of the summer growing season and the residues left on the soil to prevent weed growth, reduce erosion, and add fertility. One interesting aspect of the system is that perches are provided in the vinyards to attract hawks and owls that prey on rodents that live in the cut plant residues.", "Another, more experimental, solution to the soil erosion problem is the cultivation of perennial plants, which develop large root systems and come up each spring after being harvested the previous fall. For example, a perennial corn plant has been developed by crossing corn with a distant, wild relative, teosinte, which grows in Central America. Unfortunately, the resulting plant does not give outstanding grain yields. It should be noted that an annual plant\u2019s ability to propagate depends upon producing large quantities of seeds, which is why plants harvested for their grain (seeds) are annual plants. In contrast, a perennial plant must develop a strong root system with bulbous growths called rhizomes, which store food for the coming year. However, it is possible that the application of genetic engineering may result in the development of perennial crops with good seed yields. The cultivation of such a crop would significantly reduce soil erosion. 16.12.1 AGROFORESTRY The best known perennial plants are trees, which are very effective in stopping soil erosion. Wood from trees can be used as fuel, as raw material, for construction, and as food (glucose from wood cellulose, see below). There is a tremendous unrealized potential for an increase in the production of tree biomass. In the past, trees were often allowed to grow naturally with native varieties and without the benefit of any special agricultural practices, such as fertilization. The productivity of biomass from trees can be greatly increased with improved varieties, including those that are genetically engineered, and with improved cultivation and fertilization. A promising alternative in sustainable agriculture is agroforestry in which crops are grown in strips between rows of trees as shown in Figure 16.9. The trees stabilize the soil, particularly on sloping terrain. By choosing trees with the capability to fix nitrogen, the system can be self- suffi cient in this essential nutrient. Cultivation called alley cropping across the slope (Figure 16.9) uses fast-growing, nitrogen- fixing trees to hold sloping soil in place. Spreading nutrient-rich tree prunings on the soil where crops are grown between crop seasons fertilizes the soil, adding organic matter and holding the soil in place. The trees potentially have economic value in providing wood for construction, fi rewood for cooking, fruit, and nuts. Genetically engineered trees may even provide high-value pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals in the future. At the bottom of the slope, a buffer strip of grass can serve to filter nutrients and suspended soil from runoff from the fields. Potentially, rich topsoil collected by the buffer strip can be returned to higher levels to enrich the soil. The most important use for wood is, of course, as lumber for construction. This use will remain important as higher energy costs increase the costs of other construction materials, such as steel, aluminum, and cement. Wood is about 50% cellulose, which can be hydrolyzed by enzyme processes to yield glucose sugar. The glucose can be used directly as food, fermented to ethyl alcohol for fuel (gasohol), or employed as a carbon and energy source for protein-producing yeasts. Given these and other potential uses, the future of trees as an environmentally desirable and profi table crop is very promising. 16.12.2 SOIL RESTORATION Soil can be impaired by loss of fertility, erosion, buildup of salinity, contamination by phytotoxins, such as zinc from sewage sludge, and other insults. Soil has a degree of resilience and can largely recover whenever the conditions leading to its degradation are removed. However, in many cases, more active measures called soil restoration are required to restore soil productivity, through the application of restoration ecology. Measures taken in soil restoration may include physical alteration of the soil to provide terraces and relatively flat areas not subject to erosion. Organic matter can be Row of trees FIGURE 16.9 Alley cropping of crops between rows of trees running across sloping land can be an effective means of practicing agroforestry sustainably. restored by planting crops the residues of which are cultivated into the soil for partially decayed biomass. Nutrients may be added and contaminants neutralized. Excess acid or base can be neutralized and salinity can be leached from the soil. Some toxic substances can be removed by plants in the process of phytoremediation (see Section 16.6). As the demand for food increases and damage to soil becomes more evident, soil restoration will become a very important endeavor. 16.13 GENETIC ENGINEERING AND AGRICULTURE The nuclei of living cells contain the genetic instruction for cell reproduction.", "These instructions are in the form of a special material called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In combination with proteins, DNA makes up the cell chromosomes. During the 1970s, the ability to manipulate DNA through genetic engineering became a reality, and since then it has become the basis of a major industry. Such manipulation falls into the category of recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA gets its name from the fact that it contains DNA from two different organisms, recombined together. This technology promises some exciting developments in agriculture and, indeed, is expected to lead to a \u201csecond green revolution.\u201d The first \u201cgreen revolution\u201d of the mid-1960s used conventional plant-breeding techniques of selective breeding, hybridization, cross-pollination, and back-crossing, to develop new strains of rice, wheat, and corn, which, when combined with chemical fertilizers, yielded spectacularly increased crop yields. For example, India\u2019s output of grain increased 50%. By working at the cellular level, however, it is now possible to greatly accelerate the process of plant breeding. Thus, plants may be developed that resist particular diseases, grow in seawater, or have much higher productivity. The possibility exists for developing entirely new kinds of plants. One exciting possibility with genetic engineering is the development of plants other than legumes that fix their own nitrogen. For example, if nitrogen-fixing corn could be developed, the savings in fertilizer would be enormous. Furthermore, since the nitrogen is fi xed in an organic form in plant root structures, there would be no pollutant runoff of chemical fertilizers. Another promising possibility with genetic engineering is increased efficiency of photosynthesis. Plants utilize only about 1% of the sunlight striking their leaves, so there is appreciable room for improvement in that area. Cell-culture techniques can be applied in which billions of cells are allowed to grow in a medium and develop mutants which, for example, might be resistant to particular viruses or herbicides or have other desirable qualities. If the cells with the desired qualities can be regenerated into whole plants, results can be obtained that might have taken decades using conventional plant-breeding techniques. The United States has by far the largest land area devoted to genetically modified crops, 143 million acres of corn, soybean, cotton, canola, squash, papaya, and alfalfa in 2008. Ranking next were Argentina (47 million acres), Brazil (37 million acres), Canada (17 million acres), and India (15 million acres). China ranked sixth with 9 million acres of genetically modified crops but was planning a big increase in such crops in an effort to feed its huge population. There has been strong resistance to transgenic crops and livestock in some quarters. This is especially true in Europe where restrictions on genetically modified foods and strict labeling requirements are in force. A particular concern with GM crops in Europe is the possibility of gene transfer to non-GM varieties such as might occur with cross-pollination of GM corn to other varieties of corn by means of corn pollen. Genes from GM crops could be transferred to wild plants that might act as particularly aggressive weeds. Despite the enormous potential of the \u201cgreen revolution,\u201d genetic engineering, and more intensive cultivation of land to produce food and fi ber, these technologies cannot be relied upon to support an uncontrolled increase in world population, and may even simply postpone an inevitable day of reckoning with the consequences of population growth. Changes in climate resulting from global warming (greenhouse effect, Section 14.2), ozone depletion (by CFCs, Section 14.6), or natural disasters such as massive volcanic eruptions or collisions with large meteorites can, and almost certainly will, result in worldwide famine conditions in the future that no agricultural technology will be able to alleviate. 16.14 GREEN CHEMISTRY AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE The practice of green chemistry may significantly enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability. To understand why this is so, it is useful to consider some of the problems that have arisen from spectacular advances in agricultural productivity with the application of advanced technologies over the last 100 years: \u2022 Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers and their products have accumulated on agricultural lands and waters leading to adverse effects on wildlife, the environment, and potentially humans as well. \u2022 Nontarget organisms have suffered and insect and weed pests have built up resistance to agents used in their eradication. \u2022 Poorly trained and inadequately protected personnel in less developed countries have suffered adverse effects from modern agricultural products. \u2022 Disposal problems have arisen with respect to obsolete pesticides.", "The application of green chemistry to agriculture holds promise for preventing or alleviating problems such as these. Agriculture is a science of living organisms applied to human needs for food and fi ber production. So in attempting to find more sustainable and environment-friendly approaches to agriculture, it is reasonable to look to natural ecosystems that have evolved over the eons that enable various species of plants and animals to thrive. Such an approach is based upon biomimetics in which humans attempt to mimic natural life systems. Pesticides that come from natural sources such as plants or bacteria are called biopesticides. These substances are usually more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides, although the blanket assumption that anything from a natural source is automatically safer than synthetic materials should not be made. Some substances, such as botulinum from botulinus bacteria or ricin from castor beans are among the most toxic substances known. In cases where genetic material is introduced into plants, there is the possibility that the material may get into wild species, such as weeds, with unintended consequences. There is also concern that proteins in biopesticides may be allergens. The three major categories of biopesticides are \u2022 Microbial pesticides composed of microorganisms, such as insecticide-producing cells of Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria \u2022 Plant-incorporated protectants, such as plants genetically engineered to make the insecticide produced by Bacillus thuringiensis \u2022 Biochemical pesticides that control pests by nontoxic effects, such as sex attractants that confuse insects\u2019 reproductive activities Advantages of biopesticides include a generally lower toxicity than conventional pesticides, high specificity for target pests, effectiveness in very small quantities, and rapid decomposition. Biopesticides are generally most effective when used in a program of integrated pest management. A promising biomimetic approach is the use of naturally produced pesticides and pheromones in combating pests. Pheromones are substances produced by organisms, especially insects, in small quantities that are used for communication, especially with respect to reproduction. Because of their low toxicities, specificities for kinds of insects, and minute quantities required, pheromones are very environmentally friendly. Some insects can detect a single molecule of pheromone. Some pheromones are relatively simple compounds. One example is methylsalicylate, which is released by some plants infested with insects such as aphids. This compound is an antiaphrodisiac released by male aphids during mating to make the females unattractive to other males, and release of this substance in the vicinity of aphid-infested crops interferes with aphid reproduction. Another approach using pheromones is to place these materials in traps containing insecticides. The quantities of pheromones required are minute, as little as 50 mg per trap. For example, the diamondback moth, a cabbage pest, can be controlled with traps baited with its pheromone and containing permethrin insecticide. Pheromone-based pest control has been found to be especially effective in control of moths, which are pests for a significant number of crops. One such pest is the gypsy moth, which is a serious problem for forest trees. Another is the coddling moth, which is the most serious pest in Washington State apple orchards. One of the greatest deterrent to the widespread use of pheromones for insect control is cost. Recombinant DNA technologies are now being used to enable microorganisms such as yeasts to produce pheromones, and these technologies may significantly reduce costs of pheromones for pest control. Efforts are under way to find natural products with insecticidal properties. The greatest success to date with natural products insecticides has been with the proteinaceous materials produced by strains of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Consisting of a family of proteins that are selective for various insect pests, Bt destroys insect larvae by causing their digestive tracts to deteriorate, but it is not appreciably toxic to noninsect organisms and it breaks down in the environment. The genes for producing Bt have been spliced into corn and other crops by recombinant DNA techniques, and large fractions of the corn and cotton crops now grown in the United States and some other countries consist of these genetically modifi ed strains. Another pesticide from natural sources is Dow Agrosciences\u2019 Spinosad produced by the bacterium Saccaropolyspora spinosa. This substance is a neurotoxin to insect pests that afflict a number of economic pests including those that attack fruit, vegetables, trees, and cotton. Spinosad is nonvolatile, does not bioaccumulate, and has a low toxicity to mammals. Rohm and Haas have developed CONFIRM, a dicylhydrazine that mimics ecdysone, a hormone that initiates molting in insects. CONFIRM causes caterpillars to quit eating so that they die of dehydration and starvation.", "Another insecticide that operates by the same mechanism is azadirachtin, which is extracted from the kernels of the neem tree. Development of a biofungicide from natural sources, AgraQuest\u2019s Serenade, was one of the winners of the 2003 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards. Serenade is a mixture of more than 30 lipopeptides such as agrastatin A (Figure 16.10) produced by a bacterium isolated from a California orchard and designated Bacillus subtilis, strain QST-713. Advantages of this fungicide include negligible toxicity to nontarget organisms and ready biodegradability. The active ingredients of the substance can be made by fermentation of natural materials, an inherently \u201cgreen\u201d process. Dow Agrosciences won the 2008 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award for the development of Spinetoram, a chemical modification of spinosyns, which are oxic fermentation products of the soil bacterium, Saccharopolyspora spinosa. Winner of the 1999 Presidential Green Chemistry Award, Spinosad, described above, is a combination of spinosyns A and D, that is a very effective, safe, and environmentally benign insecticide for vegetables, but not very effective for insect control on tree fruits and tree nuts. Using relatively minor modifications of existing spinosyns, the developers of Spinetoram devised a material that retains the favorable environmental properties of Spinosad and is effective for the control of insect pests on fruit and nut trees. The mammalian acute oral toxicity of Spinetoram is only about 1/1000 that of azinphos-methyl and 1/44 that of phosmet, the two organophosphate insecticides that it is designed to replace. Weeds are another major class of agricultural pest. Numerous herbicides have been developed to kill weeds. Probably one of the safest of these\u2014and certainly one of the most widely used\u2014is Monsanto\u2019s Roundup, glyophosate discussed in Section 16.1. A problem with Roundup and many other herbicides is that they may kill crops that they are used to protect. Soybeans, cotton, corn, and other crops have now been genetically engineered that are not harmed by Roundup, allowing its direct application to these crops to kill competing weeds, thus significantly reducing the amount of herbicide required. Plants are susceptible to a variety of fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases. An interesting approach to combating such diseases is by activating plants\u2019 natural defense mechanisms. This has been done successfully with harpin, a protein produced by Erwinia amylovora, the bacterial agent of fi re blight in apples and pears. E. coli bacteria have been genetically modified to produce harpin, which is sold as Eden Bioscience\u2019s Messenger biochemical pesticide and is reputed to enable plants to resist disease and generally thrive better. Green chemistry can be applied to fertilizer utilization. A problem with urea, a favored fertilizer source of nutrient nitrogen is that it undergoes biologically mediated hydrolysis, CO(NH2)2 + H2O \u00c6 CO + 2NH3 (16.25) leading to loss of as much as 30% of its nitrogen from evaporation of ammonia. Applied in relatively small quantities, N-(n-butyl)thiophosphorictriamide, a urease enzyme inhibitor, reduces the microbial hydrolysis of urea and increases the efficiency of urea fertilizer utilization. Thermal polyaspartate, a polyelectrolyte material formed by condensation and base treatment of the naturally occurring amino acid aspartic acid, and containing an abundance of carboxylate groups (-CO 2 -) groups has been found to be effective in stimulating plant uptake of fertilizer, thus reducing the amount of fertilizer required. This material has the advantage of coming from biological sources and being biodegradable. 16.15 AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH Soil, the plants that grow on it, and the animals that consume these plants constitute an important connection between the geosphere and the biosphere and may infl uence health. An important connection is the incorporation into food of micronutrient elements essential for human health. One such nutrient (which is toxic at overdose levels) is selenium. It is definitely known that the health of animals is adversely affected in selenium-deficient areas as it is in areas of selenium excess. Human health might be similarly affected. There are some striking geographic correlations with the occurrence of cancer, some of which may be due to soil type and its influence on food. A high incidence of stomach cancer occurs in areas with certain types of soils in the Netherlands, the United States, France, Wales, and Scandinavia. These soils are high in organic matter content, are acidic, and are frequently waterlogged. One possible reason for the existence of \u201cstomach cancer-producing soils\u201d is the production of cancer-causing secondary metabolites by plants and microorganisms. Secondary metabolites are biochemical compounds that are of no apparent use to the organism producing them.", "It is believed that they are formed from the precursors of primary metabolites when the primary metabolites accumulate to excessive levels. The role of soil in environmental health is not definitively known, and has not been as extensively studied as it deserves. The amount of research on the influence of soil in producing foods that are more nutritious and lower in content of naturally occurring toxic substances is quite small compared to research on higher soil productivity. It is hoped that the environmental health aspects of soil and its products will receive much greater emphasis in the future. 16.15.1 FOOD CONTAMINATION Food is subject to contamination from faulty agricultural practices. The most common type of contamination is microbiological, often from bacteria transferred to food from human or animal wastes sources. In 2006, numerous cases including several fatalities due to hemolytic uremic syndrome were reported in the United States attributed to bagged spinach contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 bacteria. In 2008, the U.S. fresh tomato industry was devastated by erroneous reports of Salmonella contamination eventually attributed to peppers imported from Mexico. Some sources of peppers from Mexico as well as irrigation water used on the pepper crops were found to be contaminated with Salmonella. The most common source of chemical contamination of food is from application of pesticides. Although large quantities of herbicides and soil fumigants are commonly applied to soil, insecticides are more likely to be found in food because to be effective they must usually be applied to plants. Sewage sludge applied to soil is a potential source of chemical contamination, particularly from phytotoxic zinc and heavy metals. 16.16 PROTECTING THE FOOD SUPPLY FROM ATTACK As the basic provider of food that all humans need for their existence, the agricultural system is clearly of utmost importance and requires maximum protection from attack. In modern industrialized countries such as the United States, agriculture is highly specialized and now lacks the diversity which would otherwise protect it from, for example, infestation with pathogens to which widely grown varieties of crops are susceptible. Past disease outbreaks, such as the hoof and mouth disease infestation of livestock in England in 2001, serve as reminders of the vulnerability of the agricultural sector. Even a single incident, such as the finding of a cow with mad cow disease in Washington state in December 2003, can cause great anxiety and have significant economic repercussions. Although chemical attack on agricultural systems is plausible, it is hard to imagine such an attack on a scale that would cause great damage. It is possible that crops could be sprayed with toxic chemicals before harvest, and, if these materials got into the food supply, could cause some anxiety and economic disruption. However, it would be difficult to mount such an attack in secrecy and on a scale required to do signifi cant harm. Infestation by crop-destroying insects could cause enormous loss and has done so throughout history. Huge swarms of locusts that devored all plant material in their paths are described in the Bible and still devastate agricultural areas. The boll weevil nearly wiped out the U.S. cotton crop during 1800s. Some of the most damaging insect infestations have come from exotic insect species introduced to areas where they previously were not found such as has been the case with beetle species that have killed millions of trees in U.S. forests. Microbial diseases pose a significant threat to agriculture and could be used as attacking agents. Insofar as plants are concerned, the greatest microbial threats are from fungi. Fungi are notorious for forming huge numbers of very durable spores that could be readily spread. Microorganisms pose an even greater threat from exotic insect species introduced to areas where they previously were not found. This has threat to livestock. The outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in England that required destruction of tens of thousands of animals was mentioned above. Animals are subject to a number of viral and bacterial diseases. Perhaps the most notorious of these is anthrax, which can be spread to humans as well. Perhaps the greatest terrorist threat to food supplies comes from potential contamination of edible products with pathogens. Human illnesses caused by bacterial contamination of food occur every year. Consumers were made ill and some died in the United States from Salmonella-contaminated peppers in 2008 and from peanuts contaminated by Salmonella from unsanitary handling conditions in 2008/2009.", "Terrorists could deliberately contaminate food with such pathogens, although it would be difficult to do so on a large enough scale to sicken significant numbers of people.

Haynes, Van Nostrand Publishers, 1954: \u201cBy sensible definition, any by-product of a chemical operation for which there is no profi table use is a waste. The most convenient, least expensive way of disposing of said waste\u2014up the chimney or down the river\u2014is the best.\u201d Fortunately, this barbaric attitude toward waste has been long regarded as completely wrong and unacceptable. Environmental chemistry is largely involved with the problems caused by improper discharges of pollutants from the anthrosphere to the other environmental spheres. This chapter deals largely with ways in which such problems can be avoided before environmental problems develop. In recognition of the environmental effects of the chemical industry and related enterprises, many laws have been passed and implemented throughout the world to regulate chemical processes and products. These laws have emphasized dealing with environmental problems after they have occurred, a \u201ccommand and control\u201d approach. Compliance with environmental laws over the last several decades has involved the expenditure of more than a trillion dollars worldwide. These laws have unquestionably had very positive effects on environmental quality, have been effective in helping to save some species from extinction, and have improved human health and quality of life. However, necessary as it is, the regulatory approach to enhancing environmental quality has some defi nite deficiencies. Its effective implementation and maintenance have required legions of regulators and have resulted in the expenditure of vast sums for litigation that could be better used directly to enhance environmental quality. Especially from the viewpoint of those regulated, some regulations have appeared to be petty, poorly cost effective, and, in the worst cases, counterproductive. A modern industrial society will always require regulations of various kinds to maintain environmental quality and even to ensure its continued existence. But, are there alternatives to some of the regulations? Most desirable are alternatives that help to ensure environmental quality by \u201cnatural,\u201d self-regulating means. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that, at least to a certain extent, there are alternatives to a purely regulatory approach for the chemical industry and other enterprises that have potentially huge influences on the environment and sustainability. One alternative to the regulatory approach to pollution control is provided in part by the practice of industrial ecology, which in its modern form can be traced to a 1989 article by Frosch and Gallopoulos.1 Industrial ecology views industrial systems as interacting to mutual advantage in a way that minimizes environmental and sustainability impacts and that processes materials and energy with maximum efficiency and minimum waste in a manner analogous to the metabolism of matter and energy in natural ecosystems. Starting in the mid-1990s, green chemistry has developed as a dynamic and rapidly developing discipline dealing with the sustainable practice of chemistry. Green chemistry and industrial ecology are closely related and one cannot be practiced effectively without the other. This chapter addresses green chemistry and industrial ecology as essential disciplines in maintaining environmental quality. 17.2 GREEN CHEMISTRY Green chemistry can be defi ned as the sustainable practice of chemical science and technology within the framework of good practice of industrial ecology in a manner that is safe and nonpolluting and that consumes minimum amounts of materials and energy while producing little or no waste material and which minimizes the use and handling of hazardous substances and does not release such substances to the environment.2 The inclusion of industrial ecology in this defi nition carries with it a number of implications regarding minimum consumption of raw materials, maximum recycling of materials, minimum production of unusable by-products, and other environmentally friendly factors favorable to the maintenance of sustainability. Figure 17.1 illustrates the main aspects of green chemistry. A key aspect of green chemistry is sustainability. Ideally, green chemistry is self-sustaining for several reasons. One of these is economic because green chemistry in its most developed form is less costly in strictly monetary terms than chemistry the way it has been traditionally practiced. Green chemistry is sustainable in terms of materials because of its minimal but highly effi cient use of raw materials. And green chemistry is sustainable in terms of wastes, because it does not cause an intolerable accumulation of hazardous waste products.", "In implementing the practice of green chemistry, two often-complementary approaches are the following. \u2022 Use existing chemicals, but make them by environmentally benign syntheses. \u2022 Substitute chemicals made by environmentally benign syntheses for existing chemicals. Both approaches need to be used. And both approaches challenge the ingenuity of chemists and chemical engineers to come up with innovative solutions to environmental problems arising from the chemical industry. 17.2.1 TWELVE PRINCIPLES OF GREEN CHEMISTRY Green chemistry is guided by Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry,3 aspects of which are discussed in this chapter. 1. Design chemical products and processes to prevent waste. One of life\u2019s most common lessons is that it is better to not make a mess than to clean it up once made. Failure to follow this simple rule has resulted in most of the troublesome chemical hazardous waste sites that are causing problems throughout the world today. 2. Design chemicals and products for maximum safety while still maintaining their effectiveness. The practice of green chemistry is making substantial progress in designing chemicals and new approaches to the use of chemicals such that effectiveness is retained and even enhanced while toxicity is reduced. 3. Minimize hazards in chemical synthesis using and generating substances with minimum toxicity and environmental hazard. Substances to be avoided when possible include toxic chemicals that pose health hazards to workers. They include substances that are likely to become air or water pollutants and harm the environment or organisms in the environment. In cases in which hazardous substances cannot be avoided, only the minimum amount needed should be used or produced and only at the time the substances are required. Here the connection between green chemistry and environmental chemistry is especially strong. 4. Use renewable feedstocks wherever possible. Raw materials extracted from Earth are depleting in that there is a finite supply that cannot be replenished after they are used. For these depleting feedstocks, recycling should be practiced to the maximum extent possible. Biomass feedstocks are highly favored in those applications for which they work. 5. Use catalysts for optimum conditions of chemical synthesis and minimum by-product. Reagents should be as selective as possible for their specifi c function. 6. Avoid chemical derivatives used as blocking agents and for other purposes in chemical synthesis to avoid generating excess by-products. In the synthesis of an organic compound it is often necessary to modify or protect groups on a molecule during the course of the synthesis. This often results in the generation of by-products not incorporated into the fi nal product, such as occurs when a protecting group is bonded to a specific location on a molecule, then removed when protection of the group is no longer needed. Since these processes generate by-products that may require disposal, they should be avoided if possible. 7. Maximize atom economy: One of the most effective ways to prevent generation of wastes is to make sure that the maximum fraction of materials involved in making a product are incorporated into the final product. Therefore, the practice of green chemistry is largely about incorporation of all raw materials into the product, if at all possible. The degree to which this is accomplished is termed atom economy. 8. Use safer reaction media: Chemical synthesis as well as many manufacturing operations make use of auxiliary substances that are not part of the final product. In chemical synthesis, such a substance consists of solvents in which chemical reactions are carried out. Another example consists of separating agents that enable separation of product from other materials. Since these kinds of materials may end up as wastes or (in the case of some volatile, toxic solvents) pose health hazards, their use should be minimized and preferably avoided. 9. Increase energy efficiency: One way in which this can be done is to run reactions under mild temperature and pressure conditions, which also increases safety. Energy consumption poses economic and environmental costs in virtually all synthesis and manufacturing processes. In a broader sense, the extraction of energy, such as fossil fuels pumped from or dug out of the ground, has significant potential to damage the environment. One successful approach to energy use under mild conditions has been the application of biological processes, which, because of the conditions under which organisms grow, must occur at moderate temperatures and in the absence of toxic substances. 10. Design for degradability of chemicals and products to produce innocuous products upon degradation.", "This requires careful consideration of the downstream fates of products taking account of their environmental chemistry. 11. Use in-process real-time monitoring and control to reduce wastes and pollution, maximize safety, and minimize energy consumption. Exacting \u201creal-time\u201d control of chemical processes is essential for efficient, safe operation with minimum production of wastes. This goal has been made much more attainable by modern computerized controls. 12. Minimize the potential for accidents by designing processes that use materials unlikely to cause explosions, fires, and harmful releases. Accidents, such as spills, explosions, and fires, are a major hazard in the chemical industry. Not only are these incidents potentially dangerous in their own right, they tend to spread toxic substances into the environment and increase exposure of humans and other organisms to these substances. Green chemistry is sustainable chemistry. There are several important respects in which green chemistry is sustainable. \u2022 Economic: At a high level of sophistication green chemistry normally costs less in strictly economic terms (to say nothing of environmental costs) than chemistry as it is normally practiced. \u2022 Materials: By efficiently using materials, maximum recycling, and minimum use of virgin raw materials, green chemistry is sustainable with respect to materials. \u2022 Waste: By reducing insofar as possible, or even totally eliminating their production, green chemistry is sustainable with respect to wastes. 17.3 REDUCTION OF RISK: HAZARD AND EXPOSURE A major goal in the manufacture and use of commercial products, and, indeed, in practically all areas of human endeavor, is the reduction of risk. Much of the design and practice of green chemistry is about risk reduction. There are two major aspects of risk\u2014the hazard presented by a product or process and exposure of humans or other potential targets to those hazards: Risk = F{hazard \u00a5 exposure} (17.1) This relationship simply states that risk is a function of hazard times exposure. It shows that risk can be reduced by a reduction of hazard, a reduction of exposure, and various combinations of both. The command and control approach to reducing risk has concentrated upon reduction of exposure. Such efforts have used various kinds of controls and protective measures to limit exposure. The most common example of such a measure in the academic chemistry laboratory is the wearing of goggles to protect the eyes. Goggles will not by themselves prevent acid from splashing into the face of a student, but they do prevent the acid from contacting fragile eye tissue. Explosion shields will not prevent explosions, but they do retain glass fragments that might harm the chemist or others in the vicinity. Reduction of exposure is unquestionably effective in preventing injury and harm. However, it does require constant vigilance and even nagging of personnel, as any laboratory instructor charged with making laboratory students wear their safety goggles at all times will attest. It does not protect the unprotected, such as a visitor who may walk bare faced into a chemical laboratory ignoring the warnings for required eye protection. On a larger scale, protective measures may be very effective for workers in a chemical manufacturing operation but useless to those outside the area or the environment beyond the plant walls who do not have protection. Protective measures are most effective against acute effects, but less so against long-term chronic exposures that may cause toxic responses over many years\u2019 period of time. Finally, the protective equipment can fail and there is always the possibility that humans will not use it properly. Where feasible, hazard reduction is a much more certain way of reducing risk than is exposure reduction. The human factors that play so prominently in successfully limiting exposure and that require a conscious, constant effort are much less crucial when hazards have been reduced. Compare, for example, the use of a volatile, flammable, somewhat toxic organic solvent employed for cleaning and degreasing of machined metal parts with that of a water solution of a nontoxic cleaning agent used for the same purpose. To safely work around the solvent requires an unceasing effort and constant vigilance to avoid hazards such as formation of explosive mixtures with air, presence of ignition sources that could result in a fire, and excessive exposure by inhalation or absorption through skin that might cause peripheral neuropathy (a nerve disorder) in workers. Failure of protective measures can result in a bad accident or serious harm to worker health. The water-based cleaning solution, however, would not present any of these hazards so that failure of protective measures would not create a problem.", "Normally, measures taken to reduce risk by reducing exposure have an economic cost that cannot be reclaimed in lower production costs or enhanced value of product. Of course, failure to reduce exposure can have direct, high economic costs in areas such as higher claims for worker compensation. In contrast, hazard reduction often has the potential to substantially reduce operating costs. Safer feedstocks are often less costly as raw materials. The elimination of costly control measures can lower costs overall. Again, to use the comparison of an organic solvent to a water-based cleaning solution, the organic solvent is almost certain to cost more than the aqueous solution containing relatively low concentrations of detergents and other additives. Although the organic solvent will at least require purification for recycle and perhaps even expensive disposal as a hazardous waste, the water solution may be purified by relatively simple processes, and perhaps even biological treatment, then safely discharged as wastewater to a municipal wastewater treatment facility. It should be kept in mind, however, that not all low-hazard materials are cheap, and may be signifi cantly more expensive than their more hazardous alternatives. And, in some cases, nonhazardous alternatives simply do not exist. Since hazardous substances manifest their hazards largely through their chemical reactions and characteristics, it is convenient to classify them chemically. Although the chemical variability of hazardous substances make such a classification system somewhat inexact, several categories can be defined based on chemical behavior. These are the following: \u2022 Combustible and fl ammable substances, strong reducers that burn readily or violently in the presence of atmospheric oxygen \u2022 Oxidizers that provide oxygen for the combustion of reducers \u2022 Reactive substances that are likely to undergo rapid, violent reactions, often in an unpredictable manner \u2022 Corrosive substances that are generally sources of H+ ion or OH- ion and that tend to react destructively with materials, particularly metals Some hazardous substances fall into more than one of these groups, which increases the dangers that they pose. Often the greatest concern with hazardous substances has to do with toxicity. Toxic substances are not so easy to classify in terms of chemical properties as are substances belonging to the classifications listed above. It is more appropriate to classify toxic substances on the basis of their biochemical properties. Of special use in making these classifi cations are structure\u2013activity relationships that relate known structural features and functional groups to likely toxic effects. Three kinds of hazardous substances stand out as candidates for reduction in the practice of green chemistry. The first of these consists of heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, or cadmium. As elements, these substances are indestructible. They have a wide range of adverse biological effects. Another category consists of persistent, nonbiodegradable organic materials, such as PCBs. Often not extremely toxic, these substances persist in the environment and exhibit a tendency to become magnified through biological food chains, adversely affecting organisms at or near the end of the food chain. The classic example of such compounds is insecticidal DDT, which caused reproductive problems for birds, such as falcons or eagles, at the top of the food chain. A third category of troublesome hazardous substances consists of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These have been particularly prevalent in industrial settings because of their uses as solvents for organic reactions, vehicles in paints and coatings, and for cleaning parts. In the latter two applications, the most convenient means of dealing with these volatile materials was to allow them to evaporate, so that large quantities were simply discharged to the atmosphere. 17.3.1 THE RISKS OF NOT TAKING RISKS There are limits to the reduction in risk beyond which efforts to do so become counterproductive. As in other areas of endeavor, there are circumstances in which there is no choice but to work with hazardous substances. Some things that are inherently dangerous are rendered safe by rigorous training, constant attention to potential hazards, and understanding of hazards and the best way to deal with them. Consider the analogy of commercial flight. When a large passenger aircraft lands, 100 ton of aluminum, steel, flammable fuel, and fragile human flesh traveling at a speed of twice the legal interstate speed limits for automobiles come into sudden contact with an unforgiving concrete runway. That procedure is inherently dangerous!", "But it is carried out hundreds of thousands of times per year throughout the world with but few injuries and fatalities, a tribute to the generally superb design, construction, and maintenance of aircraft and the excellent skills and training of aircrew. The same principles that make commercial air flight generally safe also apply to the handling of hazardous chemicals by properly trained personnel under carefully controlled conditions. So, although much of this book is about risk reduction as it relates to chemistry, we must always be mindful of the risks of not taking risks. If we become so timid in all of our enterprises that we refuse to take risks, scientific and economic progress will stagnate. If we get to the point that no chemical can be made if its synthesis involves the use of a potentially toxic or otherwise hazardous substance, the progress of chemical science and the development of such beneficial products as new life-saving drugs or innovative chemicals for treating water pollutants will be held back. Many argue that nuclear power entails significant risks as an energy source and that development of this power source must therefore be stopped. But, balance that potential risk against the virtually certain risk of continuing to use fossil fuels that produce greenhouse gases that cause global climate warming, and a strong case can be made for continued development of nuclear energy with newer reactor designs that incorporate strong safety features. Another example is the use of thermal processes for treating hazardous wastes, somewhat risky because of the potential for the release of toxic substances or air pollutants, but still the best way to convert many kinds of hazardous wastes to innocuous materials. 17.4 WASTE PREVENTION AND GREEN CHEMISTRY One of the basic goals of the practice of green chemistry is to reduce waste. Waste prevention is better than having to treat or clean up wastes. In the earlier years of chemical manufacture the direct costs associated with producing large quantities of wastes were very low because such wastes were simply discarded into waterways, onto the ground, or in the air as stack emissions. With the passage and enforcement of environmental laws after about 1970, costs for waste treatment increased steadily. One of the most commonly cited examples of costly waste remediation is the cleanup of PCBs in Hudson River (New York) sediment from PCBs that were discharged into the river as by-products of electrical equipment manufacture. General Electric has agreed to remove PCBs from sediments along 65 km of the river requiring the movement of about 2.5 million cubic meters of material at a cost now estimated to be around $700 million. The cleanup of pollutants including asbestos, dioxins, pesticide manufacture residues, perchlorate, and mercury are costing various concerns hundreds of millions of dollars. From a purely economic standpoint, therefore, a green chemistry approach that avoids these costs is very attractive, in addition to its large environmental benefi ts. Although the costs of such things as engineering controls, regulatory compliance, personnel protection, wastewater treatment, and safe disposal of hazardous solid wastes have certainly been worthwhile for society and the environment, they have become a large fraction of the overall cost of doing business. Companies must now do full cost accounting, which includes costs of emissions, waste disposal, cleanup, and protection of personnel and the environment. In industrialized countries, costs of complying with environmental and occupational health regulations are of a magnitude similar to those of research and development for industry as a whole. Considering the economic costs, alone, waste prevention must have a high priority in addition to its being dictated by environmental considerations. Therefore, a top priority in the practice of green chemistry is to avoid producing wastes. In the past, this largely meant producing wastes as usual, then processing them to reduce their hazards or to salvage something of value from them. With the proper practice of green chemistry, it means designing and operating integrated systems which, by their nature, do not produce wastes. 17.5 GREEN CHEMISTRY AND SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY Synthetic chemistry is the branch of chemical science involved with developing means of making new chemicals and developing improved ways of synthesizing existing chemicals. A key aspect of green chemistry is the involvement of synthetic chemists in the practice of environmental chemistry. Synthetic chemists, whose major objective has always been to make new substances and to make them cheaper and better, have come relatively late to the practice of environmental chemistry and green chemistry.", "Other areas of chemistry have been involved much longer in pollution prevention and environmental protection. From the beginning, analytical chemistry has been a key to discovering and monitoring the severity of pollution problems. Physical chemistry has played a strong role in explaining and modeling environmental chemical phenomena. The application of physical chemistry to atmospheric photochemical reactions has been especially useful in explaining and preventing harmful atmospheric chemical effects including photochemical smog formation and stratospheric ozone depletion. Other branches of chemistry have been instrumental in studying various environmental chemical phenomena. Now synthetic chemists, those who make chemicals and whose activities drive chemical processes, have become much more involved in making the manufacture, use, and ultimate disposal of chemicals as environmentally friendly as possible. Before environmental and health and safety issues gained their current prominence, the economic aspects of chemical manufacture and distribution were relatively simple. The economic factors involved included costs of feedstock, energy requirements, and marketability of product. Now, however, costs must include those arising from regulatory compliance, liability, end-of-pipe waste treatment, and costs of waste disposal. By eliminating or greatly reducing the use of toxic or hazardous feedstocks, catalysts, and reaction media, and by avoiding the generation of dangerous intermediates and by-products, green chemistry eliminates or greatly diminishes the additional costs that have come to be associated with meeting environmental and safety requirements of conventional chemical manufacture. As illustrated in Figure 17.2, there are two general and often complementary approaches to the implementation of green chemistry in chemical synthesis, both of which challenge the imaginations of chemists and chemical engineers. The first of these is to use existing feedstocks but make them by more environmentally benign processes. The second approach is to substitute other feedstocks that are made by environmentally benign approaches. In some cases, a combination of the two approaches is used. 17.5.1 YIELD AND ATOM ECONOMY Traditionally, synthetic chemists have used yield, defi ned as a percentage of the degree to which a chemical reaction or synthesis goes to completion, to measure the success of a chemical synthesis. For example, if a chemical reaction shows that 100 g of product should be produced, but only 85 g is produced, the yield is 85%. A synthesis with a high yield may still generate signifi cant quantities Substitute chemicals made byenvironmentally benign processes of useless by-products if the reaction does so as part of the synthesis process. Instead of yield, green chemistry emphasizes atom economy, the fraction of reactant material that actually ends up in fi nal product. Atom economy is expressed by the equation Molar mass desired product Atom economy = (17.2) Total molar mass of materials generated With 100% atom economy, all of the material that goes into the synthesis process is incorporated into the product. For efficient utilization of raw materials, a 100% atom economy process is most desirable. Figure 17.3 illustrates the concepts of yield and atom economy. (a) By-products fromside reaction By-products generated reactants (b) By-products generated fromreaction making desired product Another quantitative measure of green chemistry is the E-factor based on waste produced relative to the amount of product.4 In its simplest form the mathematical expression of the E-factor is the following: Total mass of waste E-factor = (17.3) Total mass of product 17.6 FEEDSTOCKS A crucial decision that must be made in implementing a process to manufacture a chemical or product is selection of feedstock from which the product is made. To the extent possible, the feedstock should place minimal demands on the earth\u2019s resources. It should be a relatively safe material, and its acquisition and refining should be safe. In some cases the processes and reagents required to isolate an otherwise safe feedstock make its acquisition hazardous, such as in the use of highly toxic cyanide to remove low levels of gold from ore. Wherever possible, a feedstock should be renewable; for example, feedstocks from biomass that can be grown repeatedly are often preferable to depletable petroleum feedstocks. In a generalized sense, the overall process of obtaining a useful product from a feedstock, such as petroleum or biological materials, can be divided into the three categories shown in Figure 17.4. Both the petroleum and biological sources of potential feedstocks are relatively well known. For petroleum feedstocks, the technology for separation has been developed to a high degree of sophistication. The technologies for obtaining raw materials from plant sources, such as extraction of oils with solvents or separation of cellulose from lignin in wood, are also well advanced.", "Because of the high degree of development of the petrochemical industry, the science of converting petroleum feedstocks to desired products is very well developed, but is less so in the case of biological feedstocks. 17.6.1 BIOLOGICAL FEEDSTOCKS With some billions of tons of carbon fixed as biomass each year, there exists an enormous potential for the use of biological materials as feedstocks. The most obvious such material consists of wood from trees. Large quantities of cellulose are generated each year in the production of crops such as corn and wheat. Although a fraction of crop by-product biomass should be returned to soil to maintain its condition as a growth medium for plants, there is a substantial excess that could be used as feedstock. Biological processes, particularly plant growth, produce a number of potentially useful biopolymers including, in addition to cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, lignin, lipids, and proteins. Plants are also useful sources of smaller molecules, including monosaccharides (glucose), disaccharides (sucrose), amino acids, waxes, fats, oils, and terpene hydrocarbons, including those used to make natural rubber. The potential of genetic engineering to produce plants that have high yields of feedstock chemicals could lead to the development of exciting new sources of biological feedstocks. Potential feedstocks from biological sources tend to be more complex than those from petroleum. This offers the advantage of starting with a material in which much of the synthesis required to make a product has already been done by a living plant. Furthermore, many desired products have relatively high oxygen contents, and biological materials tend to contain bound oxygen. This can avoid the operation of converting a petroleum-based hydrocarbon feedstock to an oxygenated compound, which often requires severe conditions, hazardous oxidizing agents, and potentially troublesome catalysts. In some cases, however, the complexity of biological feedstocks is a disadvantage because it is usually more difficult to convert a complex molecule to a significantly different one than it is when starting with a relatively simple feedstock. Biological feedstocks are often complex mixtures of materials that require separation, processing, and purification. Factories that perform these functions on biological feedstocks are biorefi neries.5 Biorefineries should be designed and operated in keeping with the best practice of green chemistry. This would include such things as using fermentation-produced ethanol or supercritical carbon dioxide (see Section 17.9) as solvents, the use of biocatalysts where possible, avoidance of severe conditions, and high efficiency of energy utilization. Arguably the most important biological raw materials for chemical synthesis are carbohydrates produced by plants, including glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch, and OH Glucose cellulose. Starch and cellulose are large-molecule polymers of glucose, the structural formulas of which are represented in Chapter 22, Figures 22.4 and 22.5. Carbohydrates, such as starch from corn grain and sucrose from sugar cane, are generated in high quantities by a number of plants. Furthermore, cellulosic wastes can be hydrolyzed to generate simple sugars that can be used in chemical synthesis. A major advantage of carbohydrates in chemical synthesis is their abundance of hydroxyl functional groups, as shown in the structural formula of glucose above. Such functionality provides sites for the attachment of other functionalities and for initiating chemical reactions leading to desired products. The inherent biodegradability of carbohydrates provides them with some environmental advantages as well. The most abundant biomaterial produced by plants is cellulose. Cellulose currently has a number of uses as a feedstock, and these will grow in the future as plant biomass supplants diminishing petroleum feedstocks. In addition to cellulose, a very abundant material in plant biomass is lignin, a complex binding material that serves to hold wood and other plant materials together. Unlike carbohydrate cellulose, which has a uniform structure and is composed entirely of glucose monomer units, lignin has a variable three-dimensional molecular structure, the most common feature of which is the phenylpropane unit (a benzene ring attached to a three-carbon chain) along with other hydrocarbon and oxygen-containing groups. The molecular masses of lignin may exceed 15,000. Lignin\u2019s variability severely limits its use as a chemical feedstock. A major detriment to the use of lignin in green chemistry is its resistance to any sort of biological processes that might be considered for its conversion to useful products. One of the more promising potential uses for abundant lignin resources is the production of phenolic compounds. Described in Chapter 22, Section 22.5, lipids are substances that can be extracted from biological materials by organic solvents. Lipids and hydrocarbon terpenes produced by plants have a number of potential uses as feedstocks.", "Relatively high in hydrogen and carbon and low in oxygen contents, lipids are oils, greases, and waxes with properties similar to a number of materials in petroleum. Some lipids can be used to synthesize synthetic liquid fuels and can even be used directly as diesel fuel. An early diesel engine that won the Grand Prize at the Paris Exhibition of 1900 ran on peanut oil, chosen because the French government wanted to promote this material produced in abundance in some of its African colonies. Oils and fats from biological sources are very important raw materials for the chemical industry.6 These materials provide a variety of fatty acids including oleic acid from new strains of sunfl ower, linolenic acid from soybean and linseed, rinoleic acid from castor oil, erucic acid from rapeseed, and a variety of oils from newly available plant sources. For chemical synthesis, the fatty acids from natural sources offer advantages because of the carboxylic acid group and, for some fatty acids, the presence of reactive C=C double bonds in the carbon chain. 17.7 REAGENTS Reagents are chemical agents that act upon feedstocks in synthesis. A reagent may be partly or even fully incorporated into a product, or it may act to produce a chemical change in the feedstock. Judicious selection of reagents for carrying out chemical processes can be a crucial factor in developing a successful green chemistry process. Use of a benign feedstock may be of relatively little use if large quantities of hazardous reagents are required for its processing. Two important factors driving reagent selection are product selectivity and product yield. High product selectivity means higher conversion of raw material to the desired product with minimal by-product generation. High product yield means a high percentage of the desired product is obtained relative to the maximum yield calculated from stoichiometric considerations. Both high-product selectivity and high-product yield reduce the amounts of extraneous material that must be handled and separated. In selecting safe reagents and feedstocks, consideration of structure\u2013activity relationships can be very useful. It is known that certain structural features or functional groups tend to create particular kinds of hazards. For example, the presence of oxygen and nitrogen\u2014particularly multiple nitrogen atoms\u2014in close proximity in a molecule tends to make it reactive or even explosive. The presence of the N-N=O functional group means that a compound is an N\u2013nitroso compound (nitrosamine), many of which are carcinogenic. The ability to donate methyl groups to biomolecules may make a compound mutagenic or carcinogenic; substitution of longer-chain hydrocarbon groups can reduce this hazard. In evaluating the safety of reagents and choosing safer alternatives, special attention should be given to functional groups consisting of particular groupings of atoms. The carcinogenic potential of the N-N=O group was mentioned above. Aldehydes tend to be irritants to animals and are photochemically active, so that they can contribute to smog formation when released to the atmosphere. Whenever possible it is best to use alternative compounds when particular functional groups are likely to be a problem. It is also sometimes possible to mask functional groups to produce less dangerous forms, and then unmask them at the point in the synthesis where the functionality is needed. Oxidation is one of the most common operations in chemical synthesis. The nature of oxidation often requires harsh conditions and harsh reagents, such as permanganate (MnO4 -), chromium(VI) compounds (such as potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7), toxic and costly osmium tetroxide, or m-chloroperbenzoic acid. Therefore, one of the main objectives of green chemistry has been the development of more benign oxidizing agents and oxidation reactions. Reduction is a common operation in chemical synthesis. As with oxidation, the reagents used for reduction tend to be reactive and difficult to handle. Two of the most common such reagents are lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH4, which is flammable and rather hazardous to use, and tributyltin hydride, which can release volatile, toxic tin-containing products. Both oxidizing and reducing agents used in chemical synthesis produce by-products that must be carefully disposed of at signifi cant expense. Alkylation consists of the attachment of alkyl groups, such as the methyl group, \u2013CH3, to an organic molecule. The attachment of an alkyl group to a nitrogen atom in an amine is used as a step in the synthesis of a variety of dyes, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, plant growth regulators, and other specialty chemicals.", "In such cases, alkylation is commonly carried out using alkyl halides or alkyl sulfates in the presence of a base as shown below for the attachment of a methyl group to N in aniline: (17.4) + H2O This kind of reaction produces significant amounts of inorganic salt by-product, such as Na2SO4. Also, alkyl halides and alkyl sulfates pose toxicity concerns; dimethyl sulfate is a suspect human carcinogen. Relatively nontoxic dialkyl carbonates are very effective alkylating agents that promise to provide a safer alternative to alkyl halides or sulfates for some kinds of alkylation reactions. The promise of dimethyl carbonate for methylation (alkylation in which the methyl group, -CH3, is attached) has been enhanced by the straightforward synthesis of this compound from methanol and carbon monoxide in the presence of a copper salt: HO 2HCOH+CO+12O2 H3COCOCH3+H2O (17.5) \u2013 H Dimethyl carbonate Dimethyl carbonate can be used for methylation of nitrogen in amine compounds at a temperature of 180\u221eC under continuous-flow gas\u2013liquid phase-transfer catalysis conditions (which involve transfer of organic ionic reactant species between water and an organic phase) as shown below for the methylation of aniline: O H 2 N +2H3COCOCH3 H Dimethyl carbonate (17.6) H 2 N + CH3OH + CO2 CH3 The use of dimethyl carbonate as a methylating agent offers the twin advantages of up to 99% efficiency of conversion to product with selectivities of 99% or more for the monomethyl product. The by-products are innocuous carbon dioxide and methanol, which can be recirculated through the process for making dimethyl carbonate (Reaction 17.5). Dimethyl carbonate is useful, for example, in making monomethyl organonitrogen derivatives required for the synthesis of analgesics, such as ibuprofen. 17.8 STOICHIOMETRIC AND CATALYTIC REAGENTS In discussions of green chemistry distinction is often made between stoichiometric reactions and catalytic reactions. A stoichiometric reaction written in a generalized form as A + B + C \u00c6 Product + D + E (17.7) Two Step Stoichiometric Route to Ethylene Oxide Synthesis Cl H H H Cl2 H CC H+HCl H OH Ethene (ethylene) Chlorohydrin O Ca(OH)22H C C H 2H C C H+CaCl2+2H2O HOH HH Ethylene oxide One Step Catalytic Route to Ethylene Oxide Synthesis Cl H H H CC H H + 1 \u2013 O22 Ag catalyst 10\u201330 atm H O C H C H H Ethene (ethylene) Ethylene oxide FIGURE 17.5 The stoichiometric and catalytic routes to ethylene oxide synthesis. is one in which two or more substances enter into a reaction to provide a desired product. If the reaction is simply that between A and B and if all these reagents are consumed to yield product, the reaction is 100% atom-effi cient. Such an ideal is rarely realized in practice because (1) either A or B is a limiting reagent and one of the other reagents is left over, (2) only part of at least one of the reactants ends up in product, and (3) additional reagents are required to make the reaction proceed. Where possible, it is preferable to replace stoichiometric reactions with catalytic reactions in which, ideally, a catalyst that is not itself consumed enables the reaction to occur rapidly, specifi cally, and with 100% atom efficiency. The distinction between stoichiometric and catalytic reactions can be illustrated with the example of the synthesis of ethylene oxide, widely used in the synthesis of ethylene glycol (antifreeze), ethylene glycol ester solvents, polyesters, ethanolamines, and other products, outlined in Figure 17.5. Although it gives relatively high yields, the stoichiometric chlorohydrin route to ethylene oxide requires hazardous and expensive chlorine gas as a reagent and produces 3.5 kg of waste calcium chloride per kilogram ethylene oxide product. The catalytic route gives an approximately 80% yield without generating by-products and the unreacted reagents can simply be recycled through the synthesis. By 1975, the catalytic route had supplanted the chlorhydrin synthesis pathway. 17.9 MEDIA AND SOLVENTS Media is a term used to refer to the matrix in which or on which chemical processes occur. The type and strength of interaction between the media and reactants in a chemical process play a very important role in determining the type, degree, and rate of the process. Although media may include solids upon which reactions take place, by far the most common type of media consists of liquid solvents in which reagents are dissolved. Solvents interact to various extents and in various ways with the solutes dissolved in them. An important phenomenon is solvation, in which the solvent molecules interact with solute molecules.", "A common example of this is the attraction of polar water solvent molecules for dissolved cations and anions. This ability makes water an extraordinarily good solvent for ionic substances\u2014acids, bases, and salts\u2014that are commonly used in chemical reactions. The ability of water to form hydrogen bonds is particularly important in its ability to dissolve a wide range of biological materials capable of forming hydrogen bonds. Beyond their uses as reaction media, solvents have other uses, particularly in separation, purifi cation, and cleaning. Water is the most abundant and safest solvent and should be used wherever possible. In fact, one of the main objectives of the practice of green chemistry is to convert processes to the use of water solvent wherever possible. However, water is not a suitable solvent for a wide range of organic substances used industrially. Therefore, the use of organic solvents consisting of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives, such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, is unavoidable in many cases. In addition to serving as reaction media, organic solvents are used as cleaners, degreasers, and as extractants to remove organic substances from solids. A major use of organic solvents is as the liquid vehicle to enable the application, spreading, and impregnation (such as of cloth) of dissolved or suspended dyes and other agents in formulations of paints, coatings, inks, and related materials. By their nature, solvents cause more environmental and health problems than do other participants in the chemical synthesis process. Most solvents are volatile and tend to escape into the workplace and atmosphere. Hydrocarbon solvents are fl ammable and can form explosive mixtures with air. Released to the atmosphere, they can be instrumental in causing formation of photochemical smog (see Chapter 13). A number of adverse health effects are attributed to solvents. Carbon tetrachloride, CCl4, causes lipid peroxidation in the body that can result in severe damage to the liver. Benzene causes blood disorders and is suspected of causing leukemia. Volatile C5\u2013C7 alkanes damage nerves and can result in a condition known as peripheral neuropathy. The possibility of their being carcinogenic is always a consideration in dealing with solvents in the workplace. A key consideration in selecting and using a solvent for the proper practice of green chemistry consists of its toxicological and environmental effects on biological systems. This obviously includes toxic effects to humans. Physical properties, such as volatility, density, and solubility, are important in estimating potential environmental and biological effects. Lipophilicity, the tendency to dissolve lipid tissue, is a measure of the ability of a solvent to penetrate skin and hence is an important factor in determining its biological effects. The environmental persistence and biodegradation of solvents should be considered. Special care must be taken to not use or at least prevent the release to the atmosphere of volatile solvents that may become involved in photochemical reactions leading to photochemical smog formation. The formerly widespread use of volatile chlorofl uorocarbon (CFC) solvents as blowing agents to produce porous plastics and plastic foams resulted in widespread dissipation of these ozone destroying CFC vapors to the atmosphere (see Chapter 14). Much of the progress that has been made toward the goal of green chemistry has come with replacement of potentially troublesome solvents with less dangerous ones. Some pertinent examples of such replacement are shown in Table 17.1. The best solvent to use, when possible, is water. It is discussed below. 17.9.1 WATER, THE GREENEST SOLVENT Although it does not truly dissolve hydrophobic organic substances, water may hold such substances in suspension as finely divided colloidal matter, thus in some cases enabling its use in place of organic solvents as a medium for organic reactions and for other applications. In addition to its not dissolving organic substances, water suffers from the disadvantage of reacting strongly with some reagents, such as AlCl3 used in Friedel\u2013Crafts reactions, strongly reducing LiAlH4, and metallic sodium used in some applications. On the other hand, precisely because water is such a poor solvent for organic substances\u2014the hydrophobic effect\u2014some organic reactions proceed better in a water medium than in organic solvents. Water is an excellent solvent for some of the more hydrophilic biological molecules, such as glucose, that are gaining favor as reactants for green chemical processes. Largely ignored during the development of organic synthesis, water is getting renewed attention as a medium for organic chemical reactions and processes. This is due largely to water being the ultimate green solvent with no detrimental environmental, safety (flammability), or toxicological aspects to its use.", "As the price for feedstocks for making organic solvents has increased, the fact that water is essentially free increases its attractiveness. Water is a good solvent for many biological materials that are gaining favor as green chemistry feedstocks, and, as discussed above, its repulsion of some organophilic reagents can be advantageous in some cases. Water-insoluble organic products are readily separated from water without having to distill off an organic solvent. The control of heat and TABLE 17.1 Solvents for Which Substitutes Have Been Developed Solvent Disadvantages of the Solvent Substitute Characteristics of the Substitute Benzene Toxic, causing blood disorders Toluene Much less toxic than benzene and suspected of causing because of the presence of a leukemia, metabolized to toxic metabolically oxidizable methyl phenol substituent group; produces harmless hippuric acid metabolite n-Hexane Neurotoxic causing peripheral 2,5-Dimethyl-hexane Lacks toxicity characteristics of neuropathy manifested by n-hexane, signifi cantly higher mobility loss, reduced boiling point may be a sensations in extremeties disadvantage Glycol ethers Ethylene glycol monomethyl 1-Methoxy-2-propanol Less toxic than the glycol ethers, ether and ethylene glycol but still effective as a solvent monoethyl ether have adverse reproductive and developmental effects in animals Various organic Flammability, toxicity, poor Supercritical fl uid Widely available, good solvent for solvents biodegradability, tendency to carbon dioxide organic solutes, readily removed contribute to photochemical by evaporation, nonpolluting, smog except as a greenhouse gas if allowed to escape temperature is an important aspect of many chemical processes. For heat and temperature control, water is the best solvent to use because of its very high heat capacity (see Chapter 3, Table 3.1). 17.9.2 DENSE PHASE CARBON DIOXIDE AS A SOLVENT Substances that are normally considered to be gases take on special properties when highly compressed. The general diagram shown in Figure 17.6 shows that, at temperatures exceeding a critical temperature, Tc, and pressures exceeding a critical pressure, Pc, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears and a substance becomes a supercritical fluid. The most widely studied supercritical fluid is that formed by carbon dioxide, for which Tc is 31.1\u221eC and Pc is 73.8 atm. Supercritical fl uids have many useful solvent properties. It has also been found, however, that highly compressed carbon dioxide below the critical point, where it is not supercritical, but may exist as a mixture of liquid and gas, has some excellent solvent properties as well. The term dense phase fluid is used to designate a highly compressed, dense substance that may be a supercritical fluid, highly compressed gas, or mixture of gas and liquid. Dense phase fluids have a number of interesting solvent properties and have been extensively investigated as extractants and for chromatographic separations (supercritical fl uid chromatography). An important characteristic of these fluids is their much lower viscosities than conventional liquids; that of supercritical CO2 is only about 1/30 the viscosity of liquids normally used as solvents. This means that solutes diffuse much more readily in supercritical fluids, thus enabling them to react much faster. The wide latitude within which pressures and temperatures of dense phase fluids may be changed enables their properties to be varied widely. Supercritical fluid carbon dioxide is an excellent solvent for organic solutes. This has led to its uses in place of organochlorine solvents for cleaning metal parts and in dry cleaning. A major advantage of supercritical fluid carbon dioxide in some applications is that it is readily evaporated from solutes by releasing pressure. This has led to interest in the solvent as a vehicle for paints and coatings. With the appropriate apparatus, the released carbon dioxide can be reclaimed and recompressed back to a supercritical state for recycling. This capability tends to overcome criticism of the use of carbon dioxide, which is, of course, a greenhouse gas when released to the atmosphere. Supercritical fluid carbon dioxide has a highly organophilic nature, which may be excessive for some applications with more polar or ionic solutes. Addition of polar cosolvents, such as methyl alcohol, can overcome this disadvantage. A further advantage of supercritical fl uid carbon dioxide as a solvent is its ability to dissolve gases, enhanced by the very high pressure under which supercritical fluid carbon dioxide must be maintained. This enables reactions to occur effi ciently with gaseous reactants in supercritical fluid carbon dioxide that would otherwise not be possible. Supercritical fluids have some disadvantages. The major disadvantage of such solvents is the special apparatus required to maintain relatively severe supercritical conditions.", "However, supercritical fluid carbon dioxide\u2019s advantages of low cost, high abundance from a number of sources, nontoxic nature, nonflammability, and the fact that it is not classified as a volatile organic solvent are leading to increased uses of this solvent. 17.9.3 GAS-EXPANDED SOLVENTS Some of the handling and safety issues involved with the use of supercritical carbon dioxide can be overcome with gas-expanded solvents that are composed of subcritical pressurized gas (usually carbon dioxide) in contact with an organic solvent. The carbon dioxide dissolves in the organic liquid and expands the volume of the liquid several fold. As much as 80% of the organic solvent can be replaced by this approach. The properties of the solvent are altered significantly by the presence of carbon dioxide. An interesting possibility is that carbon dioxide, which is used in fi re extinguishers, can render volatile hydrocarbon solvents much less flammable enabling their substitution for environmentally and toxicologically problematic chlorinated hydrocarbon liquids. 17.10 ENHANCING REACTIONS One of the most important aspects of green chemistry is the enhancement of the speed and degree of completion of chemical reactions. The two major ways in which this can be done are by adding energy to the reaction system or by reducing the activation energy required to make the reaction go. Catalysts are substances that enable reactions to proceed more rapidly (or at all). Catalysts can enable all kinds of reactions including oxidation, reduction, and a variety of organic reactions. The choice of catalysts is very important in the practice of green chemistry because they can add to the hazards of chemical processes and produce troublesome by-products and product contaminants. This can occur, for example, with homogeneous catalysts that are intimately mixed with the reagents involved in chemical synthesis. Catalysts that are most amenable to the practice of green chemistry are heterogeneous catalysts, such as molecular sieves, that can be kept entirely separate from products. Insofar as possible, such catalysts should be nontoxic. In general, the greenest catalysts are enzymes that have developed in organisms to carry out biochemical processes.7 Because they developed in organisms under conditions conducive to life, enzymatic reactions are by their nature carried out in water under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. They are generally very rapid and specific. Such reactions have been used for thousands of years in fermentation processes, such as the conversion of sucrose in cane sugar to glucose and fructose sugars by invertase enzymes and the subsequent fermentation of these two monosaccharides to ethanol by zymase enzyme in yeasts. In recent years, aided by recombinant DNA (genetic engineering) techniques, enzyme processes have been developed to carry out a wide variety of chemical processes. Among the functions that enzyme catalysts can perform are oxidation and reduction reactions, hydrolysis reactions, transfer of functional groups to or from organic molecules, and additions to groups across double bonds or the reverse. The most basic way of introducing energy into a reaction system is by external heating. This can be done by simply heating a reaction vessel from the outside, with steam coils immersed in a reaction vessel, or by resistance-heated electrical coils immersed in the reaction system. The practice of green chemistry seeks to develop more elegant means of introducing energy into a reaction system as alternatives to external heating. Microwaves can be used to add energy to reactions to enhance reaction rates. Microwaves are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths of 1 cm to 1 m (frequency 30 GHz to 300 Hz). To avoid interference with microwave bands used in communication, industrial and household microwave generators commonly operate at 2.45 GHz. Microwaves are absorbed by polar molecules, such as those of water, causing rapid re-orientation of the molecules in a microwave field. The result is a high input of energy directly into substances subjected to microwaves thereby adding energy and speeding up reactions. Microwave energy can be put directly into relatively small volumes of reaction media, reducing material requirements and minimizing wastes. Microwaves can be used to enhance reactions in (1) water media, (2) polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, and (3) media-free reactions, such as mixed solid reactants. Subjecting a reaction medium to ultrasound energy at frequencies between 20 and 100 kHz can introduce very high energy pulses into the medium. This approach to enhancing reactions is commonly called sonochemistry.", "Commonly, the ultrasound is produced by the piezoelectric effect through which crystals of substances such as ceramic impregnated barium titanate are subjected to rapidly reversing electrical fields converting the electrical energy to sound energy with an effi ciency that can reach 95%. An advantage of sonochemistry is that it can introduce high energy into microscopic regions enabling reactions to occur without appreciably heating the reaction medium. The passage of a direct current of electricity through a reaction medium can cause both reductions and oxidations to occur. Reduction, the addition of electrons, e -, can occur at the relatively negatively charged cathode, and oxidation, the loss of electrons, at the relatively positively charged anode. A simple example of an electrochemical process used to manufacture industrial chemicals occurs when a direct current is passed through molten sodium chloride, NaCl to produce elemental giving the following net reaction: sodium and elemental chlorine. At the cathode, sodium ion is reduced: Na+ + e \u00c6 Na(l) (17.8) and at the anode, chloride ion is oxidized to elemental chlorine gas: 2Cl\u00c6 Cl2(g) + 2e (17.9) 2Na++ 2Cl-\u00c6 2Na(l) +Cl2(g) (17.10) The reaction utilizes electrical energy efficiently and occurs with 100% atom economy. Electrochemical oxidation and reduction can be controlled by the potentials applied, by the media in which they occur, and by the electrodes used. In a sense, electrochemical processes use \u201cmatter-free\u201d reagents; no other approach comes any closer to the attainment of ideal green chemistry. Photochemical reactions use the energy of photons of light or ultraviolet radiation to cause reactions to occur. For electromagnetic radiation of frequency n, the energy of a photon is given by the equation E =hn, where h is Planck\u2019s constant. Since a photon can be absorbed directly by a molecule or a functional group on a molecule, the application of electromagnetic radiation of the appropriate energy to a reaction medium can introduce a high amount of energy into a reactant species without significantly heating the medium. Photochemical energy can be used to cause synthesis reactions to occur more efficiently and with less production of waste by-products than nonphotochemical processes.8,9 One example is the acylation of benzoquinone with an aldehyde to produce an acylhydroquinone, an intermediate used to make some specialty polymers: O OH O O h\u03bd R +C HR (17.11) O OH Benzoquinone An acylhydroquinone (R is a hydrocarbon group) This reaction occurs with 100% atom economy. Unlike the standard Friedel\u2013Crafts type of reaction, which utilizes the catalytic effect of Lewis acid-type acidic halides, particularly aluminum chloride, AlCl3, the photochemical process does not require moisture- and air-sensitive, potentially reactive catalytic substances. A reagent does not have to absorb a photon directly to undergo a photochemically induced reaction. In some cases photochemically reactive species may be added that absorb photons, then produce reactive excited species or free radicals that carry out additional reactions. An example of this is provided with hydrogen peroxide, which absorbs photons H2O2 h HO +HO\u2211 +n\u00c6 \u2211 (17.12) to produce reactive hydroxyl radicals that react with a number of other species. 17.11 INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY Figure 17.7 illustrates the old way of industrial production that prevailed in the earlier days of the industrial revolution. Raw materials and energy were taken from nonrenewable sources, including wood from old growth timber, and products were made without consideration of wastes or pollutants. Air and water pollutants were simply released to the atmosphere and waterways, respectively, and by-product solid, semisolid, and liquid wastes were placed in the geosphere without consideration of their effects. After products were used, they were simply discarded to the environment without thought of environmental effects. The idea of sustainability was a foreign concept. As a result, air and water became polluted and the land was littered with waste dumps and discarded consumer products. Some of the ill effects of reckless production without regard to sustainability were noted in Section 17.1. At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that a viable alternative to the old unsustainable ways is provided in part by the practice of industrial ecology, which emerged as a recognized discipline around 1990.", "Industrial ecology is a comprehensive approach to production, distribution, utilization, and termination of goods and services in a manner that maximizes mutually beneficial utilization of materials and energy among enterprises, thereby minimizing consumption of nonrenewable raw materials and energy while preventing the production of wastes and pollutants.10 The practice of industrial ecology involves optimization of materials utilization starting with raw material and progressing through finished material, to component, to product, and finally to the final fate of obsolete product and its components. In addition to materials and resources, industrial ecology considers energy and capital. Figure 17.8 shows industrial ecology operating in an idealized manner. This figure illustrates the minimal inputs of raw materials and energy, minimum production of wastes, and maximum circulation of materials within the systems that are characteristic of ideal systems of industrial ecology. Industrial ecology is analogous to ecology in nature in which organisms create intricate interdependent webs whereby individual kinds of organisms utilize waste products from others for their own needs. This results in extremely high efficiencies of resource utilization in nature with essentially zero wastes. Organisms operate in natural ecosystems. Similarly, enterprises that practice industrial ecology operate in industrial ecosystems. Several important analogies exist between industrial ecology and natural ecology. One of these is the analogy behind the evolution of organisms and their ecosystems through natural selection in which those organisms most suited to particular environments evolve through genetic processes. Similarly, systems of industrial ecology have evolved through natural selection processes. If a waste product becomes available, an enterprise is likely to develop to utilize the product. If a more effi cient enterprise for utilizing the waste appears, it will become dominant. These kinds of practices have occurred ever since industries first emerged, centuries before industrial ecology was formally recognized. It should be kept in mind that with current understanding of the nature of industrial ecology, something like \u201cintelligent design\u201d has the potential to be applied to industrial ecosystems. Based on knowledge of industrial enterprises, their needs, and their markets, and utilizing the enormous computing powers now available to planners, systems of industrial ecology can be planned, constructed, and operated that are functional and effi cient. Just as natural ecosystems are not static and undergo ecological succession, such as grasslands \u00c6 shrublands \u00c6 forests, industrial ecosystems undergo a form of ecological succession. Rapid developments in manufacturing techniques, changes in sources of raw materials or energy, and shifting markets will inevitably change the mix of enterprises in an industrial ecosystem and the ways in which they interact. Therefore, a form of natural selection must operate to provide the most effi cient possible systems of industrial ecology. 17.12 THE FIVE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF AN INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM Industrial ecosystems include all aspects of production, processing, and consumption. As shown in Figure 17.8, there are several distinct components of an industrial ecosystem, which can be categorized as the following: these are (1) a primary materials producer, (2) a source or sources of energy, (3) a materials processing and manufacturing sector, (4) a waste processing sector, and (5) a consumer sector. In such an idealized system operating with the best practice of industrial ecology, the flow of materials among the major hubs is very high. Each constituent of the system evolves in a manner that maximizes the efficiency with which the system utilizes materials and energy. It is convenient to consider the primary materials producers and the energy generators together because both materials and energy are required in order for the industrial ecosystem to operate. The primary materials producer or producers may consist of one or several enterprises devoted to providing the basic materials that sustain the industrial ecosystem. Most generally, in any realistic industrial ecosystem, a significant fraction of the material processed by the system consists of virgin materials. In a number of cases, and increasingly so as pressures build to recycle materials, signifi cant amounts of the materials come from recycling sources. The processes that virgin materials entering the system are subjected to vary with the kind of material, but can generally be divided into several major steps. Typically, the first step is extraction, designed to remove the desired substance as completely as possible from the other substances with which it occurs. This stage of materials processing can produce large quantities of waste material requiring disposal, as is the case with some metal ores in which the metal makes up a small percentage of the ore that is mined.", "In other cases, such as corn grain providing the basis of a corn products industry, the \u201cwaste,\u201d\u2014in this specific example the cornstalks associated with the grain\u2014can be left on the soil to add humus and improve soil quality. A concentration step may follow extraction to put the desired material into a purer form. After concentration, the material may be put through additional refining steps including separations. Following these steps, the material is usually subjected to additional processing and preparation leading to the finished materials. Throughout the various steps of extraction, concentration, separation, refining, processing, preparation, and fi nishing, various physical and chemical operations are used, and wastes requiring disposal may be produced. Recycled materials may be introduced at various parts of the process, although they are usually introduced into the system following the concentration step. The extraction and preparation of energy sources can follow many of the steps outlined above for the extraction and preparation of materials. For example, the processes involved in extracting uranium from ore, enriching it in the fi ssionable uranium-235 isotope, and casting it into fuel rods for nuclear fission power production include all of those outlined above for materials. On the other hand, some rich sources of coal are essentially scooped from a coal seam and sent to a power plant for power generation with only minimal processing, such as sorting and grinding. Recycled materials added to the system at the primary materials and energy production phase may be from both pre and postconsumer sources. As examples, recycled paper may be macerated and added at the pulping stage of paper manufacture. Recycled aluminum may be added at the molten metal stage of aluminum metal production. Finished materials from primary materials producers are fabricated to make products in the materials processing and manufacturing sector, which is often a very complex system. For example, the manufacture of an automobile requires steel for the frame, plastic for various components, rubber in tires, lead in the battery, and copper in the wiring, along with a large number of other materials. Typically, the first step in materials manufacturing and processing is a forming operation. For example, sheet steel suitable for making automobile frames may be cut, pressed, and welded into the configuration needed to make a frame. At this step some wastes may be produced that require disposal. An example of such wastes consists of carbon fiber/epoxy composites left over from forming parts such as jet aircraft engine housings. Finished components from the forming step are fabricated into finished products that are ready for the consumer market. The materials processing and manufacturing sector presents several opportunities for recycling. At this point it may be useful to define two different streams of recycled materials: \u2022 Process recycle streams consisting of materials recycled in the manufacturing operation itself \u2022 External recycle streams consisting of materials recycled from other manufacturers or from postconsumer products Materials suitable for recycling can vary significantly. Generally, materials from the process recycle streams are most suitable for recycling because they are the same materials used in the manufacturing operation. Recycled materials from the outside, especially those from postconsumer sources, may vary greatly in their characteristics because of the lack of effective controls over recycled post-consumer materials. Therefore, manufacturers may be reluctant to use such substances. In the consumer sector, products are sold or leased to the consumers who use them. The duration and intensity of use vary widely with the product; paper towels are used only once, whereas an automobile may be used thousands of times over many years. In all cases, however, the end of the useful lifetime of the product is reached and it is either (1) discarded or (2) recycled. The success of a total industrial ecology system may be measured largely by the degree to which recycling predominates over disposal. Recycling has become so widely practiced that an entirely separate waste processing sector of an economic system may now be defi ned. This sector consists of enterprises that deal specifi cally with the collection, separation, and processing of recyclable materials and their distribution to end-users. Such operations may be entirely private or they may involve cooperative efforts with governmental sectors. They are often driven by laws and regulations that provide penalties against simply discarding used items and materials, as well as positive economic and regulatory incentives for their recycle. 17.13 INDUSTRIAL METABOLISM Industrial metabolism refers to the processes to which materials and components are subjected in industrial ecosystems.", "It is analogous to the metabolic processes that occur with food and nutrients in biological systems. Like biological metabolism, industrial metabolism may be addressed at several levels. A level of industrial metabolism at which green chemistry, especially, comes into play is at the molecular level where substances are changed chemically to give desired materials or to generate energy. Industrial metabolism can be addressed within individual unit processes in a factory, at the factory level, at the industrial ecosystem level, and even globally. A signifi cant difference between industrial metabolism as it is now practiced and natural metabolic processes relates to the wastes that these systems generate. Natural ecosystems have developed such that true wastes are virtually nonexistent. For example, even those parts of plants that remain after biodegradation of plant materials form soil humus (see Chapter 16) that improves the conditions of soil on which plants grow. Anthropogenic industrial systems, however, have developed in ways that generate large quantities of wastes, where a waste may be defi ned as dissipative use of natural resources. Furthermore, human use of materials has a tendency to dilute and dissipate materials and disperse them to the environment. Materials may end up in a physical or chemical form from which reclamation becomes impractical because of the energy and effort required. A successful industrial ecosystem overcomes such tendencies. Organisms performing their metabolic processes degrade materials to extract energy (catabolism) and synthesize new substances (anabolism). Industrial ecosystems perform analogous functions. The objective of industrial metabolism in a successful industrial ecosystem is to make desired goods with the least amount of by-product and waste. This can pose a significant challenge. For example, to produce lead from lead ore for automobile batteries requires mining large quantities of ore, extracting the relatively small fraction of the ore consisting of lead sulfide mineral, and roasting and reducing the mineral to get lead metal. The whole process generates large quantities of lead-contaminated tailings left over from mineral extraction and significant quantities of by-product sulfur dioxide, which must be reclaimed to make sulfuric acid and not released to the environment. The recycling pathway, by way of contrast, takes essentially pure lead from recycled batteries and simply melts it down to produce lead for new batteries; the advantages of recycling in this case are obvious. Industrial metabolic processes that emphasize recycling are desirable because recycling gives essentially constant reservoirs of materials in the recycling loop. Living organisms have elaborate systems of control. Considering the metabolism that occurs in an entire natural ecosystem, it is seen to be self-regulating. If herbivores that consume plant biomass become too abundant and diminish the stock of the biomass, their numbers cannot be sustained, the population dies back, and their food source rebounds. The most successful ecosystems are those in which this self-regulating mechanism operates continuously without wide variations in populations. Industrial systems do not inherently operate in a self-regulating manner that is advantageous to their surroundings, or even to themselves in the long run. Examples of the failure of self-regulation of industrial systems abound in which enterprises have wastefully produced large quantities of goods of marginal value, running through limited resources in a short time, and dissipating materials to their surroundings, polluting the environment in the process. Despite these bad experiences, within a proper framework of laws and regulations designed to avoid wastes and excess, industrial ecosystems can be designed to operate in a self-regulating manner. Such self-regulation operates best under conditions of maximum recycling in which the system is not dependent on a depleting resource of raw materials or energy. 17.14 MATERIALS FLOW AND RECYCLING IN AN INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM In an industrial ecosystem, there are several points at which materials may be recycled and there are several points at which wastes are produced. The potential for the greatest production of waste lies in the earlier stages of the cycle in which large quantities of materials with essentially no use associated with the raw material, such as ore tailings, may require disposal. In many cases, little if anything of value can be obtained from such wastes and the best thing to do with them is to return them to their source (usually a mine), if possible. Another big source of potential wastes, and often the one that causes the most problems, consists of postconsumer wastes generated when a product\u2019s life cycle is finished. With a properly designed industrial ecology cycle, such wastes can be minimized and, ideally, totally eliminated.", "In general, the amount of waste per unit output decreases in going through the industrial ecology cycle from virgin raw material to final consumer product. Also, the amount of energy expended in dealing with waste or in recycling decreases farther into the cycle. For example, waste iron from the milling and forming of automobile parts may be recycled from a manufacturer to the primary producer of iron as scrap steel. In order to be used, such steel must be remelted and run through the steel manufacturing process again, with a considerable consumption of energy. However, a postconsumer item, such as an engine block, may be refurbished and recycled to the market with relatively less expenditure of energy. 17.15 THE KALUNDBORG INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM The most often cited example of a functional industrial ecosystem is that of Kalundborg, Denmark. The various components of the Kalundborg industrial ecosystem are shown in Figure 17.9. To a degree, the Kalundborg system developed spontaneously, without being specifically planned as an industrial ecosystem. It is based on two major energy suppliers, the 1500-MW ASNAES coal-fi red electrical power plant and the 4\u20135 million ton/yr Statoil petroleum refining complex, each the largest of its kind in Denmark. The electric power plant sells process steam to the oil refi nery, from which it receives fuel gas and cooling water. Sulfur removed from the petroleum goes to the Kemira sulfuric acid plant. By-product heat from the two energy generators is used for district heating of homes and commercial establishments, as well as to heat greenhouses and a fish farming operation. Steam from the electrical power plant is used by the $2 billion/yr Novo Nordisk pharmaceutical plant, a fi rm that produces industrial enzymes and 40% of the world\u2019s supply of insulin. This plant generates a biological sludge that is used by area farms for fertilizer, applied both as a liquid sludge and in a dried form. Calcium sulfate produced as a by-product of sulfur removal by lime scrubbing from the electrical plant is used by the Gyproc company to make wallboard. The wallboard manufacturer also uses clean-burning gas from the petroleum refinery as fuel. Fly ash generated from coal combustion goes into cement and roadbed fill. Lake Tisso serves as a freshwater source. Other examples of efficient materials utilization associated with Kalundborg include use of sludge from the plant that treats water and wastes from the fish farm\u2019s processing plant for fertilizer, and blending of excess yeast from Novo Nordisk\u2019s insulin production as a supplement to swine feed. The development of the Kalundborg complex occurred over a long period of time, beginning in the 1960s, and provides some guidelines for the way in which an industrial ecosystem can evolve naturally. The first of many synergistic (mutually advantageous) arrangements was cogeneration of usable steam along with electricity by the ASNAES electrical power plant. The steam was fi rst sold to the Statoil petroleum refinery, then, as the advantages of large-scale, centralized production of steam became apparent, steam was also provided to homes, greenhouses, the pharmaceutical plant, and the fish farm. The need to produce electricity more cleanly than was possible simply by burning high-sulfur coal resulted in two more synergies. Operation of a lime-scrubbing unit for sulfur removal on the power plant stack produced large quantities of calcium sulfate, which found a market in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard. It was also found that a clean-burning gas by-product of the petroleum refining operation could be substituted in part for the coal burned in the power plant, further reducing pollution. The implementation of the Kalundborg ecosystem occurred largely because of the close personal contact among the managers of the various facilities in a relatively close social and professional network over a long period of time. All the contracts have been based on sound business fundamentals and have been bilateral. Each company has acted upon its perceived self-interest, and there has been no master plan for the system as a whole. The regulatory agencies have been cooperative, but not coercive in promoting the system. The industries involved in the agreements have fi t well, with the needs of one matching the capabilities of the other in each of the bilateral agreements. The physical distances involved have been small and manageable; it is not economically feasible to ship commodities such as steam or fertilizer sludges for long distances. 17.16 CONSIDERATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY By its nature, industrial production has an impact upon the environment.", "Whenever raw materials are extracted, processed, used, and eventually discarded, some environmental impacts will occur. In designing an industrial ecological system, several major kinds of environmental impacts must be considered in order to minimize them and keep them within acceptable limits. These impacts and the measures taken to alleviate them are discussed below. For most industrial processes, the first environmental impact is that of extracting raw materials. This can be a straightforward case of mineral extraction, or it can be less direct, such as utilization of biomass grown on forest or cropland. A basic decision, therefore, is the choice of the kind of material to be used. Wherever possible, materials should be chosen that are not likely to be in short supply in the foreseeable future. As an example, the silica used to make the lines employed for fi beroptics communication is in unlimited supply and a much better choice for communication conduits than copper wire made from limited resources of copper ore. Industrial ecology systems should be designed to reduce or even totally eliminate air pollutant emissions. Among the most notable recent progress in that area has been the marked reduction and even total elimination of solvent vapor emissions (volatile organic carbon, VOC), particularly those from organochlorine solvents. Some progress in this area has been made with more effective trapping of solvent vapors. In other cases, the use of the solvents has been totally eliminated. This is the case for CFCs, which are no longer used in plastic foam blowing and parts cleaning because of their potential to affect stratospheric ozone. Other air pollutant emissions that should be eliminated are hydrocarbon vapors, including those of methane, CH4, and oxides of nitrogen or sulfur. Discharges of water pollutants should be entirely eliminated wherever possible. For many decades, efficient and effective water treatment systems have been employed that minimize water pollution. However, these are \u201cend-of-pipe\u201d measures, and it is much more desirable to design industrial systems such that potential water pollutants are not even generated. Industrial ecology systems should be designed to prevent production of liquid wastes that may have to be sent to a waste processor. Such wastes fall into the two broad categories of water-based wastes and those contained in organic liquids. Under current conditions the largest single constituent of so-called \u201chazardous wastes\u201d is water. Elimination of water from the waste stream automatically prevents pollution and reduces amounts of wastes requiring disposal. The solvents in organic wastes largely represent potentially recyclable or combustible constituents. A properly designed industrial ecosystem does not allow such wastes to be generated or to leave the factory site. In addition to liquid wastes, many solid wastes must be considered in an industrial ecosystem. The most troublesome are toxic solids that must be placed in a secure hazardous waste landfi ll. The problem has become especially acute in some industrialized nations in which the availability of landfill space is severely limited. In a general sense, solid wastes are simply resources that have not been properly utilized. Closer cooperation among suppliers, manufacturers, consumers, regulators, and recyclers can minimize quantities and hazards of solid wastes. Whenever energy is expended, there is a degree of environmental damage. Therefore, energy efficiency must have a high priority in a properly designed industrial ecosystem. Signifi cant progress has been made in this area in recent decades, as much because of the high costs of energy as for environmental improvement. More efficient devices, such as high-efficiency electric motors, and approaches, such as cogeneration of electricity and heat, that make the best possible use of energy resources are highly favored. An important side benefit of more efficient energy utilization is the lowered emissions of air pollutants, including greenhouse gases. 17.17 LIFE CYCLES: EXPANDING AND CLOSING THE MATERIALS LOOP In a general sense, the traditional view of product utilization is the one-way process of extraction \u00c6 production \u00c6 consumption \u00c6 disposal shown in the upper portion of Figure 17.10. Materials that are extracted and refined are incorporated into the production of useful items, usually by processes that produce large quantities of waste by-products. After the products are worn out, they are discarded. This essentially one-way path results in a relatively large exploitation of resources, such as metal ores, and a constant accumulation of wastes. As shown at the bottom of Figure 17.10, however, the one-way path outlined above can become a cycle in which manufactured goods are used, and then recycled at the end of their life spans.", "As one aspect of such a cyclic system, it is often useful for manufacturers to assume responsibility for their products, to maintain \u201cstewardship.\u201d Ideally, in such a system a product and/or the material in it would have a never-ending life cycle; when its useful lifetime is exhausted, it is either refurbished or converted into another product. From the discussion above and in the rest of this chapter, it may be concluded that industrial ecology is all about cyclization of materials. This approach is summarized in a statement attributed to Kumar Patel of the University of California at Los Angles, \u201cThe goal is cradle to reincarnation, since if one is practicing industrial ecology correctly there is no grave.\u201d For the practice of industrial ecology to be as efficient as possible, cyclization of materials should occur at the highest possible level of material purity and stage of product development as discussed under embedded utility below. In considering life cycles, it is important to note that commerce can be divided into the two broad categories of products and services. Although most commercial activity used to be concentrated on providing large quantities of goods and products, demand has been largely satisfied for some segments of the population, and the wealthier economies are moving more to a service-based system. Much of the commerce required for a modern society consists of a mixture of services and goods. The trend toward a service economy offers two major advantages with respect to waste minimization. Obviously, a pure service involves little material. Secondly, a service provider is in a much better position to control materials to ensure that they are recycled and to control wastes, ensuring their proper disposal. A commonly cited example is that of photocopy machines. They provide a service, and a heavily used copy machine requires frequent maintenance and cleaning. The parts of such a machine and the consumables, such as toner cartridges, consist of materials that eventually will have to be discarded or recycled. In this case it is often reasonable for the provider to lease the machine to users, taking responsibility for its maintenance and ultimate fate. The idea could even be expanded to include recycling of the paper processed by the copier, with the provider taking responsibility for recyclable paper printed by the machine. In many cases, to be practical, recycling must be practiced on a larger scale than simply that of a single industry or product. For example, recycling plastics used in soft drink bottles to make new soft drink bottles is not allowed because of the possibilities for contamination. However, the plastics can be used as raw material for auto parts. Usually, different companies are involved in making auto parts and soft drink bottles. 17.17.1 PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP The degree to which products are recycled is strongly affected by the custody of the products. For example, batteries containing cadmium or mercury pose significant pollution problems when they are purchased by the public; used in a variety of devices, such as calculators and cameras; then discarded through a number of channels, including municipal refuse. However, when such batteries are used within a single organization, it is possible to ensure that almost all of them are returned for recycling. In cases such as this, systems of stewardship can be devised in which marketers and manufacturers exercise a high degree of control of the product. This can be done through several means. One is for the manufacturer to retain ownership of the product, as is commonly practiced with photocopy machines. Another mechanism is one in which a significant part of the purchase price is refunded for trade-in of a spent item. This approach could work very well with batteries containing cadmium or mercury. The normal purchase price could be doubled, then discounted to half with the trade-in of a spent battery. 17.17.2 EMBEDDED UTILITY Figure 17.11 can be regarded as an \u201cenergy/materials pyramid\u201d showing that the amounts of energy and materials involved decrease going from the raw material to the finished product. The implication of this diagram is that significantly less energy, and certainly no more materials, are involved when recycling is performed near the top of the materials flow chain rather than near the bottom. In low-level recycling, a material or component is taken back to near the beginning of the steps through which it is made. For example, an automobile engine block might be melted down to produce molten metal from which new blocks are then cast.", "With high-level recycling, the item or material is recycled as close to the final product as possible. In the case of the automobile engine block, it may be cleaned, the cylinder walls rehoned, the flat surfaces replaned, and the block used as the platform for assembling a rebuilt engine. In this example and many others that can be cited, high-level recycling uses much less energy and materials and is inherently more effi cient. The greater usability and lower energy requirements for recycling products higher in the order of material flow are called embedded utility. One of the major objectives of a system of industrial Quantity of materials and energy involved ecology and, therefore, one of the main reasons for performing life-cycle assessments is to retain the embedded utility in products by measures such as recycling as near to the end of the material flow as possible, and replacing only those components of systems that are worn out or obsolete. An example of the latter occurred during the 1960s when efficient and highly reliable turboprop engines were retrofitted to still serviceable commercial aircraft airframes to replace relatively complex piston engines, thus extending the lifetime of the aircraft by a decade or more. 17.18 LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT From the beginning, industrial ecology must consider process/product design in the management of materials, including the ultimate fates of materials when they are discarded. The product and materials in it should be subjected to an entire life-cycle assessment or analysis. A life-cycle assessment applies to products, processes, and services through their entire life cycles from extraction of raw materials\u2014through manufacturing, distribution, and use\u2014to their final fates from the viewpoint of determining, quantifying, and ultimately minimizing their environmental impacts. It takes account of manufacturing, distribution, use, recycling, and disposal. Life-cycle assessment is particularly beneficial in determining the relative environmental merits of alternative products and services. At the consumer level, this could consist of an evaluation of paper versus styrofoam drinking cups. On an industrial scale, life-cycle assessment could involve evaluation of nuclear versus fossil-energybased electrical power plants. A basic step in life-cycle analysis is inventory analysis, which provides qualitative and quantitative information regarding consumption of material and energy resources (at the beginning of the cycle) and releases to the anthrosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and atmosphere (during or at the end of the cycle). It is based on various materials cycles and budgets, and it quantifies materials and energy required as input and the benefits and liabilities posed by products. The related area of impact analysis provides information about the kind and degree of environmental impacts resulting from a complete life cycle of a product or activity. Once the environmental and resource impacts have been evaluated, it is possible to do an improvement analysis to determine measures that can be taken to reduce impacts on the environment or resources. In making a life-cycle analysis the following must be considered: \u2022 If there is a choice, selection of the kinds of materials that will minimize waste \u2022 Kinds of materials that can be reused or recycled \u2022 Components that can be recycled \u2022 Alternate pathways for the manufacturing process or for various parts of it Although a complete life-cycle analysis is expensive and time consuming, it can yield signifi cant returns in lowering environmental impacts, conserving resources, and reducing costs. This is especially true if the analysis is performed at an early stage in the development of a product or service. Improved computerized techniques are making significant advances in the ease and efficacy of life-cycle analyses. Until now, life-cycle assessments have been largely confined to simple materials and products such as reusable cloth versus disposable paper diapers. A major challenge now is to expand these efforts to more complex products and systems such as aircraft or electronics products. 17.18.1 SCOPING IN LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT A crucial early step in life-cycle assessment is scoping the process by determining the boundaries of time, space, materials, processes, and products to be considered. Consider as an example the manufacture of parts that are rinsed with an organochloride solvent in which some solvent is lost by evaporation to the atmosphere, by staying on the parts, during the distillation and purifi cation process by which the solvent is made suitable for recycling, and by disposal of waste solvent that cannot be repurified. The scope of the life-cycle assessment could be made very narrow by confining it to the process as it exists.", "An assessment could be made of the solvent losses, the impacts of these losses, and means for reducing the losses, such as reducing solvent emissions to the atmosphere by installation of activated carbon air filters or reducing losses during purification by employing more efficient distillation processes. A more broadly scoped life-cycle assessment would be to consider alternatives to the organochloride solvent. An even broader scope would consider whether the parts even need to be manufactured; Are there alternatives to their use? 17.19 CONSUMABLE, RECYCLABLE, AND SERVICE (DURABLE) PRODUCTS In industrial ecology, most treatments of life-cycle analysis make the distinction between consumable products, which are essentially used up and dispersed to the environment during their life cycle and service or durable products, which essentially remain in their original form after use. Gasoline is clearly a consumable product, whereas the automobile in which it is burned is a service product. It is useful, however, to define a third category of products that clearly become \u201cworn out\u201d when employed for their intended purpose, but which remain largely undispersed to the environment. The motor oil used in an automobile is such a substance in that most of the original material remains after use. Such a category of material may be called a recyclable commodity. 17.19.1 DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF CONSUMABLES Consumable products include laundry detergents, hand soaps, cosmetics, windshield washer fl uids, fertilizers, pesticides, laser printer toners, and all other materials that are impossible to reclaim after they are used. The environmental implications of the use of consumables are many and profound. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, for example, nondegradable surfactants in detergents caused severe foaming and esthetic problems at water treatment plants and sewage outflows, and the phosphate builders in the detergents promoted excessive algal growth in receiving waters resulting in eutrophication (see Chapter 7). Lead in consumable leaded gasoline was widely dispersed to the environment when the gasoline was burned. These problems have now been remedied with the adoption of phosphate-free detergents with biodegradable surfactants and mandatory use of unleaded gasoline. Since they are destined to be dispersed into the environment, consumables should meet several \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d criteria, including the following: \u2022 Degradability: This usually means biodegradability, such as that of household detergent constituents that occurs in waste treatment plants and in the environment. Chemical degradation may also occur. \u2022 Nonbioaccumulative: Lipid-soluble, poorly biodegradable substances, such as DDT and PCBs, tend to accumulate in organisms and to be magnified through the food chain. This characteristic should be avoided in consumable substances. \u2022 Nontoxic: To the extent possible, consumables should not be toxic in the concentrations that organisms are likely to be exposed to them. In addition to their not being acutely toxic, consumables should not be mutagenic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic (cause birth defects). 17.19.2 DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF RECYCLABLES Recyclables is used here to describe materials that are not used up in the sense that laundry detergents or photocopier toners are consumed, but are not durable items. In this context, recyclables can be understood to be chemical substances and formulations. The HCFCs used as refrigerant fl uids fall into this category, as does ethylene glycol mixed with water in automobile engine antifreeze/ antiboil formulations (although rarely recycled in practice). Insofar as possible, recyclables should be minimally hazardous with respect to toxicity, fl ammability, and other hazards. For example, both volatile hydrocarbon solvents and organochloride (chlorinated hydrocarbon) solvents are recyclable after use for parts degreasing and other applications requiring a good solvent for organic materials. The hydrocarbon solvents have relatively low toxicities, but may present flammability hazards during use and reclamation for recycling. The organochloride solvents are less fl ammable, but may pose a greater toxicity hazard. An example of such a solvent is carbon tetrachloride, which is so nonflammable that it was once used in fire extinguishers, but the current applications of which are highly constrained because of its high toxicity. An obviously important characteristic of recyclables is that they should be designed and formulated to be amenable to recycling. In some cases there is little leeway in formulating potentially recyclable materials; motor oil, for example, must meet certain performance criteria, including the ability to lubricate, stand up to high temperatures, and other attributes, regardless of its ultimate fate. In other cases formulations can be modified to enhance recyclability. For example, the use of bleachable or removable ink in newspapers enhances the recyclability of the newsprint, enabling it to be restored to an acceptable level of brightness.", "For some commodities, the potential for recycling is enormous. This can be exemplified by lubricating oils. The volume of motor oil sold in the United States each year for internal combustion engines is about 2.5 billion liters, a figure that is doubled if all lubricating oils are considered. A particularly important aspect of utilizing recyclables is their collection. In the case of motor oil, collection rates are low from consumers who change their own oil, and they are responsible for the dispersion of large amounts of waste oil to the environment. 17.19.3 DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF SERVICE PRODUCTS Since, in principle at least, service products are destined for recycling, they have comparatively lower constraints on materials and higher constraints on their ultimate disposal. A major impediment to the recycling of service products is the lack of convenient channels through which they can be put into the recycling loop. Television sets and major appliances such as washing machines or ovens have many recyclable components, but often end up in landfills and waste dumps simply because there is no handy means for getting them from the user and into the recycling loop. In such cases, government intervention may be necessary to provide appropriate channels. One partial remedy to the disposal/ recycling problem consists of leasing arrangements or payment of deposits on items such as batteries to ensure their return to a recycler. The terms \u201cde-shopping\u201d or \u201creverse shopping\u201d describe a process by which service commodities would be returned to a location such as a parking lot where they could be collected for recycling. According to this scenario, the analogy to a supermarket would be a facility in which service products are collected and disassembled for recycling. Much can be done in the design of service products to facilitate their recycle. One of the main characteristics of recyclable service products must be ease of disassembly so that remanufacturable components and recyclable materials, such as copper wire, can be readily removed and separated for recycling. 17.20 DESIGN FOR ENVIRONMENT Design for environment is the term given to the approach of designing and engineering products, processes, and facilities in a manner that minimizes their adverse environmental impacts and, where possible, maximizes their beneficial environmental effects. In modern industrial operations, design for environment is part of a larger scheme termed \u201cdesign for X,\u201d where \u201cX\u201d can be any one of a number of characteristics such as assembly, manufacturability, reliability, and serviceability. In making such a design, numerous desired characteristics of the product must be considered, including ultimate use, properties, costs, and appearance. Design for environment requires that the designs of the product, the process by which it is made, and the facilities involved in making it conform to appropriate environmental goals and limitations imposed by the need to maintain environmental quality. It must also consider the ultimate fate of the product, particularly whether or not it can be recycled at the end of its normal life span. 17.20.1 PRODUCTS, PROCESSES, AND FACILITIES In discussing design for environment, the distinctions among products, processes, and facilities must be kept in clear perspective. Products\u2014automobile tires, laundry detergents, and refrigerators\u2014are items sold to consumers. Processes are the means of producing products and services. For example, tires are made by a process in which hydrocarbon monomers are polymerized to produce rubber that is molded in the shape of a tire with a carcass reinforced by synthetic fibers and steel wires. A facility is where processes are carried out to produce or deliver products or services. In cases where services are regarded as products, the distinction between products and processes becomes blurred. For example, a lawn care service delivers products in the forms of fertilizers, pesticides, and grass seeds, but also delivers pure services including mowing, edging, and sod aeration. Although products tend to get the most public attention in consideration of environmental matters, processes often have more environmental impact. Successful process designs tend to stay in service for many years and to be used to make a wide range of products. While the product of a process may have minimal environmental impact, the process by which the product is made may have marked environmental effects. An example is the manufacture of paper. The environmental impact of paper as a product, even when improperly discarded, is not terribly great, whereas the process by which it is made involves harvesting wood from forests, high use of water, potential emission of a wide range of air pollutants, and other factors with profound environmental implications.", "Processes develop symbiotic relationships when one provides a product or service utilized in another. An example of such a relationship is that between steel making and the process for the production of oxygen required in the basic oxygen process by which carbon and silicon impurities are oxidized from molten iron to produce steel. The long lifetimes and widespread applicability of popular processes make their design for environment of utmost importance. The nature of a properly functioning system of industrial ecology is such that processes are even more interwoven than would otherwise be the case, because by-products from some processes are used by other processes. Therefore, the processes employed in such a system and the interrelationships and interdependencies among them are particularly important. A major change in one process may have a \u201cdomino effect\u201d on the others. 17.20.2 KEY FACTORS IN DESIGN FOR ENVIRONMENT Two key choices that must be made in design for environment are those involving materials and energy. The choices of materials in an automobile illustrate some of the possible trade-offs. Steel as a component of automobile bodies requires relatively large amounts of energy and involves signifi cant environmental disruption in the mining and processing of iron ore. Steel is a relatively heavy material, so more energy is involved in moving automobiles made of steel. However, steel is durable, has a high rate of recycling, and is produced initially from abundant sources of iron ore. Aluminum is much lighter than steel and quite durable. It is one of the most commonly recycled commodities. Good primary sources of aluminum, bauxite ores, are not as abundant as iron ores, and large amounts of energy are required in the primary production of aluminum. Plastics are another source of automotive components. The light weight of plastic reduces automotive fuel consumption, plastics with desired properties are readily made, and molding and shaping plastic parts is a straightforward process. However, plastic automobile components have a low rate of recycling. Three related characteristics of a product that should be considered in design for environment are durability, repairability, and recyclability. Durability simply refers to how well the product lasts and resists breakdown in normal use. Some products are notable for their durability; ancient two-cylinder John Deere farm tractors from the 1930s and 1940s are legendary in farming circles for their durability, enhanced by the affection engendered in their owners who tend to preserve them. Repairability is a measure of how easy and inexpensive it is to repair a product. A product that can be repaired is less likely to be discarded when it ceases to function for some reason. Recyclability refers to the degree and ease with which a product or components of it may be recycled. An important aspect of recyclability is the ease with which a product can be disassembled into constituents consisting of a single material that can be recycled. It also considers whether the components are made of materials that can be recycled. 17.20.3 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IN DESIGN FOR ENVIRONMENT A key consideration in the practice of design for environment is the reduction of the dispersal of hazardous materials and pollutants. This can entail the reduction or elimination of hazardous materials in manufacture, an example of which was the replacement of stratospheric ozone-depleting CFCs in foam blowing of plastics. If appropriate substitutes can be found, somewhat toxic and persistent chlorinated solvents should not be used in manufacturing applications such as parts washing. The use of hazardous materials in the product\u2014such as batteries containing toxic cadmium, mercury, and lead\u2014should be eliminated or minimized. Pigments containing heavy metal cadmium or lead should not be used if there are any possible substitutes. The substitution of HCFCs and hydrofl uorocarbons for ozone-depleting CFCs in products (refrigerators and air conditioners) is an example of a major reduction in environmentally damaging materials in products. The elimination of extremely persistent PCBs from electrical transformers removed a major hazardous waste problem due to the use of a common product. 17.21 INHERENT SAFETY The use of nitroglycerin in the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad in California during the 1860s provides a lesson in safe handling of materials. On April 3, 1866, 70 crates of California-bound dangerously explosive nitroglycerin blew up aboard the steamship European being unloaded on the Caribbean coast of Panama killing 50 people and causing substantial damage.", "Only 2 weeks later two crates of nitroglycerin, which had been refused delivery because of their condition, exploded in an offi ce of the Wells Fargo Company in San Francisco killing 15 people and causing massive destruction, although instantaneously resolving the question regarding what to do with the damaged goods. Only 2 days later six workers on the Central Pacific Railroad in the Sierra Nevada mountains were killed by an explosion of nitroglycerin that was being used in place of much less effective black gunpowder, for blasting on the railroad construction. As a consequence of these accidents, California legislators quickly passed legislation forbidding the transportation of nitroglycerin through San Francisco and Sacramento. It appeared that the measures taken by the California authorities would prevent the use of the powerfully explosive nitroglycerin in the construction of the Central Pacific causing a huge delay of the project. However, James Howden, a British chemist, won contracts to make nitroglycerin on site for the massive Central Pacific construction project and he produced up to 100 lbs per day of the explosive as needed with no further injuries resulting from accidental nitroglycerin explosions. This was an early example of safe handling of material. The glycerin and sulfuric and nitric acids needed to make nitroglycerin could be transported to the site in relative safety and with no explosion hazard. The truly hazardous nitroglycerin was made only as needed so that at no time was there a large amount available in one place to cause an explosion. Finally, the nitroglycerin was only transported short distances greatly minimizing the possibility of transportation accidents with this notoriously sensitive explosive. A chemical process is said to be inherently safe when permanent measures have been integrated into the process to reduce or eliminate specific hazards. Five approaches by which this may be done are the following. 1. Use only minimum quantities of hazardous substances. In the example of nitroglycerin discussed above relatively small quantities of the explosive were made at any one time. 2. Use a less hazardous substance. In 1867 Alfred Nobel invented dynamite, which consisted of nitroglycerin absorbed onto a carrier such as sawdust and which was much safer to handle than pure nitroglycerin but almost as effective as an explosive. 3. Use safer conditions. In a chemical process, this might consist of carrying out reactions at lower temperatures and pressures over a catalyst so that if a malfunction occurs, the results are much less catastrophic. 4. Simplify. As a general rule, simpler processes are safer processes. Added steps add possibilities for things to go wrong. 5. Maximize continuous steady-state operation with continuous processes that avoid problems likely to occur during startup and shutdown. 17.21.1 INCREASED SAFETY WITH SMALLER SIZE Safety can be increased by using \u201cgreen reactors,\u201d11 often by the simple expedient of down-sizing operations and quantities of materials, a strategy of minimization. A common example of minimization is the substitution of small continuous flow reactors for large batch processes (Figure 17.12). In scaling up from batch laboratory processes to commercial production, large batch reactors often have been employed. Such a reactor containing large amounts of material can be very problematic if something goes wrong, such as an uncontrolled runaway reaction. Such reactors often have been used because of slow mixing and heating that required reactants to be in contact for long periods of time, whereas the actual reaction is often very quick once the reactants are in contact. It is often desirable to substitute a very small loop reactor with efficient mixing and rapid energy transfer so that the quantities of reactants in the reaction process are very much reduced (Figure 17.12). In such a case, only much smaller quantities are involved and if anything goes wrong the amounts of material that must be dealt with are much smaller.

Ecological engineering has many commonalities with industrial ecology. Ecological engineering combines systems ecology with engineering. It develops ecotechnologies through designing, constructing, and managing systems of natural ecology integrated with the anthrosphere. The greatest success to date from the application of ecological engineering is the construction and operation of wetlands to treat wastewater. Constructed wetlands do not necessarily duplicate the living species and other aspects of natural wetlands and may even be located in areas where wetlands have not previously existed.", "They do provide the essential ingredients\u2014water, sunlight, nutrients, and confined conditions\u2014that enable wetland-based ecosystems to develop and thrive. Other endeavors involving ecological engineering include restoration ecology of areas damaged by development, phytoremediation using living plants to remove pollutants from polluted areas, stream restoration, and soil bioengineering that uses ecosystems and the plants in them to reduce soil erosion and to increase agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner. The most ambitious project based on ecological engineering to date in the United States is the restoration of the Florida Everglades. This huge area is a vast wetland that has been drained and damaged by channelization projects carried out by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Now a massive effort is underway to reverse the damage. The Everglades will never be what they were before human intervention, but the successful completion of the project will see the re-establishment of a functional wetlands system to the benefit of alligators, other wildlife, and eventually humans.

One of the greatest challenges facing humankind is posed by the demand for materials that humans need (or at least want) to meet their desires for higher material standards of living. The economic effects of this demand were illustrated painfully during the approximately 2005\u20132008 time period when demand for materials such as crude oil, aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, phosphate minerals (for fertilizer), and other commodities sent prices of these and many other materials soaring.", "This demand was fueled by a number of factors operating throughout the world including the evolving economies of highly populated China and India and buying binges of consumers in the United States made over-confident by rapidly increasing housing values, increasing prices of stock, and easy credit on credit cards. In early 2008, it began to look like the price of crude oil would soar far above $150 per barrel, gasoline would surpass $5.00 per gallon in the Unites States (still inexpensive by European standards), and grain for food and animal feed would continue to increase beyond record levels. The prices of metals had risen such that thieves were raiding unoccupied houses to steal aluminum and copper as some other thieves were even cutting catalytic converters from vehicles to get to their precious metal contents. Around mid-2008, a wrenching adjustment occurred as it became obvious that such price increases were unsustainable, prices of commodities such as crude oil dropped drastically, and home prices in the United States fell dramatically as countries throughout much of the world experienced the worst economic downturn (a very big recession or a mini-depression) since the Great Depression of the 1930s. These events clearly illustrate the importance of materials for modern societies. The acquisition, utilization, and disposal of materials have enormous environmental consequences. Earth simply cannot support the current trajectory of material use. This is especially so as countries with large and growing populations aspire to the standard of living enjoyed by modern industrialized countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. Calculations of how many \u201cEarths\u201d would be required to satisfy material demands if all the world\u2019s people enjoyed a U.S. standard of living have shown that perhaps as many as 10 planets such as ours would be needed. It is obvious that materials are of the utmost importance in sustainability. This chapter is devoted to materials and the resources from which they are acquired. Energy is a resource of particular importance, so Chapter 19, \u201cSustainable Energy: The Key to Everything,\u201d is devoted to the topic of energy. The materials needed for modern societies can be provided from either extractive (nonrenewable) or renewable sources. Extractive industries remove irreplaceable mineral resources from the earth\u2019s crust. The utilization of mineral resources is strongly tied with technology, energy, and the environment. Perturbations in one usually cause perturbations in the others. For example, reductions in automotive exhaust pollutant levels to curtail air pollution have required use of catalytic devices that contain platinum-group metals, a valuable and irreplaceable natural resource. Implementation of the best practices of industrial ecology and green chemistry will be required to improve environmental quality with reduced consumption of nonrenewable material resources. In discussing nonrenewable sources of minerals as well as energy, it is useful to define two terms related to available quantities. The first of these is resources, defined as quantities that are estimated to be ultimately available. The second term is reserves, which refers to well-identified resources that can be profitably utilized with existing technology. 18.2 MINERALS IN THE GEOSPHERE There are numerous kinds of mineral deposits that are used in various ways. These are, for the most part, sources of metals which occur in batholiths composed of masses of igneous rock that have been extruded in a solid or molten state into the surrounding rock strata. In addition to deposits formed directly from solidifying magma, associated deposits are produced by water interacting with magma. Hot aqueous solutions associated with magma can form rich hydrothermal deposits of minerals. Several important metals, including lead, zinc, and copper, are often associated with hydrothermal deposits. Some useful mineral deposits are formed as sedimentary deposits along with the formation of sedimentary rocks. Evaporites are produced when seawater is evaporated. Common mineral evaporites are halite (NaCl), sodium carbonates, potassium chloride, gypsum (CaSO4 . 2H2O), and magnesium salts. Many significant iron deposits consisting of hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) were formed as sedimentary bands when earth\u2019s atmosphere was changed from reducing to oxidizing as photosynthetic organisms produced oxygen, precipitating the oxides from the oxidation of soluble Fe2+ ion. Deposition of suspended rock solids by flowing water can cause segregation of the rocks according to differences in size and density. This can result in the formation of useful placer deposits that are enriched in desired minerals. Gravel, sand, and some other minerals, such as gold, often occur in placer deposits. Some mineral deposits are formed by the enrichment of desired constituents when other fractions are weathered or leached away.", "The most common example of such a deposit is bauxite, Al2O3, remaining after silicates and other more soluble constituents have been dissolved from aluminum-rich minerals by the weathering action of water under the severe conditions of hot tropical climates with very high levels of rainfall. This kind of material is called a laterite. 18.2.1 EVALUATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES World mineral resources are obviously critical to the well-being of modern civilization. In order to make its extraction worthwhile, a mineral must be enriched at a particular location in the earth\u2019s crust relative to the average crustal abundance. Normally applied to metals, such an enriched deposit is called an ore. The value of an ore is expressed in terms of a concentration factor: Concentration of material in ore Concentration factor = (18.1) Average crustal concentration Obviously, higher concentration factors are always desirable. Required concentration factors decrease with average crustal concentrations and with the value of the commodity extracted. A concentration factor of 4 might be adequate for iron, which makes up a relatively high percentage of the earth\u2019s crust. Concentration factors must be several hundred or even several thousand for less expensive metals that are not present at very high percentages in the earth\u2019s crust. However, for an extremely valuable metal, such as platinum, a relatively low concentration factor is acceptable because of the high financial return obtained from extracting the metal. Acceptable concentration factors are a sensitive function of the price of a metal. Shifts in price can cause significant CCS (copper/chrome/arsenic). If the price of a metal increases by, for example, 50%, and the increase appears to be long term, it becomes profi table to mine deposits that had not been mined previously. The opposite can happen, as is often the case when richer sources are discovered or substitute materials are found. In addition to large variations in the concentration factors of various ores, there are extremes in the geographic distribution of mineral resources. The United States is perhaps about average for all nations in terms of its mineral resources, possessing significant resources of copper, lead, iron, gold, and molybdenum, but virtually without resources of some important strategic metals, including chromium, tin, and platinum-group metals. For its size and population, South Africa is particularly blessed with some important metal mineral resources. 18.3 EXTRACTION AND MINING Minerals are usually extracted from the earth\u2019s crust by various kinds of mining procedures, but other techniques may be employed as well. The raw materials so obtained include inorganic compounds such as phosphate rock, sources of metal such as lead sulfide ore, clay used for fi rebrick, and structural materials, such as sand and gravel. Surface mining, which can consist of digging large holes in the ground, or strip mining, is used to extract minerals that occur near the surface. A common example of surface mining is quarrying of rock. Vast areas have been dug up to extract coal. Because of past mining practices, surface mining got a well-deserved bad name. With modern reclamation practices, however, topsoil is fi rst removed and stored. After the mining is complete, the topsoil is spread on top of overburden that has been replaced such that the soil surface has gentle slopes and proper drainage. Topsoil spread over the top of the replaced spoil, often carefully terraced to prevent erosion, is seeded with indigenous grass and other plants, fertilized, and watered, if necessary, to provide vegetation. The end result of carefully done mine reclamation projects is a well-vegetated area suitable for wildlife habitat, recreation, forestry, grazing, and other beneficial purposes. Such a project can be regarded as an application of ecological engineering (see Section 17.22). Water pollution is often a problem associated with mining. One of the most common problems is the formation of acid mine water (H2SO4) from microbial action on pyrite (FeS2) exposed to the atmosphere in mining a number of kinds of mineral ores (see Section 6.14). Processes have been developed for the treatment of this acid rock drainage, such as those using sulfate-reducing bacteria in bioreactors.1 Extraction of minerals from placer deposits formed by deposition from water has obvious environmental implications. Mining of placer deposits can be accomplished by dredging from a boom-equipped barge. Another means that can be used is hydraulic mining with large streams of water. One interesting approach for more coherent deposits is to cut the ore with intense water jets, then suck up the resulting small particles with a pumping system.", "These techniques have a high potential to pollute water and disrupt waterways and are environmentally controversial. For many minerals, underground mining is the only practical means of extraction. An underground mine can be very complex and sophisticated. The structure of the mine depends on the nature of the deposit. It is of course necessary to have a shaft that reaches to the ore deposit. Horizontal tunnels extend out into the deposit, and provision must be made for sumps to remove water and for ventilation. Factors that must be considered in designing an underground mine include the depth, shape, and orientation of the ore body, as well as the nature and strength of the rock in and around it; thickness of overburden; and depth below the surface. Usually, significant amounts of processing are required before a mined product is used or even moved from the mine site. Such processing, and the by-products of it, can have signifi cant environmental effects. Even rock to be used for aggregate and for road construction must be crushed and sized, a process that has the potential to emit air-polluting dust particles into the atmosphere. Crushing is also a necessary first step for further processing of ore. Some minerals occur to an extent of a few percent or even less in the rock taken from the mine and must be concentrated on site so that the residue does not have to be hauled far. These concentration processes along with roasting, extraction, and in some cases chemical leaching of the ore are categorized as extractive metallurgy. Year One of the more environmentally troublesome by-products of mineral refining consists of waste tailings. By the nature of the mineral processing operations employed, tailings are usually fi nely divided and, as a result, subject to chemical and biochemical weathering processes. Heavy metals associated with metal ores can be leached from tailings, producing water runoff contaminated with cadmium, lead, and other pollutants. Adding to the problem are some of the processes used to refi ne ore. Large quantities of cyanide solution are used in some processes to extract low levels of gold from ore, posing obvious toxicological hazards. Environmental problems resulting from exploitation of extractive resources\u2014including disturbance of land, air pollution from dust and smelter emissions, and water pollution from disrupted aquifers\u2014are aggravated by the fact that the general trend in mining involves utilization of less rich ore. This is illustrated in Figure 18.1, showing the average percentage of copper in copper ore mined since 1900. The average percentage of copper in ore mined in 1900 was about 4%, but by 1982 it was about 0.6% in domestic ore, and 1.4% in richer foreign ore. Ore as low as 0.1% copper may eventually be processed. Increased demand for a particular metal, coupled with the necessity to utilize lower-grade ore, has a vicious multiplying effect on the amount of ore that must be mined and processed and accompanying environmental consequences.2 The proper practice of industrial ecology can be used to significantly reduce the effects of mining and mining by-products. One way in which this can be done is to entirely eliminate the need for mining, utilizing alternate sources of materials. An example of such utilization, widely hypothesized but not yet put into practice to a large extent, is the extraction of aluminum from coal ash. This would have the double advantage of minimizing amounts of waste ash and reducing the need to mine scarce aluminum ore. 18.4 METALS The majority of elements are metals, most of which are of crucial importance as resources. The availability and annual usage of metals vary widely with the kind of metal. Some metals are abundant and widely used in structural applications; iron and aluminum are prime examples. Other metals, especially those of the platinum group (platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium) are very precious and their use is confined to applications such as catalysts, filaments, or electrodes for which only small quantities are required. Some metals are considered to be \u201ccrucial\u201d because of their applications for which no substitutes are available and shortages or uneven distribution in supply that occur. Such a metal is chromium, used to manufacture stainless steel (especially for parts exposed to high temperatures and corrosive gases), jet aircraft, automobiles, hospital equipment, and mining equipment. The platinum-group metals are used as catalysts in the chemical industry, in petroleum refining, and in automobile exhaust antipollution devices. Metals exhibit a wide variety of properties and uses.", "They come from a number of different compounds; in some cases two or more compounds are significant mineral sources of the same metal. Usually these compounds are oxides or sulfides. However, other kinds of compounds and, in the cases of gold and platinum-group metals, the elemental (native) metals themselves serve as metal ore.

In the case of relatively abundant metals that are inexpensive to extract from ores and that do not pose major environmental problems in their disposal, the geosphere is the major source (iron is such a metal). For metals in limited supply that should never be discarded because of adverse environmental effects, recycling predominates; lead is the prime example. The current anthrospheric stock of iron in the United States is now estimated at 3200 million metric tons such that a system of perfect recycling could entirely eliminate the need to mine additional iron ore.3 Considerations of industrial ecology are very important in extending and effi ciently utilizing metal resources. More than any other kind of resource, metals lend themselves to recycling and to the practice of industrial ecology. This section briefly addresses the industrial ecology of metals. 18.5.1 ALUMINUM Aluminum metal has a remarkably wide range of uses resulting from its properties of low density, high strength, ready workability, corrosion resistance, and high electrical conductivity. The use and disposal of aluminum present no environmental problems and it is one of the most readily recycled of all metals. The environmental problems associated with aluminum result from the mining and processing of bauxite aluminum ore, which contains 40\u201360% alumina, Al2O3, associated with water molecules, the result of weathering away of more soluble minerals, particularly in high-rainfall regions of the tropics (see laterites in Section 18.2). Strip mining of bauxite from thin seams causes signifi cant disturbance to the geosphere. The commonly used Bayer process for aluminum refi ning dissolves alumina, shown below as the hydroxide Al(OH)3, from bauxite at high temperatures with sodium hydroxide as sodium aluminate: Al(OH)3 + NaOH \u00c6 NaAlO2 + 2H2O (18.2) leaving behind large quantities of caustic \u201cred mud.\u201d This residue, which is rich in oxides of iron, silicon, and titanium, has virtually no uses and a high potential to produce pollution. Aluminum hydroxide is then precipitated in the pure form at lower temperatures and calcined at about 1200\u221eC to produce pure anhydrous Al2O3. The anhydrous alumina is electrolyzed in molten cyrolite, Na3AlF6, at carbon electrodes to produce aluminum metal. All of these steps are very energy intensive, which makes recycling of aluminum metal particularly desirable. An interesting possibility that could avoid many of the environmental problems associated with aluminum production is the use of coal fly ash as a source of the metal. Produced in large quantities as a by-product of electricity generation, fly ash is essentially free. Its anhydrous nature avoids the expense of removing water; it is a finely divided homogeneous material. Aluminum, along with iron, manganese, and titanium, can be extracted from coal fly ash with acid. If aluminum is extracted as the chloride salt, AlCl3, it can be electrolyzed as the chloride by the ALCOA process. Although this process has not yet been proven to be competitive with the Bayer process, it may become so in the future. Gallium is a metal that commonly occurs with aluminum ore and may be produced as a byproduct of aluminum manufacture. Gallium combined with arsenic or with indium and arsenic is useful in semiconductor applications, including integrated circuits, photoelectric devices, and lasers. Although important, these applications require only miniscule amounts of gallium compared to major metals. 18.5.2 CHROMIUM Chromium is of crucial importance to industrialized societies because of its use in stainless steel and superalloys used in jet engines, nuclear power plants, chemical-resistant valves, and other applications in which a material that resists heat and chemical attack is required. As noted in Table 18.1, supplies of chromium are poorly distributed around the world. To conserve chromium it is important that it be handled according to good practices of industrial ecology. Several measures may be taken in this respect. Chromium is almost impossible to recover from chrome-plated objects, and this use should be eliminated insofar as possible, as has been done with much of the decorative chrome-plated adornments formerly put on automobiles. Chromium(VI) (chromate) is a toxic form of the metal and its uses should be eliminated wherever possible.", "The use of chromium in leather tanning and miscellaneous chemical applications should be curtailed. Chromium was once widely used in the preparation of treated CCS (copper/chrome/arsenic) lumber, which resists fungal decay and termites, but this product is now banned because of its content of toxic arsenic. 18.5.3 COPPER Copper is a low-toxicity, corrosion-resistant metal widely used because of its workability (ductility and malleability), electrical conductivity, and ability to conduct heat. In addition to its use in electrical wire, where in some applications it is now challenged by aluminum, copper is also used in tubing, copper pipe, shims, gaskets, and other applications. There are at least two major environmental problems associated with the extraction and refi ning of copper. The first of these is the dilute form in which copper ore now occurs (see Figure 18.1), such that in the United States 150\u2013175 ton of inert material (not counting overburden removed in strip mining) must be processed and discarded to produce a ton of copper metal. The second problem is the occurrence of copper as the sulfide so that in the production of copper, large amounts of sulfur must be recovered as a by-product or, unfortunately in some less developed countries, released into the atmosphere as pollutant SO2. An advantage to copper for recycling is that it is used primarily as the metal, which represents \u201cstored energy\u201d in that it does not require energy for reduction to the metal. Recycling rates of scrap copper appear low in part because so much of the inventory of copper metal is tied up in long-lasting electrical wire, in structures, and other places where the lifetime of the metal is long. (This is in contrast to lead, where the main source of recycled metal is storage batteries, which last only 2\u20135 years.) An impediment to copper recycling is the difficulty of recovering copper components from circuits, plumbing, and other applications. 18.5.4 COBALT Cobalt is a \u201cstrategic\u201d metal with very important applications in alloys, particularly in heat-resistant applications, such as jet engines. The major source of cobalt is as a by-product of copper refi ning, although it can also be obtained as a by-product of nickel and lead. As much as 50% of the cobalt in these sources is lost to tailings, slag, or other wastes, so there is a significant potential to improve the recovery of cobalt. Relatively low percentages of cobalt are recycled as scrap. 18.5.5 LEAD The industrial ecology of lead is very important because of the widespread use of this metal and its toxicity. Global fluxes of lead from the anthrosphere are shown in Figure 18.2. Somewhat more than half of the lead processed by humans comes from the geosphere, mostly as lead ore, with the remainder coming from recycled lead. By far the greatest use of lead is in batteries, and the amount of battery lead recycled each year approaches that taken from the geosphere. A small fraction of lead is dissipated as wastes associated with mining, refining, and use of the metal. Former uses of lead other than in batteries, including pigments, solder, cable sheathing, formed products, and shot in ammunition, have been severely curtailed; recycling lead from such applications is difficult. Although much of the lead in batteries is recycled,4 about one-third of it is lost and this represents another area of potential improvement in the utilization of lead. 18.5.6 LITHIUM Lithium, atomic number 3, atomic mass 6.941, is emerging as a metal of particular importance with respect to energy sustainability. It is the first metal in the periodic table and the lightest with a density in the metallic form of only 0.531 g/cm3. Until recently, the demand for lithium was relatively low with uses in glasses, enamels, specialty ceramics, lubricant greases, and as a pharmaceutical agent to treat some mental disorders. Lithium forms the Li+ ion which, because of its low mass, is a very efficient charge carrier in powerful, compact lithium ion batteries, which operate by means of the movement of Li+ ions between electrodes through an electrolyte and across a separator. Because of their abilities to store large amounts of electrical energy in relatively small rechargeable batteries, these devices have become very popular in portable electronic devices, especially laptop computers.", "Although the popularity of lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices has increased the demand for lithium, it is miniscule compared to the demand that will be created for this metal as lithium ion batteries are developed for use in electric and especially hybrid vehicles that have both electric motors and internal combustion engines. Known world resources of lithium are limited. As of 2009, these were estimated at 5.4 million tons in Bolivia, 3 million in Chile, 1.1 million in China, and 410,000 in the United States. The harvesting of lithium salts from the fl at-salt desert of Uyuni in Bolivia has become an important source of income for the local people although meeting projected demand will require larger mechanized operations. The limited number of locations of known lithium deposits and political uncertainties regarding these sources have raised concerns regarding acquisition of sufficient supplies of this metal to meet projected demands. However, it is likely that there are signifi cant lithium resources in various parts of the world that have not been found, largely because they have not been sought in the past due to limited demand for this element. 18.5.7 POTASSIUM Potassium deserves special mention as a metal because the potassium ion, K+, is an essential element required for plant growth. It is mined as potassium minerals and applied to soil as plant fertilizer. Potassium minerals consist of potassium salts, generally KCl. Such salts are found as deposits in the ground or may be obtained from some brines. Very large deposits are found in Saskatchewan, Canada. All the salts used as potassium sources are quite soluble in water. 18.5.8 ZINC Zinc is relatively abundant and not particularly toxic, so its industrial ecology is of less concern than that of toxic lead or scarce chromium. As with other metals, the mining and processing of zinc can pose some environmental concerns. Zinc occurs as ZnS (a mineral called sphalerite), and the sulfur must be reclaimed as SO2 in the smelting of zinc. Zinc minerals often contain significant fractions of lead and copper, as well as significant amounts of toxic arsenic and cadmium. Zinc ore typically containing about 6% zinc is concentrated by a flotation process in which air is bubbled into a slurry of finely ground zinc ore in water treated with special chemicals and a froth concentrate of zinc sulfi de containing up to 50% zinc is skimmed off the top. Up to 90% of the zinc in the ore is recovered. Zinc is widely used as the metal and to make alloys, particularly brass, an alloy with copper that is widely recycled. Lesser amounts of zinc are used to make zinc chemicals. One of the larger uses for zinc is as a corrosion-resistant coating on steel. This application, refined to a high degree in the automotive industry in recent years, has significantly lengthened the life span of automotive bodies and frames. It is difficult to reclaim zinc from zinc plating. However, zinc is a volatile element and it can be recovered in baghouse dust from electric arc furnaces used to reprocess scrap steel. The most important zinc compound is zinc oxide, ZnO. Formerly widely used as a paint pigment, this white substance is now employed as an accelerating and activating agent for hardening rubber products, particularly tires. The other two major compounds of zinc employed commercially are zinc chloride used in dry cells, as a disinfectant, and to vulcanize rubber, and zinc sulfi de, used in zinc electroplating baths. Two aspects of zinc may be addressed with respect to its industrial ecology. The first of these is that, although it is not very toxic to animals, zinc is phytotoxic (toxic to plants) and soil can be \u201cpoisoned\u201d by exposure to zinc from zinc smelting or from application of zinc-rich sewage sludge. The second of these is that the recycling of zinc is complicated by its dispersal as a plating on other metals. However, means do exist to reclaim significant fractions of such zinc, such as from electric arc furnaces as mentioned above. 18.6 NONMETAL MINERAL RESOURCES A number of minerals other than those used to produce metals are important resources. As with metals, the environmental aspects of mining many of these minerals are quite important. Typically, even the extraction of ordinary rock and gravel can have important environmental effects. Clays are secondary minerals formed by weathering processes on parent minerals (see Chapter 15, Section 15.7). Clays have a variety of uses.", "About 70% of the clays used are miscellaneous clays of variable composition that have uses for a number of applications including filler (such as in paper), brick manufacture, tile manufacture, and portland cement production. Somewhat more than 10% of the clay used is fireclay, which has the characteristic of being able to withstand firing at high temperatures without warping. This clay is used to make a variety of refractories, pottery, sewer pipe, tile, and brick. Somewhat <10% of the clay that is used is kaolin, which has the general formula Al2(OH)4Si2O5. Kaolin is a white mineral that can be fired without losing shape or color. It is employed to make paper filler, refractories, pottery, dinnerware, and as a petroleum-cracking catalyst. About 7% of clay mined consists of bentonite and fuller\u2019s earth, a clay of variable composition used to make drilling muds, petroleum catalyst, carriers for pesticides, sealers, and clarifying oils. Very small quantities of a highly plastic clay called ball clay are used to make refractories, tile, and whiteware. U.S. production of clay is about 42 million metric tons per year, and global and domestic resources are abundant. Fluorine compounds are widely used in industry. Large quantities of fl uorspar, CaF2, are required as a fl ux in steel manufacture. Synthetic and natural cryolite, Na3AlF6, is used as a solvent for aluminum oxide in the electrolytic preparation of aluminum metal. Sodium fl uoride is added to water to help prevent tooth decay, a measure commonly called water fl uoridation. World reserves of high-grade fluorspar are around 190 million metric tons, about 13% of which is in the United States. This is suffi cient for several decades at projected rates of use. A great deal of byproduct fluorine is recovered from the processing of fl uorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F, used as a source of phosphorus (see below). Micas are complex aluminum silicate minerals that are transparent, tough, fl exible, and elastic. Muscovite, K2O \u2022 3Al2O3\u2022 6SiO2 \u2022 2H2O, is a common type of mica. Better grades of mica are cut into sheets and used in electronic apparatus, capacitors, generators, transformers, and motors. Finely divided mica is widely used in roofing, paint, welding rods, and many other applications. Sheet mica is imported into the United States, and finely divided \u201cscrap\u201d mica is recycled domestically. Shortages of this mineral are unlikely. Pigments and fi llers of various kinds are used in large quantities. The only naturally occurring pigments still in wide use are those containing iron. These minerals are colored by limonite, an amorphous brown-yellow compound with the formula 2Fe2O3 \u2022 3H2O, and hematite, composed of gray-black Fe2O3. Along with varying quantities of clay and manganese oxides, these compounds are found in ocher, sienna, and umber. Manufactured pigments include carbon black, titanium dioxide, and zinc pigments. About 1.5 million metric tons of carbon black, manufactured by the partial combustion of natural gas, are used in the United States each year, primarily as a reinforcing agent in tire rubber. Over 7 million metric tons of minerals are used in the United States each year as fillers for paper, rubber, roofing, battery boxes, and many other products. Among the minerals used as fi llers are carbon black, diatomite, barite, fuller\u2019s earth, kaolin (see clays, above), mica, limestone, pyrophyllite, and wollastonite (CaSiO3). Although sand and gravel are the cheapest of mineral commodities per ton, the average annual dollar value of these materials is greater than all but a few mineral products because of the huge quantities involved. In tonnage, sand and gravel production is by far the greatest of nonfuel minerals. Almost 1 billion tons of sand and gravel are employed in construction in the United States each year, largely to make concrete structures, road paving, and dams. Slightly more than that amount is used to manufacture portland cement and as construction fill. Although ordinary sand is predominantly silica, SiO2, about 30 million tons of a more pure grade of silica are consumed in the United States each year to make glass, high-purity silica, silicon semiconductors, and abrasives. At present, old river channels and glacial deposits are used as sources of sand and gravel. Many valuable deposits of sand and gravel are covered by construction and lost to development. Transportation and distance from source to use are especially crucial for this resource. Environmental problems involved with defacing land can be severe, although bodies of water used for fi shing and other recreational activities frequently are formed by removal of sand and gravel.", "18.7 PHOSPHATES Phosphate minerals are of particular importance because of their essential use in the manufacture of fertilizers applied to land to increase crop productivity. In addition, phosphorus is used for supplementation of animal feeds, synthesis of detergent builders, and preparation of chemicals such as pesticides and medicines. The most common phosphate minerals are hydroxyapatite, Ca5(PO4)3(OH), and fl uorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F. Ions of Na, Sr, Th, and U are found substituted for calcium in apatite minerals. Small amounts of PO43- may be replaced by AsO43- and the arsenic must be removed for food applications. Approximately 17% of world phosphate production is from igneous minerals, primarily fluorapatites. About three-fourth of world phosphate production is from sedimentary deposits, generally of marine origin. Vast deposits of phosphate, accounting for approximately 5% of world phosphate production, are derived from guano droppings of seabirds and bats. Current U.S. production of phosphate rock is around 40 million metric tons per year, most of it from Florida. Most of the available phosphate ore is of low grade so that its processing generates large quantities of by-product.5 Naturally occurring phosphate minerals are not sufficiently soluble to be used as phosphate fertilizer. For commercial phosphate fertilizer production, these minerals are treated with phosphoric or sulfuric acids to produce more soluble superphosphates as described in Chapter 16, Section 16.7. The hydrogen fluoride (HF) produced as a by-product of superphosphate production from fl uorapatite can create air pollution problems, and the recovery of fluorides is an important aspect of the industrial ecology of phosphate production. There are at least two major reasons why the industrial ecology of phosphorus is particularly important. The first of these is that current rates of phosphate use would exhaust known reserves of phosphate within two or three generations. Although additional sources of phosphorus will be found and exploited, it is clear that this essential mineral is in distressingly short supply relative to human consumption; phosphate shortages, along with sharply higher prices, will eventually cause a crisis in food production. The second significant aspect of the industrial ecology of phosphorus is the pollution of waterways by waste phosphate, a plant, and algal nutrient. This results in excessive growth of algae in the water, followed by decay of the plant biomass, consumption of dissolved oxygen, and an undesirable condition of eutrophication. Excessive use of phosphate coupled with phosphate pollution suggests that phosphate wastes, such as from sewage treatment, should be substituted as sources of plant fertilizer. Several other partial solutions to the problem of phosphate shortages are the following. \u2022 Development and implementation of methods of fertilizer application that maximize effi cient utilization of phosphate \u2022 Genetic engineering of plants that have minimal phosphate requirements and that utilize phosphorus with maximum effi ciency \u2022 Development of systems to maximize the utilization of phosphorus-rich animal wastes 18.8 SULFUR Sulfur is an important nonmetal; its greatest single use is in the manufacture of sulfuric acid. However, the element is employed in a wide variety of other industrial and agricultural products. Current consumption of sulfur amounts to approximately 10 million metric tons per year in the United States. The four most important sources of sulfur are (in decreasing order) deposits of elemental sulfur, H2S recovered from sour natural gas, organic sulfur recovered from petroleum, and pyrite (FeS2). Recovery of sulfur from coal used as a fuel is a huge potential, largely untapped source of this important nonmetal. The resource situation for sulfur differs from that of phosphorus in several signifi cant respects. Although sulfur is an essential nutrient like phosphorus, most soils contain sufficient amounts of nutrient sulfur, and the major uses of sulfur are in the industrial sector. The sources of sulfur are varied and abundant and supply is no problem either in the United States or worldwide; sulfur recovery from fossil fuels as a pollution control measure could even result in surpluses of this element. About 90% of the use of sulfur in the world is for the manufacture of sulfuric acid. Almost two-third of the sulfuric acid consumed is used to make phosphate fertilizers as discussed in Section 18.7, in which case the phosphorus ends up as waste \u201cphospho-gypsum,\u201d CaSO4 \u2022 xH2O. Other uses of sulfuric acid include lead storage batteries, steel pickling, petroleum refining, extraction of copper from copper ore, and the chemical industry. The industrial ecology of sulfur needs to emphasize reduction of wastes and sulfur pollution, rather than supply of this element.", "Unlike many resources, such as most common metals, the uses of sulfur are for the most part dissipative, and the sulfur is \u201clost\u201d to agricultural land, paper products, petroleum products, or other environmental sinks. There are two major environmental concerns with sulfur. One of these is the emission of sulfur into the atmosphere, which occurs mostly as pollutant sulfur dioxide and is largely manifested by production of acidic precipitation and dry deposition. The second major environmental concern with sulfur is that it is used mostly as sulfuric acid and is not incorporated into products, thus posing the potential to pollute water and create acidic wastes. Acid purification units are available to remove significant amounts of sulfuric acid from waste acid solutions for recycling. 18.8.1 GYPSUM Calcium sulfate in the form of the dihydrate CaSO4 . 2H2O is the mineral gypsum, one of the most common forms in which waste sulfur is produced. As noted, large quantities of this material are produced as a by-product of phosphate fertilizer manufacture. Another major source of gypsum is its production when lime is used to remove sulfur dioxide from power plant stack gas: Ca(OH)2 + SO2 \u00c6 CaSO3 + H2O (18.3) to produce a calcium sulfite product that can be oxidized to calcium sulfate. About 100 million metric tons of gypsum are mined each year for a variety of uses, including production of portland cement, to make wallboard, as a soil conditioner to loosen tight clay soils, and numerous other applications. Calcium sulfate from industrial or natural (gypsum) sources can be calcined at a very low temperature of only 159\u221eC to produce CaSO4 \u00b7 _1H2O, a material known as plaster of Paris, which was 2 once commonly used for the manual application of plaster to walls. Plaster of Paris mixed with water forms a plastic material that sets up as the solid dihydrate: (18.4) CaSO4 \u00b7 _1H2O + _3H2O \u00c6 CaSO4 \u00b7 2H2O 22 Cast into sheets coated with paper, this material produces plasterboard commonly used for the interior walls of homes and other buildings. Historically, plaster of Paris was used for mortar and other structural applications, and it has the potential for similar applications today. The very large quantities of gypsum that are mined suggest that by-product calcium sulfate, especially that produced with phosphate fertilizers and from flue gas desulfurization, should be a good candidate for reclamation through the practice of industrial ecology. The low temperature (see _1 above) required to convert hydrated calcium sulfate to CaSO4 \u00b7 2H2O, which can be set up as a solid by mixing with water, suggests that the energy requirements for a gypsum-based by-products industry should be modest. Low-density gypsum blown as a foam and used as a filler in composites along with sturdy reinforcing materials should have good insulating, fire-resistant, and structural properties for building construction. 18.9 WOOD: A MAJOR RENEWABLE RESOURCE Fortunately, one of the major natural resources in the world, wood, is a renewable resource. Production of wood and wood products is the fifth largest industry in the United States, and forests cover one-third of the U.S. surface area. Wood ranks first worldwide as a raw material for the manufacture of other products, including lumber, plywood, particle board, cellophane, rayon, paper, methanol, plastics, and turpentine. Chemically, wood is a complicated substance consisting of long cells having thick walls composed largely of polysaccharides such as cellulose, a glucose polymer shown in Chapter 22, Figure 22.5. In addition to the solid wood fraction consisting of cellulose and lignin (see Chapter 17, Section 17.6), a wide variety of tannins, pigments, sugars, starch, cyclitols, gums, mucilages, pectins, galactans, terpenes, hydrocarbons, acids, esters, fats, fatty acids, aldehydes, resins, sterols, and waxes can be extracted from wood by water, alcohol-benzene, ether, and steam distillation. Substantial amounts of methanol, a useful synthetic chemical and fuel once commonly called wood alcohol, are obtained from pyrolysis of wood. A major use of wood is in paper manufacture. The widespread use of paper is a mark of an industrialized society. The manufacture of paper is a highly advanced technology. Paper consists essentially of cellulosic fibers tightly pressed together. To make paper, the lignin fraction must fi rst be removed from the wood, leaving the cellulosic fraction. Both the sulfite and alkaline processes for accomplishing this separation have resulted in severe water and air pollution problems, now significantly alleviated through the application of advanced treatment technologies.", "Wood fi bers and particles can be used for making fi berboard, paper-base laminates (layers of paper held together by a resin and formed into the desired structures at high temperatures and pressures), particle board (consisting of wood particles bonded together by a phenol-formaldehyde or urea-formaldehyde resin), and nonwoven textile substitutes consisting of wood fi bers held together by adhesives. Wood chemical by-products including glucose and cellulose are potential major products from the 60 million metric tons of wood wastes produced in the United States each year. 18.10 EXTENDING RESOURCES THROUGH THE PRACTICE OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY A tremendous potential exists for applying the practice of industrial ecology to lower the burden on virgin raw materials and sources of energy. These approaches include using less material (dematerialization), substitution of a relatively more abundant and safe material for one that is scarce and/or toxic, extracting useful materials from wastes (waste mining), and recycling materials and items. Properly applied, these measures can not only conserve increasingly scarce raw materials, but can also increase wealth as it is conventionally defi ned. The greatest potential for extending material resources is by recycling through the practice of industrial ecology. One of the greatest savings in recycling is energy saved by the practice. Materials vary in their amenability to recycling. Arguably the most recyclable materials are metals in a relatively pure form. Such metals are readily melted and recast into other useful components. Among the least recyclable materials are mixed polymers or composites, the individual constituents of which cannot be readily separated. The chemistry of some polymers is such that, once they are prepared from monomers, they are not readily broken down again and reformed to a useful form. This section briefly addresses the kinds of materials that are recycled or that are candidates for recycling in a functional system of industrial ecology. An important aspect of industrial ecology applied to recycling materials consists of the separation processes that are employed to \u201cunmix\u201d materials for recycling at the end of a product cycle. An example of this is the separation of graphite carbon fibers from the epoxy resins used to bind them together in carbon fiber composites. The chemical industry provides many examples where separations are required. For example, the separation of toxic heavy metals from solutions or sludges can yield a metal product, leaving nontoxic water and other materials for safe disposal or reuse. 18.10.1 METALS Pure metals are easily recycled, and the greatest challenge is to separate the metals into a pure state. One of the more difficult problems with metals recycling is the mixing of metals, such as problems that occur with metal alloys when a metal is plated onto another metal, or with components made of two or more metals in which it is hard to separate the metals. A common example of the complications from mixing metals is the contamination of iron with copper from copper wiring or other components made from copper. As an impurity, copper produces steel with inferior mechanical characteristics. Another problem can be the presence of toxic cadmium used as plating on steel parts. Recycling metals can take advantage of the technology developed over many years of technology for the separation of metals that occur together in ores. Examples of by-product metals recovered during the refining of other metals are gallium from aluminum; arsenic from lead or copper; precious metal iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium from platinum; and cadmium, germanium, indium, and thorium from zinc. 18.10.2 PLASTICS AND RUBBER Much attention has been given to the recycling of plastics in recent years. Compared to metals, plastics are much less recyclable because recycling is technically difficult and plastics are less valuable than metals. There are two general classes of plastics, a fact that has a strong infl uence on their recyclability. Thermoplastics are those that become fluid when heated and solid when cooled. Since they can be heated and reformed multiple times, thermoplastics are generally amenable to recycling. Recyclable thermoplastics include polyalkenes (low-density and high-density polyethylene and polypropylene); polyvinylchloride (PVC), used in large quantities to produce pipe, house siding, and other durable materials; polyethylene terephthalate; and polystyrene. Plastic packaging materials are commonly made from thermoplastics and are potentially recyclable. Fortunately, from the viewpoint of recycling, thermoplastics make up most of the quantities of plastics used. Thermosetting plastics are those that form molecular cross linkages between their polymeric units when they are heated. These bonds set the shape of the plastic, which does not melt when it is heated.", "Therefore, thermosetting plastics cannot be simply remolded; they are not very amenable to recycling, and often burning them for their heat content is about the only use to which they may be put. An important class of thermosetting plastics consists of the epoxy resins, characterized by an oxygen atom bonded between adjacent carbons (1,2-epoxide or oxirane). Epoxies are widely used in composite materials combined with fibers of glass or graphite. Other thermosetting plastics include cross-linked phenolic polymers, some kinds of polyesters, and silicones. When recycling is contemplated, the best use for thermosetting plastics is for the fabrication of entire components that can be recycled. Contaminants are an important consideration in recycling plastics. A typical kind of contaminant is paint used to color the plastic object. Adhesives and coatings of various kinds may also act as contaminants. Such materials may weaken the recycled material or decompose to produce gases when the plastic is heated for recycling. Toxic cadmium used to enable polymerization of plastics, a \u201ctramp element\u201d in recycling parlance, can hinder recycling of plastics and restrict the use of the recycled products. Large quantities of recycled polyester plastics from bottles can be used to make carpets. As of 2008 Mohawk carpets was using 14,000 plastic drink bottles per minute, about one-third of those available for recycling in the United States, to make Everstrand carpet. It should be noted that the plastic used for bottled drinking water bottles, alone, in the United States requires around 175 million liters of petroleum each year for their manufacture generating almost 1.5 million metric tons per year of waste. Only about one in four of these plastic bottles are recycled. Although natural rubber was widely recycled during World War II, the synthetic rubbers developed as substitutes during the war were much less amenable to recycling. Countries throughout the world produce millions of spent vehicle tires, which can cause severe problems in waste dumps and are commonly used as fuel. One approach that is proving successful is to freeze the shredded rubber from tires in liquid nitrogen and grind it to a very fine powder. This material is used as an additive for paints, coatings, and sealants to which it imparts some rubber properties including elasticity and impact resistance along with protection against ultraviolet radiation and ozone. The powdered rubber product is also added to rubber used in new tires. 18.10.3 LUBRICATING OIL Lubricating oils are used in vast quantities and are prime candidates for recycling. The most simplistic means of recycling lubricating oil is to burn it, and large volumes of oil are burned for fuel. This is a very low level of recycling and will not be addressed further here. For many years the main process for reclaiming waste lubricating oil used treatment with sulfuric acid followed by clay. This process generated large quantities of acid sludge and spent clay contaminated with oil. These undesirable by-products contributed substantial amounts of wastes to hazardous waste disposal sites. Current state-of-the-art practices of lubricating oil reclamation do not utilize large quantities of clay for cleanup, but instead use solvents, vacuum distillation, and catalytic hydrofinishing to produce a usable material from spent lubricating oil. The first step is dehydration to remove water and stripping to remove contaminant fuel (gasoline) fractions. If solvent treatment is used, the oil is then extracted with a solvent, such as isopropyl or butyl alcohols or methylethylketone. After treatment with a solvent, the waste oil is commonly centrifuged to remove impurities that are not soluble in the solvent. The solvent is then stripped from the oil. The next step is a vacuum distillation that removes a light fraction useful for fuel and leaves a heavy residue that can be used for fuel. The lubricating oil can then be subjected to hydrofinishing, chemical addition of H2 over a catalyst, to produce a suitable lubricating oil product. LITERATURE CITED 1. Bless, D., B. Park, S.

Lead, zinc, and copper are often associated with hydrothermal deposits and comonly occur as the metal sulfides. What does this suggest about the pE conditions (see Chapter 4) in the hydrothermal waters under which these deposits were formed? 2. The world\u2019s largest trona deposit is in the Green River Basin of Wyoming. Look up trona on the internet and suggest how this deposit was formed. 3. It is believed that the earth\u2019s oceans before the emergence of living organisms in them contained large amounts of dissolved Fe2+. Describe with chemical equations how this iron was converted to deposits of Fe2O3, an important iron ore, by biochemical and chemical processes. Consider the solubility of Fe(OH)3 and what happens to it when it is heated. 4. Using internet resources, look up the chemical reactions involved in extraction of gold from ore with cyanide. Why are the solutions maintained at a relatively high pH? What are the environmental implications of the process? 5. Calculate approximately how many tons of tailings were produced per ton of copper metal recovered from ore in 1900 compared to now. What are the environmental implications of these fi gures. 6. Although very rare in nature, why was gold one of the first metals discovered and used by humans? From what you can learn about the chemistry of copper and that of iron, suggest why copper metal was discovered and used before iron. Although iron almost never occurs in the elemental form in that part of the earth\u2019s crust accessible to humans, suggest how elemental iron was discovered. Where might elemental iron have been observed in nature in very rare and spotty locations around Earth? 7. What is the chemical reaction for the calcination of the aluminum compound precipitated from bauxite? In what two respects is the production of aluminum from ore energy-intensive? How does aluminum metal recycling reduce the consumption of energy in aluminum production? 8. What were the two applications of lead that led to its widespread dispersal in the environment until about the 1970s? 9.", "What environmental measures have the potential to lead to a surplus of sulfur? 10. What are the chemical processes for extracting cellulose from wood to make paper? Why are these environmentally problematic? Look up the chemical composition of cotton and suggest why it can be used to make an especially good (but expensive) grade of paper. 11. Two of the main approaches that employ the practice of industrial ecology for using smaller amounts of material and more readily available substances are dematerialization and material substitution. Compare the nature of electronics and communications apparatus from the 1950s to the corresponding apparatus used today and show how both dematerialization and material substitution have led to much less use of materials in electronics and communications. 12. According to information from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, \u201cindustrial biorefineries have been identified as the most promising route to the creation of a new domestic biobased industry.\u201d What is a biorefinery? How does it compare to a petroleum refinery? How can the widespread application of biorefineries aid sustainability? 13. Although alloys greatly increase the utility of metals, how is alloying potentially detrimental to metal recycling? 14. What are the two reasons that plastics are generally less recyclable than metals? Why are thermosetting plastics less recyclable than thermoplastics? 15. Why are present practices for recycling lubricating oils much more sustainable than those employed in decades past? 19 Sustainable Energy: The Key to Everything 19.1 ENERGY PROBLEM It is a rather bold claim that sustainable energy is \u201cthe key to everything.\u201d But a convincing argument can be made that most problems in the physical environment can be solved to at least a large degree if enough energy is available, if it is inexpensive enough, and if it can be used without doing irreparable environmental harm. Consider the following environmental and sustainability problems that can be solved at least in part with sufficient sustainable energy: \u2022 Water: With enough energy, wastewater can be reclaimed to drinking water standards by reverse osmosis and other energy-consuming technologies and seawater can be desalinated. \u2022 Food: With enough energy, marginal land can be reclaimed by measures such as leveling, terracing, and rock removal and irrigation water can be pumped from long distances or desalinated to grow food. Greenhouses can be heated even during winter months to grow high-value specialty foods. \u2022 Wastes: The disposal of hazardous organic wastes in landfills, though widely practiced, is not a good idea. With sufficient energy, such wastes can be converted to forms that cannot do harm. \u2022 Transportation: With suffi cient sustainable energy, transportation problems can be solved by technologies such as electrifi ed railways. \u2022 Fuels: Biomass sources of fixed carbon can be converted to hydrocarbon fuels for applications for which there are no viable alternatives (such as aircraft) without adding any net amounts of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The list above can be extended to many other areas and to a large number of sustainability and environmental problems. The great challenge is, of course, that systems of energy utilization have developed that are unsustainable. One of the most obvious sustainability challenges is that humankind is running out of the sources of energy around which its economic systems have become based. This is especially true of petroleum. Peak U.S. petroleum production was passed several years ago, and it is likely that peak world production will be reached within a few years of 2010. Exorbitantly high petroleum prices in the first part of 2008 followed by a precipitous fall in price as world economies collapsed at the end of the year emphasized the economic uncertainties of reliance on petroleum as an energy source, especially by nations that do not have domestic sources. There are still abundant resources of coal, but their utilization to provide for energy with current technology almost certainly will cause unacceptable global warming. Therefore, the great challenge facing humankind during the next several decades is to develop sources of energy that will meet energy needs and that will not ruin Earth and its climate. There are energy alternatives to fossil fuels that can be developed, that are environmentally safe (or can be made so), and that, taken in total, can be adequate to supply energy needs. These include wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and nuclear energy sources. Some other miscellaneous sources, such as tidal energy, may contribute as well. Fossil fuels will continue to be used and may contribute sustainably for decades with sequestration of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.", "And, of course, energy conservation and greatly enhanced efficiency of energy use will make substantial contributions. This chapter discusses the energy alternatives listed above with emphasis on energy sustainability. 19.2 NATURE OF ENERGY Energy is the capacity to do work (basically, to move matter around) or heat in the form of the movement of atoms and molecules. Kinetic energy is contained in moving objects. One such example is the energy contained in a rapidly spinning flywheel, a device of potentially great importance for energy storage to even out the energy flow from intermittent solar and wind sources. Potential energy is stored energy, such as in an elevated reservoir of water used as a means of storing hydroelectric energy for later use that can be run through a hydroelectric turbine to generate electricity as needed. A very important form of potential energy is chemical energy stored in the bonds of molecules and released, usually as heat, when chemical reactions occur. For example, in the case of methane, CH4, in natural gas, when the methane burns, CH4 + 2O2 \u00c6 CO2 + 2H2O (19.1) the difference between the bond energies in the CO2 and H2O products and the CH4 and O2 reactants is released, primarily in the form of heat. If the heat is released by combustion of methane in a gas turbine, part of the heat energy can be converted to mechanical energy in the form of the rapidly spinning turbine and an electrical generator to which it is attached. The generator, in turn, converts the mechanical energy to electrical energy. The standard unit of energy is the joule, abbreviated J. A total of 4.184 J of heat energy will raise the temperature of 1 g of liquid water by 1\u00b0C. This amount of heat is equal to 1 calorie of energy (1 cal = 4.184 J), the unit of energy formerly used in scientific work. A joule is a small unit, and the kilojoule, kJ, equal to 1000 J is widely used in describing chemical processes. The \u201ccalorie\u201d commonly used to express the energy value of food (and its potential to produce fat) is actually a kilo-calorie, kcal, equal to 1000 cal. Power refers to energy generated, transmitted, or used per unit time. The unit of power is the watt, equal to an energy flux of 1 J/s). A compact fluorescent light bulb adequate to illuminate a desk area might have a rating of 21 W. A large power plant may put out electricity at a power level of 1000 megawatts (MW, where 1 MW is equal to 1 million watts). Power on a national or global scale is often expressed in gigawatts, each one of which is equal to a billion watts or even terawatts, where a terawatt is equal to a trillion watts. The science that deals with energy in its various forms and with work is thermodynamics. There are some important laws of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is neither created nor destroyed. This law is also known as the law of conservation of energy. The fi rst law of thermodynamics must always be kept in mind in the practice of green technology, the best practice of which requires the most efficient use of energy. Thermodynamics enables calculation of the amount of usable energy. As described by the laws of thermodynamics, only a relatively small amount of the potential energy in fuel can be converted to mechanical energy or electrical energy with the remaining energy from the combustion of the fuel dissipated as heat. With the application of green technology, much of this heat is salvaged for applications such as district heating of homes. Although energy is neither created nor destroyed, the amount of useful energy that can be obtained from a system can be dissipated. Useful mechanical energy can be produced, for example, in a heat engine by harnessing part of the energy flow from a hot to a cooler part of the system (Section 19.4 and Equation 19.5). The amount of this useful energy is called exergy and it can go to zero in a system that has reached equilibrium. 19.3 SOURCES OF ENERGY USED IN THE ANTHROSPHERE Before the 1800s, most of the energy used in the anthrosphere came from biomass produced during plant photosynthesis. Houses were heated with wood. Soil was cultivated and goods and people moved by the power of animals or by humans themselves, obtaining their energy from food biomass.", "Wind drove sailing ships and windmills and falling water moved waterwheels. These sources were renewable and sustainable, with solar energy captured by photosynthesis to generate biomass, wind produced by temperature and pressure differences in solar-heated masses of atmospheric air, and flowing water moved as part of the solar-driven hydrologic cycle. Although coal from readily accessible deposits had long been used in small quantities for home heating, exploitation of this energy source grew rapidly after the invention of the steam engine around 1800. During the 1800s, coal became the predominant source of energy in the United States, England, Europe, and other countries that had readily accessible coal resources, a major shift from renewable biomass, wind, and water to a depletable resource that had to be dug from the ground. By 1900, petroleum had become a signifi cant source of energy and by 1950 had surpassed coal as the United States\u2019 leading energy supply. Lagging behind petroleum, natural gas had become a signifi cant energy supplier by 1950. By 1950, hydroelectric power was providing a large fraction of energy used in the anthrosphere and still is. By around 1975, nuclear energy was supplying signifi cant amounts of electricity and has maintained an appreciable share worldwide until the present. Miscellaneous renewable sources including geothermal and, more recently, solar and wind energy are making increasing contributions to total energy supply. Biomass still contributes signifi cantly to the total of the sources of energy used. Figure 19.1 shows U.S. and world energy sources used annually as of the year 2000. The predominance of fossil fuel petroleum, natural gas, and coal are obvious. Estimates of the amounts of fossil fuels available differ. Those of the quantities of recoverable fossil fuels in the world before 1800 as estimated around 1970 are given in Figure 19.2. By far, the greatest recoverable fossil fuel is in the form of coal and lignite. Although world coal resources are enormous and potentially can fill energy needs for a century or two, their utilization would become intolerable to earth\u2019s environment because of environmental disruption from mining and emissions of carbon dioxide long before coal resources were exhausted. Assuming only uranium-235 as a fission fuel source, total recoverable reserves of nuclear fuel are roughly about the same as fossil fuel reserves. These are several orders of magnitude higher if the use of breeder reactors that convert normally unfissionable uranium-238 to fi ssionable plutonium239 is assumed.

K. Hubbert, \u201cThe energy resources of the earth,\u201d in Energy and Power, W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, 1971). about a billion times as much energy by controlled nuclear fusion as was originally present in fossil fuels! This prospect is tempered by the lack of success in developing a controlled nuclear fusion reactor. Geothermal power, currently utilized in northern California, Italy, Iceland, and New Zealand, has the potential for providing a significant percentage of energy worldwide. The same limited potential is characteristic of several renewable energy resources, including hydroelectric energy, tidal energy, and especially wind power. All of these will continue to contribute signifi cant amounts of energy. Renewable, nonpolluting solar energy comes close to being an ideal energy source and it almost certainly has a bright future. The contributions of different fossil fuels to greenhouse gas carbon dioxide emissions vary with the chemical nature of the fuel with greater contributions from those that have relatively less hydrogen. For example, the chemical reaction for the combustion of methane, CH4, CH4 + 2O2 \u00c6 CO2 + 2H2O + energy (19.2) shows that 2 molecules of H2O are produced for each molecule of CO2.", "Since the conversion of chemically bound hydrogen to H2O produces a large amount of heat, a relatively smaller amount of CO2 is released per unit of heat generated. Petroleum hydrocarbons, such as those in gasoline or diesel fuel contain essentially only 2 atoms of H per atom of C. The combustion of such a molecule showing the conversion of 1 atom of C to CO2 is represented as CH + 3O \u00c6 CO + HO + energy (19.3) 222 22 demonstrating that only half as much hydrocarbon-bound H is burned per molecule of CO2 produced, so significantly less energy is produced per C atom than in the combustion of natural gas. Coal is even worse. Coal is a black hydrocarbon with an approximate simple formula of CH0.8, so the combustion of an atom of carbon in coal can be represented as the following: CH0.8 + 1.2O2 \u00c6 CO2 + 0.4H2O + energy (19.4) Much less hydrocarbon-bound hydrogen is available to burn per atom of C in coal compared to petroleum or, especially, natural gas, so the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere per unit energy produced from coal is higher than with petroleum and much higher than with natural gas. The problem that industrialized societies have become dependent on unsustainable fossil energy is clear, the solution less so. Alternatives must be developed and the transition to them will not be easy. The alternatives are discussed later in this chapter. 19.4 ENERGY DEVICES AND CONVERSIONS Energy occurs in many forms and its utilization requires conversion to other forms. Many devices exist for the utilization of energy and its conversion to other forms. The most common of these are shown in Figure 19.3. The types of energy available, the forms in which it is utilized, and the processes by which it is converted to other forms have a number of implications for green technology and sustainability. For example, the wind turbine shown in Figure 19.3(1), once in place, continues to pump electricity into the power grid with virtually no harm to the environment (although some people regard them as unsightly while others think they are picturesque), whereas the steam power plant shown in Figure 19.3(2) requires mining of depletable coal, combustion of the fossil fuel with its potential for air pollution, control of air pollutants, and means for cooling the steam exiting the turbine, with its potential for thermal pollution of waterways. An important aspect of energy utilization is its conversion to usable forms. For example, gasoline burned in automobile engines comes originally from petroleum pumped from underground, the petroleum constituents are separated, molecules with properties suitable for engine fuel are produced chemically, the gasoline product is burned in an internal combustion engine converting chemical to mechanical energy, and the mechanical energy is transmitted to the wheels of the automobile in the form of kinetic energy that moves the automobile. Signifi cantly, less than half of the energy in the gasoline is actually converted to mechanical energy of the automobile\u2019s motion; the rest is dissipated as waste heat through the engine\u2019s cooling system. Figure 19.4 illustrates major forms of energy and conversions between them. A signifi cant point of this illustration is the very large ranges of energy conversion efficiencies from just a few percent or less to almost 100%. These differences suggest areas in which improvements may be sought. One of the most striking efficiencies is the less than 0.5% conversion of light energy to chemical energy by photosynthesis. Despite such a low conversion efficiency, photosynthesis has generated the fossil fuels, from which industrialized societies now get their energy and provide a signifi cant fraction of energy in areas where wood and agricultural wastes are used. Doubling photosynthesis efficiency with genetically engineered plants could be a major factor in making biomass a more desirable energy source. Replacement of woefully inefficient incandescent light bulbs with fl uorescent bulbs that are 5\u20136 times more efficient in converting electrical energy to light can save large amounts of energy and will be mandated in the United States by legislation passed in 2007. A particularly important energy conversion carried out in the anthrosphere is that of heat, such as from chemical combustion of fuel, to mechanical energy used to propel a vehicle or run an electrical generator.", "This occurs, for example, when gasoline in a gasoline engine burns, generating hot gases that move pistons in the engine connected to a crankshaft that converts the up-and-down movement of the piston to rotary motion that drives a vehicle\u2019s wheels. It also occurs when hot steam generated at high pressure in a boiler flows through a turbine connected directly to an electrical generator. A device, such as a steam turbine, in which heat energy is converted to mechanical energy is called a heat engine. Unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics dictate that the conversion of heat to mechanical energy is always much less than 100% efficient. The efficiency of this conversion is given by the Carnot equation, - TT Percent efficiency = 12 \u00a5100 (19.5) T1 Steam Turbine Generator Generator waste heat) out Heat source (fossil (1)Turbine for conversion fueled boiler, reactor Coolant in of kinetic or potential core, solar heatenergy of a \ufb02uid to collector)mechanical and elec trical energy (2) Steam power plant in which high-energy \ufb02uid isproduced by vaporizing water Spark plugIntake Exhaustvalve valve Compressor Turbine Piston Combustion chamber (4) Gas turbine engine.

Consider a steam turbine as shown in Figure 19.5. Substitution into the Carnot equation of 875 K for T1 and 335 K for T2 gives a maximum theoretical effi ciency of 62%. However, it is not possible to introduce all the steam at the highest temperature and friction losses occur so that the energy conversion efficiency of most modern steam turbines is just below 50%. About 80% of the chemical energy released by combustion of fossil fuel in a boiler is actually transferred to water to produce steam so that the net efficiency for conversion of chemical energy in fossil fuels to mechanical energy to produce electricity is about 40%. The overall conversion of chemical energy to electricity is essentially the same because an electrical generator converts virtually all of the energy of a rotating turbine to electricity. Because nuclear reactor peak temperatures are limited for safety reasons, their conversion of nuclear energy to electricity is only about 30%. A particularly important machine for converting chemical to mechanical energy is the internal combustion piston engine shown in Figure 19.6. Most internal combustion engines operate on a cycle of four strokes. In the first of these, the piston moves downward drawing air or an air/fuel mixture into the cylinder. Next, with both valves closed, the air or air/fuel mixture is compressed as the piston moves upward. With the piston near the top of the cylinder (a point at which fuel may be injected if only air is compressed), ignition occurs and the burning fuel creates a mass of highly pressurized combustion gas in the cylinder, which drives the piston down in the third stroke. The exhaust valve then opens and the exhaust gas is expelled during the exhaust stroke. The efficiency of the internal combustion engine increases with the peak temperature reached by the burning fuel, which increases with the degree of compression during the compression stroke Superheatedsteam in, T1 Rotating shaft connectedto electrical generator Cooler steam out, T2 (around 20:1 for a modern diesel engine). This temperature is highest for the diesel engine in which the compression is so high that fuel injected into the combustion chamber ignites without a spark plug ignition source. Whereas a standard gasoline engine is typically about 25% efficient in converting chemical energy in fuel to mechanical energy, a diesel engine is typically 37% effi cient, with some reaching higher values. Although highly superior from the standpoint of efficiency, diesel engines do have some disadvantages with respect to emissions. The first of these is that the combustion zone is not homogeneous because the fuel is injected into the highly compressed air at the top of the compression stroke resulting in incomplete combustion and production of carbon particles; improperly adjusted diesel engines are a major source of particle air pollution in urban areas.", "In addition, because of their very high combustion temperatures and high ignition pressures, diesel engines tend to produce elevated levels of air pollutant nitrogen oxides. Recent advances in diesel engine design, computerized control, and exhaust pollutant control devices have greatly reduced diesel engine emissions. 19.4.1 FUEL CELLS Fuel cells are devices that convert the energy released by electrochemical reactions directly to electricity without going through a combustion process and electricity generator. Fuel cells are the primary means for utilizing hydrogen fuel and are becoming more common as electrical generators. A fuel cell has an anode at which elemental hydrogen is oxidized, releasing electrons to an external circuit, and a cathode at which elemental oxygen is reduced by electrons introduced from the external circuit, as shown by the half-reactions in Figure 19.7. The H+ ions generated at the anode migrate to the cathode through a solid membrane permeable to protons. The net reaction is 2H2 + O2 \u00c6 2H2O + electrical energy (19.6) and the only product of the fuel cell reactions is water. Although elemental hydrogen is the ultimate fuel for fuel cells, it may be produced by the chemical breakdown of hydrogen-rich fuels, such as methane, methanol, or even gasoline, a process that also generates carbon dioxide. Tubular-style solid-oxide fuel cells, such as those manufactured by Siemens Westinghouse, operate at an elevated temperature of about 1000\u00b0C and produce an exhaust that is hot enough to drive a turbine or even to cogenerate steam. Such systems may be able to develop overall efficiencies of up to 80%.

Many advances have been made in this area since the late 1800s. Part of the increase in conversion of fuel energy to electricity going from around 4% conversion in 1900 to more than 40% at present resulted from increasing the input temperature (T1 in the Carnot equation) in the heat engines driving electrical generators. Energy use efficiency increased by more than fourfold when picturesque steam engines were replaced by diesel/electric locomotives during the 1940s and 1950s. Substitution of diesel engines for gasoline engines in trucks and farm and construction equipment have resulted in gains in energy effi ciency. Much of the increased efficiency in fuel utilization has come from improved materials that allow higher operating temperatures. In addition to high-temperature-tolerant metals in engines, a contribution has been made by lubricating oils that do not break down at high temperatures. Much of the progress has been achieved with better engineering, now greatly aided by computerized design, evaluation, and manufacturing of engines. Engineers of a century ago had never heard of green technology, and probably would not have cared had they known about it. But they did understand costs of fuel (which, on the basis of constant value currency, were often higher then than they are now) and they welcomed the greater efficiencies they achieved on the basis of costs. A key aspect of the most efficient conversion of chemical to mechanical energy in engines is the precise control of operational aspects such as ignition timing, valve timing, and fuel injection. In modern engines, key operation parameters are controlled by computers leading to optimum effi ciency in engine operation. As an inevitable consequence of the thermodynamics described by the Carnot equation, engines that convert heat to mechanical energy cannot utilize much of the heat, which is carried away by an engine cooling system. Typically, a small portion of this heat is used in automotive heaters on cold days. On a broader scale, such as municipal electrical systems, this heat can be used for heating buildings. Such efficiencies are discussed under \u201cCombined Power Cycles\u201d in Section 19.17. 19.6 ENERGY CONSERVATION AND RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES Any consideration of energy needs and production must take energy conservation into consideration.", "This does not have to mean cold classrooms with thermostats set at 60\u00b0F in mid-winter, nor swelteringly hot homes with no air-conditioning, nor total reliance on the bicycle for transportation, although these and even more severe conditions are routine in many countries. The fact remains that the United States and several other industrialized nations have wasted energy at a deplorable rate. For example, U.S. energy consumption is higher per capita than that of some other countries that have equal, or significantly better, living standards. Obviously, a great deal of potential exists for energy conservation that will ease the energy problem. Efficient use of energy can in fact correlate positively with higher economic standards. Figure 19.8 shows a plot of the ratio of energy use per unit of gross domestic product in developed industrialized nations and illustrates a steady and favorable decrease of energy required relative to economic output. Whereas in 2000, 1.7 barrels of oil equivalents were required per $1000 gross domestic product in developed nations, the corresponding figure for developing nations, which tend to lack advanced means of using energy efficiently, was 5.2 barrels, or 3 times as much. These figures indicate the substantial potential for decreased energy consumption by energy conscious development of the less industrially advanced nations as well as the additional conservation that can be achieved if citizens of industrialized nations can be persuaded to forego wasteful energy practices such as using excessively large and inefficient vehicles and living in overly large dwellings. Transportation is the economic sector with the greatest potential for increased effi ciencies. The private auto and airplane are only about one-third as efficient as buses or trains for transportation. Transportation of freight by a truck requires about 3800 Btu/ton-mile, compared to only 670 Btu/tonmile for a train. Truck transport is terribly inefficient (as well as dangerous, labor-intensive, and environmentally disruptive) compared to rail transport. Major shifts in current modes of transportation in the United States will not come without anguish, but energy conservation dictates that they be made. Figure 19.9 shows the trend in U.S. automobile fuel economy during recent decades. The gains through about 1990 were very impressive, then dropped off as less fuel efficient vehicles became more popular. If the same trends from this period would have been maintained, the U.S. automobile fleet would by now average close to 40 miles per gallon (MPG). Such a figure is readily achievable without seriously compromising safety or comfort and, as is obvious from the figure, with much lower emissions from pollutants today as compared to in 1970. In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed legislation mandating higher fuel economy standards for vehicles sold in the United States. Household and commercial uses of energy are relatively efficient. Here again, appreciable savings can be made. The all-electric home requires much more energy (considering the percentage 3 2 1 0 1970 Year FIGURE 19.8 Plot of barrel of oil equivalent required per $1000 gross domestic product (GDP) as a function of year in industrialized nations. Barrel of oil equivalent$1000 GDP Major components of a hybrid automobile in which an internal combustion engine drives a generator to produce electricity to drive a vehicle. Electrical energy is stored in a battery. Electrical energy is also salvaged for storage from braking the vehicle. Vastly reduced fuel consumption can be achieved by hybrid vehicles now under development that have batteries that can be charged by an external electrical source as well as the onboard engine. Such vehicles could give around 40\u201350 km driving range from an overnight charge alone, suffi cient for the majority of routine driving. As the battery runs down, the internal combustion engine would recharge it as is the case with current hybrids. As of 2009, batteries were under development that could be recharged effi ciently by both an external source of electricity and by an internal combustion engine coupled to a generator. Although gasoline engines are now employed in hybrid vehicles, the ultimate in fuel economy could be achieved with an inherently more efficient diesel engine as the internal combustion engine component. By allowing the diesel engine to run at a generally steady rate, the output of exhaust pollutants, which are produced at higher levels by diesel engines as the engine speed is changed, could be greatly reduced.", "Furthermore, diesel engines idle with remarkably little fuel consumption, so that the diesel engine would not need to be turned off when the vehicle is stopped, thus staying hot and further reducing emissions when it is brought up to speed. As scientists and engineers undertake the crucial task of developing alternative energy sources to replace dwindling petroleum and natural gas supplies, energy conservation must receive proper emphasis. In fact, zero energy-use growth, at least on a per capita basis, is a worthwhile and achievable goal. Such a policy would go a long way toward solving many environmental problems. With ingenuity, planning, and proper management, it could be achieved while increasing the standard of living and quality of life. Closely related to energy conservation is the concept of renewable energy from sources that do not run out. Essentially all of these depend on energy from the sun including direct solar energy, wind driven by the solar heating of air masses, falling water from the solar-powered hydrologic cycle, and biomass formed from photosynthesis. For most of its lifetime on Earth, humankind has depended entirely on renewable sources of energy, and most countries are again emphasizing these sources. Enlightened sustainable energy policies are being implemented in some developing countries. China implemented a new law on renewable energy at the beginning of 2006. This policy encourages renewable energy alternatives including wind power, biomass energy, and biomethane generation. Long known for its utilization of wastes (including even use of human wastes as fertilizer for growing vegetables), China has constructed many waste-to-methane generators in rural areas with 17 million families served by such facilities by 2006. Experimental biopower projects burning crop biomass by-products have been undertaken. As of 2006, China had 80 million square meters of solar collectors to heat water, equivalent to the energy from 10 million tons per year of coal. The total renewable energy capacity of China in 2006 was 7% of China\u2019s energy use, equivalent to 160 million tons of coal per year. 19.7 PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS Liquid petroleum occurs in rock formations ranging in porosity from 10% to 30%. Up to half of the pore space is occupied by water. The oil in these formations must flow over long distances to an approximately 15-cm diameter well from which it is pumped. The rate of flow depends on the permeability of the rock formation, the viscosity of the oil, the driving pressure behind the oil, and other factors. Because of limitations in these factors, primary recovery of oil yields an average of about 30% of the oil in the formation, although it is sometimes as little as 15%. More oil can be obtained using secondary recovery techniques, which involve forcing water under pressure into the oil-bearing formation to drive the oil out. Primary and secondary recovery together typically extract somewhat less than 50% of the oil from a formation. Finally, tertiary recovery can be used to extract even more oil, normally through the injection of pressurized carbon dioxide, which forms a mobile solution with the oil and allows it to flow more easily to the well. Other chemicals, such as detergents, may be used to aid in tertiary recovery. Currently, about 300 billion barrels of U.S. oil are not available through primary recovery alone. A recovery efficiency of 60% through secondary or tertiary techniques could double the amount of available petroleum. Much of this would come from fi elds that have already been abandoned or essentially exhausted using primary recovery techniques. The year 2008 was a very interesting one for world oil production and consumption. In July of that year, prices reached record levels of more than $150/barrel and many experts forecast that prices would continue to increase with gasoline going well over the $5/gallon reached in parts of the United States. With the world economic collapse that took place in the fall of 2008, petroleum prices fell precipitously, reaching levels of around $40/barrel. The year also saw the first drop in world oil consumption since 1983 down to 85.8 million barrels per day and U.S. consumption dropped 6.3% to 19.4 million barrels per day. Shale oil is a possible substitute for liquid petroleum. Shale oil is a pyrolysis product of oil shale, a rock containing organic carbon in a complex structure of biological origin from eons past called kerogen. Oil shale is believed to contain approximately 1.8 trillion barrels of shale oil that could be recovered from deposits in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah.", "In the Colorado Piceance Creek basin alone, more than 100 billion barrels of oil could be recovered from prime shale deposits. However, the environmental implications of recovering shale oil by heating oil shale include production of vast amounts of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Furthermore, potential water pollution problems from water-soluble salt residues left over from the pyrolysis of oil shale make it unlikely that this resource will ever be developed on a large scale. Natural gas, consisting almost entirely of methane, is a very attractive fuel that produces few pollutants and less carbon dioxide per unit energy than any other fossil fuel. In addition to its use as a fuel, natural gas can be converted to many other hydrocarbon materials. It can be used as a raw material for the Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis of gasoline. As of the early 2000s, increased demand for natural gas had led to tight supplies in the United States. Production of natural gas from coal seams in Wyoming has required pumping saline, alkaline water from the seams, which has caused water pollution problems. By 2009, exploitation of natural gas in \u201ctight\u201d shale formations opened by fracturing with water had resulted in increased supply of natural gas in the United States and some other countries. 19.8 COAL From Civil War times until World War II, coal was the dominant energy source behind industrial expansion in most nations. However, after World War II, the greater convenience of lower cost petroleum resulted in a decrease in the use of coal for energy in the United States and in a number of other countries. Annual coal production in the United States fell by about one-third, reaching a low of approximately 400 million tons in 1958, but since then coal production for electricity generation has reached about 1 billion tons per year in the United States. About one-third of the world\u2019s energy and around 50% of electrical energy is provided by coal. The general term coal describes a large range of solid fossil fuels derived from partial degradation of plants. Coal is differentiated largely by coal rank based on the percentage of fi xed carbon, percentage of volatile matter, and heating value. The approximate average empirical formula of coal is CH0.8 and coal typically contains from 1 to several percent sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. Of these elements, sulfur bound to the organic coal molecule and mixed with coal as mineral pyrite, FeS2, presents major environmental problems because of production of air pollutant sulfur dioxide during combustion. Much of the FeS2 can be removed physically from coal prior to combustion and sulfur dioxide can be removed from stack gas by various scrubbing processes. 19.8.1 COAL CONVERSION As shown in Figure 19.11, coal can be converted to gaseous, liquid, or low-sulfur, low-ash solid fuels such as coal char (coke) or solvent-refined coal (SRC). Coal conversion is an old idea; a house belonging to William Murdock at Redruth, Cornwall, England, was illuminated with coal gas in 1792. The first municipal coal-gas system was employed to light Pall Mall in London in 1807. The coal-gas industry began in the United States in 1816. The early coal-gas plants used coal pyrolysis (heating in the absence of air) to produce a hydrocarbon-rich product particularly useful for illumination. Later in the 1800s, the water-gas process was developed, in which steam was impinged on hot coal coke to produce a mixture consisting primarily of H2 and CO. It was necessary to add volatile hydrocarbons to this \u201ccarbureted\u201d water-gas to bring its illuminating power up to that of gas prepared by coal pyrolysis. The United States had 11,000 coal gasifi ers operating in the 1920s. At the peak of its use in 1947, the water-gas method accounted for 57% of U.S.-manufactured gas. The gas was made in low-pressure, low-capacity gasifiers that by today\u2019s standards would be inefficient and environmentally unacceptable (many sites of these old plants have been designated as hazardous waste sites because of residues of coal tar and other wastes). This was definitely not a green technology because of the high toxicity of carbon monoxide in the gas product, and many people were killed by release of CO in their houses. During World War II, Germany developed a major synthetic petroleum industry based on coal, which reached a peak capacity of 100,000 barrels per day in 1944.", "A synthetic petroleum plant operating in Sasol, South Africa, reached a capacity of several tens of thousands of tons of coal per day in the 1970s and currently produces hydrocarbons and feedstocks equivalent to about 150,000 barrels of petroleum per day. A number of environmental implications are involved in the widespread use of coal conversion. These include strip mining, water consumption in arid regions, lower overall energy conversion compared to direct coal combustion, and increased output of atmospheric carbon dioxide. These plus economic factors have prevented coal conversion from being practiced on a very large scale. However, coal conversion does enable relatively facile carbon sequestration (see Section 19.9), which could enable much more sustainable coal utilization. 19.9 CARBON SEQUESTRATION FOR FOSSIL FUEL UTILIZATION Carbon sequestration, which prevents carbon dioxide generated by fossil fuels from entering the atmosphere, holds the promise of enabling utilization of fossil fuels without contributing to greenhouse warming. Basically, the various schemes that have been proposed entail capturing carbon dioxide from a product or waste stream and sequestering it in a place where it cannot enter the atmosphere. Several approaches have been suggested or tried for capturing carbon dioxide and there are several possibilities for sequestration. The term \u201ccarbon sequestration\u201d is also used in a more general sense to apply to the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, especially by photosynthesis. There are several possible sinks in which carbon dioxide can be sequestered. The largest of these, a natural sink for the gas, is the ocean. Earth\u2019s oceans have an almost inexhaustible capacity for carbon dioxide. However, lowering the average pH of the oceans by as little as 0.1 pH unit from acidic carbon dioxide could have a serious adverse effect on ocean life and productivity; there is some evidence to suggest that shells of some small sea creatures have become thinner because of higher levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean water. Deep saline formations also have a very high capacity for carbon dioxide sequestration. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs and unmineable coal seams have much lower, but still significant, carbon dioxide capacities. Geological carbon dioxide sequestration can be accomplished by injecting the gas into porous sedimentary formations at depths exceeding approximately 1000 m. Experience in the petroleum industry with underground disposal of carbon dioxide and injection of the gas into oil-bearing formations for petroleum recovery have provided the technology required for geological carbon dioxide sequestration. The carbon dioxide injected into sedimentary formations rises and is confi ned by poorly permeable caprock. Breaches in caprock, such as those from abandoned oil wells, can result in carbon dioxide release. Eventually, the carbon dioxide dissolves in the generally saline pore waters in the sedimentary formation into which it is injected. Chemical reactions in the water and with the surrounding geological strata can result in long-term stability of the carbon dioxide. It is much more effective and less expensive to force carbon dioxide into unsaturated saline groundwater where it is dissolved than to compress the gas into a pressurized gas form underground.1 The first commercial application of carbon dioxide sequestration has operated since 1996 in the North Sea about 240 km from the Norwegian coast in a region known as the Sleipner oil and gas field. The natural gas product from this field is about 9% carbon dioxide, a value that must be reduced to 2.5% for commercial distribution of the gas. Whereas all other gas-producing operations simply discharge the carbon dioxide removed to the atmosphere, at Sleipner it is pumped under pressure into a 200-m thick layer of sandstone, the Utsira formation, which is about 1000 m below the seabed. A mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide removed from sour natural gas that is abundant in Alberta, Canada, is now being sequestered underground.2 The easiest sources of carbon dioxide to capture are those from industrial processes that generate the gas in high concentrations. An example of such a process is the fermentation of carbohydrates to produce ethanol for fuel or other uses. This source provides much of the carbon dioxide that is used commercially at present. The largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide discharged to the atmosphere is generated in power plants fueled with fossil fuels. These sources present a substantial challenge for carbon dioxide removal because they are so dilute. A power plant fueled with carbon-rich coal produces an exhaust stream that is 13\u201315% carbon dioxide, whereas one burning hydrogen-rich methane produces only 3\u20135% carbon dioxide.", "A third possibility is to capture carbon dioxide released from the gasification of fossil fuels, particularly coal (see Section 19.8). Normally, gasification is performed using oxygen as an oxidant, and the initial product consists of carbon dioxide and combustible H2 and CO gases. Carbon monoxide in the synthesis gas product can be reacted with steam, CO + H2O \u00c6 H2 + CO2 (19.7) to produce nonpolluting elemental hydrogen fuel and carbon dioxide. Heat reclamation,district heating In late 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy announced funding for the construction of the fi rst U.S. power plant with carbon dioxide sequestration, the FutureGen coal-powered power plant to be located at a site in Mattoon, Illinois. The project was abruptly canceled in early 2008 allegedly because of greatly increased costs, but a Government Accountability Office report released in March 2009 showed that the costs had been overestimated by $500 million because of an accounting cost mathematics error! The 275 MW power plant was to be large enough to supply electricity to 275,000 households and to sequester 1\u20132 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. Figure 19.12 is a schematic of a coal-fi red power plant with carbon sequestration such as the FutureGen power plant. A gas turbine powered by hydrogen fuel produced by coal gasification generates electricity. Hot exhaust gas from the gas turbine is used to raise steam in a boiler and this steam powers a steam turbine that is also coupled to a generator. This combination results in very efficient electrical power generation. The production of intermediate hydrogen adds options for powering fuel cells or for using hydrogen in chemical synthesis or manufacture of synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. By-product hydrogen sulfi de must be removed from the hydrogen product and can be used for making sulfuric acid, an important industrial chemical, or can be sequestered with the carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide by-product is sequestered in mineral formations at depths up to around 2000 m. For power plants located near petroleum-bearing formations, carbon dioxide can be pumped into oil-bearing mineral formations for tertiary petroleum recovery. 19.10 INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY FOR ENERGY AND CHEMICALS An excellent example of a system of industrial ecology for sustainable utilization of fossil fuels is provided by the Great Plains Synfuel plant located near Beulah, North Dakota. This complex is designed to take advantage of abundant deposits of lignite, a relatively low-heating-value, high-water-content form of coal that occurs in abundance in North Dakota. A schematic diagram Ammonia product sulfate tower of the system is shown in Figure 19.13. The heart of the plant consists of 14 Lurgi-type gasifi ers that are 13 m high and 4 m in diameter processing 16,000 metric tons of lignite per day at temperatures up to 1200\u00b0C to produce a synthesis gas mixture of combustible H2 and CO along with by-products CO2, water, and smaller quantities of tars, oils, phenolic compounds, ammonia, and H2S. Useful fuel hydrocarbons, phenol, cresols, ammonia, and sulfur compounds are extracted from the water, which is used for cooling water. The gas mixture is subjected to a shift reaction that increases the ratio of H2 to CO and this mixture is reacted to produce methane (CH4) that is fed into a natural gas pipeline. Part of the synthesis gas stream is diverted to an ammonia synthesis plant to make this valuable fertilizer product. A key feature of the plant is the extraction of CO2 from the synthesis gas. The carbon dioxide is compressed and sent through a pipeline to Canada where it is pumped underground to depleted petroleum-bearing strata for secondary recovery of crude oil. The Great Plains Synfuels plant provides an excellent example of a diversifi ed industrial ecology complex. It utilizes an abundant resource (lignite coal) in a way that significantly reduces the greenhouse gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts from this resource. Rather than having to transport large quantities of lignite by rail to distant power plants, the energy content of the lignite is converted to methane, the most environmentally friendly fossil fuel, which is moved with minimum environmental disruption through pipelines. An even higher value product, fertilizer ammonia, is synthesized at the site using elemental hydrogen made from gasifying the lignite and elemental nitrogen isolated from air in the air liquefaction operation required to prepare elemental oxygen required for gasification. The carbon dioxide by-product is not released to the atmosphere where it could aggravate the global warming problem but is pumped to oilfi elds where it is pumped underground to increase crude oil recovery.", "Commercially valuable ammonium sulfate by-product, a useful source of nitrogen and sulfur soil nutrients, is recovered from the water released during lignite gasification. In an area where water shortages can occur, the relatively large amount of water released by lignite gasification is used for cooling and as boiler feedwater. 19.11 NUCLEAR ENERGY The awesome power of the atom nucleus revealed at the end of World War II held out enormous promise for the production of abundant, cheap energy. This promise has never really come to full fruition, although nuclear energy currently provides a significant percentage of electric energy in many countries, and it may be the only source of electrical power that can meet world demand without unacceptable environmental degradation, particularly through the generation of greenhouse gases. Nuclear fission for power production is carried out in nuclear power reactors in which the fi ssion (splitting) of uranium-235 or plutonium nuclei occurs. Each such event generates two radioactive fission product atoms of roughly half the mass of the nucleus fissioned, an average of 2.5 neutrons, plus an enormous amount of energy compared to normal chemical reactions. The neutrons, initially released as fast-moving, highly energetic particles, are slowed to thermal energies in a moderator medium. For a reactor operating at a steady state, exactly one of the neutron products from each fission is used to induce another fission reaction in a chain reaction (Figure 19.14). The energy from these nuclear reactions is used to heat water in the reactor core and produce steam to drive a steam turbine, as shown in Figure 19.15. As noted in Section 19.4, temperature limitations make nuclear power less efficient in converting heat to mechanical energy and, therefore, to electricity, than fossil energy conversion processes. A limitation of fission reactors is the fact that only 0.71% of natural uranium is fi ssionable uranium-235. This situation could be improved by the development of breeder reactors, which convert uranium-238 (natural abundance 99.28%) to fi ssionable plutonium-239. A major consideration in the widespread use of nuclear fission power is the production of large quantities of highly radioactive waste products. These remain lethal for thousands of years. They must either be stored in a safe place or be disposed of permanently in a safe manner. At the present time, spent fuel elements are being stored under water at the reactor sites. Under current regulations in most countries, the wastes from this fuel will eventually have to be buried. An alternative favored by many investigators is to process the material in the spent fuel elements to remove radioactive products from uranium fuel, isolate the relatively short-lived fi ssion products that decay spontaneously within several hundred years, and bombard the longer-lived nuclear wastes with neutrons in nuclear reactors. The absorption of neutrons by the nuclei of the nuclear waste elements causes transmutation in which the elements are converted to other elements or fission products with shorter half lives resulting in relatively rapid production of stable isotopes. Radioactive waste elements for which transmutation is feasible include plutonium, americium, neptunium, curium, technetium-99, and iodine-129. Plutonium, americium, neptunium, and curium are heavy actinide elements that are fissionable and add fuel value in a nuclear reactor. \u2022 Fission \u2022 + products \u2022 Neutron \u2022 Neutrons FIGURE 19.14 Fission of a uranium-235 nucleus. Control rods to absorb excess Another problem to be faced with nuclear fission reactors is their eventual decommissioning. There are three possible solutions. One is dismantling soon after shutdown, in which the fuel elements are removed, various components are flushed with cleaning fluids, and the reactor is cut up by remote control and buried. \u201cSafe storage\u201d involves letting the reactor stand 30\u2013100 years to allow for radioactive decay, followed by dismantling. The third alternative is entombment, that is, encasing the reactor in a concrete structure. The course of nuclear power development was altered drastically by two accidents. The fi rst of these occurred on March 28, 1979, with a partial loss of coolant water from the Metropolitan Edison Company\u2019s nuclear reactor located on Three Mile Island in the Susquehanna River, 28 miles outside of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Known as the TMI incident, the result was a loss of control, overheating, and partial disintegration of the reactor core. Some radioactive xenon and krypton gases were released and some radioactive water was dumped into the Susquehanna River. Eventually the reactor building was sealed.", "A much worse accident occurred at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in April 1986, when a reactor blew up and burned, spreading radioactive debris over a wide area and killing a number of people (officially 31, but certainly many more). Thousands of people were evacuated and the entire reactor structure had to be entombed in concrete and steel plate. Food was seriously contaminated as far away as northern Scandinavia. As of 2006, 28 years had passed since a new nuclear electric power plant had been ordered in the United States, in large part because of the projected high costs of new nuclear plants. Although this tends to indicate hard times for the nuclear industry, pronouncements of its demise may be premature and by 2008, several U.S. utilities had begun the process of ordering new nuclear power plants and a significant number of such plants were under construction around the world. Properly designed nuclear fission reactors can generate large quantities of electricity reliably and safely and have done so for decades in U.S. naval submarines and carrier ships and in France, which gets about 80% of its electricity from nuclear sources. The single most important factor that may lead to the renaissance of nuclear energy is the threat to the atmosphere from greenhouse gases produced in large quantities by fossil fuels. It can be argued that nuclear energy is the only proven alternative that can provide the amounts of energy required within acceptable limits of cost, reliability, and environmental effects. New designs for nuclear power plants can enable power reactors that are much safer and environmentally acceptable than those built with older technologies. The proposed new designs incorporate built-in passive safety features that work automatically in the event of problems that could lead to incidents such as TMI or Chernobyl with older reactors. These devices\u2014which depend on passive phenomena such as gravity feeding of coolant, evaporation of water, or convection flow of fl uids\u2014 give the reactor the desirable characteristics of passive stability. They have also enabled signifi cant simplification of hardware, with only about half as many pumps, pipes, and heat exchangers as are contained in older power reactors. 19.11.1 NUCLEAR FUSION The fusion of a deuterium nucleus and a tritium nucleus releases a lot of energy as shown below, where MeV stands for million electron volts, a unit of energy: 23 4 1 H + H \u00c6 He + n + 17.6 MeV (energy released per fusion) (19.8) 112 0 This reaction is responsible for the enormous explosive power of the \u201chydrogen bomb.\u201d So far it has eluded efforts at containment for a practical continuous source of energy. And since physicists have been trying to make it work on a practical basis for the last approximately 50 years, it will probably never be done. (Within about 15 years after the discovery of the phenomenon of nuclear fission, it was being used in a power reactor to power a nuclear submarine.) However, the tantalizing possibility of using the essentially limitless supply of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, from earth\u2019s oceans for nuclear fusion still give some investigators the hope of a practical nuclear fusion reactor and some research continues toward that end. Nuclear fusion was the subject of one of the greatest scientific embarrassments of modern times that occurred in 1989. This incident came about when investigators at the University of Utah announced that they had accomplished the so-called cold fusion of deuterium during the electrolysis of deuterium oxide (heavy water). This resulted in an astonishing flurry of activity as scientists throughout the world sought to repeat the results, whereas others ridiculed the idea. Unfortunately, for the dream of a cheap and abundant source of energy, the skeptics were right, and the whole story of cold fusion stands as a lesson in the (temporary) triumph of wishful technological thinking over scientific good sense. 19.12 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY Underground heat in the form of steam, hot water, or hot rock used to produce steam has been employed as an energy resource for about a century and can be regarded as largely renewable. This energy was first harnessed for the generation of electricity at Larderello, Italy, in 1904, and has since been developed in Japan, Russia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and at the Geysers in northern California. Underground dry steam is relatively rare, but is the most desirable from the standpoint of power generation. More commonly, energy reaches the surface as superheated water and steam.", "In some cases, the water is so pure that it can be used for irrigation and livestock; in other cases, it is loaded with corrosive, scale-forming salts. Utilization of the heat from contaminated geothermal water generally requires that the water be reinjected into the hot formation after heat removal to prevent contamination of surface water. The utilization of hot rocks for energy requires fracturing of the hot formation, followed by injection of water and withdrawal of steam. This technology is still in the experimental state, but promises approximately 10 times as much energy production as steam and hot water sources. Land subsidence and seismic effects, such as the mini-earthquakes that occur when water is pumped under extreme pressure into hot rock formations that fracture as a consequence, are environmental factors that may hinder the development of geothermal power. However, this energy source holds considerable promise, and its development continues. 19.13 THE SUN: AN IDEAL, RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE Solar power is an ideal source of energy that is unlimited in supply, widely available, and inexpensive. It does not add to the earth\u2019s total heat burden or produce chemical air and water pollutants. On a global basis, utilization of only a small fraction of solar energy reaching the earth could provide for all energy needs. In the United States, for example, with conversion effi ciencies ranging from 10% to 30%, it would only require collectors ranging in area from one-tenth down to one-thirtieth that of the state of Arizona to satisfy present U.S. energy needs. (This is still an enormous amount of land, and there are economic and environmental problems related to the use of even a fraction of this amount of land for solar energy collection. Certainly, many residents of Arizona would not be pleased at having so much of the state covered by solar collectors, and some environmental groups would protest the resultant shading of rattlesnake habitat.) There are vast land areas available in the United States and throughout the world that receive exceptional levels of solar energy suitable for power generation. Factors involved in evaluating areas for solar energy generation include proximity to the Equator, relatively high altitude, and consistent absence of cloud cover. The terrestrial area that has optimum conditions is in the Sahara Desert of southeast Niger in Africa, which receives an average of 6.78 kWh/m2 each day, which is close to the amount of energy required to heat water for a typical U.S. household. Solar power cells (photovoltaic cells) for the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity have been developed and are widely used for energy in space vehicles. With present technology, however, they are relatively expensive in most places for large-scale generation of electricity, although the economic gap is narrowing. Most schemes for the utilization of solar power depend on the collection of thermal energy followed by conversion to electrical energy. The simplest example of such an approach involves focusing sunlight on a steam-generating boiler (see Illustration 6 in Figure 19.3). Parabolic reflectors can be used to focus sunlight on pipes containing heat-transporting fl uids. Selective coatings on these pipes ensure that most of the incident energy is absorbed. The most efficient and reliable type of solar-powered heat engine to generate electricity is the Stirling engine, which has achieved close to 30% overall efficiency in the conversion of solar energy to electricity. The Stirling engine uses hydrogen gas as a working fluid in a sealed system in which pistons connected by rods in cylinders pump the gas back and forth in the system. The gas is heated at a heater head kept at a relatively high temperature by sunlight focused from an array of refl ective mirrors that concentrate sunlight on the heater head. The resultant pressure forces one of the pistons down in a power stroke. The gas is then transferred to a piston on the cooled side of the engine through a regenerator consisting of a material that captures some of the heat to be used in the next cycle, thereby greatly increasing efficiency. For a system planned for installation in California\u2019s Mojave desert,3 each Stirling unit is rated at 25 kW power, running at 1800 rpm, and generating electricity at 480 V and 60 Hz. A major advantage of this system is its modular character that enables scaling from a single unit to a very large number generating hundreds of MW of energy in a single location.", "As of 2008, it appeared that the Stirling system would become a leading contender for the utilization of solar power in areas such as California\u2019s Mojave Desert and Africa\u2019s Sahara that receive intense, consistent sunlight. The direct conversion of energy in sunlight to electricity is accomplished by special solar voltaic cells. Most types of photovoltaic cells depend on the electronic properties of silicon atoms containing low levels of other elements. In a typical photovoltaic cell, the cell consists of two layers of silicon, a donor layer that is doped with about 1 ppm of arsenic atoms and an acceptor layer that is doped with about 1 ppm of boron. Recall from Chapter 3 that Lewis symbols use dots to represent the outermost valence electrons of atoms, those that can be lost, gained, or shared in chemical bonds. Examination of the Lewis symbols of silicon, arsenic, and boron shows that substitution of an arsenic atom with its 5 valence electrons for a silicon atom with its 4 valence electrons in the donor layer gives a site with an excess of 1 electron, whereas substitution of a boron atom with only 3 electrons for a silicon atom in the acceptor layer gives a site \u201chole\u201d that is deficient in 1 electron. The surface of a donor layer in contact with an acceptor layer contains electrons that are attracted to the acceptor layer. When light shines on this area, the energy of the photons of light can push these electrons back onto the donor layer, from which they can go through an external circuit back to the acceptor layer, as shown in Figure 19.16. This flow of electrons constitutes an electrical current that can be used for energy. Solar voltaic cells based on crystalline silicon have operated with a 30% efficiency for experimental cells and 15\u201320% for commercial units available in 2008, at a cost of around 20\u201325 cents/ kWh, compared to 4\u20137 cents/kWh for fossil fuel fired power plants and 6\u20139 cents for those fi red by biomass. Part of the high cost results from the fact that the silicon used in the cells must be cut as small wafers from silicon crystals for mounting on the cell surfaces. Significant advances in costs and technology are being made with thin-film photovoltaics, which use an amorphous silicon alloy. These cells are only about half as efficient as those made with crystalline silicon, but cost only about 25% as much. A newer approach to the design and construction of amorphous silicon fi lm photovoltaic devices uses three layers of amorphous silicon to absorb, successively, short wavelength (\u201cblue\u201d), intermediate wavelength (\u201cgreen\u201d), and long wavelength (\u201cred\u201d) light, as shown in Figure 19.17. Thin-film solar panels constructed with this approach have achieved solar-to-electricity energy conversion efficiencies just over 10%, lower than those using crystalline silicon, but higher than other amorphous film devices. The low cost and relatively high conversion efficiencies of these solar panels should enable production of electricity at only about twice the cost of conventional electrical power, which would be competitive in some situations. Systems have been developed in which solar cells lining glass tubes are used to generate electricity. Such a configuration is well adapted to rooftops because it captures light from all angles including even light from below reflected from a white roof. It has been estimated that covering all fl at rooftops in the United States with such collectors could provide about 150 GW of electricity, 15% of U.S. consumption. e \u2013 Antireflective coating,indium-tin oxide A major disadvantage of solar energy is its intermittent nature. However, flexibility inherent in an electric power grid would enable it to accept up to 15% of its total power input from solar energy units without special provision for energy storage. Existing hydroelectric facilities may be used for pumped-water energy storage in conjunction with solar electricity generation. Heat or cold can be stored in water, in a latent form in water (ice) or eutectic salts, or in beds of rock. Enormous amounts of heat can be stored in water as a supercritical fluid contained at high temperatures and very high pressures deep underground. Mechanical energy can be stored with compressed air or fl ywheels. Utilization of solar energy to produce elemental hydrogen as a means to store, transfer, and utilize energy, as discussed in Section 19.16, will probably come into widespread use. No really insurmountable barriers exist to block the development of solar energy, such as might be the case with fusion power.", "In fact, the installation of solar space and water heaters became widespread in the late 1970s, and research on solar energy was well supported in the United States until after 1980, when it became fashionable to believe that free-market forces had solved the \u201cenergy crisis.\u201d At present, shortages of energy and concern over the effects of global warming due to the use of fossil fuels is leading to much increased interest in solar energy. With the installation of more heating devices and the probable development of some cheap, direct solar electrical generating capacity, it is likely that during the coming century, solar energy will be providing an appreciable percentage of energy needs in areas receiving abundant sunlight. 19.14 ENERGY FROM MOVING AIR AND MOVING WATER 19.14.1 SURPRISING SUCCESS OF WIND POWER Wind power using huge turbines mounted on high towers and coupled to electrical generators is emerging at a somewhat surprising rate as a source of renewable energy. Although used for centuries with windmills that drove grain grinding and water pumping operations and during the early 1900s for small-scale electricity generation, especially in remote locations, modern large-scale wind-powered electrical generators emerged during the 1990s as economical means of generating electrical power. Wind power is completely renewable and nonpolluting. It is an indirect means of utilizing solar energy because winds are caused by the movement of air masses heated by the sun (Figure 19.18). Wind power has become a major factor in world energy generation with an estimated capacity of almost 90,000 MW. (A megawatt is abbreviated as MW. Large amounts of power are often expressed in gigawatts, where 1 GW = 1000 MW. A 1000-MW power plant is considered to be quite large and can provide electricity for about 250,000 average U.S. homes. Typical modern large wind turbines generate 1.5\u20134 MW each.) As of the beginning of 2008, the United States had just over 15,500 MW of wind power capacity installed with plants in 30 states. As of mid-2007, Texas was the leading state for wind energy production in the United States with an installed capacity of 3352 MW and an additional 1246 MW under construction. Long the leader in wind energy production, California is now second with about 2400 MW. As of 2008, the next five states were Iowa (1375 MW), Minnesota (1350 MW), Washington (1290 MW), Colorado (1065 MW), and Oklahoma (680 MW). Wind energy in the United States is now sufficient to power 3.9 million average households eliminating as much as 25 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. Wind power has become a major factor in world energy supply. The European Union (EU) countries have more wind power capacity than the rest of the world combined. By the beginning of 2008, EU countries had an installed wind power generation capacity estimated to be around 56,000 MW. At the beginning of 2008, the United States was the leading country in wind energy capacity followed by Germany, India, Spain, and China. Because of its aggressive program for wind power development, China was expected to advance to second within 2 or 3 years. As of 2008, Calgary, Canada, had in operation a new $140 million wind electrical power system that powers three-fourth of the city\u2019s municipal buildings and provides the energy for the municipal light rail transportation system. The system is equivalent to taking 30,000 automobiles off the road. Wind power is especially attractive for some agricultural regions. One reason is that such regions often have low population densities so that there are fewer objections to wind power installations. A commercial wind turbine generating 1.8 MW is a formidable machine, typically mounted on towers around 80 m high to take advantage of higher, more consistent wind speeds at such heights, and may have blades 40 m long. However, the footprints of these structures are relatively small and do not occupy much farmland. The electricity is conveyed from the turbines in underground lines eliminating surface power lines. Adding to the potential attractiveness of wind power in agricultural regions is the fact that electricity generated by wind energy can be used to electrolyze water to produce elemental H2 and O2, an application not handicapped by wind\u2019s intermittent nature. The H2 currently required to make NH3 fertilizer is usually produced from steam reacting with methane (natural gas), a relatively expensive process, and its production from water by inexpensive wind energy could help keep the price of ammonia fertilizer at reasonable levels.", "Furthermore, both elemental H2 and O2 can be used to convert crop by-product biomass to hydrocarbon fuels, as discussed in Section 19.15. Northern regions, including parts of Alaska, Canada, the Scandinavian countries, and Russia often have consistently strong wind conditions conducive to the generation of wind power. Isolation from other sources of energy makes wind power attractive for many of these regions. Severe climate conditions in these regions pose special challenges for wind generators. One problem can be the buildup of rime consisting of ice condensed directly on structures from supercooled fog in air. (In warmer regions, the remains of insects zapped by the rotating turbine blades have built up to the point of reducing the aerodynamic efficiency of the blades.) Although wind turbines have been growing in size leading to much greater economy in power production, there is also a market for small wind turbines that can be used for an individual home or commercial building. Small wind turbines have been installed in a number of locations including Logan International Airport in Boston and the Brooklyn Naval yard. Although the cost of these turbines is much less than that of large commercial turbines, the cost of electricity produced by the small turbines is much higher. 19.14.2 ENERGY FROM MOVING WATER Water flowing in contact with a device called a waterwheel is one of the oldest sources of power other than humans or animals. Grain mills driven by waterpower existed in ancient Greece and Rome, and large waterwheels developing up to 50 hp were constructed in the Middle Ages. In colonial North America, waterwheels drove grist mills and sawmills and were further applied to leather, textile, and machine shop operations. Because of problems with low water flow in the summer and ice formation in the winter, these operations were rapidly displaced when steam engines became available in the early 1800s. With the development of electric power in the late 1800s, waterpower underwent a spectacular renaissance to drive electrical generators. The first practical hydroelectric plant went into operation on the Fox River near Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1882. Hydroelectric power grew rapidly as an energy source from that time and by 1980 accounted for about 25% of world electrical production and 5% of total world energy use. The potential to construct hydroelectric plants is favored by mountainous terrain with large river valleys and is distributed relatively evenly around the world. China has about one-tenth of the world\u2019s potential for hydroelectric power. About 99% of Norway\u2019s electric power is hydroelectric accounting for about 50% of that country\u2019s energy use. The largest hydroelectric project in the world is the Three Gorges installation on the huge Yangtze River in China. Located at the end of a number of steep canyons, the dam spans 2.3 km across the river valley and reaches a height of 185 m. When filled, the reservoir formed by the dam will extend for 630 km with an average width of 1.3 km. When the dam was finished in 2009, it had 26 generating units each capable of generating 700 MW of hydroelectric power, a total capacity of 18.2 GW. After 2009, six more units are to be constructed in a subterranean powerhouse bringing the total generating capacity to 22.4 GW. The sustainability and environmental acceptability of hydroelectric power present a mixed picture. In the modern age, construction of water impoundments tends to displace signifi cant numbers of people; more than 1 million were displaced for the Chinese Three Gorges project. Altering the flow of rivers can change their aquatic ecology. Esthetics can be harmed by fi lling scenic river valleys with impounded water. In some cases in the United States, dams are being dismantled to restore river valleys to their former state. However, hydroelectric power prevents release of greenhouse gases from equivalent fossil energy-powered plants. Reservoirs can provide recreational facilities and serve as sources of fish and water used by municipalities, industries, and agriculture. 19.14.3 ENERGY FROM MOVING WATER WITHOUT DAMS A promising approach to the utilization of energy from moving water without building dams is provided by hydrokinetic and wave energy conversion devices that tap the kinetic energy of moving water in river flows, tides, or ocean waves. These devices can be put in natural streams, tidal estuaries, ocean currents, and constructed waterways. One promising device consists of a turbine with large blades spaced relatively far apart and connected directly to a generator that can be placed in a water current, such as in a river.", "Such turbines can be attached directly to structures constructed on waterway beds or can be attached to bridge supports. Bidirectional turbines have been designed for use in tidal currents that flow back and forth. 19.15 BIOMASS ENERGY Fossil fuels originally came from photosynthetic processes. Photosynthesis is a promising source of combustible chemicals to be used for energy production including transportation fuels4 and could certainly produce all needed organic raw materials to substitute for petroleum in the current petrochemicals industry. It suffers from the disadvantage of being a very inefficient means of solar energy collection (a collection efficiency of only a fraction of a percent by photosynthesis is typical of most common plants). However, the overall energy conversion efficiency of several plants, such as sugarcane, is around 0.6%. Furthermore, some plants, such as Euphorbia lathyrus (gopher plant), a small bush growing wild in California, produce hydrocarbon emulsions directly. The fruit of the Philippine plant, Pittsosporum reiniferum, can be burned for illumination due to its high content of hydrocarbon terpenes, primarily a-pinene and myrcene. Conversion of agricultural plant residues to energy could be employed to provide much of the energy required for agricultural production. Indeed, until about 80 years ago, virtually all of the energy required in agriculture\u2014 hay and oats for horses, home-grown food for laborers, and wood for home heating\u2014originated from plant materials produced on the land. (An interesting exercise is to calculate the number of horses required to provide the energy used for transportation at the present time in the Los Angeles basin. It can be shown that such a large number of horses would fill the entire basin with manure at a rate of several feet per day.) Annual world production of biomass is estimated at 146 billion metric tons, mostly from uncontrolled plant growth. Many farm crops and trees can produce around 2 metric tons per acre per year of dry biomass, and some algae and grasses can produce significantly more. The heating value of this biomass is 5000\u20138000 Btu/lb about half of typical values for coal. However, biomass contains virtually no ash or sulfur, both problems with coal. Another sustainability advantage of biomass is that all of the carbon in it is taken from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so that biomass combustion does not add any net quantities of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Indeed, use of biomass to produce hydrogen-rich methane or elemental hydrogen along with sequestration of by-product carbon dioxide would result in an overall loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. As it has been throughout history, biomass is significant as heating fuel, and in some parts of the world is the fuel most widely used for cooking. Scavenging wood for cooking fuel has been a major contributor to deforestation in some areas. About 15% of Finland\u2019s energy needs are provided by wood and wood products (including black liquor by-product from pulp and paper manufacture), about one-third of which is from solid wood. Despite the charm of a wood fire and the sometimes pleasant odor of wood smoke, air pollution from wood-burning stoves and furnaces is a signifi cant problem in some areas. Currently, wood provides about 8% of world energy needs. This percentage could increase through the development of energy plantations consisting of trees grown solely for their energy content. Biomass could be used to replace much of the 100 million metric tons of petroleum and natural gas currently consumed in the manufacture of primary chemicals in the world each year. Among the sources of biomass that could be used for chemical production are grains and sugar crops (for ethanol manufacture), oilseeds, animal by-products, manure, and sewage (the last two for methane generation). The biggest potential source of chemicals is the lignocellulose making up the bulk of most plant material (see below). 19.15.1 ETHANOL FUEL A major option for converting photosynthetically produced biochemical energy to forms suitable for internal combustion engines is the production of ethanol, C2H6O, by the fermentation of sugars from biomass. Suitably designed internal combustion engines can burn pure ethanol or a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline called E85. More commonly, ethanol is blended in proportions of around 10% with gasoline to give gasohol, a fuel that can be used in existing internal combustion engines with little or no adjustment. Gasohol boosts octane rating and reduces emissions of carbon monoxide. From a resource viewpoint, because of its photosynthetic origin, alcohol may be considered a renewable resource rather than a depletable fossil fuel.", "Ethanol is most commonly produced biochemically by the fermentation of carbohydrates. Brazil, a country that produces copious amounts of fermentable sugar from sugarcane, has been a leader in the manufacture of ethanol for fuel uses, with about 16 billion liters produced in 2006. All motor fuels in Brazil contain at least 24% ethanol and some fuel is essentially pure ethanol. A significant fraction of the gasoline consumed in the United States is supplemented with ethanol. Although most of the ethanol that has been produced for fuel has been made from the fermentation of grain or sugar, there is legitimate concern that, considering the energy that goes into producing grain ethanol, there is no net energy gain. A potentially much more abundant and cheaper source of ethanol consists of biomass generated as a by-product of crop production including straw from wheat or rice production or cornstalks from growing corn. In the past, much rice straw from commercial production in the United States was simply burned to save the cost of cultivating it back into the soil. Straw cannot be fermented directly, but must be broken down to hexose and pentose sugars for fermentation. This has traditionally been done with acid treatment, which is expensive, although technologies exist for recycling acid. It is now generally agreed that production of ethanol from plant biomass by-products will require enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase enzyme to produce the required sugars. The Canadian Iogen Corporation has a means for obtaining fermentable sugars from wheat straw and other plant materials and has attempted to develop a cost-effective commercial process. 19.15.2 BIODIESEL FUEL Biodiesel fuel is a growing source of renewable liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Unlike fuel ethanol, which must be transported in corrosion-resistant truck tanker trailers or railroad tankers, biodiesel fuel is readily moved through existing pipelines. Rudolf Diesel developed the high-compression, compression-ignited diesel engine in the late 1800s and first operated the engine in Augsburg, Germany, in 1893. He demonstrated his invention at the World Fair in Paris in 1900, receiving the \u201cGrand Prix\u201d (highest prize) for his invention. Interestingly, the fuel used in this and other demonstrations of Diesel\u2019s engine was peanut oil, and vegetable oils were the main source of fuel for diesel engines during the first two decades of their use. Vegetable oils were eventually replaced by petroleum-based hydrocarbons. More recently, diesel fuels that are derivatives of the fatty acids in the oils have been synthesized from vegetable oil feed-stocks. Vegetable oils from soybeans and other biological sources are used to make biodiesel fuel as discussed below. Vegetable oils are fatty acid esters of glycerol, a three-carbon alcohol with 3-OH groups attached. To produce biodiesel fuel, the glycerol esters are hydrolyzed by strong base (NaOH) in the presence of methanol alcohol (HOCH3) and the fatty acids are converted to their methyl esters, the molecules composing biodiesel fuel: HO H H COCR HCOH O O (19.9) HCOCR+3HOCH3NaOH HCOH+3H3COCR+H2O O Fatty acid methyl H C O C R H C OH esters in biodiesel fuel H H Glycerol Glycerol ester In this reaction, R stands for a long hydrocarbon chain in one of a number of fatty acids including stearic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, and behenic acid. For example, in stearic acid, R is a straight chain with 17 carbon atoms, C17H35. Major oils that are used for biodiesel fuel production are rapeseed, sunfl ower, soybean, palm, coconut, and jatropha. Rapeseed, long grown for animal feed, is the largest source of oil for bio-diesel manufacture and is widely produced in Europe, whereas soybean oil predominates in the United States. Both of these oils offer the advantage of providing a protein-rich animal feed after the oil has been squeezed from the seed. Palm oil, and to a lesser extent, coconut oil (from coconut trees) and jatropha (from Jatropha curcus, planted for hedges) are attractive because they are from perennial plants that thrive in the tropics. (In late 2008, Air New Zealand flew a Boeing 747 aircraft on which one engine was fueled with 50% jatropha-derived fuel and 50% conventional jet fuel; the aircraft had three other engines in case the experiment failed.) By 2009, the explosive growth of palm oil tree plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia was resulting in high levels of rain forest destruction. An interesting possibility for biodiesel fuel production is algae that have an oil content exceeding 50%. Such algae can grow profusely in ponds fed with nutrient-rich effluent from wastewater treatment plants.", "Oil-producing algae have also been grown in the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere provided by power plant stack gases. By growing algae in treated wastewater within a carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere from power plants, nutrients can be removed from wastewater, thus reducing eutrophication in receiving waters, and some of the carbon dioxide can be removed from stack gas emissions. The potential productivity of algae for biomass fuel production is spectacular. Whereas soybean and palm oil sources typically produce, respectively, up to 200 and 2500 L/acre annually of biodiesel fuel, algae have the potential to yield as much as 40,000 L/acre/year of the fuel. Furthermore, with adequate supplies of water, algae can be grown on desert lands that are unsuitable for growing soil-based crops. One experimental system grows algae in water that circulates through transparent plastic tubes. Some algae thrive in saltwater, which can come from the sea or underground formations bearing brackish water. 19.15.3 UNREALIZED POTENTIAL OF LIGNOCELLULOSE FUELS Both grain- and sugar-based ethanol as well as vegetable oils used to make biodiesel fuel are not the best candidates for biomaterial fuels because they use only relatively small fractions of the plants consisting of the parts that have the most value for food, animal feed, and raw materials. A much more abundant source of fuel consists of the lignocellulose parts of plants, a material composed of large polymeric molecules with an approximate empirical formula of CH2O that composes the structural members of plants including tree wood, stalks, straw, corncobs, and leaves. The three major components of lignocellulose and their approximate empirical formulas are cellulose/starch, [C6(H2O)5)]n; hemicellulose, [C5(H2O)4)]n; and lignin, [C10(H12O)3)]n. Large amounts of crop by-product biomass are generated annually. Assuming conservatively that the amount of this material available in the United States is equal to the mass of corn grain produced, about 230 million tons of crop by-product biomass could be made available for fuel each year; the actual figure might be much higher. The amount of biomass that could be generated from dedicated trees and grass is very high, an estimated 2240 million tons per year in the United States alone. A major advantage of this source is that it comes from perennial plants that can be grown on erodable land, much of which has been taken from agricultural production as the result of government programs. One of the plants that is remarkably productive of biomass consists of hybrid poplars, from the genus Populis that includes cottonwoods and aspens. These trees may grow more than 2 m/year and will establish new growth from the stumps of harvested trees, retaining their root systems that prevent soil erosion. The grass most commonly considered for its biomass productivity is switchgrass. Native to North America, switchgrass is disease- and pest-resistant and requires little fertilizer. It tolerates both drought and flooding very well. Upland varieties of switchgrass grow up to 2 m tall in one growing season on well-drained soils. Lowland varieties can reach heights of 4 m and grow best on heavy soils in bottomlands. Improved varieties of switchgrass have been developed for animal forage and yield around 8 tons/acre of biomass each year. Average biomass yields of forests are only about half as high. Another high-yielding grass native to swampy regions, such as the Florida everglades, is sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), which gets its name from the saw-like serrations on its leaves. It is well adapted to cultivation in wet areas where other crops cannot be grown and has the additional advantage of providing good wildlife cover. There are numerous pathways by which biomass and biowastes (including sewage and animal wastes) can be converted to energy, fuels, and feedstocks. These are the following: \u2022 Direct combustion to produce heat and to raise steam to generate electricity \u2022 Fermentation to produce ethanol (from sugar) or methane \u2022 Pyrolysis to yield gaseous fuels (particularly methane), liquids (including hydrocarbons and oxygenated species), and solid carbon \u2022 Thermochemical gasification to produce CO, H2, CH4, by-product liquids, and solid carbon \u2022 Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons from CO and H2 derived from biomass \u2022 Hydrogenation of oxygenated liquids from biomass to produce hydrocarbons \u2022 Methyl esterification of oils to produce methyl ester biodiesel fuels Sustainable preparation of biofuels from biomass makes it desirable to recover nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium from the biomass during processing. Biomass can be used directly as a fuel with a heating value on a dry mass basis about half that of coal.", "It is extremely low in sulfur and ash and its mineral ash components do not contain toxic elements, such as the arsenic that occurs in some coals. The most direct way to use biomass fuel is direct combustion to produce heat. Biomass can be converted to other high-value fuels including hydrocarbons by gasification. One approach to biomass gasification begins with combustion of part of the biomass (represented by the formula {CH2O}) with pure molecular oxygen oxidant (to avoid diluting the product gas with N2 from air), {CH2O} + O2 \u00c6 CO2 + H2O + heat (19.10) yielding heat required for the rest of the gasification process. Under the oxygen-defi cient conditions through which gasification is carried out, part of the biomass is partially oxidized to combustible carbon monoxide, CO: {CH O} + 1O \u00c6 CO + HO + heat (19.11) 222 2 Part of the biomass is pyrolyzed by the heat produced by Reaction 19.10 {CH2O} + heat \u00c6 C + H2O (19.12) yielding hot carbon and combustible gaseous and liquid by-products. The hot carbon reacts with steam, C + H2O + heat \u00c6 CO + H2 (19.13) yielding a synthesis gas mixture of CO and H2. Biomass may also react as it is heated, {CH2O} + heat \u00c6 CO + H2 (19.14) yielding synthesis gas. The carbon monoxide in synthesis gas can be subjected to the water-gas shift reaction, CO + H2O \u00c6 CO2 + H2 (19.15) giving elemental H2 as the only gaseous product. The CO2 generated in Reactions 19.10 and 19.15 can be separated and sequestered, such as by pumping into underground petroleum formations to enable recovery of petroleum, thereby preventing the release of this greenhouse-warming gas to the atmosphere. Elemental hydrogen can be used as an end product of biomass gasification directly as a fuel in gas turbines and other heat engines or to generate electricity in fuel cells. Elemental hydrogen can be used to synthesize ammonia, NH3, an important industrial chemical and fertilizer. A mixture of CO and H2 can be reacted over a catalyst in a methanation reaction CO + 3H2 \u00c6 CH4 + H2O (19.16) to produce methane, which, made by this method, is called synthetic natural gas (SNG). With different proportions of hydrogen and CO reactants and a different catalyst, a mixture of CO and H2 can react according to the Fischer\u2013Tropsch reaction to yield a variety of hydrocarbons including gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel as shown by the reaction below for the synthesis of octane, one of the hydrocarbons in gasoline: 8CO + 17H2 \u00c6 C8H18 + 8H2O (19.17) A similar reaction can also be used to make ethanol and methanol, CH3OH, which can be used as a fuel, gasoline additive, and to produce H2 for fuel cells in vehicles. An interesting possibility for increasing the amount of hydrocarbon fuel that can be obtained from biomass is to use H2 and O2 produced by the electrolysis of water with electricity generated by wind power, 2H2O + electrical energy \u00c6 2H2(g) + O2(g) (19.18) to react with biomass for gasification. The pure elemental oxygen can be used to produce energy from biomass as shown by Reaction 19.10 without diluting the gas product with elemental nitrogen, N2, as would be the case with air oxidant, and enabling sequestration of the CO2 product. The elemental hydrogen generated by electrolysis of water can be reacted directly with biomass. Ideally, direct hydrogenation of biomass would produce predominantly hydrocarbons, such as methane generated by the following reaction: {CH2O} + 2H2 \u00c6 CH4 + H2O (19.19) More commonly, hydrogenation produces a mixture of many liquids, most of which contain oxygen in compounds such as ethers, alcohols, and ketones. For fuel use, these compounds must be further treated with hydrogen to remove oxygen and leave hydrocarbon liquids. Such a process as outlined above provides a means for using the energy originally generated by windpower to make a high-energy hydrocarbon fuel that can be used for transportation or other purposes. 19.15.4 BIOGAS A significant source of clean-burning methane can be obtained from the anoxic (oxygen-free) bacterial fermentation of biomass of a variety of kinds. Representing biomass as {CH2O}, the biochemical reaction is the following: 2{CH2O} \u00c6 CH4 + CO2 (19.20) This reaction has long been used in the anoxic digesters of sewage treatment plants to reduce the amount of degradable organic matter in excess sewage sludge. Such a well-balanced plant makes enough methane to provide for all its energy needs.", "Large livestock feeding operations may have digesters to produce methane from livestock manure and other biological wastes associated with the feeding operation. Another source of methane generated by anoxic fermentation is obtained by burying collector pipes in mounds of municipal solid wastes and collecting the off-gas. An outstanding example of \u201cgrass roots\u201d energy sustainability is provided by the widespread use of biogas generators in rural China, an area chronically short of fuel. The Chinese have built millions of anoxic digesters located just below the ground surface in which all kinds of biomass including animal wastes, human excrement, and vegetable and crop wastes are degraded in the absence of air to produce combustible methane gas. The digesters are usually located in proximity to dwellings and to sources of waste, including latrines and pigsties. Covered by a thin layer of soil, these facilities take advantage of solar heating to accelerate fermentation. In addition to producing fuel, anoxic digestion alleviates waste disposal and health problems through the destruction of pathogens in the waste by the fermentation process, which often takes place at a somewhat elevated temperature that kills most pathogenic organisms. An additional advantage is that the fertilizer value of the wastes is conserved so that residues from the digesters can be placed on soil to serve as fertilizer for crops without much concern over spreading pathogens. The contents of both nitrogen and phosphorus in the digester residues are much higher than in biomass that has been treated by mulching in an air environment. The gas from the Chinese biogas facilities is used largely for cooking and lamps. In larger installations, internal combustion engines have been adapted to run in part on biogas. In the case of gasoline engines, biogas is fed into carburetors through an adjustable feed valve and in the case of diesel engines, it is fed into the air/fuel intake manifold to supplement the minimal amount of diesel fuel injected into the combustion chamber to initiate combustion during engine operation. A major methane-generating system in the United States is overseen by Central Vermont Public Service in Vermont, utilizing manure from several large dairy farms. The largest dairy in this complex is the Pleasant Valley Farm where 1500 milking cows produce over 40 million pounds of milk a year. As a profitable by-product of this operation, anoxic fermentation for 3 weeks of manure from the cows produces methane used to generate 3.5 million kWh of electricity a year, enough to power 500 homes. The farm went from spending about $200/day for electricity to making about $1200/day from renewable electricity sales in 2008. The system cost about $2 million. As of late 2008, Central Vermont Public Service had five farms with a total of about 5000 cows in its \u201cCow Power\u201d renewable energy program. 19.16 HYDROGEN AS A MEANS TO STORE AND UTILIZE ENERGY Hydrogen gas, H2, is an ideal chemical fuel in some respects that may serve as a storage medium for solar energy. There are several ways to generate elemental hydrogen.5 As noted in the preceding section, solar-generated electricity can be used to electrolyze water: 2H2O + electrical energy \u00c6 2H2(g) + O2(g) (19.21) The hydrogen fuel product, and even elemental oxygen produced as an electrolysis by-product, can be piped some distance and the hydrogen burned without pollution, or it may be used in a fuel cell (Figure 19.7). This may, in fact, make possible a \u201chydrogen economy.\u201d Disadvantages of using hydrogen as a fuel include its low heating value per unit volume and the wide range of explosive mixtures it forms with air. Although not yet economical, photochemical processes can be used to split water to H2 and O2 that can be used to power fuel cells. Fuel-cell-powered vehicles are now practical in some applications and Honda began production of the first commercial fuel-cell automobile in 2008. One of the greatest barriers to their widespread adoption has been their inability to carry sufficient hydrogen for an acceptable range. Several solutions to this problem are now being investigated. One is the potentially problematic use of very cold liquid hydrogen as a fuel source. Another is the use of very high pressure containers composed of multilayer cylinders wrapped with carbon composite and filled with hydrogen at pressures up to 10,000 psi (about 670 \u00a5 atmospheric pressure!), reputed to contain sufficient hydrogen to propel an automobile up to 300 miles. Other systems use catalysts to break down liquid fuels, such as methanol or gasoline, to generate hydrogen for fuel cells.", "Although there has been much enthusiasm in some quarters for hydrogen fuel and predictions of a new hydrogen economy, some of the more enthusiastic arguments for hydrogen fuel may be too optimistic. The most important point is that, unlike fossil fuels, hydrogen is not a primary source of energy and has to be made by processes such as the electrolysis of water (Reaction 19.18) that use other sources of energy. Most of the 6 million tons of elemental hydrogen used in the United States each year is made from steam reforming of methane from natural gas: CH4 + H2O \u00c6 3H2 + CO (19.22) The carbon monoxide product can be reacted with steam as noted in the preceding section, CO + H2O \u00c6 CO2 + H2 (19.23) to produce additional H2 and the CO2 product of this reaction can be sequestered as discussed in Section 19.9. In principle, the process described above and the utilization of elemental hydrogen in fuel cells can provide a transport fuel that is pollution-free. However, methane gas is easier to store than elemental hydrogen and the modern internal combustion engine with associated emissions control equipment is virtually pollution-free. So the intermediate production of elemental hydrogen is unlikely to be the greenest approach. Production of elemental hydrogen by electrolysis of water using electricity from renewable sources, such as photovoltaics and windpower, is essentially nonpolluting, but it requires balancing the relatively inefficient electrolysis process against the value of the electricity that it consumes. 19.17 COMBINED POWER CYCLES Combined power cycles enable much more efficient utilization of combustible fuels by fi rst using the heat of combustion in a turbine coupled to an electrical generator, raising steam in a boiler Exhaust FIGURE 19.19 A combined power cycle in which combustible gas or oil is first used to fire a gas turbine connected to an electrical generator. The hot gases from this turbine are fed to a boiler to raise steam, which drives a steam turbine, also connected to a generator. The still hot exhaust steam from the steam turbine is used for process heat or conveyed to commercial or residential buildings for heating. The water condensed from the steam in this final application is returned to the power plant to generate more steam, thus conserving water and avoiding the necessity to treat more water to the high purity standards required by the boiler. with the hot exhaust gas from this turbine, using the steam to power a second turbine linked to a generator, and finally using the steam and hot water from the steam turbine for applications such as processing in the chemical industry, heating commercial buildings, or heating homes. A schematic diagram of a combined power cycle system is illustrated in Figure 19.19. The water condensed from the steam used for heating is pure and is recycled to the boiler, thus minimizing the amount of makeup boiler feedwater, which requires expensive treatment to make it suitable for use in boilers. The use of steam leaving a steam turbine for heating, a concept known as district heating, is commonly practiced in Europe (and many university campuses in the United States) and can save large amounts of fuel otherwise required for heating. Such a system as the one described is in keeping with the best practice of industrial ecology and should be employed whenever it is practical to do so. 19.18 A SYSTEM OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY FOR METHANE PRODUCTION Figure 19.20 illustrates an industrial ecosystem based on the production of methane fuel from renewable biomass and wind energy sources. Methane is the ideal clean-burning fuel for virtually all applications that currently use fossil fuels except for aircraft. With hybrid automobile technology, methane can be used as motor fuel giving an acceptable range between refueling. With previously untapped sources coming on line in the United States and a number of other countries, methane is relatively available and inexpensive. Pipeline systems are in place for its distribution. And, when methane sources are eventually exhausted, the gas can be synthesized from biomass and elemental hydrogen produced from the electrolysis of water. A system for producing methane renewably is outlined in Figure 19.20. Biomass is used as a source of fixed carbon that is reacted with elemental hydrogen made by electrolyzing water using renewable wind energy. Another source of methane in the system is anoxic fermentation of wastes, including sewage.", "Instead of municipal refuse in the community being disposed in landfill, it is fi rst subjected to anoxic fermentation to generate methane after which the residues are thermochemically gasified to provide feedstock for chemical synthesis. Other aspects of the system are largely self-explanatory from the fi gure. LITERATURE CITED 1. Leonenko, Y. and D.

What, then, is a hazardous waste? A simple definition of a hazardous waste is that it is a hazardous substance that has been discarded, abandoned, neglected, released or designated as a waste material, or one that may interact with other substances to be hazardous.", "The definition of hazardous waste is addressed in greater detail in Section 20.2, but in a simple sense it is a material that has been left where it should not be and that may cause harm to one if one encounters it. 20.1.1 HISTORY OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES Humans have always been exposed to hazardous substances, going back to prehistoric times when they inhaled noxious volcanic gases or succumbed to carbon monoxide from inadequately vented fires in cave dwellings sealed too well against Ice-Age cold. Slaves in Ancient Greece developed lung disease from weaving mineral asbestos fibers into cloth to make it more degradation resistant. Some archaeological and historical studies have concluded that lead wine containers were a leading cause of lead poisoning in the more affluent ruling class of the Roman Empire, leading to erratic behavior such as fixation on spectacular sporting events, chronic unmanageable budget defi cits, speculative purchases of overvalued stock, illicit trysts in governmental offices, and ill-conceived, overly ambitious military ventures in remote foreign lands. Alchemists who worked during the Middle Ages often suffered debilitating injuries and illnesses resulting from the hazards of their explosive and toxic chemicals. During the 1700s, runoff from mine spoils piles began to create serious contamination problems in Europe. As the production of dyes and other organic chemicals developed from the coal tar industry in Germany during the 1800s, pollution and poisoning from coal tar by-products were observed. By around 1900, the quantity and variety of chemical wastes produced each year were increasing sharply with the addition of wastes such as spent steel and iron pickling liquor, lead battery wastes, chromic wastes, petroleum refinery wastes, radium wastes, and fluoride wastes from aluminum ore refi ning. As the century progressed into the World War II era, the wastes and hazardous by-products of manufacturing increased markedly from sources such as chlorinated solvents manufacture, pesticides synthesis, polymers manufacture, plastics, paints, and wood preservatives. The Love Canal affair of the 1970s and 1980s brought hazardous wastes to public attention as a major political issue in the United States. Starting around 1940, this site in Niagara Falls, New York, had received about 20,000 metric tons of chemical wastes containing at least 80 different chemicals. By 1994, state and federal governments had spent well over $100 million to clean up the site and relocate residents. Other areas containing hazardous wastes that received attention included an industrial site in Woburn, Massachusetts, that had been contaminated by wastes from tanneries, glue-making factories, and chemical companies dating back to about 1850; the Stringfellow Acid Pits near Riverside, California; the Valley of the Drums in Kentucky; and Times Beach, Missouri, an entire town that was abandoned because of contamination by TCDD (dioxin). The problem of hazardous wastes is truly international in scope. As a result of the problem of dumping such wastes in developing countries, the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was held in Basel, Switzerland in 1989, and has since been signed by more than 100 countries. This treaty defines a long List A of hazardous wastes, a List B of nonhazardous wastes, and a List C of as yet unclassifi ed materials. An example of a material on List C is PVC-coated wire, which is harmless, itself, but may release dioxins or heavy metals when thermally treated. Actions subsequent to the Basel Convention have dealt with specific kinds of wastes. One of these consists of persistent organic pollutants (POP) addressed by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants of 2001. POP are organic compounds or mixtures including pesticides, industrial products, and manufacturing by-products that persist in the environment because of their resistance to physical, chemical, and biological processes. Those targeted for elimination in their production and use are aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), mirex, toxaphene, and PCBs. The production and use of DDT are to be restricted. Targeted for minimization and ultimate elimination are manufacturing by-product PCBs, dibenzo-p-dioxins, and dibenzofurans. Rapidly developing industrial economies normally have growing problems with hazardous wastes. During the 1990s and early 2000s, this was particularly true of the rapidly growing economies of highly populous China and India. By 2005, China was reported to be generating about 900 million metric tons of industrial solid wastes each year of which 10.6 million metric tons were classified as hazardous waste.1 20.1.2 LEGISLATION Governments in a number of nations have passed legislation to deal with hazardous substances and wastes.", "In the United States such legislation has included the following: \u2022 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) of 1976 \u2022 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 [amended and reauthorized by the Hazardous and Solid Wastes Amendments Act (HSWA) of 1984] \u2022 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 RCRA legislation charged the U.S. EPA with protecting human health and the environment from improper management and disposal of hazardous wastes by issuing and enforcing regulations pertaining to such wastes. RCRA requires that hazardous wastes and their characteristics be listed and controlled from the time of their origin until their proper disposal or destruction. Regulations pertaining to firms generating and transporting hazardous wastes require that they keep detailed records, including reports on their activities and manifests to ensure proper tracking of hazardous wastes through transportation systems. Approved containers and labels must be used, and wastes can only be delivered to facilities approved for treatment, storage, and disposal. In 2007, almost 47 million tons of RCRA-regulated wastes were reported from 16,349 generators in the United States. About 3000 facilities are involved in the treatment, storage, or disposal of RCRA wastes. CERCLA (Superfund) legislation deals with actual or potential releases of hazardous materials that have the potential to endanger people or the surrounding environment at uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites in the United States. The act requires responsible parties or the government to clean up waste sites. Among CERCLA\u2019s major purposes are the following: \u2022 Site identifi cation \u2022 Evaluation of danger from waste sites \u2022 Evaluation of damages to natural resources \u2022 Monitoring of release of hazardous substances from sites \u2022 Removal or cleanup of wastes by responsible parties or government CERCLA was extended for five years by the passage of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, legislation with greatly increased scope and additional funding. Actually longer than CERCLA, SARA encouraged the development of alternatives to land disposal that favor permanent solutions reducing volume, mobility, and toxicity of wastes; increased emphasis upon public health, research, training, and state and citizen involvement; and establishment of a new program for leaking underground (petroleum) storage tanks. After 1986, few new legislative initiatives dealing with hazardous wastes were forthcoming in the United States. During the earlier years of Superfund, it was funded by taxes levied on corporations that used, disposed of, or profited from toxic and hazardous chemicals. Since 1995, Congress has refused to renew these fees and a $3.8 billion surplus in the fund was gradually used up, running dry in 2003. Funding from general revenues and from fines levied against parties found responsible for improper waste disposal has kept the Superfund cleanup program going, but at a decreased rate. A total of $1.8 billion was spent on Superfund projects in the United States in 1999 and that figure dropped to $1.3 billion in 2007. Since 1980, the Superfund program has placed around 1600 waste sites on the National Priorities list designated for priority cleanup. Of these, somewhat more than 300 have been completely cleaned up and delisted and the majority of cleanup has been completed at somewhat more than 700 of the sites. Work was completed at a rate of about 75 sites per year during the 1990s, but has now dropped to about half that level. 20.2 CLASSIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND WASTES Many specific chemicals in widespread use are hazardous because of their chemical reactivities, fi re hazards, toxicities, and other properties. There are numerous kinds of hazardous substances, usually consisting of mixtures of specific chemicals. These include such things as explosives; fl ammable liquids; flammable solids, such as magnesium metal and sodium hydride; oxidizing materials; such as peroxides; corrosive materials, such as strong acids; etiologic agents that cause disease; and radioactive materials. 20.2.1 CHARACTERISTICS AND LISTED WASTES For regulatory and legal purposes in the United States, hazardous substances are listed specifi cally and are defined according to general characteristics.", "Under the authority of the RCRA, the U.S. EEPA defines hazardous substances in terms of the following characteristics: \u2022 Ignitability, characteristic of substances that are liquids, the vapors of which are likely to ignite in the presence of ignition sources; nonliquids that may catch fire from friction or contact with water and which burn vigorously or persistently; ignitable compressed gases; and oxidizers \u2022 Corrosivity, characteristic of substances that exhibit extremes of acidity or basicity or a tendency to corrode steel \u2022 Reactivity, characteristic of substances that have a tendency to undergo violent chemical change (e.g., explosives, pyrophoric materials, water-reactive substances, or cyanide- or sulfi de-bearing wastes) \u2022 Toxicity, defined in terms of a standard extraction procedure followed by chemical analysis for specifi c substances In addition to classification by characteristics, EPA designates more than 450 listed wastes, which are specific substances or classes of substances known to be hazardous. Each such substance is assigned an EPA hazardous waste number in the format of a letter followed by three numerals, where a different letter is assigned to substances from each of the four following lists: \u2022 F-type wastes from nonspecific sources: For example, quenching wastewater treatment sludges from metal heat treating operations where cyanides are used in the process (F012). \u2022 K-type wastes from specific sources: For example, heavy ends from the distillation of ethylene dichloride in ethylene dichloride production (K019). \u2022 P-type acute hazardous wastes: Wastes that have been found to be fatal to humans in low doses, or capable of causing or significantly contributing to an increase in serious irreversible or incapacitating reversible illness. These are mostly specific chemical species such as fluorine (P056) or 3-chloropropane nitrile (P027). \u2022 U-type miscellaneous hazardous wastes: These are predominantly specifi c compounds such as calcium chromate (U032) or phthalic anhydride (U190). Compared to RCRA, CERCLA gives a rather broad definition of hazardous substances that includes the following: \u2022 Any element, compound, mixture, solution, or substance, the release of which may substantially endanger public health, public welfare, or the environment \u2022 Any element, compound, mixture, solution, or substance in reportable quantities designated by CERCLA Section 102 \u2022 Certain substances or toxic pollutants designated by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. \u2022 Any hazardous air pollutant listed under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act \u2022 Any imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture that has been the subject of government action under Section 7 of the TSCA \u2022 With the exception of those suspended by Congress under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, any hazardous waste listed or having characteristics identified by RCRA \u00a7 3001 20.2.2 HAZARDOUS WASTES Three basic approaches to defining hazardous wastes are (1) a qualitative description by origin, type, and constituents; (2) classification by characteristics largely based upon testing procedures; and (3) by means of concentrations of specific hazardous substances. Wastes may be classifi ed by general type such as \u201cspent halogenated solvents\u201d or by industrial sources such as \u201cpickling liquor from steel manufacturing.\u201d 20.2.2.1 Hazardous Wastes and Air and Water Pollution Control Somewhat paradoxically, measures taken to reduce air and water pollution (Figure 20.1) have had a tendency to increase production of hazardous wastes. Most water treatment processes yield sludges Air pollutioncontrol Baghouse Water pollutioncontrol Chemical precipitation Cyclone separators Evaporation Electrostatic precipitators Reverse osmosis Liquid scrubbers Ion exchange Ionizing wetscrubbers Electrodialysis Fine particulate and wetsludge by-products Sludges and concentratedliquors FIGURE 20.1 Potential contributions of air and water pollution control measures to hazardous wastes production. Potentially hazardous waste substances or concentrated liquors that require stabilization and disposal. Air scrubbing processes likewise produce sludges. Baghouses and precipitators used to control air pollution all yield signifi cant quantities of solids, some of which are hazardous. 20.3 SOURCES OF WASTES Quantities of hazardous wastes produced each year are not known with certainty and depend upon the definitions used for such materials. In 1988, the figure for RCRA-regulated wastes in the United States was placed at 290 million tons. However, most of this material was water, with only a few million tons consisting of solids. Some high-water-content wastes are generated directly by processes that require large quantities of water in waste treatment, and other aqueous wastes are produced by mixing hazardous wastes with wastewater. Some wastes that might exhibit a degree of hazard are exempt from RCRA regulation by legislation.", "These exempt wastes include the following: \u2022 Fuel ash and scrubber sludge from power generation by utilities \u2022 Oil and gas drilling muds \u2022 By-product brine from petroleum production \u2022 Cement kiln dust \u2022 Waste and sludge from phosphate mining and benefi ciation \u2022 Mining wastes from uranium and other minerals \u2022 Household wastes 20.3.1 TYPES OF HAZARDOUS WASTES In terms of quantity by mass, the greatest quantities are those from categories designated by hazardous waste numbers preceded by F and K, respectively. The former are those from nonspecifi c sources and include the following examples: \u2022 F001\u2014the spent halogenated solvents used in degreasing: tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, methylene chloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, and the chlorinated fluorocarbons; and sludges from the recovery of these solvents in degreasing operations \u2022 F004\u2014the spent nonhalogenated solvents: cresols, cresylic acid, and nitro-benzene; and still bottoms from the recovery of these solvents \u2022 F007\u2014spent plating-bath solutions from electroplating operations \u2022 F010\u2014quenching-bath sludge from oil baths from metal heat treating operations The \u201cK-type\u201d hazardous wastes are those from specific sources produced by industries such as the manufacture of inorganic pigments, organic chemicals, pesticides, explosives, iron and steel, and nonferrous metals, and from processes such as petroleum refining or wood preservation; some examples are given below: \u2022 K001\u2014bottoms sediment sludge from the treatment of wastewaters from wood-preserving processes that use creosote and/or pentachlorophenol \u2022 K002\u2014wastewater treatment sludge from the production of chrome yellow and orange pigments \u2022 K020\u2014heavy ends (residue) from the distillation of vinyl chloride in vinyl chloride monomer production \u2022 K043\u20142,6-dichlorophenol waste from the production of 2,4-D \u2022 K047\u2014pink/red water from TNT operations \u2022 K049\u2014slop oil emulsion solids from the petroleum refi ning industry \u2022 K060\u2014ammonia lime still sludge from coking operations \u2022 K067\u2014electrolytic anode slimes/sludges from primary zinc production The remainder of wastes consists of reactive wastes, corrosive wastes, toxic wastes, ignitable wastes, and \u201cP\u201d wastes (discarded commercial chemical products, off-specification species, containers, and spill residues), \u201cU\u201d wastes, and unspecifi ed types. 20.3.2 HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATORS Several hundred thousand companies generate hazardous wastes in the United States, but most of these generators produce only small quantities. Hazardous waste generators are unevenly distributed geographically across the continental United States, with a relatively large number located in the industrialized upper Midwest, including the states of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Industry types of hazardous waste generators can be divided among the seven following major categories, each containing of the order of 10\u201320% of hazardous waste generators: chemicals and allied products manufacture, petroleum-related industries, fabricated metals, metal-related products, electrical equipment manufacture, \u201call other manufacturing,\u201d and nonmanufacturing and non-specified generators. About 10% of the generators produce more than 95% of all hazardous wastes. Whereas, as noted above, the number of hazardous waste generators is distributed relatively evenly among several major types of industries, 70\u201385% of the quantities of hazardous wastes are generated by the chemical and petroleum industries. Of the remainder, about three-fourth comes from metal-related industries and about one-fourth from all other industries. Household hazardous wastes are potential contaminants of municipal refuse that are supposed to be collected separately by municipalities. The problem of household hazardous wastes is complicated by the literally millions of individual household sources and the variability in the diligence with which citizens collect and segregate the wastes. A variety of substances occur in household hazardous wastes including insecticides, cleaners, oils, batteries, and fluorescent light bulbs (which contain small amounts of mercury). One of the most common components of these wastes consists of leftover paint. Household paint wastes have been the subject of a study in Denmark that found that most of the paint waste was composed of water-based paint.2 The content of heavy metals in the paint waste was found to be less than that of ordinary household waste and it was concluded that it would be safe to discard water-based paint with ordinary household refuse. 20.4 FLAMMABLE AND COMBUSTIBLE SUBSTANCES Most chemicals that are likely to burn accidentally are liquids. Liquids form vapors, which are usually more dense than air and thus tend to settle. The tendency of a liquid to ignite is measured by a test in which the liquid is heated and periodically exposed to a flame until the mixture of vapor and air ignites at the liquid\u2019s surface. The temperature at which ignition occurs under these conditions is called the fl ash point. With these definitions in mind, it is possible to divide ignitable materials into four major classes.", "A fl ammable solid is one that can ignite from friction or from heat remaining from its manufacture, or which may cause a serious hazard if ignited. Explosive materials are not included in this classifi cation. A fl ammable liquid is one having a fl ash point below 60.5\u221eC (141\u221eF). A combustible liquid has a flash point in excess of 60.5\u221eC, but below 93.3\u221eC (200\u221eF). Whereas gases are substances that exist entirely in the gaseous phase at 0\u221eC and 1 atm pressure, a flammable compressed gas meets specified criteria for lower flammability limit (LFL), flammability range (see below), and fl ame projection. In considering the ignition of vapors, two important concepts are those of flammability limit and flammability range. Values of the vapor/air ratio below which ignition cannot occur because of insufficient fuel define the LFL. Similarly, values of the vapor/air ratio above which ignition cannot occur because of insufficient air defi ne the upper flammability limit (UFL). The difference between upper and LFLs at a specified temperature is the fl ammability range. Table 20.1 gives some examples of these values for common liquid chemicals. The percentage of flammable substance for best combustion (most explosive mixture) is labeled \u201coptimal.\u201d In the case of acetone, for example, the optimal flammable mixture is 5.0% acetone. One of the more disastrous problems that can occur with flammable liquids is a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE). These are caused by rapid pressure buildup in closed containers of flammable liquids heated by an external source. The explosion occurs when the pressure buildup is sufficient to break the container walls. 20.4.1 COMBUSTION OF FINELY DIVIDED PARTICLES Finely divided particles of combustible materials are somewhat analogous to vapors with respect to flammability. One such example is a spray or mist of hydrocarbon liquid in which oxygen has the opportunity for intimate contact with the liquid particles causing the liquid to ignite at a temperature below its fl ash point. Dust explosions can occur with a large variety of solids that have been ground to a fi nely divided state. Many metal dusts, particularly those of magnesium and its alloys, zirconium, titanium, and aluminum, can burn explosively in air. In the case of aluminum, for example, the reaction is the following: 4Al(powder) + 3O2(from air) \u00c6 2Al2O3. (20.1) Coal dusts and grain dusts have caused many fatal fires and explosions in coal mines and grain elevators, respectively. Dusts of polymers such as cellulose acetate, polyethylene, and polystyrene can also be explosive. 20.4.2 OXIDIZERS Combustible substances are reducing agents that react with oxidizers (oxidizing agents or oxidants) to produce heat. Diatomic oxygen, O2, from air is the most common oxidizer. Many oxidizers are chemical compounds that contain oxygen in their formulas. The halogens (periodic table group 7A) and many of their compounds are oxidizers. Some examples of oxidizers are given in Table 20.2. An example of a reaction of an oxidizer is that of concentrated HNO3 with copper metal, which gives toxic NO2 gas as a product: 4HNO3 + Cu \u00c6 Cu(NO3)2 + 2H2O + 2NO2. (20.2) TABLE 20.2 Examples of Some Oxidizers Name Formula State of Matter Ammonium nitrate NH4NO3 Solid Ammonium perchlorate NH4ClO4 Solid Bromine Br2 Liquid Chlorine Cl2 Gas (stored as liquid) Fluorine F2 Gas Hydrogen peroxide H2O2 Solution in water Nitric acid HNO3 Concentrated solution Nitrous oxide N2O Gas (stored as liquid) Ozone O3 Gas Perchloric acid HClO4 Concentrated solution Potassium permanganate KMnO4 Solid Sodium dichromate Na2Cr2O7 Solid 20.4.3 SPONTANEOUS IGNITION Substances that catch fire spontaneously in air without an ignition source are called pyrophoric. These include several elements\u2014white phosphorus, the alkali metals (group 1A), and powdered forms of magnesium, calcium, cobalt, manganese, iron, zirconium, and aluminum. Also included are some organometallic compounds, such as ethyllithium (LiC2H5) and phenyllithium (LiC6H5), and some metal carbonyl compounds, such as iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5). Another major class of pyrophoric compounds consists of metal and metalloid hydrides, including lithium hydride, LiH; pentaborane, B5H9; and arsine, AsH3. Moisture in air is often a factor in spontaneous ignition. For example, lithium hydride undergoes the following reaction with water from moist air: LiH + H2O \u00c6 LiOH + H2 + heat (20.3) The heat generated from this reaction can be sufficient to ignite the hydride so that it burns in air: 2LiH + O2 \u00c6 Li2O + H2O (20.4) Some compounds with organometallic character are also pyrophoric.", "An example of such a compound is diethylethoxyaluminum: H5C2 OC2H5 Diethylethoxyaluminum H5C2 Al Many mixtures of oxidizers and oxidizable chemicals catch fire spontaneously and are called hypergolic mixtures. Nitric acid and phenol form such a mixture. 20.4.4 TOXIC PRODUCTS OF COMBUSTION Some of the greater dangers of fires are from toxic products and by-products of combustion. The most obvious of these is carbon monoxide, CO, which can cause serious illness or death because it forms carboxyhemoglobin with hemoglobin in the blood so that the blood no longer carries oxygen to body tissues. Toxic SO2, P4O10, and HCl are formed by the combustion of sulfur, phosphorus, and organochlorine compounds, respectively. A large number of noxious organic compounds such as aldehydes are generated as by-products of combustion. In addition to forming carbon monoxide, combustion under oxygen-deficient conditions produces PAHs consisting of fused ring structures. Some of these compounds, such as benzo[a]pyrene, below, are precarcinogens that are acted upon by enzymes in the body to yield cancer-producing metabolites. Benzo[a]pyrene 20.5 REACTIVE SUBSTANCES Reactive substances are those that tend to undergo rapid or violent reactions under certain conditions. Such substances include those that react violently or form potentially explosive mixtures with water. An example is sodium metal, which reacts strongly with water as follows: 2Na + 2H2O \u00c6 2NaOH + H2 + heat (20.5) This reaction usually generates enough heat to ignite the sodium and hydrogen. Explosives constitute another class of reactive substances. For regulatory purposes, substances are also classified as reactive that produce toxic gases or vapors when they react with water, acid, or base. Hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen cyanide is the most common toxic substances released in this manner. Heat and temperature are usually very important factors in reactivity. Many reactions require energy of activation to get them started. The rates of most reactions tend to increase sharply with increasing temperature and most chemical reactions give off heat. Therefore, once a reaction is started in a reactive mixture lacking an effective means of heat dissipation, the rate may increase exponentially with time, leading to an uncontrollable event. Other factors that may affect reaction rate include physical form of reactants (e.g., a finely divided metal powder that reacts explosively with oxygen, whereas a single mass of metal barely reacts), rate and degree of mixing of reactants, degree of dilution with nonreactive media (solvent), presence of a catalyst, and pressure. Some chemical compounds are self-reactive in that they contain oxidant and reductant in the same compound. Nitroglycerin, a strong explosive with the formula C3H5(ONO2)3, decomposes spontaneously to CO2, H2O, O2, and N2 with a rapid release of a very high amount of energy. Pure nitroglycerin has such a high inherent instability that only a slight blow may be sufficient to detonate it. TNT is also an explosive with a high degree of reactivity. However, it is inherently relatively stable in that some sort of detonating device is required to cause it to explode. 20.5.1 CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AND REACTIVITY As shown in Table 20.3, some chemical structures are associated with high reactivity. High reactivity in some organic compounds results from unsaturated bonds in the carbon skeleton, particularly where multiple bonds are adjacent (allenes, C=C=C) or separated by only one carbon\u2013carbon single bond (dienes, C=C-C=C). Some organic structures involving oxygen are very reactive. Examples are oxiranes, such as ethylene oxide, HC CH H Ethylene oxide H hydroperoxides (ROOH), and peroxides (ROOR\u00a2), where R and R\u00a2 stand for hydrocarbon moieties such as the methyl group, -CH3. Many organic compounds containing nitrogen along with carbon and hydrogen are very reactive. Included are triazenes containing a functionality with three nitrogen atoms (R-N=N-N), some azo compounds (R-N=N-R\u00a2), and some nitriles in which a nitrogen atom is triply bonded to a carbon atom: R-C\u222bN Nitrile Functional groups containing both oxygen and nitrogen tend to impart reactivity to an organic compound. Examples of such functional groups are alkyl nitrates (R-ONO2), alkyl nitrites (R-O-N=O), nitroso compounds (R-N=O), and nitro compounds (R-NO2). Many different classes of inorganic compounds are reactive. These include some of the halogen compounds of nitrogen (shock-sensitive nitrogen triiodide, NI3, is an outstanding example), compounds with metal\u2013nitrogen bonds (NaN3), halogen oxides (ClO2), and compounds with oxyanions of the halogens.", "An example of the last group of compounds is ammonium perchlorate, NH4ClO4, which was involved in a series of massive explosions that destroyed 8 million lb of the compound, injured 300 workers, caused $75 million in damage, and demolished a 40 million lb per year U.S. rocket fuel plant near Henderson, Nevada, in 1988. (By late 1989, a new $92 million plant for the manufacture of ammonium perchlorate had been constructed near Cedar City in a remote region of southwest Utah. Prudently, the buildings at the new plant were placed at large distances from each other!) TABLE 20.3 Examples of Reactive Compounds and Structures Organic Allenes Dienes Azo compounds Triazenes Hydroperoxides Peroxides Oxides Alkyl nitrates Nitro compounds Rings that are not 6-membered Heterogeneous rings Inorganic Nitrous oxide Nitrogen halides Interhalogen compounds Halogen oxides Halogen azides Hypohalites R OO R' CC C C CC C C NN C CN N N R OOH O CC R ONO2 R NO2 Y N2O NCl3, Nl3 BrCl ClO2 ClN3 NaClO Explosives such as nitroglycerin or TNT are single compounds containing both oxidizing and reducing functions in the same molecule. Such substances are commonly called redox compounds. Some redox compounds have even more oxygen than is needed for a complete reaction and are said to have a positive balance of oxygen, some have exactly the stoichiometric quantity of oxygen required (zero balance, maximum energy release), and others have a negative balance and require oxygen from outside sources to completely oxidize all components. TNT has a substantial negative balance of oxygen; ammonium dichromate [(NH4)2Cr2O7] has a zero balance, reacting with exact stoichiometry to H2O, N2, and Cr2O3; and treacherously explosive nitroglycerin has a positive balance as shown by the following reaction: 4C3H5N3O9 \u00c6 12CO2 + 10H2O + 6N2 + O2. (20.6) 20.6 CORROSIVE SUBSTANCES Corrosive substances are regarded as those that dissolve metals or cause oxidized material to form on the surface of metals\u2014rusted iron is a prime example\u2014and, more broadly, cause deterioration of materials, including living tissue, that they contact. Most corrosives belong to at least one of the four following chemical classes: (1) strong acids, (2) strong bases, (3) oxidants, and (4) dehydrating agents. Table 20.4 lists some of the major corrosive substances and their effects. TABLE 20.4 Examples of Some Corrosive Substances Name and Formula Properties and Effects Nitric acid, HNO3 Strong acid and strong oxidizer, corrodes metal, reacts with protein in tissue to form yellow xanthoproteic acid, lesions are slow to heal Hydrochloric acid, HCl Strong acid, corrodes metals, gives off HCl gas vapor, which can damage respiratory tract tissue Hydrofluoric acid, HF Corrodes metals, dissolves glass, causes particularly bad burns to fl esh Alkali metal hydroxides, NaOH and KOH Strong bases, corrode zinc, lead, and aluminum, substances that dissolve tissue and cause severe burns Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 Oxidizer, all but very dilute solutions cause severe burns Interhalogen compounds such as ClF, BrF3 Powerful corrosive irritants that acidify, oxidize, and dehydrate tissue Halogen oxides such as OF2, Cl2O, Cl2O7 Powerful corrosive irritants that acidify, oxidize, and dehydrate tissue Elemental fluorine, chlorine, bromine (F2, Cl2, Br2) Very corrosive to mucous membranes and moist tissue, strong irritants 20.6.1 SULFURIC ACID Sulfuric acid is a prime example of a corrosive substance. As well as being a strong acid, concentrated sulfuric acid is also a dehydrating agent and oxidant. The tremendous affinity of H2SO4 for water is illustrated by the heat generated when water and concentrated sulfuric acid are mixed. If this is done incorrectly by adding water to the acid, localized boiling and spattering can occur that result in personal injury. The major destructive effect of sulfuric acid on skin tissue is removal of water with accompanying release of heat. Sulfuric acid decomposes carbohydrates by removal of water. In contact with sugar, for example, concentrated sulfuric acid reacts to leave a charred mass. The reaction is H2SO4 (20.7) C12H22O11 11H2O (H2SO4) + 12C + heat. Some dehydration reactions of sulfuric acid can be very vigorous. For example, the reaction with perchloric acid produces unstable Cl2O7, and a violent explosion can result. Concentrated sulfuric acid produces dangerous or toxic products with a number of other substances, such as toxic carbon monoxide (CO) from reaction with oxalic acid, H2C2O4; toxic bromine and sulfur dioxide (Br2, SO2) from reaction with sodium bromide, NaBr; and toxic, unstable chlorine dioxide (ClO2) from reaction with sodium chlorate, NaClO3. Contact with sulfuric acid causes severe tissue destruction resulting in a severe burn that may be difficult to heal.", "Inhalation of sulfuric acid fumes or mists damages tissues in the upper respiratory tract and eyes. Long-term exposure to sulfuric acid fumes or mists has caused erosion of teeth! 20.7 TOXIC SUBSTANCES Toxicity is of the utmost concern in dealing with hazardous substances. This includes both longterm chronic effects from continual or periodic exposures to low levels of toxicants and acute effects from a single large exposure. Toxic substances are covered in greater detail in Chapters 23 and 24. 20.7.1 TOXICITY CHARACTERISTIC LEACHING PROCEDURE For regulatory and remediation purposes, a standard test is needed to measure the likelihood of toxic substances getting into the environment and causing harm to organisms. The U.S. EPA specifies a test called the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) designed to determine the toxicity hazard of wastes.3 The test was designed to estimate the availability to organisms of both inorganic and organic species in hazardous materials present as liquids, solids, or multiple phase mixtures and does not test for the direct toxic effects of wastes. Basically, the procedure consists of leaching a material with a solvent designed to mimic leachate generated in a municipal waste disposal site, followed by chemical analysis of the leachate. 20.8 PHYSICAL FORMS AND SEGREGATION OF WASTES Three major categories of wastes based upon their physical forms are organic materials, aqueous wastes, and sludges. These forms largely determine the course of action taken in treating and disposing of the wastes. The level of segregation, a concept illustrated in Figure 20.2, is very important in treating, storing, and disposing of different kinds of wastes. It is relatively easy to deal with wastes that are not mixed with other kinds of wastes, that is, those that are highly segregated. For example, spent hydrocarbon solvents can be used as fuel in boilers. However, if these solvents are mixed with spent organochlorine solvents, the production of contaminant hydrogen chloride during combustion may prevent fuel use and require disposal in special hazardous waste incinerators. Further mixing with inorganic sludges adds mineral matter and water. These impurities complicate the treatment processes required by producing mineral ash in incineration or lowering the heating value of the material incinerated because of the presence of water. Among the most difficult types of wastes to handle and treat are those with the least segregation, of which a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d would be \u201cdilute sludge consisting of mixed organic and inorganic wastes,\u201d as shown in Figure 20.2. An important factor related to segregation and mixing of wastes is the possibility of waste incompatibility. It is crucial that wastes not be mixed that will react together adversely or where one waste may exacerbate problems with another. For example, mixing acid with metal sulfide wastes can result in release of toxic H2S gas. Chelating agents such as EDTA mixed with heavy-metal salts can cause the heavy metals to become mobile as anionic chelates. Waste organic liquids Aqueous wastes Waste sludges Concentration of wastes is an important factor in their management. A waste that has been concentrated or, preferably, never diluted is generally much easier and more economical to handle than one that is dispersed in a large quantity of water or soil. Dealing with hazardous wastes is greatly facilitated when the original quantities of wastes are minimized and the wastes remain separated and concentrated insofar as possible. 20.9 ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY OF HAZARDOUS WASTES The properties of hazardous materials, their production, and what makes a hazardous substance a hazardous waste were discussed in preceding parts of this chapter. Hazardous materials normally cause problems when they enter the environment and have detrimental effects on organisms or other parts of the environment. Therefore, the present chapter deals with the environmental chemistry of hazardous materials. In discussing the environmental chemistry of hazardous materials, it is convenient to consider the following five aspects based upon the definition of environmental chemistry: \u2022 Origins \u2022 Transport \u2022 Reactions \u2022 Effects \u2022 Fates It is also useful to consider the five environmental spheres as defined and outlined in Chapter 1: \u2022 Anthrosphere \u2022 Geosphere \u2022 Hydrosphere \u2022 Atmosphere \u2022 Biosphere Hazardous materials almost always originate in the anthrosphere, are often discarded into the geosphere, and are frequently transported through the hydrosphere or the atmosphere. The greatest concern for their effects is usually on the biosphere, particularly human beings. Figure 20.3 summarizes these relationships. There are a variety of ways in which hazardous wastes get into the environment.", "Although now much more controlled by pollution prevention laws, hazardous substances have been deliberately added to the environment by humans. Wastewater containing a variety of toxic substances has Atmosphere FIGURE 20.3 Scheme of interactions of hazardous wastes in the environment. been discharged in large quantities into waterways. Hazardous gases and particulate matter have been discharged into the atmosphere through stacks from power plants, incinerators, and a variety of industrial operations. Hazardous wastes have been deliberately spread on soil or placed in landfills in the geosphere. Evaporation and wind erosion may move hazardous materials from wastes dumps into the atmosphere, or they may be leached from waste dumps into groundwater or surface waters. Underground storage tanks or pipelines have leaked a variety of materials into soil. Accidents, fires, and explosions may distribute dangerous materials into the environment. Another source of such materials consists of improperly operated waste treatment or storage facilities. 20.10 PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF HAZARDOUS WASTES Having considered the generation of hazardous wastes from the anthrosphere, the next thing to consider is their properties, which determine movement and other kinds of behaviors. These properties can be generally divided into physical and chemical properties. The behavior of waste substances in the atmosphere is largely determined by their volatilities. In addition, their solubilities in water determine the degree to which they are likely to be removed with precipitation. Water solubility is the most important physical property in the hydrosphere. The movement of substances through the action of water in the geosphere is largely determined by the degree of sorption to soil, mineral strata, and sediments. Volatility is a function of the vapor pressure of a compound. Vapor pressures at a particular temperature can vary over many orders of magnitude. Of common organic liquids, diethyl ether has one of the highest vapor pressures, whereas those of PCBs are very low. When a volatile liquid is present in soil or in water, its water solubility also determines how well it evaporates. For example, although methanol boils at a lower temperature than benzene, the much lower solubility of benzene in water means that it has the greater tendency to go from the hydrosphere or geosphere into the atmosphere. The environmental movement, effects, and fates of hazardous waste compounds are strongly related to their chemical properties. For example, a toxic heavy-metal cationic species, such as Pb2+ ion, may be strongly held by negatively charged soil solids. If the lead is chelated by the chelating EDTA anion, represented Y 4-, it becomes much more mobile as PbY2-, an anionic form. Chelation of cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) with NTA anion (Section 3.14) makes the metal much more mobile in mineral strata. Oxidation state can be very important in the movement of hazardous substances. The reduced states of iron and manganese, Fe 2+ and Mn 2+, respectively, are water soluble and relatively mobile in the hydrosphere and geosphere. However, in their common oxidized states, Fe(III) and Mn(IV), these elements are present as insoluble Fe2O3 . xH2O and MnO2, which have virtually no tendency to move. Furthermore, these iron and manganese oxides will sequester heavy-metal ions, such as Pb 2+ and Cd 2+, preventing their movement in the soluble form. The major properties of hazardous substances and their surroundings that determine the environmental transport of such substances are the following: \u2022 Physical properties of the substances, including vapor pressure and solubility \u2022 Physical properties of the surrounding matrix \u2022 Physical conditions to which wastes are subjected. Higher temperatures and erosive wind conditions enable volatile substances to move more readily \u2022 Chemical and biochemical properties of wastes. Substances that are less chemically reactive and less biodegradable will tend to move farther before breaking down 20.11 TRANSPORT, EFFECTS, AND FATES OF HAZARDOUS WASTES The transport of hazardous wastes is largely a function of their physical properties, the physical properties of their surrounding matrix, the physical conditions to which they are subjected, and chemical factors. Highly volatile wastes are obviously more likely to be transported through the atmosphere and more soluble ones to be carried by water. Wastes will move farther faster in porous, sandy formations than in denser soils. Volatile wastes are more mobile under hot, windy conditions, and soluble ones during periods of heavy rainfall. Wastes that are more chemically and biochemically reactive will not move so far as less reactive wastes before breaking down.", "20.11.1 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF WASTES The major physical properties of wastes that determine their amenability to transport are volatility, solubility, and the degree to which they are sorbed to solids, including soil and sediments. The distribution of hazardous waste compounds between the atmosphere and the geosphere or hydrosphere is largely a function of compound volatility. Usually, in the hydrosphere, and often in soil, hazardous waste compounds are dissolved in water; therefore, the tendency of water to hold the compound is a factor in its mobility. For example, although ethyl alcohol has a higher vapor pressure and lower boiling temperature (77.8\u221eC) than toluene (110.6\u221eC), vapor of the latter compound is more readily evolved from soil because of its limited solubility in water compared to ethanol, which is totally miscible with water. 20.11.2 CHEMICAL FACTORS As an illustration of chemical factors involved in transport of wastes, consider cationic inorganic species consisting of common metal ions. These inorganic species can be divided into three groups based upon their retention by clay minerals. Elements that tend to be highly retained by clay include cadmium, mercury, lead, and zinc. Potassium, magnesium, iron, silicon, and NH4 + ions are moderately retained by clay, whereas sodium, chloride, calcium, manganese, and boron ions are poorly retained. The retention of the last three elements is probably biased in that they are leached from clay, so that negative retention (elution) is often observed. It should be noted, however, that the retention of iron and manganese is a strong function of oxidation state in that the reduced forms of Mn and Fe are relatively poorly retained, whereas the oxidized forms of Fe2O3 .xH2O and MnO2 are very insoluble and stay on soil as solids. 20.11.3 EFFECTS OF HAZARDOUS WASTES The effects of hazardous wastes in the environment may be divided among effects on organisms, effects on materials, and effects on the environment. These are addressed briefly here and in greater detail in later sections. The ultimate concern with wastes has to do with their toxic effects on animals, plants, and microbes. Virtually all hazardous waste substances are poisonous to a degree, some extremely so. The toxicity of a waste is a function of many factors, including the chemical nature of the waste, the matrix in which it is contained, circumstances of exposure, the species exposed, manner of exposure, degree of exposure, and time of exposure. The toxicities of hazardous wastes are discussed in more detail in Chapters 23 and 24. As defi ned in Section 20.6, many hazardous wastes are corrosive to materials, usually because of extremes of pH or because of dissolved salt content. Oxidant wastes can cause combustible substances to burn uncontrollably. Highly reactive wastes can explode, causing damage to materials and structures. Contamination by wastes, such as by toxic pesticides in grain, can result in substances becoming unfit for use. In addition to their toxic effects in the biosphere, hazardous wastes can damage air, water, and soil. Wastes that get into air can cause deterioration of air quality, either directly or by the formation of secondary pollutants. Hazardous waste compounds dissolved in, suspended in, or floating as surface films on the surface of water can render it unfit for use and for sustenance of aquatic organisms. Soil exposed to hazardous wastes can be severely damaged by alteration of its physical and chemical properties and ability to support plants. For example, soil exposed to concentrated brines from petroleum production may become unable to support plant growth so that the soil becomes extremely susceptible to erosion. 20.11.4 FATES OF HAZARDOUS WASTES The fates of hazardous waste substances are addressed in more detail in subsequent sections. As with all environmental pollutants, such substances eventually reach a state of physical and chemical stability, although that may take many centuries to occur. In some cases, the fate of a hazardous waste material is a simple function of its physical properties and surroundings. The fate of a hazardous waste substance in water is a function of the substance\u2019s solubility, density, biodegradability, and chemical reactivity. Dense, water-immiscible liquids may simply sink to the bottoms of bodies of water or aquifers and accumulate there as \u201cblobs\u201d of liquid. Biodegradable substances are broken down by bacteria, a process for which the availability of oxygen is an important variable. Substances that readily undergo bioaccumulation are taken up by organisms, exchangeable cationic materials become bound to sediments, and organophilic materials may be sorbed by organic matter in sediments.", "The fates of hazardous waste substances in the atmosphere are often determined by photochemical reactions. Ultimately, such substances may be converted to nonvolatile, insoluble matter and precipitate from the atmosphere onto soil or plants. 20.12 HAZARDOUS WASTES AND THE ANTHROSPHERE As the part of the environment where humans process substances, the anthrosphere is the source of most hazardous wastes. These materials may come from manufacturing, transportation activities, agriculture, and any one of a number of activities in the anthrosphere. Hazardous wastes may be in any physical form and may include liquids, such as spent halogenated solvents used in degreasing parts; semisolid sludges, such as those generated from the gravitation separation of oil/ water/solids mixtures in petroleum refi ning; and solids, such as baghouse dusts from the production of pesticides. Releases of hazardous wastes from the anthrosphere commonly occur through incidents such as spills of liquids, accidental discharge of gases or vapors, fires, and explosions. RCRA regulations designed to minimize such accidental releases from the anthrosphere and to deal with them when they occur are contained in 40 CFR 265.31 (Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 265.31). Under these regulations, hazardous waste generators are required to have specifi ed equipment, trained personnel, and procedures that protect human health in the event of a release, and that facilitate remediation if a release occurs. An effective means of communication for summoning help and giving emergency instruction must be available. Also required are fi refi ghting capabilities including fire extinguishers and adequate water. To deal with spills, a facility is required to have on hand absorbents, such as granular vermiculite clay, or absorbents in the form of pillows or pads. Neutralizing agents for corrosive substances that may be used should be available as well. As noted above, hazardous wastes originate in the anthrosphere. However, to a large extent, they move, have effects, and end up in the anthrosphere as well. Large quantities of hazardous substances are moved by truck, rail, ship, and pipeline. Spills and releases from such movement, ranging from minor leaks from small containers to catastrophic releases of petroleum from wrecked tanker ships, are a common occurrence. Much effort in the area of environmental protection can be profi tably devoted to minimizing and increasing the safety of the transport of hazardous substances through the anthrosphere. In the United States, the transportation of hazardous substances is regulated through the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). One of the ways in which this is done is through the manifest system of documentation designed to accomplish the following goals: \u2022 Acts as a tracking device to establish responsibility for the generation, movement, treatment, and disposal of the waste. \u2022 By requiring the manifest to accompany the waste, such as during truck transport, it provides information regarding appropriate actions to take during emergencies such as collisions, spills, fires, or explosions. \u2022 Acts as the basic documentation for recordkeeping and reporting. Many of the adverse effects of hazardous substances occur in the anthrosphere. One of the main examples of such effects occurs as corrosion of materials that are strongly acidic or basic or that otherwise attack materials. Fire and explosion of hazardous materials can cause severe damage to anthrospheric infrastructure. The fate of hazardous materials is often in the anthrosphere. One of the main examples of a material dispersed in the anthrosphere consists of lead-based anticorrosive paints that have been spread on steel structural members. 20.13 HAZARDOUS WASTES IN THE GEOSPHERE The sources, transports, interactions, and fates of contaminant hazardous wastes in the geosphere involve a complex scheme, some aspects of which are illustrated in Figure 20.4. As illustrated in the figure, there are numerous vectors by which hazardous wastes can get into groundwater. Leachate from a landfill can move as a waste plume carried along by groundwater, in severe cases, draining into a stream or into an aquifer where it may contaminate well water. Sewers and pipelines may leak hazardous substances into the geosphere. Such substances seep from waste lagoons into geological strata, eventually contaminating groundwater. Wastes leaching from sites where they have been spread on land for disposal or as a means of treatment can contaminate the geosphere and groundwater. In some cases, wastes are pumped into deep wells as a means of disposal. The movement of hazardous waste constituents in the geosphere is largely by the action of fl owing water in a waste plume as shown in Figure 20.4. The speed and degree of waste fl ow depend upon numerous factors.", "Hydrologic factors such as water gradient and permeability of the solid formations through which the waste plume moves are important. The rate of fl ow is usually rather slow, typically several centimeters per day. An important aspect of the movement of wastes through the geosphere is attenuation by the mineral strata. This occurs because waste compounds are sorbed Land Land\ufb01ll Stream spreading to solids by various mechanisms. A measure of the attenuation can be expressed by a distribution coeffi cient, Kd, Cs Kd = (20.8) Cw where Cs and Cw are the equilibrium concentrations of the constituent on solids and in solution, respectively. This relationship assumes relatively ideal behavior of the hazardous substance that is partitioned between water and solids (the sorbate). A more empirical expression is based on the Freundlich equation: Cs = KFCeq1/n (20.9) where KF and 1/n are empirical constants. Several important properties of the solid determine the degree of sorption. One obvious factor is surface area. The chemical nature of the surface is also important. Among the important chemical factors are presence of sorptive clays, hydrous metal oxides, and humus (particularly important for the sorption of organic substances). In general, sorption of hazardous waste solutes is higher above the water table in the unsaturated zone of soil. This region tends to have a higher surface area and favor aerobic biodegradation processes. The chemical nature of the leachate is important in sorptive processes of hazardous substances in the geosphere. Organic solvents or detergents in leachates will solubilize organic materials, preventing their retention by solids. Acidic leachates tend to dissolve metal oxides: M(OH)2(s) + 2H+ \u00c6 M2+ + 2H2O (20.10) thus preventing sorption of metals in insoluble forms. This is a reason that leachates from municipal landfills, which contain weak organic acids, are particularly prone to transport metals. Solubilization by acids is particularly important in the movement of heavy-metal ions. Heavy metals are among the most dangerous hazardous waste constituents that are transported through the geosphere. Many factors affect their movement and attenuation. The temperature, pH, and reducing nature (as expressed by the negative log of the electron activity, pE) of the solvent medium are important. The nature of the solids, especially the inorganic and organic chemical functional groups on the surface, the CEC, and the surface area of the solids largely determine the attenuation of heavy-metal ions. In addition to being sorbed and undergoing ion exchange with geospheric solids, heavy metals may undergo oxidation\u2013reduction processes, precipitate as slightly soluble solids (especially sulfides), and in some cases, such as occurs with mercury, undergo microbial methylation reactions that produce mobile organometallic species. The importance of chelating agents interacting with metals and increasing their mobilities has been illustrated by the effects of chelating EDTA on the mobility of radioactive heavy metals, especially 60Co. The EDTA and other chelating agents, such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), were used to dissolve metals in the decontamination of radioactive facilities and were codisposed with radioactive materials at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Tennessee) during the period 1951\u20131965. Unexpectedly high rates of radioactive metal - mobility were observed, which was attributed to the formation of anionic species such as 60CoT (where T3- is the chelating NTA anion). Whereas unchelated cationic metal species are strongly retained in soil by precipitation reactions and cation exchange processes Co2+ + 2OH-\u00c6 Co(OH)2(s) (9.10) 2Soil}-H+ + Co2+ \u00c6 (Soil}-)2Co2+ + 2H+ (9.11) anion bonding processes are very weak, so that the chelated anionic metal species are not strongly bound. Naturally occurring humic acid chelating agents may also be involved in the subsurface movement of radioactive metals. It is now generally accepted that poorly biodegradable, strong chelating agents, of which EDTA is the prime example, will facilitate transport of metal radionuclides, whereas oxalate and citrate will not do so because they form relatively weak complexes and are readily biodegraded. Biodegradation of chelating agents tends to be a slow process under subsurface conditions. Soil can be severely damaged by hazardous waste substances. Such materials may alter the physical and chemical properties of soil and thus its ability to support plants. Some of the more catastrophic incidents in which soil has been damaged by exposure to hazardous materials have arisen from soil contamination from SO2 emitted from copper or lead smelters, or from brines from petroleum production. Both of these contaminants stop the growth of plants and, without the binding effects of viable plant root systems, topsoil is rapidly lost by erosion.", "20.14 HAZARDOUS WASTES IN THE HYDROSPHERE Hazardous waste substances may enter the hydrosphere as leachate from waste landfi lls, drainage from waste ponds, seepage from sewer lines, or runoff from soil. Deliberate release into waterways also occurs, and is a particular problem in countries with lax environmental enforcement. There are, therefore, numerous ways by which hazardous materials may enter the hydrosphere. For the most part, the hydrosphere is a dynamic, moving system, so that it provides perhaps the most important variety of pathways for moving hazardous waste species in the environment. Once in the hydrosphere, hazardous waste species can undergo a number of processes by which they are degraded, retained, and transformed. These include the common chemical processes of precipitation\u2013 dissolution, acid\u2013base reactions, hydrolysis, and oxidation\u2013reduction reactions. Also included are a wide variety of biochemical processes which, in most cases, reduce hazards, but in some cases, such as the biomethylation of mercury, greatly increase the risks posed by hazardous wastes. The unique properties of water have a strong influence on the environmental chemistry of hazardous wastes in the hydrosphere. Aquatic systems are subject to constant change. Water moves with groundwater fl ow, stream fl ow, and convection currents. Bodies of water become stratifi ed so that low-oxygen reducing conditions may prevail in the bottom regions of a body of water and there is a constant interaction of the hydrosphere with the other environmental spheres. There is a continuing exchange of materials between water and the other environmental spheres. Organisms in water may have a strong influence on even poorly biodegradable hazardous waste species through bioaccumulation mechanisms. Figure 20.5 shows some of the pertinent aspects of hazardous waste materials in bodies of water, with emphasis upon the strong role played by sediments. An interesting kind of hazardous waste Dissolved hazardous organics and inorganics Deep unstirred sediments substances in sediment FIGURE 20.5 Aspects of hazardous wastes in surface water in the hydrosphere. The deep unstirred sediments are anaerobic and the site of hydrolysis reactions and reductive processes that may act on hazardous waste constituents sorbed to the sediment. material that may accumulate in sediments consists of dense, water-immiscible liquids that may sink to the bottom of bodies of water or aquifers and remain there as \u201cblobs\u201d of liquid. Hundreds of tons of PCB wastes have accumulated in sediments in the Hudson River in New York State and are the subject of a heated debate regarding how to remediate the problem. Hazardous waste species undergo a number of physical, chemical, and biochemical processes in the hydrosphere, which strongly influence their effects and fates. The major ones of these are listed below: \u2022 Hydrolysis reactions are those in which a molecule is cleaved with addition of a molecule of H2O. An example of a hydrolysis reaction is the hydrolysis of dibutyl phthalate, Hazardous Waste Number U069: \u2022 Precipitation reactions, such as the formation of insoluble lead sulfide from soluble lead(II) ion in the anaerobic regions of a body of water: Pb2+ + HS-\u00c6 PbS(s) + H+ An important part of the precipitation process is normally aggregation of the colloidal particles fi rst formed to produce a cohesive mass. Precipitates are often relatively complicated species, such as the basic salt of lead carbonate, 2PbCO3 . Pb(OH)2. Heavy metals, a common ingredient of hazardous waste species precipitated in the hydrosphere, tend to form hydroxides, carbonates, and sulfates with the OH-, HCO3 -, and SO42- ions that commonly are present in water, and sulfides are likely to be formed in bottom regions of bodies of water where sulfide is generated by anaerobic bacteria. Heavy metals are often coprecipitated as a minor constituent of some other compound, or are sorbed by the surface of another solid. \u2022 Oxidation\u2013reduction reactions commonly occur with hazardous waste materials in the hydrosphere, generally mediated by microorganisms. An example of such a process is the oxidation of ammonia to toxic nitrite ion mediated by Nitrosomonas bacteria: NH3 + 23 O2 \u00c6 H++ NO2 -(s) + H2O \u2022 Biochemical processes, which often involve hydrolysis and oxidation\u2013reduction reactions. Organic acids and chelating agents, such as citrate, produced by bacterial action may solubilize heavy-metal ions. Bacteria also produce methylated forms of metals, particularly mercury and arsenic. \u2022 Photolysis reactions and miscellaneous chemical phenomena. Photolysis of hazardous waste compounds in the hydrosphere commonly occurs on surface films exposed to sunlight on the top of water. Hazardous waste compounds have a number of effects on the hydrosphere.", "Perhaps the most serious of these is the contamination of groundwater, which, in some cases, can be almost irreversible. Waste compounds accumulate in sediments, such as river or estuary sediments.4 Hazardous waste compounds dissolved in, suspended in, or floating as surface films on the surface of water can render it unfit for use and for sustenance of aquatic organisms. Many factors determine the fate of a hazardous waste substance in water. Among these are the substance\u2019s solubility, density, biodegradability, and chemical reactivity. As discussed above and in Section 20.16, biodegradation largely determines the fates of hazardous waste substances in the hydrosphere. In addition to biodegradation, some substances are concentrated in organisms by bioaccumulation processes and may become deposited in sediments as a result. Organophilic materials may be sorbed by organic matter in sediments. Cation-exchanging sediments have the ability to bind cationic species, including cationic metal ions and organics that form cations. 20.15 HAZARDOUS WASTES IN THE ATMOSPHERE Hazardous waste chemicals can enter the atmosphere by evaporation from hazardous waste sites, by wind erosion, or by direct release. Hazardous waste chemicals usually are not evolved in large enough quantities to produce secondary air pollutants, such as photochemical smog, formed by reactions of air pollutants in the atmosphere. Therefore, species from hazardous waste sources are usually of most concern in the atmosphere as primary pollutants emitted in localized areas at a hazardous waste site. Plausible examples of primary air pollutant hazardous waste chemicals include corrosive acid gases, particularly HCl; toxic organic vapors, such as vinyl chloride (U043); and toxic inorganic gases, such as HCN potentially released by the accidental mixing of waste cyanides with strong acids: H2SO4 + 2NaCN \u00c6 Na2SO4 + 2HCN(g) (20.11) Primary air pollutants such as these are almost always of concern only adjacent to the site or to workers involved in site remediation. One such substance that has been responsible for fatal poisonings at hazardous waste sites, usually tanks that are undergoing cleanup or demolition, is highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, H2S. An important characteristic of a hazardous waste material that enters the atmosphere is its pollution potential. This refers to the degree of environmental threat posed by the substance acting as a primary pollutant or to its potential to cause harm from secondary pollutants. Another characteristic of a hazardous waste material that determines its threat to the atmosphere is its residence time, which can be expressed by an estimated atmospheric half-life, t1/2. Among the factors that go into estimating atmospheric half-lives are water solubilities, rainfall levels, and atmospheric mixing rates. Hazardous waste compounds in the atmosphere that have significant water solubilities are commonly removed from the atmosphere by dissolution in water. The water may be in the form of very small cloud or fog particles or it may be present as rain droplets. Some hazardous waste species in the atmosphere are removed by adsorption onto aerosol particles. Typically, the adsorption process is rapid so that the lifetime of the species is that of the aerosol particles (typically a few days). Adsorption onto solid particles is the most common removal mechanism for highly nonvolatile constituents such as benzo[a]pyrene. Dry deposition is the name given to the process by which hazardous waste species are removed from the atmosphere by impingement onto soil, water, or plants on the earth\u2019s surface. These rates are dependent upon the type of substance, the nature of the surface that they contact, and weather conditions. A significant number of hazardous waste substances leave the atmosphere much more rapidly than predicted by dissolution, adsorption onto particles, and dry deposition, meaning that chemical processes must be involved. The most important of these are photochemical reactions, commonly involving hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211. Other reactive atmospheric species that may act to remove hazardous waste compounds are ozone (O3), atomic oxygen (O), peroxyl radicals (HOO\u2211), alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO\u2211), and NO3. Although its concentration in the troposphere is relatively low, HO\u2211 is so reactive that it tends to predominate in the chemical processes that remove hazardous waste species from air. Hydroxyl radical undergoes abstraction reactions that remove H atoms from organic compounds: R-H + HO\u2211\u00c6 R\u2211+ H2O (20.12) and may react with those containing unsaturated bonds by addition as illustrated by the following reaction: R RH H . C C +HO HC. COH (20.13) HH H . The free radical products are very reactive.", "They react further to form oxygenated species, such as aldehydes, ketones, and dehalogenated organics, eventually leading to the formation of particles or water-soluble materials that are readily scavenged from the atmosphere. Direct photodissociation of hazardous waste compounds in the atmosphere may occur by the action of the shorter wavelength light that reaches to the troposphere and is absorbed by a molecule with a light-absorbing group called a chromophore: R-X + hn\u00c6 R\u2211+ X\u2211 (20.14) Among the factors involved in assessing the effectiveness of direct absorption of light to remove species from the atmosphere are light intensity, quantum yields (chemical reactions per quantum absorbed), and atmospheric mixing. The requirement of a suitable chromophore limits direct photolysis as a removal mechanism for most compounds other than conjugated alkenes, carbonyl compounds, some halides, and some nitrogen compounds, particularly nitro compounds, all of which commonly occur in hazardous wastes. 20.16 HAZARDOUS WASTES IN THE BIOSPHERE Microorganisms, bacteria, fungi, and, to a certain extent, protozoa may act metabolically on hazardous wastes substances in the environment. Therefore, the ecotoxicology of hazardous wastes, that is, their toxic effects as they influence organisms in ecosystems, is very important. Most of these substances are anthropogenic (made by human activities), and most are classifi ed as xenobiotic molecules that are foreign to living systems. Although by their nature xenobiotic compounds are degradation resistant, almost all classes of them\u2014nonhalogenated alkanes, halogenated alkanes (trichloroethane, dichloromethane), nonhalogenated aryl compounds (benzene, naphthalene, and benzo[a]pyrene), halogenated aryl compounds (HCB, pentachlorophenol), phenols (phenol, cresols), PCBs, phthalate esters, and pesticides (chlordane, parathion)\u2014can be at least partially degraded by various microorganisms. Bioaccumulation occurs in which wastes are concentrated in the tissue of organisms. It is an important mechanism by which wastes enter food chains. Biodegradation occurs when wastes are converted by biological processes to generally simpler molecules; the complete conversion to simple - inorganic species, such as CO2, NH3, SO42-, and H2PO4 /HPO42-, is called mineralization. The production of a less toxic product by biochemical processes is called detoxifi cation. An example is the bioconversion of highly toxic organophosphate paraoxon insecticide to p-nitrophenol, which is only about l/200 as toxic: Other + (20.15) products OH 20.16.1 MICROBIAL METABOLISM IN WASTE DEGRADATION Two major divisions of biochemical metabolism that operate on hazardous waste species are oxic (aerobic) processes that use molecular O2 as an oxygen source and anoxic (anaerobic) processes, which make use of another oxidant such as sulfate, SO42-, which is reduced to H2S. (This has the benefit of precipitating insoluble metal sulfides in the presence of hazardous waste heavy metals.) Because molecular oxygen does not penetrate to such depths, anaerobic processes predominate in the deep sediments as shown in Figure 20.5. For the most part, anthropogenic compounds resist biodegradation much more strongly than do naturally occurring compounds. Given the nature of xenobiotic substances, there are very few enzyme systems in microorganisms that act specifi cally on these substances, especially in making an initial attack on the molecule. Therefore, most xenobiotic compounds are acted upon by a process called cometabolism, which occurs concurrently with normal metabolic processes. An interesting example of cometabolism is provided by the white rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which has been promoted for the treatment of hazardous organochlorides such as PCBs, DDT, and chlorodioxins. This fungus uses dead wood as a carbon source and has an enzyme system that breaks down wood lignin, a degradation-resistant biopolymer that binds the cellulose in wood. Under appropriate conditions, this enzyme system attacks organochloride compounds and enables their mineralization. The susceptibility of a xenobiotic hazardous waste compound to biodegradation depends upon its physical and chemical characteristics. Important physical characteristics include water solubility, hydrophobicity (aversion to water), volatility, and lipophilicity (affinity for lipids). In organic compounds, certain structural groups\u2014branched carbon chains, ether linkages, meta-substituted benzene rings, chlorine, amines, methoxy groups, sulfonates, and nitro groups\u2014impart particular resistance to biodegradation. Microorganisms vary in their ability to degrade hazardous waste compounds; virtually never does a single microorganism have the ability to completely mineralize a waste compound. Abundant aerobic bacteria of the Pseudomonas family are particularly adept at degrading synthetic compounds such as biphenyl, naphthalene, DDT, and many other compounds. Actinomycetes, microorganisms that are morphologically similar to both bacteria and fungi, degrade a variety of organic compounds including degradation-resistant alkanes and lignocellulose, as well as pyridines, phenols, nonchlorinated aryls, and chlorinated aryls. Fungi are particularly noted for their ability to attack long-chain and complex hydrocarbons, and are more successful than bacteria in the initial attack on PCB compounds.", "The potential of the white rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, to degrade biodegradation-resistant compounds, especially organochloride species, was previously noted. 20.16.2 ECOTOXICOLOGY OF HAZARDOUS WASTES Biologically, the greatest concern with wastes has to do with their toxic effects on animals, plants, and microbes. Virtually all hazardous waste substances are poisonous to a degree, some extremely so. Toxicities vary markedly with the physical and chemical nature of the waste, the matrix in which it is contained, the type and condition of the species exposed, and the manner, degree, and time of exposure. Ecotoxicology, the study of how chemicals affect organisms in the environment, is an important part of the risk assessment of hazardous wastes.5 Eco-epidemiology is a more broadly based area that seeks to evaluate over a relatively long term how the health of a biological community is affected by the physical and chemical nature of the environment with respect to foreign chemical substances in it. A key aspect of the ecotoxicology of hazardous wastes is the determination of the concentration at which chemicals begin to have significant effects on organisms in the environment. The ecotoxicities of products likely to be released to the environment are evaluated starting with a quantitative (QSAR) approach (a largely computational exercise) and progressing through acute, chronic, and model ecosystem testing (a tiered effects process) in order to evaluate the likely effects of compounds upon survival, growth, and reproduction of organisms. The expense and complexity of testing increase with higher levels in the tiered approach and later tests may not be required if those earlier in the sequence show that there is unlikely to be a problem. Only the most widely used compounds are subject to expensive chronic toxicity or model ecosystem tests. 20.17 HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES IN TERRORISM A wide variety of substances used in everyday commerce or made specifically for their destructive or toxic effects have a high potential for use in terrorist attacks. Some of these substances are discussed here. Toxic substances with potential for use in terrorist incidents are discussed further in Chapter 24. Substances used to attack people can be distributed through a number of conduits including air, food, drinking water, and pharmaceuticals. They are especially effective against concentrated groups of people, such as those gathered in shopping malls, theaters, or transportation facilities. In part because they are readily diluted to nonhazardous levels by wind and air currents, chemical agents are of less concern for attacks on dispersed populations out of doors than are biological agents or nuclear weapons. The quantities of chemical agents required for effective attack vary widely from just a few grams of nerve gas to hundreds of kilograms of ammonia or chlorine. Because of chemophobic concerns of the general public, even a relatively harmless chemical attack is likely to cause widespread panic to exposed individuals. One can imagine the consternation that could be caused by an ominous looking, but largely harmless, fog of ammonium chloride produced by simultaneous release of ammonia and hydrogen chloride gas in a crowded area. Hazardous chemicals that have the potential for use in terrorist attacks include the following: 1. Toxic and otherwise hazardous industrial chemicals 2. Military poisons 3. Combustible substances and oxidizers 4. Corrosive substances 5. Highly reactive substances including explosives The use of relatively large quantities of hazardous industrial chemicals is a characteristic of all modern industrialized societies. The potential hazards posed by such chemicals are exemplifi ed by the catastrophic Bhopal, India, incident of 1984 that killed 3500 people when methyl isocyanate was accidentally released. Elemental chlorine and phosgene are widely used and were among the fi rst military poisons employed in World War I. A more recent example of large-scale poisoning by a hazardous chemical occurred in the Chuandongbei natural gas field of southwestern China in December 2003, when a drill penetrated a highly pressurized pocket of natural gas containing a high level of toxic hydrogen sulfi de, H2S. Toxic gas spewing from the well killed at least 191 people including a high proportion of the population of Xiaoyang village, the community closest to the well. Approximately 600 people in the town of Zhonghe were treated for poisoning and thousands of people were evacuated. To prevent additional poisoning, the gas was ignited, creating a huge fi re and converting the hydrogen sulfide to noxious, but much less toxic sulfur dioxide. Industrial chemicals are very well controlled inside plant walls and incidents of harm from this source of chemicals are relatively rare.", "A greater hazard is posed by the transport of such chemicals by rail, truck, or other means. Major transportation accidents in which hazardous chemicals are released occur relatively frequently. Rail cars and trucks transporting such chemicals are vulnerable to terrorist attack and even hijacking that could result in exposure of human populations. In this respect, the practices of industrial ecology and green chemistry offer enormous potential for reducing the hazards. In many cases, hazardous chemical intermediates can be produced on site as needed and by just-in-time production, thereby eliminating the need to transport large quantities of such chemicals and preventing their accumulation in quantities that might pose hazards. Substances that burn and oxidizers required for combustion are in widespread use and must be transported from sources to users. The potential of flammable substances to cause death and H ONO2 CH3 HCONO2 HHCHH O2N NO2 O2N NO2 NN H C ONO2 O2NO C C C ONO2 HCONO2 HHCHH N H ONO2 NO2 NO2 Nitroglycerin Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) 1,3,5-Trinitro-1,3,5triazacyclohexane (RDX) FIGURE 20.6 Common military explosives. destruction was tragically illustrated by the 2001 attack on the New York World Trade Center in which the destructive agent was flammable jet fuel. Flammable substances include gases and volatile liquids that can spread some distance from their source through conduits such as a subway tunnels and sewers. Pipelines through which large quantities of flammable substances are transported are vulnerable to terrorist attack. Mixed with air, flammable vapors can cause devastating explosions. Oxidizers can greatly accelerate the burning of flammable materials. This was illustrated tragically in the 1997 crash of a ValueJet airliner in the Florida Everglades in which sodium chlorate used for aircraft oxygen generators was placed in the luggage hold and provided an oxidizer that burned tires and other flammable materials resulting in the crash. Corrosive substances that attack materials and flesh can be used in terrorist attacks. Acidic, dehydrating sulfuric acid has been used to blind people in criminal attacks. Acids and other corrosive substances can be used to attack infrastructure, such as communications equipment. Explosives are the substances most widely used in terrorist attacks. Blasts from relatively small amounts of explosives can bring down aircraft. Much larger quantities have been used in some of the more prominent recent terrorist attacks including the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya. Many kinds of explosives have been developed that can be used for illegal purposes. These include gunpowder, nitroglycerin (the explosive in dynamite), 2,4,6-TNT, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Structural formulas of several dangerous explosives are shown in Figure 20.6. Explosives can be made from readily available materials, especially a mixture of ammonium nitrate fertilizer with fuel oil, which was used in the destruction of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. 20.17.1 DETECTION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES The detection of explosives and other hazardous substances is extremely important in combating terrorist threats. Metal detectors and x-ray imaging, which have been the standard means for fi nding weapons and bombs on airline passengers and in their luggage, are of limited use in detecting hazardous substances. Stationary ion mobility spectrometers and chemiluminescence sensors can be used to detect residues of explosives such as RDX, PETN, or TNT. Typically, sampling is done by swabbing luggage; careful cleaning of luggage can reduce chances of detection. Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR), which produces a signal from the nuclei of atoms of 14N, which constitute 99.6% of naturally occurring nitrogen, is an especially promising explosives detection technique. The information it provides correlates with the functional groups in specific kinds of explosives enabling their detection. Other technologies that hold promise for explosives detection include x-ray diffraction, microwave/millimeter wave scanners, and NQR. NQR is an especially promising explosives detection technique because of its specificity for the detection of nitrogen found in all common explosives and because of its ability to detect explosives in containers and even land mines. It produces a signal from the nuclei of atoms of 14N, which constitute 99.6% of naturally occurring nitrogen. A pulse of radiofrequency radiation from a transmitter coil excites the 14N spins to higher quantized energy levels and measurement of the particular precession frequency that is followed as the nuclear spins return to their equilibrium positions provides the identities and abundance of nitrogen-containing functional groups. This information correlates with specific kinds of explosives enabling their detection.", "One of the most sensitive means for detecting hazardous chemical substances that might be involved in attacks is \u201ccanine olfactory detection.\u201d It consists of the use of dogs to sniff odors of substances at very low levels. This detection system makes use of the dogs\u2019 approximately 220 million mucus-coated olfactory receptors (about 40 times as many as humans) by which they detect odors and is more sophisticated than any yet developed by humans. (However, for various reasons, including the desire to get rewards, dogs sometime exhibit the temperamental and unpredictable nature often attributed to modern computerized instruments and some humans. According to one authoritative source quoting an expert in canine olfaction, \u201cDogs lie. We know they do. \u201d)6 20.17.2 REMOVING HAZARDOUS AGENTS An important aspect of resisting the effects of attacks by some hazardous substances is their removal, such as from contaminated air, or decontamination, such as from contaminated surfaces. Filters of various kinds can be employed to remove particles from both air and water. Adsorbents including activated carbon and molecular sieves can be used to sequester molecular contaminants. Liquids and solutions that can absorb contaminants or even react with them chemically can be used in scrubbers and packed sorbent reaction beds. A common problem in decontamination is that the materials used for this purpose may be incompatible with contaminated apparatus such as the electronic equipment. Although water sprayed as a fine mist into an atmosphere contaminated with chlorine, hydrogen fl uoride, hydrogen sulfi de, and other water-soluble materials can be an effective removal agent, it is hardly compatible with sensitive computer equipment. Reactive foams might be somewhat more preferable in some cases. Robots offer some significant potential for counterterrorism such as in assessing attack sites, performing some types of search and rescue operations, inspecting containers, performing routine surveillance, and doing some of the labor-intensive and tedious work of decontamination. In this respect, robots are most likely to function as assistants to humans rather than substitutes for them. Although the idea of robots functioning entirely on their own in complex tasks such as decontamination remains a distant dream, continued advances in computerized control and artificial intelligence will undoubtedly increase the role of robots in counterterrorism activities of the future.

Clearly, there have been severe hazardous waste problems in the United States and throughout the world. Since the 1970s, much has been done to reduce and clean up hazardous wastes. Legislation dealing with wastes has been passed, regulations have been put forth and refined, and numerous waste sites have been characterized and treated. Many of the financial resources expended on hazardous wastes have been devoted to litigation in attempts to establish the identities and contributions of various parties to waste problems. This chapter discusses how environmental chemistry, industrial ecology, and green chemistry can be applied to hazardous waste management to develop measures by which chemical wastes can be minimized, recycled, treated, and disposed. In descending order of desirability, hazardous waste management attempts to accomplish the following: \u2022 Do not produce it \u2022 If making it cannot be avoided, produce only minimum quantities \u2022 Recycle it \u2022 If it is produced and cannot be recycled, treat it, preferably in a way that makes it nonhazardous \u2022 If it cannot be rendered nonhazardous, dispose of it in a safe manner \u2022 Once it is disposed, monitor it for leaching and other adverse effects The effectiveness of a hazardous waste management system is a measure of how well it reduces the quantities and hazards of wastes. As shown in Figure 21.1, the best management option consists of measures that prevent generation of wastes. Next in order of desirability is recovery and recycling of waste constituents. Next is destruction and treatment with conversion to nonhazardous waste forms. The least desirable option is disposal of hazardous materials in storage or landfi ll. 21.2 WASTE REDUCTION AND MINIMIZATION During recent years, substantial efforts have been made in reducing the quantities of wastes and, therefore, the burden of dealing with wastes. Much of this effort has been the result of legislation and regulations restricting wastes, along with the resulting concerns over possible legal actions and lawsuits. In many cases\u2014and ideally in all\u2014minimizing the quantities of wastes produced is simply good business.", "Wastes are materials, materials have value and, therefore, all materials should be used for some beneficial purpose and not discarded as wastes, usually at a high cost for waste disposal. Industrial ecology is all about the efficient use of materials. Therefore, by its nature, a system of industrial ecology is also a system of waste reduction and minimization.1 In reducing quantities of wastes, it is important to take the broadest possible view. This is because dealing with one waste problem in isolation may simply create another. Early efforts to control air and water pollution resulted in problems from hazardous wastes isolated from industrial operations. A key aspect of industrial ecology is its approach based upon industrial systems as a whole, making such systems the best means of dealing with wastes by avoiding their production. Many hazardous waste problems can be avoided at early stages by waste reduction (cutting down quantities of wastes from their sources) and waste minimization (utilization of treatment processes that reduce the quantities of wastes requiring ultimate disposal).2 Ways in which quantities of wastes can be reduced include source reduction, waste separation and concentration, resource recovery, and waste recycling. The most effective approaches to minimizing wastes center around careful control of manufacturing processes, taking into consideration discharges and the potential for waste minimization at every step of manufacturing. Viewing the process as a whole (as outlined for a generalized chemical manufacturing process in Figure 21.2) often enables crucial identification of the source of a waste, such as a raw material impurity, catalyst, or process solvent. Once a source is identifi ed, it is much easier to take measures to eliminate or reduce the waste. The most effective approach to minimizing wastes is to emphasize waste minimization as an integral part of plant design. Modifications of the manufacturing process can yield substantial waste reduction. Some such modifications are of a chemical nature. Changes in chemical reaction conditions can minimize production of by-product hazardous substances. In some cases, potentially hazardous catalysts, such as those formulated from toxic substances, can be replaced by catalysts that are nonhazardous or that can be recycled rather than discarded. Wastes can be minimized by volume reduction, for example, through dewatering and drying sludge. Reactants Contaminants (impurities) Reaction media (water, organic Atmospheric solvents) emissions Recycle Catalysts Products and Discharges that mayuseful by-products require treatment Reclaimed by-products Wastewater Solids and sludges FIGURE 21.2 Chemical manufacturing process from the viewpoint of discharges and waste minimization. Many kinds of waste streams are candidates for minimization. As examples, such waste streams identified at U.S. Government federal facilities have included solvents used for cleaning and degreasing, spent motor oil from gasoline and diesel engines, leftover and waste paint thinners, antifreeze/antiboil engine cooling formulations, batteries, inks, exposed photographic fi lm, and pathology wastes. The sources of the wastes are as varied as the waste streams themselves. Motor pool maintenance garages generate used motor oil and spent coolants. Hospitals, clinics, and medical laboratories generate pathology wastes. Aircraft maintenance depots where aircraft and their parts are cleaned, chemically stripped of paint and coatings, repainted, and electroplated generate large quantities of effluents including organic materials. Other facilities generating wastes include equipment and arms maintenance facilities, photo developing and printing laboratories, paint shops, and arts and crafts shops. A crucial part of the process for reducing and minimizing wastes is the development of a material balance, which is an integral part of the practice of industrial ecology. Such a balance addresses various aspects of waste streams, including sources, identification, and quantities of wastes and methods and costs of handling, treatment, recycling, and disposal. Priority waste streams can then be subjected to detailed process investigations to obtain the information needed to reduce wastes. There are encouraging signs of progress in the area of waste minimization. All major companies have initiated programs to minimize quantities of wastes produced. Typically, more than 97% of oil-based petroleum refinery waste sludges that used to be discarded to landfill are now subjected to coking to yield useful hydrocarbon liquids and gases and coke, a solid carbon material with commercial value. Similar successes have been achieved with what were once waste products in a number of industries. 21.3 RECYCLING Wherever possible, recycling and reuse should be accomplished on-site because it avoids having to move wastes and because a process that produces recyclable materials is often the most likely to have use for them.", "The four broad areas in which something of value may be obtained from wastes are the following: \u2022 Direct recycle as raw material to the generator, as with the return to feedstock of raw materials not completely consumed in a synthesis process \u2022 Transfer as a raw material to another process; a substance that is a waste product from one process may serve as a raw material for another, sometimes in an entirely different industry \u2022 Utilization for pollution control or waste treatment, such as use of waste alkali to neutralize waste acid \u2022 Recovery of energy, for example, from the incineration of combustible hazardous wastes 21.3.1 EXAMPLES OF RECYCLING Recycling of scrap industrial impurities and products occurs on a large scale with a number of different materials. Most of these materials are not hazardous but, as with most large-scale industrial operations, their recycling may involve the use or production of hazardous substances. Some of the more important examples are the following: \u2022 Ferrous metals composed primarily of iron and used largely as feedstock for electric-arc furnaces \u2022 Nonferrous metals, including aluminum (which ranks next to iron in terms of quantities recycled), copper and copper alloys, zinc, lead, cadmium, tin, silver, and mercury \u2022 Metal compounds, such as metal salts \u2022 Inorganic substances including alkaline compounds (such as sodium hydroxide used to remove sulfur compounds from petroleum products), acids (steel pickling liquor where impurities permit reuse), and salts (e.g., ammonium sulfate from coal coking used as fertilizer) \u2022 Glass, which makes up about 10% of municipal refuse \u2022 Paper, commonly recycled from municipal refuse \u2022 Plastic, consisting of a variety of moldable polymeric materials and composing a major constituent of municipal wastes \u2022 Rubber \u2022 Organic substances, especially solvents and oils, such as hydraulic and lubricating oils \u2022 Catalysts from chemical synthesis or petroleum processing \u2022 Materials with agricultural uses, such as waste lime or phosphate-containing sludges used to treat and fertilize acidic soils 21.3.2 WASTE OIL UTILIZATION AND RECOVERY Waste oil generated from lubricants and hydraulic fluids is one of the more commonly recycled materials. Annual production of waste oil in the United States is of the order of 4 billion liters. Around half of this amount is burned as fuel and lesser quantities are recycled or disposed as waste. The collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of waste oil are all complicated by the fact that it comes from diverse, widely dispersed sources and contains several classes of potentially hazardous contaminants. These are divided between organic constituents (PAHs, chlorinated hydrocarbons) and inorganic constituents (aluminum, chromium, and iron from wear of metal parts; barium and zinc from oil additives; lead from leaded gasoline). 21.3.2.1 Recycling Waste Oil The processes used to convert waste oil to a feedstock hydrocarbon liquid for lubricant formulation are illustrated in Figure 21.3. The first of these uses distillation to remove water and light ends that have come from condensation and contaminant fuel. The second, or processing, step may be a vacuum distillation in which the three products are oil for further processing, a fuel oil cut, and a heavy residue. The processing step may also employ treatment with a mixture of solvents including isopropyl and butyl alcohols and methylethyl ketone to dissolve the oil and leave contaminants as a sludge; or contact with sulfuric acid to remove inorganic contaminants followed by treatment with clay to take out acid and contaminants that cause odor and color. The third step shown in Figure 21.3 employs vacuum distillation to separate lubricating oil stocks from a fuel fraction and heavy residue. This phase of treatment may also involve hydrofinishing, treatment with clay, and fi ltration. 21.3.2.2 Waste Oil Fuel For economic reasons, waste oil that is to be used for fuel is given minimal treatment of a physical nature, including settling, removal of water, and filtration. Metals in waste fuel oil become highly concentrated in its fly ash, which may be hazardous. 21.3.3 WASTE SOLVENT RECOVERY AND RECYCLE The recovery and recycling of waste solvents has some similarities to the recycling of waste oil and is also an important enterprise. Among the many solvents listed as hazardous wastes and recoverable from wastes are dichloromethane, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, benzene, liquid alkanes, 2-nitropropane, methylisobutyl ketone, and cyclohexanone. For reasons of both economics and pollution control, many industrial processes that use solvents are equipped for solvent recycle. The basic scheme for solvent reclamation and reuse is shown in Figure 21.4.", "Because of their impact on material use and environmental effects, solvents are given a high priority in the practice of green chemistry. A number of operations are used in solvent recovery and purification. Entrained solids are removed by settling, filtration, or centrifugation. Drying agents may be used to remove water from solvents, and various adsorption techniques and chemical treatment may be required to free the solvent from specifi c impurities. Fractional distillation, often requiring several distillation steps, is the most important operation in solvent purification and recycling. It is used to separate solvents from impurities, water, and other solvents. By-products 21.3.4 RECOVERY OF WATER FROM WASTEWATER It is often desirable to reclaim water from wastewater. This is especially true in regions where water is in short supply. Even where water is abundant, water recycling is desirable to minimize the amount of water that is discharged. A little more than half of the water used in the United States is consumed by agriculture, primarily for irrigation. Steam-generating power plants consume about one-fourth of the water, and other uses, including manufacturing and domestic uses, account for the remainder. The three major manufacturing consumers of water are chemicals and allied products, paper and allied products, and primary metals. These industries use water for cooling, processing, and boilers. Their potential for water reuse is high and their total consumption of water is projected to drop in future years as recycling becomes more common. The degree of treatment required for reuse of wastewater depends upon its application. Water used for industrial quenching and washing usually requires the least treatment, and wastewater from some other processes may be suitable for these purposes without additional treatment. At the other end of the scale, boiler makeup water, potable (drinking) water, water used to directly recharge aquifers, and water that people will directly contact (in boating, water skiing, and similar activities) must be of very high quality. The treatment processes applied to wastewater for reuse and recycle depend upon both the characteristics of the wastewater and its intended uses. Solids can be removed by sedimentation and filtration. BOD is reduced by biological treatment, including trickling filters and activated sludge treatment. For uses conducive to the growth of nuisance algae, nutrients may have to be removed. The easiest of these to handle is nutrient phosphate, which can be precipitated with lime. Nitrogen can be removed by denitrifi cation processes. Two of the major problems with industrial water recycling are heavy metals and dissolved toxic organic species. Heavy metals may be removed by ion exchange or precipitation by base or sulfi de. The organic species are usually removed with activated carbon filtration. Some organic species are biologically degraded by bacteria in biological wastewater treatment. One of the greater sources of potentially hazardous wastewater arises from oil/water separators at wash racks where manufactured parts and materials are washed. Because of the use of surfactants and solvents in the washwater, the separated water tends to contain emulsified oil that is incompletely separated in an oil/water separator. In addition, the sludge that accumulates at the bottom of the separator may contain hazardous constituents, including heavy metals and some hazardous organic constituents. Several measures that include the incorporation of good industrial ecology practice may be taken to eliminate these problems. One such measure is to eliminate the use of surfactants and solvents that tend to contaminate the water, and to use surfactants and solvents that are more amenable to separation and treatment. Another useful measure is to treat the water to remove harmful constituents and recycle it. This not only conserves water and reduces disposal costs, but also enables recycling of surfactants and other additives. The ultimate water quality is achieved by processes that remove solutes from water, leaving pure H2O. A combination of activated carbon treatment to remove organics, cation exchange to remove dissolved cations, and anion exchange for dissolved anions can provide very high quality water from wastewater. Reverse osmosis (see Chapter 8) can accomplish the same objective. However, these processes generate spent activated carbon, ion-exchange resins that require regeneration, and concentrated brines (from reverse osmosis) that require disposal, all of which have the potential to end up as hazardous wastes. 21.4 PHYSICAL METHODS OF WASTE TREATMENT This section addresses predominantly physical methods for waste treatment and the following section addresses methods that utilize chemical processes. It should be kept in mind that most waste Disposal, resource Disposal, resource Discharge, recovery recovery recycle treatment measures have both physical and chemical aspects.", "The appropriate treatment technology for hazardous wastes obviously depends upon the nature of the wastes, which may vary in physical form, density, chemical composition, solubility in water, solubility in organic solvents, volatility, and other characteristics. As shown in Figure 21.5, waste treatment may occur at three major levels\u2014primary, secondary, and polishing\u2014somewhat analogous to the treatment of wastewater (see Chapter 8). Primary treatment is usually preparation for further treatment, although it can result in the removal of by-products and reduction of the quantity and hazard of the waste. Secondary treatment detoxifies, destroys, and removes hazardous constituents. Polishing usually refers to treatment of water removed from wastes before discharge. The term may also apply to the treatment of other products so that they may be safely discharged or recycled. 21.4.1 METHODS OF PHYSICAL TREATMENT Knowledge of the physical behavior of wastes has been used to develop various unit operations for waste treatment that are based upon physical properties. These operations include the following: \u2022 Phase separation: Filtration Sedimentation Flotation \u2022 Phase transfer: Extraction Sorption \u2022 Phase transition: Distillation Evaporation Physical precipitation \u2022 Membrane separations: Reverse osmosis Hyper- and ultrafi ltration 21.4.1.1 Phase Separations The most straightforward means of physical treatment involves separation of components of a mixture that are already in two different phases. Sedimentation and decanting are easily accomplished with simple equipment. In many cases, the separation must be aided by mechanical means, particularly fi ltration or centrifugation. Flotation is used to bring suspended organic matter or finely divided particles to the surface of a suspension. In the process of dissolved air flotation (DAF), air is dissolved in the suspending medium under pressure and comes out of solution when the pressure is released as minute air bubbles attached to suspended particles, which causes the particles to float to the surface. An important and often difficult waste treatment step is emulsion breaking in which colloidal-sized emulsions are caused to aggregate and settle from suspension. Agitation, heat, acid, and the addition of coagulants consisting of organic polyelectrolytes, or inorganic substances such as an aluminum salt, may be used to cause the particles to stick together and settle out. 21.4.1.2 Phase Transition A second major class of physical separation is that of phase transition in which a material changes from one physical phase to another. It is best exemplifi ed by distillation, which is used in treating and recycling solvents, waste oil, aqueous phenolic wastes, xylene contaminated with paraffi n from histological laboratories, and mixtures of ethylbenzene and styrene. Distillation produces distillation bottoms (still bottoms), which are often hazardous and polluting. These consist of unevaporated solids, semisolid tars, and sludges from distillation. Specific examples are distillation bottoms from the production of acetaldehyde from ethylene (hazardous waste number K009) and still bottoms from toluene reclamation distillation in the production of disulfoton (K036). The landfill disposal of these and other hazardous distillation bottoms, once widely practiced, is now severely limited. Evaporation is usually employed to remove water from an aqueous waste to concentrate it. A special case of this technique is thin-fi lm evaporation in which volatile constituents are removed by heating a thin layer of liquid or sludge waste spread on a heated surface. Drying is removal of solvent or water from a solid or semisolid (sludge) or the removal of solvent from a liquid or suspension\u2014is a very important operation because water is often the major constituent of waste products, such as sludges obtained from emulsion breaking. In freeze drying, the solvent, usually water, is sublimed from a frozen material. Hazardous waste solids and sludges are dried to reduce the quantity of waste, to remove solvent or water that might interfere with subsequent treatment processes, and to remove hazardous volatile constituents. Dewatering can often be improved with addition of a filter aid, such as diatomaceous Earth, during the fi ltration step. Stripping is a means of separating volatile components from less volatile ones in a liquid mixture by the partitioning of the more volatile materials to a gas phase of air or steam (steam stripping). The gas phase is introduced into the aqueous solution or suspension containing the waste in a stripping tower that is equipped with trays or packed to provide maximum turbulence and contact between the liquid and gas phases. The two major products are condensed vapor and a stripped bottoms residue. Examples of two volatile components that can be removed from water by air stripping are benzene and dichloromethane.", "Air stripping can also be used to remove ammonia from water that has been treated with a base to convert ammonium ion to volatile ammonia. Physical precipitation is used here as a term to describe processes in which a solid forms from a solute in solution as a result of a physical change in the solution, as compared to chemical precipitation (see Section 21.5) in which a chemical reaction in solution produces an insoluble material. Cooling the solution, evaporation of solvent, or alteration of solvent composition may cause physical precipitation. The most common type of physical precipitation by solvent alteration occurs when a water-miscible organic solvent is added to an aqueous solution so that the solubility of a salt is lowered below its concentration in the solution. 21.4.1.3 Phase Transfer Phase transfer consists of the transfer of a solute in a mixture from one phase to another. An important type of phase transfer process is solvent extraction in which a substance is transferred from solution in one solvent (usually water) to another (usually an organic solvent) without any chemical change. Solvents may be used for leaching substances from solids or sludges. Solvent extraction and the major terms applicable to it are summarized in Figure 21.6. The same terms and general principles apply to leaching. A major application of solvent extraction to waste treatment has been in the removal of phenol from by-product water produced in coal coking, petroleum refi ning, and chemical syntheses that involve phenol. One of the more promising approaches to solvent extraction and leaching of hazardous wastes is the use of supercritical fluids, most commonly CO2, as extraction solvents. A supercritical fl uid is one that has characteristics of both liquid and gas and consists of a substance above its critical temperature and pressure (31.1\u221eC and 73.8 atm, respectively, for CO2). After a substance has been extracted from a waste into a supercritical fluid at high pressure, the pressure can be released, resulting in separation of the substance extracted. The fluid can then be compressed again and recirculated through the extraction system. Some possibilities for treatment of hazardous wastes by extraction with supercritical CO2 include removal of organic contaminants from wastewater, extraction of organohalide pesticides from soil, extraction of oil from emulsions used in aluminum and steel processing, and regeneration of spent activated carbon. Waste oils contaminated with PCBs, metals, and water can be purified using supercritical ethane. Transfer of a substance from a solution to a solid phase is called sorption. The most important sorbent is activated carbon, which, in some cases, is used for complete treatment of hazardous wastes as well as pretreatment of waste streams going into processes such as reverse osmosis to improve treatment efficiency and reduce fouling. Effluents from other treatment processes, such as biological treatment of degradable organic solutes in water, can be polished with activated carbon. Activated carbon sorption is most effective for removing from water those hazardous waste materials that are poorly water-soluble and that have high molar masses, such as xylene, naphthalene (U165), chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenol (U188), and aniline. Activated carbon does not work well for organic compounds that are highly water-soluble or polar. Solids other than activated carbon can be used for sorption of contaminants from liquid wastes. These include synthetic resins composed of organic polymers and mineral substances. Of the latter, clay is employed to remove impurities from waste lubricating oils in some oil recycling processes. Feed of solution or other matrix from which material is extracted Extract of extracted material in solvent Raffinate of matrix from which material has been extracted Solvent into which material is extracted FIGURE 21.6 Outline of solvent extraction/leaching process with important terms underlined. 21.4.1.4 Molecular Separation A third major class of physical separation is molecular separation, often based upon membrane processes in which dissolved contaminants or solvent pass through a size-selective membrane under pressure. The products are a relatively pure solvent phase (usually water) and a concentrate enriched in the solute impurities. The common membrane processes are discussed in Section 8.6 and summarized in Table 8.1. Ultrafiltration and hyperfiltration are especially useful for concentrating suspended oil, grease, and fine solids in water. They also serve to concentrate solutions of large organic molecules and heavy metal ion complexes. 21.5 CHEMICAL TREATMENT: AN OVERVIEW The applicability of chemical treatment to wastes depends upon the chemical properties of the waste constituents, particularly acid\u2013base, oxidation\u2013reduction, precipitation, and complexation behavior; reactivity; fl ammability/combustibility; corrosivity; and compatibility with other wastes.", "The major unit operations for chemical waste treatment are the following: \u2022 Acid/base neutralization \u2022 Chemical extraction and leaching \u2022 Ion exchange \u2022 Chemical precipitation \u2022 Oxidation \u2022 Reduction Some of the more sophisticated means available for treatment of wastes have been developed for pesticide disposal. 21.5.1 ACID\u2013BASE NEUTRALIZATION Waste acids and bases are treated by neutralization: H++ OH-\u00c6 H2O (21.1) Although simple in principle, neutralization can present some problems in practice. These include evolution of volatile contaminants, mobilization of soluble substances, excessive heat generated by the neutralization reaction, and corrosion to apparatus. By adding too much or too little of the neutralizing agent, it is possible to get a product that is too acidic or basic. Lime, Ca(OH)2, is widely used as a base for treating acidic wastes. Because of lime\u2019s limited solubility, solutions of excess lime do not reach extremely high pH values. Sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is a relatively inexpensive acid for treating alkaline wastes. However, addition of too much sulfuric acid can produce highly acidic products; for some applications, acetic acid, CH3COOH, is preferable. As noted above, acetic acid is a weak acid and an excess of it does little harm. It is also a natural product and biodegradable. Neutralization, or pH adjustment, is often required prior to the application of other waste treatment processes. Processes that may require neutralization include oxidation/reduction, activated carbon sorption, wet air oxidation, stripping, and ion exchange. Microorganisms usually require a pH in the range of 6\u20139, so neutralization may be required prior to biochemical treatment. 21.5.1.1 Acid Recovery Rather than neutralizing acid, in some cases, it may be recovered for its economic value. Acid recovery is in keeping with the best practice of green chemistry. An example of acid recovery is the use of trioctyl phosphate to recover acetic acid and nitric acid from a waste acid mixture of these acids and H3PO4 produced in some processes such as etching in the production of liquid crystals.

Most metal ions tend to produce basic salt precipitates, such as basic copper(II) sulfate, CuSO4 . 3Cu(OH)2, which is formed as a solid when hydroxide is added to a solu 2 tion containing Cu2+ and SO4 ions. The solubilities of many heavy metal hydroxides reach a minimum value, often at a pH in the range of 9\u201311, then increase with increasing pH values due to the formation of soluble hydroxo complexes, as illustrated by the following reaction: Zn(OH)2(s) + 2OH-(aq) \u00c6 Zn(OH)42 (aq) (21.4) The chemical precipitation method that is used most is precipitation of metals as hydroxides and basic salts with lime. Sodium carbonate can be used to precipitate hydroxides [Fe(OH)3 . xH2O], carbonates (CdCO3), or basic carbonate salts [2PbCO3.Pb(OH)2]. The carbonate anion produces hydroxide by virtue of its hydrolysis reaction with water: CO32-+ H2O \u00c6 HCO3 -+ OH- (21.5) Carbonate, alone, does not give as high a pH as do alkali metal hydroxides, which may have to be used to precipitate metals that form hydroxides only at relatively high pH values. The solubilities of some heavy metal sulfides are extremely low, so precipitation by H2S or other sulfides (see Reaction 21.2) can be a very effective means of treatment. Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic gas that is itself considered to be a hazardous waste (U135). Iron(II) sulfide (ferrous sulfide) can be used as a safe source of sulfide ion to produce sulfide precipitates with other metals that are less soluble than FeS.", "However, toxic H2S can be produced when metal sulfide wastes contact acid: MS + 2H+\u00c6 M2++ H2S (21.6) Some metals can be precipitated from solution in the elemental metal form by the action of a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride: 4Cu2+ + NaBH4 + 2H2O \u00c6 4Cu + NaBO2 + 8H+ (21.7) or with more active metals in a process called cementation: Cd2+ + Zn \u00c6 Cd + Zn2+ (21.8) Regardless of the method used to precipitate a metal, the form of the metal in the waste solution can be an important consideration. Chelated metals can be especially difficult to remove. 21.5.2.2 Coprecipitation of Metals In some cases, advantage may be taken of the phenomenon of coprecipitation to remove metals from wastes. A good example of this application is the coprecipitation of lead from battery industry wastewater with iron(III) hydroxide. Raising the pH of such a wastewater consisting of dilute sulfuric acid and contaminated with Pb2+ ion precipitates lead as several species, including PbSO4, Pb(OH)2, and Pb(OH)2 . 2PbCO3. In the presence of iron(III), gelatinous Fe(OH)3 forms, which coprecipitates the lead, leading to significantly greater lead removal, typically to below 0.2 ppm. 21.5.3 OXIDATION\u2013REDUCTION As shown by the reactions in Table 21.1, oxidation and reduction can be used for the treatment and removal of a variety of inorganic and organic wastes. Some waste oxidants can be used to treat oxidizable wastes in water and cyanides. Ozone, O3, is a strong oxidant that can be generated on-site by an electrical discharge through dry air or oxygen. Ozone employed as an oxidant gas at levels of 1\u20132 wt% in air and 2\u20135 wt% in oxygen has been used to treat a large variety of oxidizable contaminants, effluents, and wastes including wastewater and sludges containing oxidizable constituents. It is also used to partially oxidize organic waste solutes in water to make them more amenable to biological treatment. Fenton oxidation is also used to oxidize organic substances in water, often as a fi nal polishing step prior to release of the treated wastewater. The Fenton process entails adding iron(II) salts, such TABLE 21.1 Oxidation\u2013Reduction Reactions Used to Treat Wastes Waste Substance Reaction with Oxidant or Reductant Oxidation of Organics Organic matter, {CH2O} {CH2O} + 2{O} \u00c6 CO2 + H2O Aldehyde CH3CHO + {O} \u00c6 CH3COOH (acid) Oxidation of Inorganics - Cyanide 2CN-+ 5OCl-+ H2O \u00c6 N2 + 2HCO3 + 5ClIron(II) 4Fe2++ O2 + 10H2O \u00c6 4Fe(OH)3 + 8H+ Sulfur dioxide 2SO2 + O2 + 2H2O \u00c6 2H2SO4 Reduction of Inorganics Chromate 2CrO42-+ 3SO2 + 4H+\u00c6 Cr2(SO4)3 + 2H2O - Permanganate MnO4 + 3Fe2++ 7H2O \u00c6 MnO2(s) + 3Fe(OH)3(s) + 5H+ as FeSO4, acidification, addition of hydrogen peroxide, and acid neutralization. Hydrogen peroxide reacts with iron(II), Fe(II) + H2O2 \u00c6 Fe(III) + OH-+ HO\u2211 (4.77) to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radical, HO \u2211, which oxidizes even refractory organic materials. A disadvantage of Fenton treatment is the iron-containing sludge that is generated when the acidic reaction mixture is neutralized. 21.5.4 ELECTROLYSIS As shown in Figure 21.7, electrolysis is a process in which one species in solution (usually a metal ion) is reduced by electrons at the cathode and another gives up electrons to the anode and is oxidized there. In hazardous waste applications, electrolysis is most widely used in the recovery of cadmium, copper, gold, lead, silver, and zinc. Metal recovery by electrolysis is made more diffi cult by the presence of cyanide ion, which stabilizes metals in solution as the cyanide complexes, such as Ni(CN)42-. Electrolytic removal of contaminants from solution can be by direct electrodeposition, particularly of reduced metals, and as the result of secondary reactions of electrolytically generated precipitating agents. A specific example of both is the electrolytic removal of both cadmium and nickel from wastewater contaminated by nickel/cadmium battery manufactured using fibrous carbon electrodes. At the cathode, cadmium is removed directly by reduction to the metal: Cd2++ 2e -\u00c6 Cd (21.9) At relatively high cathodic potentials, hydroxide is formed by the electrolytic reduction of water: 2H2O + 2e -\u00c6 2OH-+ H2 (21.10) or by the reduction of molecular oxygen, if it is present: 2H2O + O2 + 4e -\u00c6 4OH- (21.11) Cu2+ + 2e \u2013 \u00c6 Cu H2O \u00c6 \u20131O2 + 2H+ + 2e \u2013 2 Net reaction: Cu2+ + H2O \u00c6 Cu+ 1\u2013O2 + 2H+ 2 FIGURE 21.7 Electrolysis of copper solution. If the localized pH at the cathode surface becomes sufficiently high, cadmium can be precipitated and removed as colloidal Cd(OH)2.", "The direct electrodeposition of nickel is too slow to be signifi cant, but it is precipitated as solid Ni(OH)2 at pH values above 7.5 from OH- generated at the cathode. Cyanide, which is often present as an ingredient of electroplating baths with metals such as cadmium and nickel, can be removed by oxidation with electrolytically generated elemental chlorine at the anode. Chlorine is generated by the anodic oxidation of added chloride ion: 2Cl-\u00c6 Cl2 + 2e - (21.12) The electrolytically generated chlorine then breaks down cyanide by a series of reactions for which the overall reaction is the following: 2CN-+ 5Cl2 + 8OH-\u00c6 10Cl-+ N2 + 2CO2 + 4H2O (21.13) 21.5.5 HYDROLYSIS One of the ways to dispose of chemicals that are reactive with water is to allow them to react with water under controlled conditions, a process called hydrolysis. Inorganic chemicals that can be treated by hydrolysis include metals that react with water; metal carbides, hydrides, amides, alkoxides, and halides; and nonmetal oxyhalides and sulfides. Examples of the treatment of these classes of inorganic species are given in Table 21.2. Organic chemicals may also be treated by hydrolysis. For example, toxic acetic anhydride is hydrolyzed to relatively safe acetic acid: H H O O C C O C H H C H + H2O H 2H H C H O C OH (21.14) Acetic anhydride (an acid anhydride) 21.5.6 CHEMICAL EXTRACTION AND LEACHING Chemical extraction or leaching in hazardous waste treatment is the removal of a hazardous constituent by chemical reaction with an extractant in solution. Poorly soluble heavy metal salts can be extracted by reaction of the salt anions with H+ as illustrated by the following: - PbCO3 + H+\u00c6 Pb2++ HCO3 (21.15) TABLE 21.2 Inorganic Chemicals That May Be Treated by Hydrolysis Class of Chemical Reaction with Oxidant or Reductant Active metals (calcium) Ca + 2H2O \u00c6 H2 + Ca(OH)2 Hydrides (sodium aluminum hydride) NaAlH4 + 4H2O \u00c6 4H2 + NaOH + Al(OH)3 Carbides (calcium carbide) CaC2 + 2H2O \u00c6 Ca(OH)2 + C2H2 Amides (sodium amide) NaNH2 + H2O \u00c6 NaOH + NH3 Halides (silicon tetrachloride) SiCl4 + 2H2O \u00c6 SiO2 + 4HCl Alkoxides (sodium ethoxide) NaOC2H5 + H2O \u00c6 NaOH + C2H5OH Acids also dissolve basic organic compounds such as amines and aniline. Extraction with acids should be avoided if cyanides or sulfides are present to prevent formation of toxic hydrogen cyanide or hydrogen sulfide. Nontoxic weak acids are usually the safest to use. These include acetic acid, CH3COOH, and the acid salt, NaH2PO4. Chelating agents, such as dissolved EDTA (HY3-), dissolve insoluble metal salts by forming soluble species with metal ions: FeS +HY3-\u00c6 FeY2-+HS- (21.16) Heavy metal ions in soil contaminated by hazardous wastes may be present in a coprecipitated form with insoluble iron(III) and manganese(IV) oxides, Fe2O3 and MnO2, respectively. These oxides can be dissolved by reducing agents, such as solutions of sodium dithionate/citrate or hydroxylamine. This results in the production of soluble Fe2+ and Mn2+ and the release of heavy metal ions, such as Cd2+ or Ni2+, which are removed with the water. 21.5.7 ION EXCHANGE Ion exchange is a means of removing cations or anions from solution onto a solid resin, which can be regenerated by treatment with acids, bases, or salts. The greatest use of ion exchange in hazardous waste treatment is for the removal of low levels of heavy metal ions from wastewater: 2H+-{CatExchr} +Cd2+\u00c6 Cd2+-{CatExchr}2 +2H+ (21.17) Ion exchange is employed in the metal plating industry to purify rinsewater and spent plating bath solutions. Cation exchangers are used to remove cationic metal species, such as Cu2+, from such solutions. Anion exchangers remove anionic cyanide metal complexes [e.g., Ni(CN)42-] and chromium(VI) species, such as CrO42-. Radionuclides may be removed from radioactive wastes and mixed waste by ion-exchange resins. 21.6 GREEN WASTE TREATMENT BY PHOTOLYSIS AND SONOLYSIS Photolysis and sonolysis are discussed together because of some similarities in their modes of action and because they are both potentially green chemistry waste treatment processes that can be carried out without added reagents or with minimal quantities of relatively harmless reactants. Both provide means of introducing high energy into the treatment system (see Section 17.10); photolysis does so through the action of photons of ultraviolet light or even x-rays or gamma rays, whereas sonolysis does so by \u201cphonons\u201d of high frequency ultrasound. Both generate chemically reactive intermediate species that break down waste molecules. Photolytic reactions were discussed in Chapter 9. Photolysis can be used to destroy a number of kinds of hazardous wastes.", "In such applications, it is most useful in breaking chemical bonds in refractory organic compounds. TCDD (see Section 7.11), one of the most troublesome and refractory of wastes, can be treated by ultraviolet light in the presence of hydrogen atom donors {H} resulting in reactions such as the following: Cl O Cl H Cl + h\u03bd {H} (21.18) Cl O Cl Cl Cl As photolysis proceeds, the H\u2013C bonds are broken, the C\u2013O bonds are broken, and the fi nal product is a harmless organic polymer. An initial photolysis reaction can result in the generation of reactive intermediates that participate in chain reactions that lead to the destruction of a compound. By far, the most important reactive intermediate is free radical HO\u2211. Solid titanium dioxide, TiO2, can be used as a photocatalyst leading to chain reactions involving active radicals. When the surface of TiO2 is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, \u201choles\u201d (h) are generated at sites where excited electrons (e -) are produced: TiO2 + h\u03bd \u00c6 TiO2(h +e -) (21.19) The electrons can react with dissolved O2 to produce reactive O2 -: - TiO2(e -) + O2 \u00c6 O2 (21.20) The surface holes may take electrons from dissolved hydroxyl ion to produce reactive hydroxyl radicals on the TiO2 surface: TiO2(h) + OH-\u00c6 HO\u2211 (21.21) The hydroxyl radicals may then initiate reactions leading to the destruction of waste compounds or the TiO2(h) sites may initiate reactions directly with waste molecules by abstracting electrons from them. In the example just cited, solid TiO2 acts as a sensitizer to absorb radiation and generate reactive species that destroy wastes. Other sensitizers may be added to solution to generate hydroxyl radical for waste treatment. The addition of a chemical oxidant, such as potassium peroxydisulfate, K2S2O8, enhances destruction by oxidizing active photolytic products. One of the most common processes that entails generation of active hydroxyl radical is the Fenton reaction involving iron(II) and hydrogen peroxide (see Reaction 4.77). Sunlight impinging on water containing iron can generate both Fe(II) and H2O2 with the potential to use for waste treatment. Hazardous waste substances other than TCDD that have been destroyed by photolysis are herbicides including atrazine, 2,4-D, 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid; 2,4-dichlorophenol; 2,4,6-trichlorophenol; TNT; and PCBs. Sonolysis in water with ultrasound (typically 660 kHz frequency) generates reactive hydroxyl radical by the following reaction: Ultrasound HOH \u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00c6 HO \u2211 +H \u2211 (21.22) The hydroxyl radical undergoes reactions with waste compounds leading to their destruction. The waste solution may be saturated with O2 gas to facilitate waste oxidation. Sonolysis may be combined with photolysis for more effective waste destruction. 21.7 THERMAL TREATMENT METHODS Thermal treatment of hazardous wastes can be used to accomplish most of the common objectives of waste treatment\u2014volume reduction; removal of volatile, combustible, mobile organic matter; and destruction of toxic and pathogenic materials. The most widely applied means of thermal treatment of hazardous wastes is incineration. Incineration utilizes high temperatures, an oxidizing atmosphere, and often turbulent combustion conditions to destroy wastes. Methods other than incineration that make use of high temperatures to destroy or neutralize hazardous wastes are discussed briefly at the end of this section. 21.7.1 INCINERATION Hazardous waste incineration will be defined here as a process that involves exposure of the waste materials to oxidizing conditions at a high temperature, usually in excess of 900\u221eC. Normally, the heat required for incineration comes from the oxidation of organically bound carbon and hydrogen contained in the waste material or in supplemental fuel: C(organic) + O2 \u00c6 CO2 + heat (21.23) 4H(organic) + O2 \u00c6 2H2O + heat (21.24) These reactions destroy organic matter and generate heat required for endothermic reactions, such as the breaking of C\u2013Cl bonds in organochlorine compounds. 21.7.1.1 Incinerable Wastes Ideally, incinerable wastes are predominantly organic materials that will burn with a heating value of at least 5000 Btu/lb and preferably over 8000 Btu/lb. Such heating values are readily attained with wastes having high contents of the most commonly incinerated waste organic substances, including methanol, acetonitrile, toluene, ethanol, amyl acetate, acetone, xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, adipic acid, and ethyl acetate. In some cases, however, it is desirable to incinerate wastes that will not burn alone and which require supplemental fuel, such as methane and petroleum liquids. Examples of such wastes are nonflammable organochlorine wastes, some aqueous wastes, or soil in which the elimination of a particularly troublesome contaminant is worth the expense and trouble of incinerating it. Inorganic matter, water, and organic hetero element contents of liquid wastes are important in determining their incinerability.", "21.7.2 HAZARDOUS WASTE FUEL Many industrial wastes, including hazardous wastes, are burned as hazardous waste fuel for energy recovery in industrial furnaces and boilers and in incinerators for nonhazardous wastes, such as sewage sludge incinerators. This process is called coincineration, and more combustible wastes are utilized by it than are burned solely for the purpose of waste destruction. In addition to heat recovery from combustible wastes, it is a major advantage to use an existing on-site facility for waste disposal rather than a separate hazardous waste incinerator. One of the greatest applications of coincineration is use of hazardous waste liquids containing organochlorine solvents and other pollutants as fuel for the preparation of portland cement (see below). 21.7.3 INCINERATION SYSTEMS The four major components of hazardous waste incineration systems are shown in Figure 21.8. Waste preparation for liquid wastes may require filtration, settling to remove solid material and water, blending to obtain the optimum incinerable mixture, or heating to decrease viscosity. Solids may require shredding and screening. Atomization is commonly used to feed liquid wastes. Several mechanical devices, such as rams and augers, are used to introduce solids into the incinerator. The most common kinds of combustion chambers are liquid injection, fixed hearth, rotary kiln, and fluidized bed. These types are discussed in more detail later in this section. Often the most complex part of a hazardous waste incineration system is the air pollution control system, which involves several operations. The most common operations in air pollution control from hazardous waste incinerators are combustion gas cooling, heat recovery, quenching, particulate matter removal, acid gas removal, and treatment and handling of by-product solids, sludges, and liquids. Hot ash is often quenched in water. Prior to disposal it may require dewatering and chemical stabilization. A major consideration with hazardous waste incinerators and the types of wastes Ash disposal that are incinerated is the disposal problem posed by the ash, especially with respect to potential leaching of heavy metals. 21.7.4 TYPES OF INCINERATORS Hazardous waste incinerators may be divided among the following, based upon type of combustion chamber: \u2022 Rotary kiln (about 40% of U.S. hazardous waste incinerator capacity) in which the primary combustion chamber is a rotating cylinder lined with refractory materials, and an afterburner downstream from the kiln to complete destruction of the wastes. \u2022 Liquid injection incinerators (also about 40% of U.S. hazardous waste incinerator capacity) that burn pumpable liquid wastes dispersed as small droplets. \u2022 Fixed-hearth incinerators with single or multiple hearths upon which combustion of liquid or solid wastes occurs. \u2022 Fluidized-bed incinerators in which combustion of wastes is carried out on a bed of granular solid (such as limestone) held in a suspended (fluid-like) state by injection of air to remove pollutant acid gas and ash products. \u2022 Advanced design incinerators including plasma incinerators that make use of an extremely hot plasma of ionized gas injected through an electrical arc; electric reactors that use resistance-heated incinerator walls at around 2200\u221eC to heat and pyrolyze wastes by radiative heat transfer; infrared systems that generate intense infrared radiation by passing electricity through silicon carbide resistance heating elements; molten salt combustion that uses a bed of molten sodium carbonate at about 900\u221eC to destroy the wastes and retain gaseous pollutants; and molten glass processes that use a pool of molten glass to transfer heat to the waste and to retain products in a poorly leachable glass form. 21.7.5 COMBUSTION CONDITIONS The key to effective incineration of hazardous wastes lies in the combustion conditions. These require (1) sufficient free oxygen in the combustion zone to ensure combustion of the wastes; (2) turbulence for thorough mixing of waste, oxidant, and (in cases where the waste does not have sufficient fuel content to be burned alone) supplemental fuel; (3) high combustion temperatures above about 900\u221eC to ensure that thermally resistant compounds do react; and (4) sufficient residence time (at least 2 s) to allow reactions to occur. 21.7.6 EFFECTIVENESS OF INCINERATION EPA standards for hazardous waste incineration are based upon the effectiveness of destruction of the principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs). Measurement of these compounds before and after incineration gives the destruction removal efficiency (DRE) according to the formula W -W in out DRE =\u00a5 100 (21.25) Win where Win and Wout are the mass flow rates of the POHC input and output (at the stack downstream from emission controls), respectively. U.S. EPA regulations call for destruction of 99.99% of POHCs and 99.9999% (\u201csix nines\u201d) destruction of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, commonly called TCDD or \u201cdioxin.\u201d", "21.7.7 WET AIR OXIDATION Organic compounds and oxidizable inorganic species can be oxidized by oxygen in aqueous solution. The source of oxygen usually is air. Rather extreme conditions of temperature and pressure are required, with a temperature range of 175\u2013327\u221eC and a pressure range of 300\u20133000 psig (2070\u201320,700 kPa). The high pressures allow a high concentration of oxygen to be dissolved in the water and the high temperatures enable the reaction to occur. Wet air oxidation has been applied to the destruction of cyanides in electroplating wastewaters. The oxidation reaction for sodium cyanide is the following: 2Na++ 2CN-+ O2 + 4H2O \u00c6 2Na++ 2HCO3 -+ 2NH3 (21.26) Organic wastes can be oxidized in supercritical water, taking advantage of the ability of supercritical fluids to dissolve organic compounds (see Section 21.4). Wastes are contacted with water and the mixture raised to a temperature and pressure required for supercritical conditions for water. Oxygen is then pumped in sufficient to oxidize the wastes. The process produces only small quantities of CO and no SO2 or NOx. It can be used to degrade PCBs, dioxins, organochlorine insecticides, benzene, urea, and numerous other materials. 21.7.8 UV-ENHANCED WET OXIDATION Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can be used as an oxidant in solution assisted by ultraviolet radiation (hv). For the oxidation of organic species represented in general as {CH2O}, the overall reaction is 2H2O2 + {CH2O} + hv \u00c6 CO2 + 3H2O (21.27) The ultraviolet radiation breaks chemical bonds and serves to form reactive oxidant species, such as HO\u2211. 21.7.9 DESTRUCTION OF HAZARDOUS WASTES IN CEMENT MANUFACTURE One of the most effective means of destroying hazardous wastes is to use them as supplemental fuel in the manufacture of portland cement. In this application, cement manufacture is an excellent example of the practice of industrial ecology, destroying a waste and utilizing it as fuel.3 Portland cement is made by heating limestone, clay, and sand to a very high temperature such that the mineral mixture fuses, after which it is ground to the fine powder that composes cement. When a cement kiln is cofired with hazardous wastes, the very high temperatures, strongly oxidizing conditions, and relatively long residence times are ideal for destroying organic wastes. Furthermore, the basic solids in the charge that is fired to make cement act to sequester acid gases, such as HCl generated in the combustion of organohalide compounds. Collection of solids from the cement kiln fl ue prevents release of potential pollutant ash materials. 21.8 BIODEGRADATION OF WASTES Biodegradation of wastes is a term that describes the conversion of wastes by enzymatic biological processes to simple inorganic molecules (mineralization) and, to a certain extent, to biological materials. Usually, the products of biodegradation are molecular forms that tend to occur in nature and that are in greater thermodynamic equilibrium with their surroundings than are the starting materials. Detoxifi cation refers to the biological conversion of a toxic substance to a less toxic species. Microbial bacteria and fungi possessing enzyme systems required for biodegradation of wastes are usually best obtained from populations of indigenous microorganisms at a hazardous waste site where they have developed the ability to degrade particular kinds of molecules. Biological treatment offers a number of significant advantages and has considerable potential for the degradation of hazardous wastes, even in situ. Under the label of bioremediation, the use of microbial processes to destroy hazardous wastes has been the subject of intense investigation for many years.4 Doubts still exist about claims for its effectiveness in a number of applications. It must be kept in mind, however, that there are many factors that can cause biodegradation to fail as a treatment process. Often physical conditions are such that mixing of wastes, nutrients, and electron acceptor species (such as oxygen) is too slow to permit biodegradation to occur at a useful rate. Low temperatures may make reactions too slow to be useful. Toxicants, such as heavy metals, may inhibit biological activity, and some metabolites produced by the microorganisms may be toxic to them. 21.8.1 BIODEGRADABILITY The biodegradability of a compound is influenced by its physical characteristics, such as solubility in water and vapor pressure, and by its chemical properties, including molar mass, molecular structure, and presence of various kinds of functional groups, some of which provide a \u201cbiochemical handle\u201d for the initiation of biodegradation. With the appropriate organisms and under the right conditions, even substances such as phenol that are considered to be biocidal to most microorganisms can undergo biodegradation.", "Recalcitrant or biorefractory substances are those that resist biodegradation and tend to persist and accumulate in the environment. Such materials are not necessarily toxic to organisms, but simply resist their metabolic attack. However, even some compounds regarded as biorefractory may be degraded by microorganisms that have had the opportunity to adapt to their biodegradation; for example, DDT is degraded by properly acclimated Pseudomonas. Chemical pretreatment, especially by partial oxidation, can make some kinds of recalcitrant wastes much more biodegradable. Properties of hazardous wastes and their media can be changed to increase biodegradability. This can be accomplished by adjustment of conditions to optimum temperature, pH (usually in the range of 6\u20139), stirring, oxygen level, and material load and by addition of nutrients. Biodegradation can be aided by removal of toxic organic and inorganic substances, such as heavy metal ions. 21.8.2 AEROBIC TREATMENT Aerobic waste treatment processes utilize aerobic bacteria and fungi that require molecular oxygen, O2. These processes are often favored by microorganisms, in part, because of the high energy yield obtained when molecular oxygen reacts with organic matter. Aerobic waste treatment is well adapted to the use of an activated sludge process. It can be applied to hazardous wastes such as chemical process wastes and landfi ll leachates. Some systems use powdered activated carbon as an additive to absorb organic wastes that are not biodegraded by microorganisms in the system. Contaminated soils can be mixed with water and treated in a bioreactor to eliminate biodegradable contaminants in the soil. It is possible, in principle, to treat contaminated soils biologically in place by pumping oxygenated, nutrient-enriched water through the soil in a recirculating system. 21.8.3 ANAEROBIC TREATMENT Anaerobic waste treatment in which microorganisms degrade wastes in the absence of oxygen can be practiced on a variety of organic hazardous wastes. Compared to the aerated activated sludge process, anaerobic digestion requires less energy; yields less sludge by-product; generates hydrogen sulfi de (H2S), which precipitates toxic heavy metal ions; and produces methane gas, CH4, which can be used as an energy source. The overall process for anaerobic digestion is a fermentation process in which organic matter is both oxidized and reduced. The simplified reaction for the anaerobic fermentation of a hypothetical organic substance, \u201c{CH2O},\u201d is the following: 2{CH2O} \u00c6 CO2 + CH4 (21.28) In practice, the microbial processes involved are quite complex. Most of the wastes for which anaerobic digestion is suitable consist of oxygenated compounds, such as acetaldehyde or methylethyl ketone. 21.8.4 REDUCTIVE DEHALOGENATION Reductive dehalogenation is a mechanism by which halogen atoms are removed from organohalide compounds by anaerobic bacteria. It is an important means of detoxifying alkyl halides (particularly solvents), aryl halides, and organochlorine pesticides, all of which are important hazardous waste compounds, and which were discarded in large quantities in some of the older waste disposal dumps. Reductive dehalogenation is the main means by which some of the more highly halogenated waste compounds are biodegraded; such compounds include tetrachloroethene, HCB, pentachlorophenol, and the more highly chlorinated PCB congeners (see dehalorespiration in Section 6.13). The two general processes by which reductive dehalogenation occurs are hydrogenolysis, as shown by the example in Reaction 21.29, (21.29) and vicinal reduction: HClH 2e \u2013H H (21.30) H C C C C C C Cl H H HHH 2Cl\u2013 HH Vicinal reduction removes two adjacent halogen atoms and works only on alkyl halides, not aryl halides. Both processes produce innocuous inorganic halide (Cl-). 21.9 PHYTOREMEDIATION Phytoremediation uses various kinds of plants including trees to treat soil and water contaminated with organic contaminants, heavy metals, and radionuclides. Although phytoremediation is generally regarded as using plants to remove pollutants from soil, it also includes growing plants on contaminated soil, often under conditions that are not normally conducive to plant growth. A cover of plants\u2014phytostabilization\u2014significantly reduces loss of pollutants from water or wind erosion and provides a soil medium conducive to pollutant biodegradation. Enhanced biodegradation of pollutants by microorganisms in the rhizosphere, where plant roots grow, is discussed in Section 16.10. One way in which plants act to decontaminate soil is by absorbing contaminants through their roots and transporting them to the rest of the plant. The plant biomass may then be burned or otherwise processed to remove the pollutants; use of plants to \u201cmine\u201d valuable metals, such as nickel, has even been seriously suggested. Beyond simple uptake of pollutants, growing plants have active enzyme systems, such as nitroreductase, dioxygenases, and laccases that can degrade organic pollutants.", "Plants that absorb volatile organic pollutants, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and MTBE have an undesirable tendency to release these materials to the atmosphere. Fast-growing, deep-rooted tree varieties are favorites for phytoremediation. Willows and poplars, including hybrid varieties that grow with spectacular rapidity, have been favored. Domestic crops including alfalfa, clover, corn, rye, sorghum, and soy have been used on soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. Tobacco plants bred for phytoremediation have been used on soils contaminated with cadmium, copper, and zinc. 21.10 LAND TREATMENT AND COMPOSTING 21.10.1 LAND TREATMENT Soil may be viewed as a natural filter for wastes. Soil has physical, chemical, and biological characteristics that can enable waste detoxification, biodegradation, chemical decomposition, and physical and chemical fi xation. Therefore, land treatment of wastes may be accomplished by mixing the wastes with soil under appropriate conditions. In many cases, the reclamation of contaminated soil to restore it to productivity is an important activity. Soil is a natural medium for a number of living organisms that may have an effect upon biodegradation of hazardous wastes. Of these, the most important are bacteria, including those from the genera Agrobacterium, Arthrobacteri, Bacillus, Flavobacterium, and Pseudomonas. Actinomycetes and fungi are important organisms in decay of vegetable matter and may be involved in biodegradation of wastes. Microorganisms useful for land treatment are usually present in sufficient numbers to provide the inoculum required for their growth. The growth of these indigenous microorganisms may be stimulated by adding nutrients and an electron acceptor to act as an oxidant (for aerobic degradation) accompanied by mixing. The most commonly added nutrients are nitrogen and phosphorus. Oxygen can be added by pumping air underground or by treatment with hydrogen peroxide, H2O2. In some cases, such as for treatment of hydrocarbons on or near the soil surface, simple tillage provides both oxygen and the mixing required for optimum microbial growth. Wastes that are amenable to land treatment are biodegradable organic substances. However, in soil contaminated with hazardous wastes, bacterial cultures may develop that are effective in degrading normally recalcitrant compounds through acclimation over a long period of time. Land treatment is most used for petroleum refining wastes and is applicable to the treatment of fuels and wastes from leaking underground storage tanks. It can also be applied to biodegradable organic chemical wastes, including some organohalide compounds. Land treatment is not suitable for the treatment of wastes containing acids, bases, toxic inorganic compounds, salts, heavy metals, and organic compounds that are excessively soluble, volatile, or fl ammable. 21.10.2 COMPOSTING Composting of hazardous wastes is the biodegradation of solid or solidified materials in a medium other than soil. Bulking material, such as plant residue, paper, municipal refuse, or sawdust may be added to retain water and enable air to penetrate to the waste material. Successful composting of hazardous waste depends upon a number of factors, including those discussed above under land treatment. The first of these is the selection of the appropriate microorganism or inoculum. Once a successful composting operation is underway, a good inoculum is maintained by recirculating spent compost to each new batch. Other parameters that must be controlled include oxygen supply, moisture content (which should be maintained at a minimum of about 40%), pH (usually around neutral), and temperature. The composting process generates heat, so if the mass of the compost pile is sufficiently high, it can be self-heating under most conditions. Some wastes are defi cient in nutrients, such as nitrogen, which must be supplied from commercial sources or from other wastes. 21.11 PREPARATION OF WASTES FOR DISPOSAL Immobilization, stabilization, fixation, and solidification are terms that describe sometimes overlapping techniques whereby hazardous wastes are placed in a form suitable for long-term disposal. These aspects of hazardous waste management are addressed below. 21.11.1 IMMOBILIZATION Immobilization includes physical and chemical processes that reduce surface areas of wastes to minimize leaching. It isolates the wastes from their environment, especially groundwater, so that they have the least possible tendency to migrate. This is accomplished by physically isolating the waste, reducing its solubility, and decreasing its surface area. Immobilization usually improves the handling and physical characteristics of wastes. 21.11.2 STABILIZATION Stabilization means the conversion of a waste from its original form to a physically and chemically more stable material that is less likely to cause problems during handling and disposal, and less likely to be mobile after disposal. Stabilization may include solidification (see below) and chemical reactions that generate products that are less volatile, soluble, and reactive.", "Stabilization is required for land disposal of wastes. Fixation is a stabilization process that binds a hazardous waste in a less mobile and less toxic form. 21.11.3 SOLIDIFICATION Solidifi cation may involve chemical reaction with a solidification agent, mechanical isolation in a protective binding matrix, or a combination of chemical and physical processes. It can be accomplished by evaporation of water from aqueous wastes or sludges, sorption onto solid material, reaction with cement, reaction with silicates, encapsulation, or imbedding in polymers or thermoplastics. In many solidification processes, such as reaction with portland cement, water is an important ingredient of the hydrated solid matrix. Therefore, the solid should not be heated excessively or exposed to extremely dry conditions, which could result in diminished structural integrity from loss of water. In some cases, however, heating a solidified waste is an essential part of the overall solidification procedure. For example, an iron hydroxide matrix can be converted to highly insoluble, refractory iron oxide by heating. Heating can convert organic constituents of solidified wastes to inert carbon. Heating is an integral part of the process of vitrification (see below). 21.11.3.1 Sorption to a Solid Matrix Material Hazardous waste liquids, emulsions, sludges, and free liquids in contact with sludges may be solidified and stabilized by fixing onto solid sorbents, including activated carbon (for organics), fl y ash, kiln dust, clays, vermiculite, and various proprietary materials. Sorption may convert liquids and semisolids to dry solids, improve waste handling, and reduce solubility of waste constituents, and can be used to improve waste compatibility with substances such as portland cement used for solidification and setting. Specific sorbents may also be used to stabilize pH and pE (a measure of the tendency of a medium to be oxidizing or reducing, see Chapter 4). The action of sorbents can include simple mechanical retention of wastes, physical sorption, and chemical reactions. It is important to match the sorbent to the waste. A substance with a strong affinity for water should be employed for wastes containing excess water and one with a strong affinity for organic materials should be used for wastes with excess organic solvents. 21.11.3.2 Thermoplastics and Organic Polymers Hazardous waste materials may be mixed with hot thermoplastic liquids and solidified in the cooled thermoplastic matrix, which is rigid but deformable. The thermoplastic material most used for this purpose is asphalt bitumen. Other thermoplastics, such as paraffin and polyethylene, have also been used to immobilize hazardous wastes. Among the wastes that can be immobilized with thermoplastics are those containing heavy metals, such as electroplating wastes. Organic thermoplastics repel water and reduce the tendency toward leaching in contact with groundwater. Compared to cement, thermoplastics add relatively less material to the waste. A technique similar to that described above uses organic polymers produced in contact with solid wastes to imbed the wastes in a polymer matrix. Three kinds of polymers that have been used for this purpose include polybutadiene, urea-formaldehyde, and vinyl ester-styrene polymers. This procedure is more complicated than is the use of thermoplastics but, in favorable cases, yields a product in which the waste is held more strongly. 21.11.3.3 Vitrif cation Vitrifi cation or glassifi cation consists of imbedding wastes in a glass material. In this application, glass may be regarded as a high-melting-temperature inorganic thermoplastic. Molten glass can be used or glass can be synthesized in contact with the waste by mixing and heating with glass constituents\u2014silicon dioxide (SiO2), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and calcium oxide (CaO). Other constituents may include boron oxide, B2O3, which yields a borosilicate glass that is especially resistant to changes in temperature and chemical attack. In some cases, glass is used in conjunction with thermal waste destruction processes, serving to immobilize hazardous waste ash constituents. Some wastes are detrimental to the quality of the glass. Aluminum oxide, for example, may prevent glass from fusing. Vitrifi cation is relatively complicated and expensive, the latter because of the energy consumed in fusing glass. Despite these disadvantages, it is the favored immobilization technique for some special wastes and has been promoted for solidification of radionuclear wastes because glass is chemically inert and resistant to leaching. However, high levels of radioactivity can cause deterioration of glass and lower its resistance to leaching. 21.11.3.4 Solidifcation with Cement Portland cement is widely used for solidification of hazardous wastes including wastes containing both metals and organic contaminants.", "In this application, portland cement provides a solid matrix for isolation of the wastes, chemically binds water from sludge wastes, and may react chemically with wastes (e.g., the calcium and base in portland cement react chemically with inorganic arsenic wastes to reduce their solubilities). However, most wastes are held physically in the rigid portland cement matrix and are subject to leaching. As a solidification matrix, portland cement is most applicable to inorganic sludges containing heavy metal ions that form insoluble hydroxides and carbonates in the basic carbonate medium provided by the cement. The success of solidifi cation with portland cement strongly depends upon whether or not the waste adversely affects the strength and stability of the concrete product. A number of substances\u2014organic matter such as petroleum or coal; some silts and clays; sodium salts of arsenate, borate, phosphate, iodate, and sulfide; and salts of copper, lead, magnesium, tin, and zinc\u2014are incompatible with portland cement because they interfere with its set and cure, producing a mechanically weak product and resulting in deterioration of the cement matrix with time. However, a reasonably good disposal form can be obtained by absorbing organic wastes with a solid material, which in turn is set in portland cement. 21.11.3.5 Solidifcation with Silicate Materials Water-insoluble silicates (pozzolanic substances), containing oxyanionic silicon such as SiO32-, are used for waste solidification. There are a number of such substances, some of which are waste products, including fly ash, flue dust, clay, calcium silicates, and ground-up slag from blast furnaces. Soluble silicates, such as sodium silicate, may also be used. Silicate solidification usually requires a setting agent, which may be portland cement (see above), gypsum (hydrated CaSO4), lime, or compounds of aluminum, magnesium, or iron. The product may vary from a granular material to a concrete-like solid. In some cases, the product is improved by additives, such as emulsifi ers, surfactants, activators, calcium chloride, clays, carbon, zeolites, and various proprietary materials. Success has been reported for the solidification of both inorganic wastes and organic wastes (including oily sludges) with silicates. The advantages and disadvantages of silicate solidifi cation are similar to those of portland cement discussed above. One consideration that is especially applicable to fly ash is the presence in some silicate materials of leachable hazardous substances, which may include arsenic and selenium. 21.11.3.6 Encapsulation As the name implies, encapsulation is used to coat wastes with an impervious material so that they do not come in contact with their surroundings. For example, a water-soluble waste salt encapsulated in asphalt would not dissolve so long as the asphalt layer remains intact. A common means of encapsulation uses heated, molten thermoplastics, asphalt, and waxes that solidify when cooled. A more sophisticated approach to encapsulation is to form polymeric resins from monomeric substances in the presence of the waste. 21.11.4 CHEMICAL FIXATION Chemical fixation is a process that binds a hazardous waste substance in a less mobile, less toxic form by a chemical reaction that alters the waste chemically. Physical and chemical fi xations often occur together, and sometimes it is a little difficult to distinguish between them. Polymeric inorganic silicates containing some calcium and often some aluminum are the inorganic materials most widely used as a fixation matrix. Many kinds of heavy metals are chemically bound in such a matrix, as well as being held physically by it. Similarly, some organic wastes are bound by reactions with matrix constituents. 21.12 ULTIMATE DISPOSAL OF WASTES Regardless of the destruction, treatment, and immobilization techniques used, there will always remain, from hazardous wastes, some material that has to be put somewhere. This section briefl y addresses the ultimate disposal of ash, salts, liquids, solidified liquids, and other residues that must be placed where their potential to do harm is minimized. 21.12.1 DISPOSAL ABOVEGROUND In some important respects, disposal aboveground, essentially in a pile designed to prevent erosion and water infiltration, is the best way to store solid wastes. Perhaps its most important advantage is that it avoids infiltration by groundwater that can result in leaching and groundwater contamination common to storage in pits and landfills. In a properly designed aboveground disposal facility, any leachate that is produced drains quickly by gravity to the leachate collection system where it can be detected and treated. Aboveground disposal can be accomplished with a storage mound deposited on a layer of compacted clay covered with impermeable membrane liners laid somewhat above the original soil surface and shaped to allow leachate flow and collection.", "The slopes around the edges of the storage mound should be sufficiently great to allow good drainage of precipitation, but gentle enough to deter erosion. 21.12.2 LANDFILL Landfi ll historically has been the most common way of disposing of solid hazardous wastes and some liquids, although it is being severely limited in many nations by new regulations and high land costs. Landfill involves disposal that is at least partially underground in excavated cells, quarries, or natural depressions. Usually, fill is continued above ground to utilize space most effi ciently and provide a grade for drainage of precipitation. The greatest environmental concern with landfill of hazardous wastes is the generation of leachate from infiltrating surface water and groundwater with resultant contamination of groundwater supplies. Modern hazardous waste landfills provide elaborate systems to contain, collect, and control such leachate. There are several components in a modern landfill. A landfill should be placed on a compacted, low-permeability medium, preferably clay, which is covered by a fl exible-membrane liner consisting of watertight impermeable material. This liner is covered with granular material in which is installed a secondary drainage system. Next is another flexible-membrane liner, above which is installed a primary drainage system for the removal of leachate. This drainage system is covered with a layer of granular filter medium, upon which the wastes are placed. In the landfi ll, wastes of different kinds are separated by berms consisting of clay or soil covered with liner material. When the fi ll is complete, the waste is capped to prevent surface water infi ltration and covered with compacted soil. In addition to leachate collection, provision may be made for a system to treat evolved gases, particularly when methane-generating biodegradable materials are disposed in the landfi ll. The flexible-membrane liner made of rubber (including chlorosulfonated polyethylene) or plastic (including chlorinated polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, and PVC) is a key component of state-of-the-art landfills. It controls seepage out of, and infiltration into, the landfi ll. Obviously, liners have to meet stringent standards to serve their intended purpose. In addition to being impermeable, the liner material must be strongly resistant to biodegradation, chemical attack, and tearing. Capping is done to cover the wastes, prevent infiltration of excessive amounts of surface water, and prevent release of wastes to overlying soil and the atmosphere. Caps come in a variety of forms and are often multilayered. Some of the problems that may occur with caps are settling, erosion, ponding, damage by rodents, and penetration by plant roots. 21.12.3 SURFACE IMPOUNDMENT OF LIQUIDS Many liquid hazardous wastes, slurries, and sludges are placed in surface impoundments, which usually serve for treatment and often are designed to be filled in eventually as landfill disposal sites. Most liquid hazardous wastes and a significant fraction of solids are placed in surface impoundments in some stage of treatment, storage, or disposal. A surface impoundment may consist of an excavated \u201cpit,\u201d a structure formed with dikes, or a combination thereof. The construction is similar to that discussed above for landfills in that the bottom and walls should be impermeable to liquids and provision must be made for leachate collection. The chemical and mechanical challenges to liner materials in surface impoundments are severe so that proper geological siting and construction with fl oors and walls composed of low-permeability soil and clay are important in preventing pollution from these installations. 21.12.4 DEEP-WELL DISPOSAL OF LIQUIDS Deep-well disposal of liquids consists of their injection under pressure to underground strata isolated by impermeable rock strata from aquifers. Early experience with this method was gained in the petroleum industry where disposal is required for large quantities of saline wastewater coproduced with crude oil. The method was later extended to the chemical industry for the disposal of brines, acids, heavy metal solutions, organic liquids, and other liquids. A number of factors must be considered in deep-well disposal. Wastes are injected into a region of elevated temperature and pressure, which may cause chemical reactions to occur involving the waste constituents and the mineral strata. Oils, solids, and gases in the liquid wastes can cause problems such as clogging. Corrosion may be severe. Microorganisms may have some effects. Most problems from these causes can be mitigated by proper waste pretreatment. The most serious consideration involving deep-well disposal is the potential contamination of groundwater. Although injection is made into permeable saltwater aquifers presumably isolated from aquifers that contain potable water, contamination may occur. Major routes of contamination include fractures, faults, and other wells.", "The disposal well itself can act as a route for contamination if it is not properly constructed and cased (lined with pipe) or if it is damaged. 21.13 LEACHATE AND GAS EMISSIONS 21.13.1 LEACHATE The production of contaminated leachate is a possibility with most disposal sites.5 Therefore, new hazardous waste landfills require leachate collection/treatment systems as discussed in Section 21.12 and many older sites are required to have such systems retrofitted to them. Chemical and biochemical processes have the potential to cause some problems for leachate collection systems. One such problem is clogging by insoluble manganese(IV) and iron(III) hydrated oxides upon exposure to air as described for water wells in Section 15.8. Leachate consists of water that has become contaminated by wastes as it passes through a waste disposal site. It contains waste constituents that are soluble, not retained by soil, and not degraded chemically or biochemically. Some potentially harmful leachate constituents are products of chemical or biochemical transformations of wastes. The best approach to leachate management is to prevent its production by limiting infi ltration of water into the site. Rates of leachate production may be very low when sites are selected, designed, and constructed with minimal production of leachate as a major objective. A well maintained, low-permeability cap over the landfill is very important for leachate minimization. 21.13.2 HAZARDOUS WASTE LEACHATE TREATMENT The first step in treating leachate is to characterize it fully, particularly with a thorough chemical analysis of possible waste constituents and their chemical and metabolic products. The biodegradability of leachate constituents should also be determined. The options available for the treatment of hazardous waste leachate are generally the physical, chemical, and biochemical processes used to treat industrial wastewaters as discussed earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 8. 21.13.3 GAS EMISSIONS In the presence of biodegradable wastes, methane and carbon dioxide gases are produced in landfi lls by anaerobic degradation (see Reaction 21.28). Gases may also be produced by chemical processes with improperly pretreated wastes, as would occur in the hydrolysis of calcium carbide to produce acetylene: CaC2 + 2H2O \u00c6 C2H2 + Ca(OH)2 (21.31) Odorous and toxic hydrogen sulfi de, H2S, may be generated by the chemical reaction of sulfi des with acids or by the biochemical reduction of sulfate by anaerobic bacteria (Desulfovibrio) in the presence of biodegradable organic matter: 2-+ Anaerobic SO + 2{CH O} + 2H \u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00c6 HS + 2CO + 2H O (21.32) 4 2 bacteria 2 2 2 Gases such as these may be toxic, combustible, or explosive. Furthermore, gases permeating through landfilled hazardous waste may carry along waste vapors, such as those of volatile aryl compounds and low-molar-mass halogenated hydrocarbons. Of these, the ones of most concern are benzene, 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrachloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride. Because of the hazards from these and other volatile species, it is important to minimize production of gases and, if significant amounts of gases are produced, they should be vented or treated by activated carbon sorption or fl aring. 21.14 IN SITU TREATMENT In situ treatment refers to waste treatment processes that can be applied to wastes in a disposal site by direct application of treatment processes and reagents to the wastes. Where possible, in situ treatment is desirable for waste site remediation. 21.14.1 IN SITU IMMOBILIZATION In situ immobilization is used to convert wastes to insoluble forms that will not leach from the disposal site. Heavy metal contaminants including lead, cadmium, zinc, and mercury can be immobilized by chemical precipitation as the sulfides by treatment with gaseous H2S or alkaline Na2S solution. Disadvantages include the high toxicity of H2S and the contamination potential of soluble sulfide. Although precipitated metal sulfides should remain as solids in the anaerobic conditions of a landfi ll, unintentional exposure to air can result in oxidation of the sulfide and remobilization of the metals as soluble sulfate salts. Oxidation and reduction reactions can be used to immobilize heavy metals in situ. Oxidation of soluble Fe2+ and Mn2+ to their insoluble hydrous oxides, Fe2O3 . xH2O and MnO2 . xH2O, respectively, can precipitate these metal ions and coprecipitate other heavy metal ions. However, subsurface reducing conditions could later result in reformation of soluble reduced species. Reduction can be used in situ to convert soluble, toxic chromate to insoluble chromium(III) compounds. Chelation may convert metal ions to less mobile forms, although with most agents chelation has the opposite effect. The humin fraction of soil humic substances immobilizes metal ions.", "21.14.2 VAPOR EXTRACTION Many important wastes have relatively high vapor pressures and can be removed by vapor extraction. This technique works for wastes in soil above the level of groundwater, that is, in the vadose zone. Simple in concept, vapor extraction involves pumping air into injection wells in soil and withdrawing it, along with volatile components that it has picked up, through extraction wells. The substances vaporized from the soil are removed by activated carbon or by other means. In some cases, the air is pumped through an engine (which can be used to run the air pumps) and organic vapors are destroyed by conditions in the engine\u2019s combustion chambers. Pumping air is relatively efficient compared to groundwater pumping because of the much higher fl ow rates of air through soil compared to water. Vapor extraction is most applicable to the removal of VOCs such as chloromethanes, chloroethanes, chloroethylenes (such as trichloroethylene), benzene, toluene, and xylene. 21.14.3 SOLIDIFICATION IN SITU In situ solidification can be used as a remedial measure at hazardous waste sites. One approach is to inject soluble silicates followed by reagents that cause them to solidify. For example, injection of soluble sodium silicate followed by calcium chloride or lime forms solid calcium silicate. 21.14.4 DETOXIFICATION IN SITU When only one or a limited number of harmful constituents is present in a waste disposal site, it may be practical to consider detoxifi cation in situ. This approach is most practical for organic contaminants including pesticides (organophosphate esters and carbamates), amides, and esters. Among the chemical and biochemical processes that can detoxify such materials are chemical and enzymatic oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis. Chemical oxidants that have been proposed for this purpose include hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and hypochlorite. Enzyme extracts collected from microbial cultures and purified have been considered for in situ detoxification. One cell-free enzyme that has been used for detoxification of organophosphate insecticides is parathion hydrolase. The hostile environment of a chemical waste landfi ll, including the presence of enzyme-inhibiting heavy metal ions, is detrimental to many biochemical approaches to in situ treatment. Furthermore, most sites contain a mixture of hazardous constituents, which might require several different enzymes for their detoxifi cation. 21.14.5 PERMEABLE BED TREATMENT Some groundwater plumes contaminated by dissolved wastes can be treated by subsurface permeable reactive barriers consisting of a permeable bed of material placed in a trench through which the groundwater must flow. Limestone in a permeable bed neutralizes acid and precipitates some heavy metal hydroxides or carbonates. Synthetic ion-exchange resins can be used in a permeable bed to retain heavy metals and even some anionic species, although competition with ionic species present naturally in the groundwater can cause some problems with their use. Activated carbon in a permeable bed will remove some organics, especially less soluble, higher-molar-mass organic compounds. Granular zerovalent iron [iron(0)] offers some advantages as a permeable bed medium.6 This material acts as a reducing agent and can dechlorinate organochlorine compounds, which are resistant to biodegradation. In addition to treating groundwaters contaminated with organochlorine compounds, permeable barriers containing zerovalent iron have been used to treat groundwaters polluted with inorganics, metals, munition wastes, radionuclides, and various other pollutants. Permeable bed treatment requires relatively large quantities of reagent, which argues against the use of activated carbon and ion-exchange resins. In such an application, it is unlikely that either of these materials could be reclaimed and regenerated as is done when they are used in columns to treat wastewater. Furthermore, ions taken up by ion exchangers and organic species retained by activated carbon may be released at a later time, causing subsequent problems. Finally, a permeable bed that has been truly effective in collecting waste materials may, itself, be considered a hazardous waste requiring special treatment and disposal. 21.14.6 IN SITU THERMAL PROCESSES Heating of wastes in situ can be used to remove or destroy some kinds of hazardous substances. Steam injection, radio frequency, and microwave heating have been proposed for this purpose. Volatile wastes brought to the surface by heating can be collected and held as condensed liquids or by activated carbon. One approach to immobilizing wastes in situ is high temperature vitrification using electrical heating. This process involves pouring conducting graphite on the surface between two electrodes and passing an electric current between the electrodes. In principle, the graphite becomes very hot and \u201cmelts\u201d into the soil leaving a glassy slag in its path.", "Volatile species evolved are collected and, if the operation is successful, a nonleachable slag is left in place. It is easy to imagine problems that might occur, including difficulties in getting a uniform melt, problems from groundwater infi ltration, and very high consumption of electricity. 21.14.7 SOIL WASHING AND FLUSHING Extraction with water containing various additives can be used to cleanse soil contaminated with hazardous wastes. When the soil is left in place and the water pumped into and out of it, the process is called fl ushing; when soil is removed and contacted with liquid the process is referred to as washing. Here, washing is used as a term applied to both processes. The composition of the fluid used for soil washing depends upon the contaminants to be removed. The washing medium may consist of pure water or it may contain acids (to leach out metals or neutralize alkaline soil contaminants), bases (to neutralize contaminant acids), chelating agents (to solubilize heavy metals), surfactants (to enhance the removal of organic contaminants from soil and improve the ability of the water to emulsify insoluble organic species), or reducing agents (to reduce oxidized species). Soil contaminants may dissolve, form emulsions, or react chemically. Heavy metal salts; lighter aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene and xylenes; lighter organohalides, such as trichloro- or tetrachloroethylene; and light-to-medium molar mass aldehydes and ketones can be removed from soil by washing.

These effects are addressed under the topic of \u201cToxicological Chemistry\u201d in Chapter 23, and for specific substances in Chapter 24. This chapter is designed to provide the fundamental background in biochemistry required to understand toxicological chemistry. Most people have had the experience of looking through a microscope at a single cell. It may have been an ameba, alive and oozing about like a blob of jelly on the microscope slide, or a cell of bacteria, stained with a dye to make it show up more plainly. Or, it may have been a beautiful cell of algae with its bright green chlorophyll. Even the simplest of these cells is capable of carrying out a thousand or more chemical reactions. These life processes fall under the heading of biochemistry, that branch of chemistry that deals with the chemical properties, composition, and biologically-mediated processes of complex substances in living systems.1 Biochemical phenomena that occur in living organisms are extremely sophisticated. In the human body, complex metabolic processes break down a variety of food materials to simpler chemicals, yielding energy and the raw materials to build body constituents such as muscle, blood, and brain tissue. Impressive as this may be, consider a humble microscopic cell of photosynthetic cyanobacteria only about a micrometer in size, which requires only a few simple inorganic chemicals and sunlight for its existence. This cell uses sunlight energy to convert carbon from CO2, hydrogen and oxygen from H2O, nitrogen from NO3 -, sulfur from SO42-, and phosphorus from inorganic phosphate into all the proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and other materials that it requires to exist and reproduce. Such a simple cell accomplishes what could not be done by humans in even a vast chemical factory costing billions of dollars. Ultimately, most environmental pollutants and hazardous substances are of concern because of their effects upon living organisms. The study of the adverse effects of substances on life processes requires some basic knowledge of biochemistry. Biochemistry is discussed in this chapter, with emphasis upon aspects that are especially pertinent to environmentally hazardous and toxic substances, including cell membranes, DNA, and enzymes. Biochemical processes not only are profoundly influenced by chemical species in the environment, they largely determine the nature of these species, their degradation, and even their syntheses, particularly in the aquatic and soil environments. The study of such phenomena forms the basis of environmental biochemistry.2 22.1.1 BIOMOLECULES The biomolecules that constitute matter in living organisms often are polymers with molecular masses of the order of a million or even larger. As discussed later in this chapter, these biomolecules may be divided into the categories of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Proteins and nucleic acids consist of macromolecules, lipids are usually relatively small molecules, and carbohydrates range from small sugar molecules to high molar mass macromolecules such as those in cellulose.", "The behavior of a substance in a biological system depends to a large extent upon whether the substance is hydrophilic (\u201cwater-loving\u201d) or hydrophobic (\u201cwater-hating\u201d). Some important toxic substances are hydrophobic, a characteristic that enables them to traverse cell membranes readily. Part of the detoxification process carried on by living organisms is to render such molecules hydrophilic, therefore water-soluble and readily eliminated from the body. 22.2 BIOCHEMISTRY AND THE CELL The focal point of biochemistry and biochemical aspects of toxicants is the cell, the basic building block of living systems where most life processes are carried out. Bacteria, yeasts, and some algae consist of single cells. However, most living things are made up of many cells. In a more complicated organism, the cells have different functions. Liver cells, muscle cells, brain cells, and skin cells in the human body are quite different from each other and do different things. Cells are divided into two major categories depending upon whether or not they have a nucleus: eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and prokaryotic cells do not. Prokaryotic cells are found predominately in single-celled organisms such as bacteria. Eukaryotic cells occur in multicellular plants and animals\u2014higher life forms. 22.2.1 MAJOR CELL FEATURES Figure 22.1 shows the major features of the eukaryotic cell, which is the basic structure in which biochemical processes occur in multicellular organisms. These features are the following: \u2022 Cell membrane, which encloses the cell and regulates the passage of ions, nutrients, lipid-soluble (\u201cfat-soluble\u201d) substances, metabolic products, toxicants, and toxicant metabolites into and out of the cell interior because of its varying permeability for different substances. The cell membrane protects the contents of the cell from undesirable outside infl uences. Cell membranes are composed in part of phospholipids that are arranged with their hydrophilic (\u201cwater-seeking\u201d) heads on the cell membrane surfaces and their hydrophobic (\u201cwater-repelling\u201d) tails inside the membrane. Cell membranes contain bodies of proteins that are involved in the transport of some substances through the membrane. One reason the cell membrane is very important in toxicology and environmental biochemistry is because it regulates the passage of toxicants and their products into and out of the cell interior. Furthermore, when its membrane is damaged by toxic substances, a cell may not function properly and the organism may be harmed. Cell wall Golgi bodyCell membrane Mitochondria Vacuole Lysosome Starch grain ChloroplastRibosome \u2022 Cell nucleus, which acts as a sort of \u201ccontrol center\u201d of the cell. It contains the genetic directions the cell needs to reproduce itself. The key substance in the nucleus is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Chromosomes in the cell nucleus are made up of combinations of DNA and proteins. Each chromosome stores a separate quantity of genetic information. Human cells contain 46 chromosomes. When DNA in the nucleus is damaged by foreign substances, various toxic effects, including mutations, cancer, birth defects, and defective immune system function may occur. \u2022 Cytoplasm, which fills the interior of the cell not occupied by the nucleus. Cytoplasm is further divided into a water-soluble proteinaceous fi ller called cytosol, in which are suspended bodies called cellular organelles, such as mitochondria or, in photosynthetic organisms, chloroplasts. \u2022 Mitochondria, \u201cpowerhouses\u201d which mediate energy conversion and utilization in the cell. Mitochondria are sites in which food materials\u2014carbohydrates, proteins, and fats\u2014are broken down to yield carbon dioxide, water, and energy, which is then used by the cell. The best example of this is the oxidation of the sugar glucose, C6H12O6: C6H12O6 + 6O2 \u00c6 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy This kind of process is called cellular respiration. \u2022 Ribosomes, which participate in protein synthesis. \u2022 Endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in the metabolism of some toxicants by enzymatic processes. \u2022 Lysosome, a type of organelle that contains potent substances capable of digesting liquid food material. Such material enters the cell through a \u201cdent\u201d in the cell wall, which eventually becomes surrounded by cell material. This surrounded material is called a food vacuole. The vacuole merges with a lysosome and the substances in the lysosome bring about the digestion of the food material. The digestion process consists largely of hydrolysis reactions in which large, complicated food molecules are broken down into smaller units by the addition of water. \u2022 Golgi bodies, that occur in some types of cells. These are flattened bodies of material that serve to hold and release substances produced by the cells. \u2022 Cell walls of plant cells. These are strong structures that provide stiffness and strength.", "Cell walls are composed mostly of cellulose, which will be discussed later in this chapter. \u2022 Vacuoles inside plant cells that often contain materials dissolved in water. \u2022 Chloroplasts in plant cells that are involved in photosynthesis (the chemical process which uses energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water to organic matter). Photosynthesis occurs in these bodies. Food produced by photosynthesis is stored in the chloroplasts in the form of starch grains. 22.3 PROTEINS Proteins are nitrogen-containing organic compounds which are the basic units of live systems. Cytoplasm, the jelly-like liquid filling the interior of cells, is largely protein. Enzymes, which act as catalysts of life reactions, are proteins; they are discussed later in the chapter. Proteins are made up of amino acids joined together in huge chains. Amino acids are organic compounds which contain the carboxylic acid group, -CO2H, and the amino group, -NH2. They are sort of a hybrid of carboxylic acids and amines. Proteins are polymers or macromolecules of amino acids containing from approximately 40 to several thousand amino acid groups joined by peptide linkages. Smaller molecule amino acid polymers, containing only about 10\u201340 amino acids per molecule, are called polypeptides. A portion of the amino acid left after the elimination of H2O during polymerization is called a residue. The amino acid sequence of these residues is designated by a series of three-letter abbreviations for the amino acid. Natural amino acids all have the following chemical group: O R C C OH H In this structure, the -NH2 group is always bonded to the carbon next to the -CO2H group. This is called the \u201calpha\u201d location, so natural amino acids are a-amino acids. Other groups, designated as \u201cR,\u201d are attached to the basic a-amino acid structure. The R groups may be as simple as an atom of H found in glycine, H H H N O H + HN O H C C OH Zwitterion form H C C O\u2013 H Glycine H or, they may be as complicated as the structure, H found in tryptophan. There are 20 common amino acids in proteins, examples of which are shown in Figure 22.2. The amino acids are shown with uncharged -NH2 and -CO2H groups. Actually, these functional groups exist in the charged zwitterion form as shown for glycine, above. Amino acids in proteins are joined together by a specific bond called the peptide linkage. The formation of peptide linkages is a condensation process involving the loss of water. Consider as an example the condensation of alanine, leucine, and tyrosine, as shown in Figure 22.3. When these three amino acids join together, two water molecules are eliminated. The product is a tripeptide since there are three amino acids involved. The amino acids in proteins are linked as shown for this tripeptide, except that many more monomeric amino acid groups are involved. Proteins may be divided into several major types that have widely varying functions. These are given in Table 22.1.

This is what makes life so diverse. Proteins have primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The structures of protein molecules determine the behavior of proteins in crucial areas such as the processes by which the body\u2019s immune system recognizes substances that are foreign to the body.", "Proteinaceous enzymes depend upon their structures for the very specific functions of the enzymes. The order of amino acids in the protein molecule determines its primary structure. Secondary protein structures result from the folding of polypeptide protein chains to produce a maximum number of hydrogen bonds between them: Hydrogen bonds Illustration of hydrogen bonds betweenC O H N N and O atoms in peptide linkages, which N H constitute protein secondary structures OC Hydrogen bonds TABLE 22.1 Major Types of Proteins Type of Protein Example Function and Characteristics Nutrient Casein (milk protein) Food source. People must have an adequate supply of nutrient protein with the right balance of amino acids for adequate nutrition Storage Ferritin Storage of iron in animal tissues Structural Collagen (tendons) keratin (hair) Structural and protective components in organisms Contractile Actin, myosin in Strong, fibrous proteins that can contract muscle tissue and cause movement to occur Transport Hemoglobin Transport inorganic and organic species across cell membranes, in blood, between organs Defense \u2014 Antibodies against foreign agents such as viruses produced by the immune system Regulatory Insulin, human growth hormone Regulate biochemical processes such as sugar metabolism or growth by binding to sites inside cells or on cell membranes Enzymes Acetylcholinesterase Catalysts of biochemical reactions (see Section 22.6) The nature of the R groups on the amino acids determines the secondary structure. Small R groups enable protein molecules to be hydrogen-bonded together in a parallel arrangement. With larger R groups, the molecules tend to take a spiral form. Such a spiral is known as an a-helix. Tertiary structures are formed by the twisting of a-helices into specific shapes. They are produced and held in place by the interactions of amino side chains on the amino acid residues constituting the protein macromolecules. Tertiary protein structure is very important in the processes by which enzymes identify specific proteins and other molecules upon which they act. It is also involved with the action of antibodies in blood which recognize foreign proteins by their shape and react to them. This is basically what happens in the case of immunity to a disease where antibodies in blood recognize specific proteins from viruses or bacteria and reject them. Two or more protein molecules consisting of separate polypeptide chains may be further attracted to each other to produce a quaternary structure. Some proteins are fi brous proteins, which occur in skin, hair, wool, feathers, silk, and tendons. The molecules in these proteins are long and threadlike and are laid out parallel in bundles. Fibrous proteins are quite tough and they do not dissolve in water. Aside from fibrous protein, the other major type of protein form is the globular protein. These proteins are in the shape of balls and oblongs. Globular proteins are relatively soluble in water. A typical globular protein is hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Enzymes are generally globular proteins. 22.3.2 DENATURATION OF PROTEINS Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary protein structures are easily changed by a process called denaturation. These changes can be quite damaging. Heating, exposure to acids or bases, and even violent physical action can cause denaturation to occur. The albumin protein in egg white is denatured by heating so that it forms a semisolid mass. Almost the same thing is accomplished by the violent physical action of an egg beater in the preparation of meringue. Heavy metal poisons such as lead and cadmium change the structures of proteins by binding to functional groups on the protein surface. 22.4 CARBOHYDRATES Carbohydrates have the approximate simple formula CH2O and include a diverse range of substances composed of simple sugars such as glucose: Glucose molecule High-molar-mass polysaccharides, such as starch and glycogen (\u201canimal starch\u201d), are biopolymers of simple sugars. When photosynthesis occurs in a plant cell, the energy from sunlight is converted to chemical energy in a carbohydrate. This carbohydrate may be transferred to some other part of the plant for use as an energy source. It may be converted to a water-insoluble carbohydrate for storage until it is needed for energy. Or it may be transformed to cell wall material and become part of the structure of the plant. If the plant is eaten by an animal, the carbohydrate is used for energy by the animal. The simplest carbohydrates are the monosaccharides, also called simple sugars. Because they have six carbon atoms, simple sugars are sometimes called hexoses. Glucose (formula shown above) is the most common simple sugar involved in cell processes.", "Other simple sugars with the same CH2OH CH2OH CH2OH C O C O C O H HH H H HH H H C C C C C C OH H OH H OH H O OO O C C C C C C H OH H OH H OH FIGURE 22.4 Part of a starch molecule showing units of C6H10O5 condensed together. formula but somewhat different structures are fructose, mannose, and galactose. These must be changed to glucose before they can be used in a cell. Because of its use for energy in body processes, glucose is found in the blood. Normal levels are from 65 to 110 mg glucose per 100 mL of blood. Higher levels may indicate diabetes. Units of two monosaccharides make up several very important sugars known as disaccharides. When two molecules of monosaccharides join together to form a disaccharide, C6H12O6 + C6H12O6 \u00c6 C12H22O11 + H2O (22.1) a molecule of water is lost. Recall that proteins are also formed from smaller amino acid molecules by condensation reactions involving the loss of water molecules. Disaccharides include sucrose (cane sugar used as a sweetener), lactose (milk sugar), and maltose (a product of the breakdown of starch). Polysaccharides consist of many simple sugar units hooked together. One of the most important polysaccharides is starch, which is produced by plants for food storage. Animals produce a related material called glycogen. The chemical formula of starch is (C6H10O5)n, where n may represent a number as high as several hundreds. What this means is that the very large starch molecule consists of many units of C6H10O5 joined together. For example, if n is 100, there are 6 times 100 carbon atoms, 10 times 100 hydrogen atoms, and 5 times 100 oxygen atoms in the molecule. Its chemical formula is C600H1000O500. The atoms in a starch molecule are actually present as linked rings represented by the structure shown in Figure 22.4. Starch occurs in many foods, such as bread and cereals. It is readily digested by animals, including humans. Cellulose is a polysaccharide which is also made up of C6H10O5 units. Molecules of cellulose are huge, with molecular masses of around 400,000. The cellulose structure (Figure 22.5) is similar to that of starch. Cellulose is produced by plants and forms the structural material of plant cell walls. Wood is about 60% cellulose and cotton contains over 90% of this material. Fibers of cellulose are extracted from wood and pressed together to make paper. Humans and most other animals cannot digest cellulose because they lack the enzyme needed to hydrolyze the oxygen linkages between the glucose molecules. Ruminant animals (cattle, sheep, goats, moose) have bacteria in their stomachs that break down cellulose into products which can be used by the animal. Chemical processes are available to convert cellulose to simple sugars by the reaction (C HO) + nHO \u00c6 nCHO 610 5 n 2 6 12 6 (22.2) Cellulose Glucose CH2OH H OH CH2OH CH2OH FIGURE 22.5 Part of the structure of cellulose. where n may be 2000\u20133000. This involves breaking the linkages between units of C6H10O5 by adding a molecule of H2O at each linkage, a hydrolysis reaction. Large amounts of cellulose from wood, sugarcane, and agricultural products go to waste each year. The hydrolysis of cellulose enables these products to be converted to sugars, which can be fed to animals. Carbohydrate groups are attached to protein molecules in a special class of materials called glycoproteins. Collagen is a crucial glycoprotein that provides structural integrity to body parts. It is a major constituent of skin, bones, tendons, and cartilage. 22.5 LIPIDS Lipids are substances that can be extracted from plant or animal matter by organic solvents, such as chloroform, diethyl ether, or toluene (Figure 22.6). Whereas carbohydrates and proteins are characterized predominately by the monomers (monosaccharides and amino acids) from which they are composed, lipids are defined essentially by their physical characteristic of organophilicity. The most common lipids are fats and oils composed of triglycerides formed from the alcohol glycerol, CH2(OH) CH(OH)CH2OH, and a long-chain fatty acid such as stearic acid, CH3(CH2)16COOH, as shown in H O (C15H31) C O C (C15H31) H Cetyl palmitate H O O H C O C R R C O C H H C O C R H O FIGURE 22.7 General formula of triglycerides, which make up fats and oils. The R group is from a fatty acid and is a hydrocarbon chain, such as \u2013(CH2)16CH3. Figure 22.7.", "Numerous other biological materials, including waxes, cholesterol, and some vitamins and hormones, are classified as lipids. Common foods such as butter and salad oils are lipids. The longer chain fatty acids such as stearic acid are also organic-soluble and are classified as lipids. Lipids are toxicologically important for several reasons. Some toxic substances interfere with lipid metabolism, leading to detrimental accumulation of lipids. Many toxic organic compounds are poorly soluble in water but are lipid-soluble, so that bodies of lipids in organisms serve to dissolve and store toxicants. An important class of lipids consists of phosphoglycerides (glycerophosphatides), which may be regarded as triglycerides in which one of the acids bonded to glycerol is orthophosphoric acid. These lipids are especially important because they are essential constituents of cell membranes. These membranes consist of bilayers in which the hydrophilic phosphate ends of the molecules are on the outside of the membrane and the hydrophobic \u201ctails\u201d of the molecules are on the inside. Waxes are also esters of fatty acids. However, the alcohol in a wax is not glycerol, but is often a very long chain alcohol. For example, one of the main compounds in beeswax is myricyl palmitate in which the alcohol portion of the ester has a very large hydrocarbon chain: Alcohol portion Fatty acid portion of ester of ester Waxes are produced by both plants and animals, largely as protective coatings. Waxes are found in a number of common products. Lanolin is one of these. It is the \u201cgrease\u201d in sheep\u2019s wool. When mixed with oils and water, it forms stable colloidal emulsions consisting of extremely small oil droplets suspended in water. This makes lanolin useful for skin creams and pharmaceutical ointments. Carnauba wax occurs as a coating on the leaves of some Brazilian palm trees. Spermaceti wax is composed largely of cetyl palmitate (below), extracted from the blubber of the sperm whale. It is very useful in some cosmetics and pharmaceutical preparations. Steroids are lipids found in living systems which all have the ring system shown in Figure 22.8 for cholesterol. Steroids occur in bile salts, which are produced by the liver and then secreted into the intestines. Their breakdown products contribute to the characteristic color of feces. Bile salts act upon fats in the intestine. They suspend very tiny fat droplets in the form of colloidal emulsions. This enables the fats to be broken down chemically and digested. Some steroids are hormones. Hormones act as \u201cmessengers\u201d from one part of the body to another. As such, they start and stop a number of body functions. Male and female sex hormones (estrogens) are examples of steroid hormones. Hormones are given off by glands in the body called endocrine glands. The locations of important endocrine glands are shown in Figure 22.9. CH3 H3C C CH2 CH2 CH2 C H H3C H CH3 H3C Cholesterol, a typical steroid HO FIGURE 22.8 Steroids are characterized by the ring structure shown above for cholesterol. 22.6 ENZYMES Catalysts are substances that speed up a chemical reaction without themselves being consumed in the reaction. The most sophisticated catalysts of all are those found in living systems. They bring about reactions that could not be performed at all, or only with great difficulty, outside a living organism. These catalysts are called enzymes. In addition to speeding up reactions by as much as ten- to a hundred million-fold, enzymes are extremely selective in the reactions they promote. Enzymes are proteinaceous substances with highly specific structures that interact with particular substances or classes of substances called substrates. Enzymes act as catalysts to enable biochemical reactions to occur, after which they are regenerated intact to take part in additional reactions. The extremely high specificity with which enzymes interact with substrates results from their \u201clock and key\u201d action based upon the unique shapes of enzymes as illustrated in Figure 22.10. This illustration shows that an enzyme \u201crecognizes\u201d a particular substrate by its molecular structure and binds to it to produce an enzyme\u2013substrate complex. This complex then breaks apart to form one or more products different from the original substrate, regenerating the unchanged enzyme, which is then available to catalyze additional reactions. The basic process for an enzyme reaction is, therefore, enzyme + substrate enzyme -substrate complex enzyme + product (22.3) Several important things should be noted about this reaction. As shown in Figure 22.10, an enzyme acts upon a specific substrate to form an enzyme\u2013substrate complex because of the fi t between their structures.", "As a result, something happens to the substrate molecule. For example, it might be split in two at a particular location. Then the enzyme\u2013substrate complex comes apart, yielding the enzyme and products. The enzyme is not changed in the reaction and is now free to Products Regenerated enzyme react again. Note that the arrows in the formula for enzyme reaction point both ways. This means that the reaction is reversible. An enzyme\u2013substrate complex can simply go back to the enzyme and the substrate. The products of an enzymatic reaction can react with the enzyme to form the enzyme\u2013 substrate complex again. It, in turn, may again form the enzyme and the substrate. Therefore, the same enzyme may act to cause a reaction to go either way. Some enzymes cannot function by themselves. In order to work, they must first be attached to coenzymes. Coenzymes normally are not protein materials. Some of the vitamins are important coenzymes. Enzymes are named based on what they do. For example, the enzyme given off by the stomach, which splits proteins as part of the digestion process, is called gastric proteinase. The \u201cgastric\u201d part of the name refers to the enzyme\u2019s origin in the stomach. The \u201cproteinase\u201d denotes that it splits up protein molecules. The common name for this enzyme is pepsin. Similarly, the enzyme produced by the pancreas that breaks down fats (lipids) is called pancreatic lipase. Its common name is steapsin. In general, lipase enzymes cause lipid triglycerides to dissociate and form glycerol and fatty acids. The enzymes mentioned above are hydrolyzing enzymes, which bring about the breakdown of high-molecular-mass biological compounds and add water. This is one of the most important types of the reactions involved in digestion. The three main classes of energy-yielding foods that animals eat are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Recall that the higher carbohydrates humans eat are largely disaccharides (sucrose, or table sugar) and polysaccharides (starch). These are formed by the joining together of units of simple sugars, C6H12O6, with the elimination of an H2O molecule at the linkage where they join. Proteins are formed by the condensation of amino acids, again with the elimination of a water molecule at each linkage. Fats are esters that are produced when glycerol and fatty acids link together. A water molecule is lost for each of these linkages when a protein, fat, or carbohydrate is synthesized. In order for these substances to be used as a food source, the reverse process must occur to break down large, complicated molecules of protein, fat, or carbohydrate to simple, soluble substances which can penetrate a cell membrane and take part in chemical processes in the cell. This reverse process is accomplished by hydrolyzing enzymes. H O O H O H H H + CO2 (22.4) Pyruvic acid Acetaldehyde Biological compounds with long chains of carbon atoms are broken down into molecules with shorter chains by the breaking of carbon\u2013carbon bonds. This commonly occurs by the elimination of CO2 from carboxylic acids. For example, pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme acts upon pyruvic acid, to split off CO2 and produce a compound with one less carbon. It is by such carbon-by-carbon break down reactions that long chain compounds are eventually degraded to CO2 in the body, or that long-chain hydrocarbons undergo biodegradation by the action of microorganisms in the water and soil environments. Oxidation and reduction are the major reactions for the exchange of energy in living systems. Cellular respiration is an oxidation reaction in which a carbohydrate, C6H12O6, is broken down to carbon dioxide and water with the release of energy: C6H12O6 + 6O2 \u00c6 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy (22.5) Actually, such an overall reaction occurs in living systems by a complicated series of individual steps. Some of these steps involve oxidation. The enzymes that bring about oxidation in the presence of free O2 are called oxidases. In general, biological oxidation\u2013reduction reactions are catalyzed by oxidoreductase enzymes. In addition to the types of enzymes discussed above, there are many enzymes that perform miscellaneous duties in living systems. Typical of these are isomerases, which form isomers of particular compounds. For example, of the several simple sugars with the formula C6H12O6, only glucose can be used directly for cell processes. The other isomers are converted to glucose by the action of isomerases.", "Transferase enzymes move chemical groups from one molecule to another, lyase enzymes remove chemical groups without hydrolysis and participate in the formation of C=C bonds or addition of species to such bonds, and ligase enzymes work in conjunction with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), (a high-energy molecule that plays a crucial role in energy-yielding, glucose-oxidizing metabolic processes), to link molecules together with the formation of bonds such as carbon\u2013carbon or carbon\u2013sulfur bonds. Enzyme action may be affected by many different things. Enzymes require a certain hydrogen ion concentration (pH) to function best. For example, gastric proteinase requires the acid environment of the stomach to work well. When it passes into the much less acidic intestines, it stops working. This prevents damage to the intestine walls, which would occur if the enzyme tried to digest them. Temperature is critical. Not surprisingly, the enzymes in the human body work best at around 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), which is the normal body temperature. Heating these enzymes to around 60\u00b0C permanently destroys them. Some bacteria that thrive in hot springs have enzymes that work best at temperatures as high as that of boiling water. Other \u201ccold-seeking\u201d bacteria have enzymes adapted to near the freezing point of water. One of the greatest concerns regarding the effects of surroundings upon enzymes is the infl uence of toxic substances. A major mechanism of toxicity is the alteration or destruction of enzymes by toxic agents\u2014cyanide, heavy metals, or organic compounds such as insecticidal parathion. An enzyme that has been destroyed obviously cannot perform its designated function, whereas one that has been altered either may not function at all or may act improperly. The detrimental effects of toxicants on enzymes are discussed in more detail in Chapter 23. 22.7 NUCLEIC ACIDS The structural formulas of the monomeric constituents of nucleic acids are given in Figure 22.11. These are pyrimidine or purine nitrogen-containing bases, two sugars, and phosphate.

RNA molecules are composed of the nitrogen-containing bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil; phosphoric acid (H3PO4); and the simple sugar b-D-ribofuranose (ribose). The formation of nucleic acid polymers from their monomeric constituents may be viewed as the following steps: \u2022 Monosaccharide (simple sugar) + cyclic nitrogenous base yields a nucleoside. \u2022 Nucleoside + phosphate yields phosphate ester nucleotide.

Molecules of RNA are also quite large. The structure of DNA is that of the famed \u201cdouble helix\u201d (Figure 22.12). It was fi gured out in 1953 by an American scientist, James D. Watson, and Francis Crick, a British scientist.", "They received the Nobel Prize for this scientific milestone in 1962. This model visualizes DNA as a so-called double a-helix structure of oppositely wound polymeric strands held together by hydrogen bonds between opposing pyrimidine and purine groups. As a result, DNA has both a primary and a secondary structure; the former is due to the sequence of nucleotides in the individual strands of DNA and the latter results from the a-helix interaction of the two strands. In the FIGURE 22.12 Representation of the double helix structure of DNA showing the allowed base pairs held together by hydrogen bonding between the phosphate/sugar polymer \u201cbackbones\u201d of the two strands of DNA. The letters stand for adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The dashed lines, ---, represent hydrogen bonds. secondary structure of DNA, only cytosine can be opposite guanine and only thymine can be opposite adenine and vice versa. Basically, the structure of DNA is that of two spiral ribbons \u201ccounter-wound\u201d around each other as illustrated in Figure 22.12. The two strands of DNA are complementary. This means that a particular portion of one strand fits like a key in a lock with the corresponding portion of another strand. If the two strands are pulled apart, each manufactures a new complementary strand, so that two copies of the original double helix result. This occurs during cell reproduction. The molecule of DNA is sort of a coded message. This \u201cmessage,\u201d the genetic information contained in, and transmitted by nucleic acids, depends upon the sequence of bases from which they are composed. It is somewhat like the message sent by telegraph, which consists only of dots, dashes, and spaces in between. The key aspect of DNA structure that enables storage and replication of this information is the famed double helix structure of DNA mentioned above. Portions of the DNA double helix may unravel, and one of the strands of DNA may produce a strand of RNA. This substance then goes from the cell nucleus out into the cell and regulates the synthesis of new protein. In this way, DNA regulates the function of the cell and acts to control life processes. 22.7.1 NUCLEIC ACIDS IN PROTEIN SYNTHESIS Whenever a new cell is formed, the DNA in its nucleus must be accurately reproduced from the parent cell. Life processes are absolutely dependent upon accurate protein synthesis as regulated by cell DNA. The DNA in a single cell must be capable of directing the synthesis of up to 3000 or even more different proteins. The directions for the synthesis of a single protein are contained in a segment of DNA called a gene. The process of transmitting information from DNA to a newly-synthesized protein involves the following steps: \u2022 The DNA undergoes replication. This process involves separation of a segment of the double helix into separate single strands which then replicate such that guanine is opposite cytosine (and vice versa) and adenine is opposite thymine (and vice versa). This process continues until a complete copy of the DNA molecule has been produced. \u2022 The newly replicated DNA produces messenger RNA (m-RNA), a complement of the single strand of DNA, by a process called transcription. \u2022 A new protein is synthesized using m-RNA as a template to determine the order of amino acids in a process called translation. 22.7.2 MODIFIED DNA DNA molecules may be modified by the unintentional addition or deletion of nucleotides or by substituting one nucleotide for another. The result is a mutation that is transmittable to offspring. Mutations can be induced by chemical substances. This is a major concern from a toxicological viewpoint because of the detrimental effects of many mutations and because substances that cause mutations often cause cancer as well. DNA malfunction may result in birth defects and the failure to control cell reproduction results in cancer. Radiation from x-rays and radioactivity also disrupts DNA and may cause mutation. 22.8 RECOMBINANT DNA AND GENETIC ENGINEERING As noted above, segments of DNA contain information for the specific syntheses of particular proteins. Within the last two decades, it has become possible to transfer this information between organisms by means of recombinant DNA technology, which has resulted in a new industry based on genetic engineering. Most often the recipient organisms are bacteria, which can be reproduced (cloned) over many orders of magnitude from a cell that has acquired the desired qualities.", "Therefore, to synthesize a particular substance such as human insulin or growth hormone, the required genetic information can be transferred from a human source to bacterial cells, which then produce the substance as part of their metabolic processes. The first step in recombinant DNA gene manipulation is to lyze or \u201copen up\u201d a cell that has the genetic material needed and to remove this material from the cell. Through enzyme action, the sought-after genes are cut from the donor DNA chain. These are next spliced into small DNA molecules. These molecules, called cloning vehicles, are capable of penetrating the host cell and becoming incorporated into its genetic material. The modified host cell is then reproduced many times and carries out the desired biosynthesis. Early concerns about the potential of genetic engineering to produce \u201cmonster organisms\u201d or new and horrible diseases have been largely allayed, although caution is still required with this technology. In the environmental area, genetic engineering offers some hope for the production of bacteria engineered to safely destroy troublesome wastes and to produce biological substitutes for environmentally damaging synthetic pesticides. Numerous possibilities exist for combining biology with chemistry to produce chemical feed-stocks and products of various kinds. An example is the production of polylactic acid using lactic acid produced enzymatically with corn and polymerized by standard chemical processes. Much attention has been focused on the development of enzymes to perform a variety of chemical conversions. Another important area that uses transgenic organisms is the breeding of plants that produce natural insecticides, specifically the insecticide from Bacillus thuringiensis. 22.9 METABOLIC PROCESSES Biochemical processes that involve the alteration of biomolecules fall under the category of metabolism. Metabolic processes may be divided into the two major categories of anabolism (synthesis) and catabolism (degradation of substances). An organism may use metabolic processes to yield energy or to modify the constituents of biomolecules. 22.9.1 ENERGY-YIELDING PROCESSES Organisms can gain energy by one of three major processes, which are listed as follows: \u2022 Respiration, in which organic compounds undergo catabolism that requires molecular oxygen (aerobic respiration) or that occurs in the absence of molecular oxygen (anaerobic respiration). Aerobic respiration uses the Krebs cycle to obtain energy from the following reaction: C6H12O6 + 6O2 \u00c6 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy About half of the energy released is converted to short-term stored chemical energy, particularly through the synthesis of ATP nucleotide. For longer-term energy storage, glycogen or starch polysaccharides are synthesized, and for still longer-term energy storage, lipids (fats) are generated and retained by the organism. \u2022 Fermentation, which differs from respiration in not having an electron transport chain. Yeasts produce ethanol from sugars by fermentation: C6H12O6 \u00c6 2CO2 + 2C2H5OH \u2022 Photosynthesis, in which light energy captured by plant and algal chloroplasts is used to synthesize sugars from carbon dioxide and water: 6CO2 + 6H2O + hn \u00c6 C6H12O6 + 6O2 Plants cannot always get the energy that they need from sunlight. During the dark, they must use stored food. Plant cells, like animal cells, contain mitochondria in which stored food is converted to energy by cellular respiration. Plant cells, which use sunlight as a source of energy and CO2 as a source of carbon, are said to be autotrophic. In contrast, animal cells must depend upon organic material manufactured by plants for their food. These are called heterotrophic cells. They act as \u201cmiddlemen\u201d in the chemical reaction between oxygen and food material using the energy from the reaction to carry out their life processes. 22.10 METABOLISM OF XENOBIOTIC COMPOUNDS When toxicants or their metabolic precursors (protoxicants) enter a living organism, they may undergo several processes, including those that may make them more toxic or that detoxify them. Chapter 23 discusses the metabolic processes that toxicants undergo and the mechanisms by which they may cause damage to an organism. Emphasis is placed on xenobiotic compounds, which are those that are normally foreign to living organisms; on chemical aspects; and on processes that lead to products that can be eliminated from the organism. Of particular importance is intermediary xenobiotic metabolism which results in the formation of somewhat transient species that are different from both those ingested and the ultimate product that is excreted. These species may have significant toxicological effects. Xenobiotic compounds in general are acted upon by enzymes that function on a material that is in the body naturally\u2014an endogenous substrate.", "For example, fl avincontaining mono-oxygenase enzyme acts upon endogenous cysteamine to convert it to cystamine, but also functions to oxidize xenobiotic nitrogen and sulfur compounds. Biotransformation refers to changes in xenobiotic compounds as a result of enzyme action. Reactions that are not mediated by enzymes may also be important in some cases. As examples of nonenzymatic transformations, some xenobiotic compounds bond with endogenous biochemical species without an enzyme catalyst, undergo hydrolysis in body fluid media, or undergo oxidation/ reduction processes. The metabolic Phase I and Phase II reactions of xenobiotics discussed here and in Chapter 23 are enzymatic, however. The likelihood that a xenobiotic species will undergo enzymatic metabolism in the body depends upon the chemical nature of the species. Compounds with a high degree of polarity, such as relatively ionizable carboxylic acids, are less likely to enter the body system and, when they do, tend to be quickly excreted. Therefore, such compounds are unavailable, or only available for a short time, for enzymatic metabolism. Volatile compounds, such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether, are expelled so quickly from the lungs that enzymatic metabolism is less likely. This leaves nonpolar lipophilic compounds, those that are relatively less soluble in aqueous biological fluids and more attracted to lipid species, as the most likely candidates for enzymatic metabolic reactions. Of these, the ones that are resistant to enzymatic attack (e.g., PCBs) tend to bioaccumulate in lipid tissue. Xenobiotic species may be metabolized in many body tissues and organs. As part of the body\u2019s defense against the entry of xenobiotic species, the most prominent sites of xenobiotic metabolism are those associated with entry into the body, such as the skin and lungs. The gut wall through which xenobiotic species enter the body from the gastrointestinal tract is also a site of signifi cant xenobiotic compound metabolism. The liver is of particular significance because materials entering systemic circulation from the gastrointestinal tract must first traverse the liver. 22.10.1 PHASE I AND PHASE II REACTIONS The processes that most xenobiotics undergo in the body can be divided into the two categories of Phase I reactions and Phase II reactions. A Phase I reaction introduces reactive, polar functional groups into lipophilic (\u201cfat-seeking\u201d) toxicant molecules. In their unmodifi ed forms, such toxicant molecules tend to pass through lipid-containing cell membranes and may be bound to lipoproteins, in which form they are transported through the body. Because of the functional group present, the product of a Phase I reaction is usually more water-soluble than the parent xenobiotic species, and more importantly, possesses a \u201cchemical handle\u201d to which a substrate material in the body may become attached so that the toxicant can be eliminated from the body. The binding of such a substrate is a Phase II reaction, and it produces a conjugation product that is amenable to excretion from the body. In general, the changes in structure and properties of a compound that result from a Phase I reaction are relatively mild. Phase II processes, however, usually produce species that are much different from the parent compounds. It should be emphasized that not all xenobiotic compounds undergo both Phase I and Phase II reactions. Such a compound may undergo only a Phase I reaction and be excreted directly from the body. Or a compound that already possesses an appropriate functional group capable of conjugation may undergo a Phase II reaction without a preceding Phase I reaction. Phase I and Phase II reactions are discussed in more detail as they relate to toxicological chemistry in Chapters 23 and 24. LITERATURE CITED 1. Voet, D., J. G. Voet, and C. W.

The general aspects of these effects are addressed in this chapter under the heading toxicological chemistry; the toxicological chemistry of specific classes of chemical substances is addressed in this chapter. In order to understand toxicological chemistry, it is essential to have some understanding of biochemistry, the science that deals with chemical processes and materials in living systems. Biochemistry was summarized in Chapter 22. 23.1.1 TOXICOLOGY A poison, or toxicant, is a substance that is harmful to living organisms because of its detrimental effects on tissues, organs, or biological processes. Common end point effects of toxic substances are destruction of cells, mutation of DNA leading to cancer, and disruption of the signaling mechanisms by which cell development and function are controlled. Most toxicants are foreign to the bodies of individuals that are affected (see xenobiotics in Section 23.5) and tend to have an affinity for lipids. Therefore, they have a tendency to cross the lipid membranes of cells and to build up to toxic levels. In many cases toxicants undergo metabolism to produce an active species that causes poisoning. Toxicology is the science of poisons. Whether a substance is poisonous depends upon the type of organism exposed, the amount of the substance, and the route of exposure. In the case of human exposure, the degree of harm done by a poison can depend strongly upon whether the exposure is to the skin, by inhalation, or through ingestion. Toxicants to which subjects are exposed to in the environment or occupationally may be in several different physical forms. This may be illustrated for toxicants that are inhaled. Gases are substances such as carbon monoxide in air that are normally in the gaseous state under ambient conditions of temperature and pressure. Vapors are gas-phase materials that have evaporated or sublimed from liquids or solids. Dusts are respirable solid particles produced by grinding bulk solids, whereas fumes are solid particles from the condensation of vapors, often metals or metal oxides. Mists are liquid droplets. Often a toxic substance is in solution or mixed with other substances. A substance with which the toxicant is associated (the solvent in which it is dissolved or the solid medium in which it is dispersed) is called the matrix. The matrix may have a strong effect upon the toxicity of the toxicant. There are numerous variables related to the ways in which organisms are exposed to toxic substances. One of the most crucial of these, dose, is discussed in Section 23.2. Another important factor is the toxicant concentration, which may range from the pure substance (100%) down to a very dilute solution of a highly potent poison. Both the duration of exposure per exposure incident and the frequency of exposure are important. The rate of exposure and the total time period over which the organism is exposed are both important situational variables. The exposure site and route also affect toxicity. It is possible to classify exposures on the basis of acute versus chronic and local versus systemic exposure, giving four general categories. Acute local exposure occurs at a specific location over a time period of a few seconds to a few hours and may affect the exposure site, particularly the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes. The same parts of the body can be affected by chronic local exposure, for which the time span may be as long as several years. Acute systemic exposure is a brief exposure or exposure to a single dose and occurs with toxicants that can enter the body, such as by inhalation or ingestion, and affect organs, such as the liver, that are remote from the entry site. Chronic systemic exposure differs in that the exposure occurs over a prolonged time period. In discussing exposure sites for toxicants it is useful to consider the major routes and sites of exposure, distribution, and elimination of toxicants in the body as shown in Figure 23.1.", "The major routes of accidental or intentional exposure to toxicants by humans and other animals are the skin (percutaneous or dermal route), the lungs (inhalation, respiration, pulmonary route), and the mouth (oral route); minor routes of exposure are rectal, vaginal, and parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular, a common means for the administration of drugs or toxic substances in test subjects). Of these, the dermal route is the most difficult to quantify. It is particularly important in children, whose activities bring them into contact with contaminated dirt, pesticides, household chemicals, and other environmental pollutants. Furthermore, the skin of children is relatively more permeable to toxic substances, increasing their risk of dermal exposure. The way that a toxic substance is introduced into the complex system of an organism is strongly dependent upon the physical and chemical properties of the substance. The pulmonary system is most likely to take in toxic gases or very fine, respirable solid or liquid particles. In other than a respirable form, a solid usually enters the body orally. Absorption through the skin is most likely for liquids, solutes in solution, and semisolids, such as sludges. The defensive barriers that a toxicant may encounter vary with the route of exposure. Toxic substances ingested orally are absorbed through the intestinal epithelium, which has detoxifi cation systems that help reduce the effects of the substances. Toxic elemental mercury is absorbed through the alveoli in the lungs much more readily than through the skin or gastrointestinal tract. Most test exposures to animals are through ingestion or gavage (introduction into the stomach through a tube). Pulmonary exposure is often favored with subjects that may exhibit refractory behavior when noxious chemicals are administered by means requiring a degree of cooperation from the subject. Intravenous injection may be chosen for deliberate exposure when it is necessary to know the concentration and effect of a xenobiotic substance in the blood. However, pathways used experimentally that are almost certain not to be significant in accidental exposures can give misleading results when they avoid the body\u2019s natural defense mechanisms. An interesting historical example of the importance of the route of exposure to toxicants is provided by cancer caused by contact of coal tar with skin. The major barrier to dermal absorption of toxicants is the stratum corneum, or horny layer. The permeability of skin is inversely proportional to the thickness of this layer, which varies by location on the body in the order soles and palms > abdomen, back, legs, arms > genital (perineal) area. Evidence of the susceptibility of the genital area to absorption of toxic substances is to be found in accounts of the high incidence of cancer of the scrotum among chimney sweeps in London described by Sir Percival Pott, Surgeon General of Britain during the reign of King George III. The cancer-causing agent was coal tar condensed in chimneys. This material was more readily absorbed through the skin in the genital areas than elsewhere, leading to a high incidence of scrotal cancer. (The chimney sweeps\u2019 conditions were aggravated by their lack of appreciation of basic hygienic practices, such as bathing and regular changes of underclothing.) Organisms can serve as indicators of various kinds of pollutants. In this application, organisms are known as biomonitors. For example, higher plants, fungi, lichens, and mosses can be important biomonitors for heavy metal pollutants in the environment. 23.1.2 SYNERGISM, POTENTIATION, AND ANTAGONISM The biological effects of two or more toxic substances can be different in kind and degree from those of one of the substances alone. One of the ways in which this can occur is when one substance affects the way in which another undergoes any of the steps in the kinetic phase as discussed in Section 23.7 and illustrated in Figure 23.9. Chemical interaction between substances may affect their toxicities. Both substances may act upon the same physiologic function, or two substances may compete for binding to the same receptor (molecule or other entity acted upon by a toxicant). When both substances have the same physiologic function, their effects may be simply additive or they may be synergistic (the total effect is greater than the sum of the effects of each separately). Potentiation occurs when an inactive substance enhances the action of an active one, and antagonism when an active substance decreases the effect of another active one. 23.2 DOSE\u2013RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS Toxicants have widely varying effects upon organisms.", "Quantitatively, these variations include minimum levels at which the onset of an effect is observed, the sensitivity of the organism to small increments of toxicant, and levels at which the ultimate effect (particularly death) occurs in most exposed organisms. Some essential substances, such as nutrient minerals, have optimum ranges above and below which detrimental effects are observed (see Section 23.5 and Figure 23.4). Factors such as those just outlined are taken into account by the dose\u2013response relationship, which is one of the key concepts of toxicology. Dose is the amount, usually per unit body mass, of a toxicant to which an organism is exposed. Response is the effect upon an organism resulting from exposure to a toxicant. In order to define a dose\u2013response relationship, it is necessary to specify a particular response, such as death of the organism, as well as the conditions under which the response is obtained, such as the length of time from administration of the dose. Consider a specific response of a population of the same kinds of organisms. At relatively low doses, none of the organisms exhibits the response (e.g., all live), whereas at higher doses all of the organisms exhibit the response (e.g., all die). In between, there is a range of doses over which some of the organisms respond in the specifi ed manner and others do not, thereby defining a dose\u2013response curve. Dose\u2013response relationships differ among different kinds and strains of organisms, types of tissues, and populations of cells. Percent deaths 100 50 0 FIGURE 23.2 Illustration of a dose\u2013response curve in which the response is the death of the organism. The cumulative percentage of deaths of organisms is plotted on the Y axis. Figure 23.2 shows a generalized dose\u2013response curve. Such a plot may be obtained, for example, by administering different doses of a poison in a uniform manner to a homogeneous population of test animals and plotting the cumulative percentage of deaths as a function of the log of the dose. The dose corresponding to the mid-point (inflection point) of the resulting S-shaped curve is the statistical estimate of the dose that would kill 50% of the subjects and is designated as LD50. The estimated doses at which 5% (LD5) and 95% (LD95) of the test subjects die are obtained from the graph by reading the dose levels for 5% and 95% fatalities, respectively. A relatively small difference between LD5 and LD95 is reflected by a steeper S-shaped curve, and vice versa. Statistically, 68% of all values on a dose\u2013response curve fall within \u00b11 standard deviation of the mean at LD50 and encompass the range from LD16 to LD84. 23.3 RELATIVE TOXICITIES Table 23.1 illustrates standard toxicity ratings that are used to describe estimated toxicities of various substances to humans. In terms of fatal doses to an adult human of average size, a \u201ctaste\u201d of a supertoxic substance (just a few drops or less) is fatal. A teaspoonful of a very toxic substance could have the same effect. However, as much as a quart of a slightly toxic substance might be required to kill an adult human. When there is a substantial difference between LD50 values of two different substances, the one with the lower value is said to be the more potent. Such a comparison must assume that the dose\u2013 response curves for the two substances being compared have similar slopes. 23.3.1 NONLETHAL EFFECTS So far, toxicities have been described primarily in terms of the ultimate effect\u2014deaths of organisms or lethality. This is obviously an irreversible consequence of exposure. In many, and perhaps most, cases, sublethal and reversible effects are of greater importance. This is obviously true of drugs, where death from exposure to a registered therapeutic agent is rare, but other effects, both detrimental and beneficial, are usually observed. By their very nature, drugs alter biological processes; therefore, the potential for harm is almost always present. The major consideration in establishing drug dose is to find a dose that has an adequate therapeutic effect without undesirable side effects. A dose\u2013response curve can be established for a drug that progresses from noneffective levels through effective, harmful, and even lethal levels. A low slope for this curve indicates a wide range of effective dose and a wide margin of safety (see Figure 23.3). This term applies to other substances, such as pesticides, for which it is desirable to have a large difference between the dose that kills a target species and that which harms a desirable species.", "TABLE 23.1 Toxicity Scale with Example Substancesa Substance Approximate LD50 DEHPb Ethanol Sodium chloride Malathion Chlordane Heptachlor Parathion TEPPc Tetrodotoxind TCDDe Botulinus toxin \u2013105 \u2013 \u2013104 \u2013 \u2013103 \u2013 \u2013102 \u2013 \u201310 \u2013 \u20131 \u201310\u20131 \u2013 \u201310\u20132 \u2013 \u201310\u20133 \u2013 \u201310\u20134 \u2013 \u201310\u20135 Toxicity Rating 1.

If there is no lasting effect from the exposure, it is said to be reversible. However, if the effect is permanent, it is termed irreversible. Irreversible effects of exposure remain after the toxic substance is eliminated from the organism. Figure 23.3 illustrates these two kinds of effects. For various chemicals and different subjects, toxic effects may range from the totally reversible to the totally irreversible. 23.4.1 HYPERSENSITIVITY AND HYPOSENSITIVITY Examination of the dose\u2013response curve shown in Figure 23.2 reveals that some subjects are very sensitive to a particular poison (e.g., those killed at a dose corresponding to LD5), whereas others are very resistant to the same substance (e.g., those surviving a dose corresponding to LD95). These two kinds of responses illustrate hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity, respectively; subjects in the midrange of the dose\u2013response curve are termed normals. These variations in response tend to complicate toxicology in that there is no specific dose guaranteed to yield a particular response, even in a homogeneous population. In some cases hypersensitivity is induced. After one or more doses of a chemical, a subject may develop an extreme reaction to it. This occurs with penicillin, for example, in cases where people develop such a severe allergic response to the antibiotic that exposure is fatal if countermeasures are not taken. 23.5 XENOBIOTIC AND ENDOGENOUS SUBSTANCES Xenobiotic substances are those that are foreign to a living system, whereas those that occur naturally in a biologic system are termed endogenous. Xenobiotic substances that cause harm in organisms are commonly metabolized by them. The levels of endogenous substances must usually fall within a particular concentration range in order for metabolic processes to occur normally. Levels below a normal range may result in a defi ciency response or even death, and the same effects may occur above the normal range. This kind of response is illustrated in Figure 23.4. Examples of endogenous substances in organisms include various hormones, glucose (blood sugar), and some essential metal ions, including Ca2+, K+, and Na+. The optimum level of calcium in human blood serum occurs over a rather narrow range of 9\u20139.5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Below these values a deficiency response known as hypocalcemia occurs, manifested by muscle cramping. At serum levels above about 10.5 mg/dL hypercalcemia occurs, the major effect of which is kidney malfunction. Normal physiologicaleffect Detrimental effect Potentiallylethal effect Deficiency Excess, toxicity FIGURE 23.4 Biological effect of an endogenous substance in an organism showing optimum level, defi ciency, and excess. Dose 23.6 TOXICOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 23.6.1 TOXICOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY DEFINED Toxicological chemistry is the science that deals with the chemical nature and reactions of toxic substances, including their origins, uses, and chemical aspects of exposure, fates, and disposal.1 Toxicological chemistry addresses the relationships between the chemical properties and molecular structures of molecules and their toxicological effects. Figure 23.5 outlines the terms discussed above and the relationships among them. Much of what is known about xenobiotic substances in living systems is based upon intensive research upon pharmaceutical compounds in organisms. Pharmacodynamics deals with what a drug does to a body including the dose\u2013response relationship, sites and mechanisms of pharmaceutical actions, therapeutic effects, and side effects. What the body does to a drug is addressed by pharmacokinetics, including uptake, distribution, metabolism, retention, and excretion. 23.6.2 TOXICANTS IN THE BODY The processes by which organisms metabolize xenobiotic species are enzyme-catalyzed Phase I and Phase II reactions, which are described briefly here.", "The substances that undergo these reactions are treated theoretically by the science of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), which relates the chemical nature of substances to their biochemical reactions. 23.6.2.1 Phase I Reactions Lipophilic xenobiotic species in the body tend to undergo Phase I reactions that make them more water-soluble and reactive by the attachment of polar functional groups, such as \u2013OH (Figure 23.6). Most Phase I processes are \u201cmicrosomal mixed-function oxidase\u201d reactions catalyzed by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system, associated with the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell and occurring most abundantly in the liver of vertebrates.2 An example of a Phase I reaction of a xenobiotic is epoxide formation of chloroprene, used to make solvent-resistant synthetic rubbers: Cl H Cl H Cl H H H OHCC C C C CH H {O} H H2O H CC CC C C H O H P-450 HChloroprene H H OH {O} P450 O H H C C H (23.1) C Cl H C HO C C H Rearrange Cl H C C Cl H H H H O C C H C C H HH Product that is more water-soluble and reactive OEpoxide: C C Hydroxide: OH Sulfhydryl: SH H Hydroxylamine: N OH Others FIGURE 23.6 Illustration of Phase I reactions. 23.6.2.2 Phase II Reactions A Phase II reaction occurs when an endogenous species is attached by enzyme action to a polar functional group which often, though not always, is the result of a Phase I reaction on a xenobiotic species. Phase II reactions are called conjugation reactions in which enzymes attach conjugating agents to xenobiotics, their Phase I reaction products, and nonxenobiotic compounds (Figure 23.7). The conjugation product of such a reaction is usually less toxic than the original xenobiotic compound, less lipid-soluble, more water-soluble, and more readily eliminated from the body. The major conjugating agents and the enzymes that catalyze their Phase II reactions are glucuronide (UDP glucuronyltransferase enzyme), glutathione (glutathionetransferase enzyme), sulfate (sulfotransferase enzyme), and acetyl (acetylation by acetyltransferase enzymes). The most abundant conjugation products are glucuronides. A glucuronide conjugate is illustrated in Figure 23.8, where \u2013X\u2013R represents a xenobiotic species conjugated to glucuronide, and R is an organic moiety. O O C OH O OH X R HO Xenobiotic OH Glucuronide FIGURE 23.8 Glucuronide conjugate formed from a xenobiotic, HX\u2013R. For example, if the xenobiotic compound conjugated is phenol, HXR is HOC6H5, X is the O atom, and R represents the phenyl group, C6H5. 23.7 KINETIC PHASE AND DYNAMIC PHASE 23.7.1 KINETIC PHASE The major routes and sites of absorption, metabolism, binding, and excretion of toxic substances in the body are illustrated in Figure 23.1. Toxicants in the body are metabolized, transported, and excreted; they have adverse biochemical effects; and they cause manifestations of poisoning. It is convenient to divide these processes into two major phases, a kinetic phase and a dynamic phase. In the kinetic phase, a toxicant or the metabolic precursor of a toxic substance (protoxicant) may undergo absorption, metabolism, temporary storage, distribution, and excretion, as illustrated in Figure 23.9. A toxicant that is absorbed may be passed through the kinetic phase unchanged as an active parent compound, metabolized to a detoxifi ed metabolite that is excreted, or converted to a toxic active metabolite. These processes occur through Phase I and Phase II reactions discussed above. 23.7.2 DYNAMIC PHASE In the dynamic phase (Figure 23.10), a toxicant or toxic metabolite interacts with cells, tissues, or organs in the body to cause some toxic response. The three major subdivisions of the dynamic phase are the following: \u2022 Primary reaction with a receptor or target organ \u2022 A biochemical response \u2022 Observable effects 23.7.2.1 Primary Reaction in the Dynamic Phase A toxicant or an active metabolite reacts with a receptor. The process leading to a toxic response is initiated when such a reaction occurs. A typical example is when benzene epoxide, the initial product of the Phase I reaction of benzene (see Figure 24.1), forms an adduct with a nucleic acid unit in Active parent compound tofurther biochemical interaction DNA (receptor) resulting in alteration of the DNA. (Many species that cause a toxic response are reactive intermediates, such as benzene epoxide, which have a brief lifetime but a strong tendency to undergo reactions leading to a toxic response while they are around.) DNA adduct formation with benzene epoxide is an irreversible reaction between a toxicant and a receptor.", "A reversible reaction that can result in a toxic response is illustrated by the binding between carbon monoxide and oxygen-transporting hemoglobin (Hb) in blood: O2Hb + CO COHb + O2 (23.2) 23.7.2.2 Biochemical Effects in the Dynamic Phase The binding of a toxicant to a receptor may result in some kind of biochemical effect. The major ones are the following: \u2022 Impairment of enzyme function by binding to the enzyme, coenzymes, metal activators of enzymes, or enzyme substrates \u2022 Alteration of cell membrane or carriers in cell membranes \u2022 Interference with carbohydrate metabolism \u2022 Interference with lipid metabolism resulting in excess lipid accumulation (\u201cfatty liver\u201d) \u2022 Interference with respiration, the overall process by which electrons are transferred to molecular oxygen in the biological oxidation of energy-yielding substrates \u2022 Stopping or interfering with protein biosynthesis by their action on DNA \u2022 Interference with regulatory processes mediated by hormones or enzymes 23.7.2.3 Responses to Toxicants Among the more immediate and readily observed manifestations of poisoning are alterations in the vital signs of temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Poisoning by some substances may cause an abnormal skin color (jaundiced, yellow skin from CCl4 poisoning) or excessively moist or dry skin. Toxic levels of some materials or their metabolites cause the body to have unnatural odors, such as the bitter almond odor of HCN in tissues of victims of cyanide poisoning. Symptoms of poisoning manifested in the eye include miosis (excessive or prolonged contraction of the eye pupil), mydriasis (excessive pupil dilation), conjunctivitis (inflammation of the mucus membrane that covers the front part of the eyeball and the inner lining of the eyelids), and nystagmus (involuntary movement of the eyeballs). Some poisons cause a moist condition of the mouth, whereas others cause a dry mouth. Gastrointestinal tract effects including pain, vomiting, or paralytic ileus (stoppage of the normal peristalsis movement of the intestines) occur as a result of poisoning by a number of toxic substances. Central nervous system poisoning may be manifested by convulsions, paralysis, hallucinations, and ataxia (lack of coordination of voluntary movements of the body), as well as abnormal behavior, including agitation, hyperactivity, disorientation, and delirium. Severe poisoning by some substances, including organophosphates and carbamates, causes coma, the term used to describe a lowered level of consciousness. Prominent among the more chronic responses to toxicant exposure are mutations, cancer, and birth defects and effects on the immune system. Other observable effects, some of which may occur soon after exposure, include gastrointestinal illness, cardiovascular disease, hepatic (liver) disease, renal (kidney) malfunction, neurologic symptoms (central and peripheral nervous systems), and skin abnormalities (rash, dermatitis). Often the effects of toxicant exposure are subclinical in nature. The most common of these are some kinds of damage to the immune system, chromosomal abnormalities, modification of functions of liver enzymes, and slowing of conduction of nerve impulses. 23.8 TERATOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, CARCINOGENESIS, AND EFFECTS ON THE IMMUNE AND REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS 23.8.1 TERATOGENESIS Teratogens are chemical species that cause birth defects. These usually arise from damage to embryonic or fetal cells. However, mutations in germ cells (egg or sperm cells) may cause birth defects, such as Down\u2019s syndrome. The biochemical mechanisms of teratogenesis are varied. They include enzyme inhibition by xenobiotics; deprivation of the fetus of essential substrates, such as vitamins; interference with energy supply; or alteration of the permeability of the placental membrane. Fetuses exposed to toxic substances in utero are the most vulnerable to the effects of xenobiotics. Such toxicants can traverse the placental barrier and enter the fetal blood stream, the detoxifi cation enzyme systems of fetuses are not as effective as they become after birth, and their organ systems are immature and subject to damage during development. The result of such exposures can be birth defects, retardation of interuterine growth, and later development of afflictions including diabetes and coronary artery disease.3 23.8.2 MUTAGENESIS Mutagens alter DNA to produce inheritable traits. Although mutation is a natural process that occurs even in the absence of xenobiotic substances, most mutations are harmful. The mechanisms of mutagenicity are similar to those of carcinogenicity, and mutagens often cause birth defects as well. Therefore, mutagenic hazardous substances are of major toxicological concern. Guanine bound to DNA Methylated guanine in DNA FIGURE 23.11 Alkylation of guanine in DNA. 23.8.2.1 Biochemistry of Mutagenesis To understand the biochemistry of mutagenesis, it is important to recall from Chapter 22 that DNA contains the nitrogenous bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine.", "The order in which these bases occur in DNA determines the nature and structure of newly produced RNA, a substance generated as a step in the synthesis of new proteins and enzymes in cells. Exchange, addition, or deletion of any of the nitrogenous bases in DNA alters the nature of RNA produced and can change vital life processes, such as the synthesis of an important enzyme. This phenomenon, which can be caused by xenobiotic compounds, is a mutation that can be passed on to progeny, usually with detrimental results. There are several ways in which xenobiotic species may cause mutations. It is beyond the scope of this work to discuss these mechanisms in detail. For the most part, however, mutations due to xenobiotic substances are the result of chemical alterations of DNA, such as those discussed in the two examples below. Nitrous acid, HNO2, is an example of a chemical mutagen that is often used to cause mutations in bacteria. To understand the mutagenic activity of nitrous acid it should be noted that three of the nitrogenous bases\u2014adenine, guanine, and cytosine\u2014contain the amino group, \u2013NH2. The action of nitrous acid is to replace amino groups with a hydroxy group. When this occurs, the DNA may not function in the intended manner, causing a mutation to occur. Alkylation, the attachment of a small alkyl group, such as \u2013CH3 or \u2013C2H5, to an N atom on one of the nitrogenous bases in DNA, is one of the most common mechanisms leading to mutation. The methylation of \u201c7\u201d nitrogen in guanine in DNA to form N-methylguanine is shown in Figure 23.11. O-alkylation may also occur by attachment of a methyl or other alkyl group to the oxygen atom in guanine. A number of mutagenic substances act as alkylating agents. Prominent among these are the compounds shown in Figure 23.12. Alkylation occurs by way of generation of positively charged electrophilic species that bond to electron-rich nitrogen or oxygen atoms on the nitrogenous bases in DNA. The generation of such species usually occurs by way of biochemical and chemical processes. For example, dimethylnitrosamine (structural formula in Figure 23.12) is activated by oxidation through cellular NADPH to produce the following highly reactive intermediate: H HO C NNO H CH3 O N CH3 N CH3 N CH3 N N CH3 H N H3C H N CH3 H3CO O S O CH3 Dimethylnitros- 3,3-Dimethyl-1- 1,2-Dimethyl- Methylmethane- amine phenyltriazine hydrazine sulfonate FIGURE 23.12 Examples of simple alkylating agents capable of causing mutations. This product undergoes several nonenzymatic transitions, losing formaldehyde and generating a methyl carbocation, +CH3, that can methylate nitrogenous bases on DNA: O COHHC H HHO N N HO\u2013+NNCH3 CH3 CH3 Other products One of the more notable mutagens is tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate, commonly called \u201ctris,\u201d that was used as a flame retardant in children\u2019s sleepwear. Tris was found to be mutagenic in experimental animals and metabolites of it were found in children wearing the treated sleepwear. This strongly suggested that tris is absorbed through the skin and its uses were discontinued. 23.8.3 CARCINOGENESIS Cancer is a condition characterized by the uncontrolled replication and growth of the body\u2019s own (somatic) cells. Carcinogenic agents may be categorized as follows: \u2022 Chemical agents, such as nitrosamines and PAHs \u2022 Biological agents, such as hepadnaviruses or retroviruses \u2022 Ionizing radiation, such as x-rays \u2022 Genetic factors, such as selective breeding Clearly, in some cases, cancer is the result of the action of synthetic and naturally occurring chemicals. The role of xenobiotic chemicals in causing cancer is called chemical carcinogenesis. It is often regarded as the single most important facet of toxicology and is clearly the one that receives the most publicity. Chemical carcinogenesis has a long history. As noted earlier in this chapter, in 1775 Sir Percival Pott, Surgeon General serving under King George III of England, observed that chimney sweeps in London had a very high incidence of cancer of the scrotum, which he related to their exposure to soot and tar from the burning of bituminous coal. Around 1900 a German surgeon, Ludwig Rehn, reported elevated incidences of bladder cancer in dye workers exposed to chemicals extracted from coal tar; 2-naphthylamine NH2 2-Naphthylamine was shown to be largely responsible. Other historical examples of carcinogenesis include observations of cancer from tobacco juice (1915), oral exposure to radium from painting luminescent watch dials (1929), tobacco smoke (1939), and asbestos (1960).", "An important and unresolved question regarding carcinogens is the existence of thresholds above which carcinogenesis occurs and below which there is no effect.4 Rodent tests for carcinogens are normally conducted at doses 1000\u201310,000 times those to which humans are exposed and the probabilities of substances causing cancer in humans are extrapolated linearly to the low doses at which humans are exposed under the assumption that there is no threshold below which the carcinogen has no effect. Some authorities believe that such extrapolations are unrealistic and overstate cancer risk in part because they do not take into account mechanisms possessed by humans to combat genotoxic and carcinogenic insults leading to cancer. Such mechanisms include detoxication and error-free DNA repair. (23.3) 23.8.3.1 Biochemistry of Carcinogenesis Large expenditures of time and money on the subject in recent years have yielded a much better understanding of the biochemical bases of chemical carcinogenesis. The overall processes for the induction of cancer may be quite complex, involving numerous steps. However, it is generally recognized that there are two major steps in carcinogenesis: an initiation stage followed by a promo tional stage. These steps are further subdivided as shown in Figure 23.13. Initiation of carcinogenesis may occur by the reaction of a DNA-reactive species with DNA, or by the action of an epigenetic carcinogen that does not react with DNA and is carcinogenic by some other mechanism. Most DNA-reactive species are genotoxic carcinogens because they are also mutagens. These substances react irreversibly with DNA. They are either electrophilic or, more commonly, metabolically activated to form electrophilic species, as is the case with electrophilic +CH3 generated from dimethylnitrosamine, discussed under mutagenesis above. Most cancer-causing substances require metabolic activation to produce electrophilic species capable of forming adducts with DNA thereby causing gene mutations. The substances that are activated are called procarcinogens. The metabolic species actually responsible for carcinogenesis is termed an ultimate carcinogen. Some species that are intermediate metabolites between precarcinogens and ultimate carcinogens are called proximate carcinogens. Carcinogens that do not require biochemical activation are categorized as primary or direct-acting carcinogens. Some procarcinogens and primary carcinogens are shown in Figure 23.14. Most substances classified as epigenetic carcinogens are promoters that act after initiation. Manifestations of promotion include increased numbers of tumor cells and decreased length of time for tumors to develop (shortened latency period). Promoters do not initiate cancer, are not electrophilic, and do not bind with DNA. The classic example of a promoter is decanoyl phorbol acetate or phorbol myristate acetate, which is extracted from croton oil. 23.8.3.2 Alkylating Agents in Carcinogenesis Chemical carcinogens usually have the ability to form covalent bonds with macromolecular life molecules. Such covalent bonds can form with proteins, peptides, RNA, and DNA. Although most binding is with other kinds of molecules, which are more abundant, the DNA adducts are the significant ones in initiating cancer. Prominent among the species that bond to DNA in carcinogenesis are the alkylating agents that attach alkyl groups\u2014methyl (CH3) or ethyl (C2H5)\u2014to DNA. A similar type of compound, arylating agents, act to attach aryl moieties, such as the phenyl group, Phenyl group Naturally occurring carcinogens that require bioactivation OCH3 O OCH3 H H H C C C OO O HH H C N NOH3CO H H O CH3 Cl H3C Griseofulvin (produced by Saffrole (from N-methyl-N-formylhydrazine Penicillium griseofulvum) sassafras) (from edible false morel mushroom) Synthetic carcinogens that require bioactivation Benzo(a)pyrene Vinyl chloride 4-Dimethylaminoazobenzene Primary carcinogens that do not require bioactivation H O H H O C N Cl C O C Cl H C C H H C C H H H H H H H Bis(chloromethyl)ether Ethyleneimine b -Propioacetone FIGURE 23.14 Examples of the major classes of naturally occurring and synthetic carcinogens, some of which require bioactivation, and others that act directly. to DNA. As shown by the examples in Figure 23.15, the alkyl and aryl groups become attached to N and O atoms in the nitrogenous bases that compose DNA. This alteration in DNA can trigger initiation of the sequence of events that results in the growth and replication of neoplastic (cancerous) cells. The reactive species that donate alkyl groups in alkylation are usually formed by metabolic activation through the action of enzymes. This process was shown for conversion of dimethylnitrosamine to a methylating metabolic intermediate in the discussion of mutagenesis earlier in this section. 23.8.4 TESTING FOR CARCINOGENS Only a few chemicals have definitely been established as human carcinogens.", "A well documented example is vinyl chloride, CH2 =CHCl, which is known to have caused a rare form of liver cancer (angiosarcoma) in individuals who cleaned autoclaves in the PVC fabrication industry. In some cases chemicals are known to be carcinogens from epidemiological studies of exposed humans. Animals are used to test for carcinogenicity, and the results can be extrapolated, although with much uncertainty, to humans. Attachment to the remainder of the DNA molecule 23.8.4.1 Bruce Ames Test Mutagenicity used to infer carcinogenicity is the basis of the Bruce Ames test, in which observations are made of the reversion of mutant histidine-requiring Salmonella bacteria back to a form that can synthesize its own histidine. The test makes use of enzymes in homogenized liver tissue to convert potential procarcinogens to ultimate carcinogens. Histidine-requiring Salmonella bacteria are inoculated onto a medium that does not contain histidine, and those that mutate back to a form that can synthesize histidine establish visible colonies that are assayed to indicate mutagenicity. According to Bruce Ames, the pioneer developer of the test that bears his name, animal tests for carcinogens that make use of massive doses of chemicals have a misleading tendency to give results that cannot be accurately extrapolated to assess cancer risks from smaller doses of chemicals. This is because the huge doses of chemicals used kill large numbers of cells, which the organism\u2019s body attempts to replace with new cells. Rapidly dividing cells greatly increase the likelihood of mutations that result in cancer simply as the result of rapid cell proliferation, not genotoxicity. 23.8.5 IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSE The immune system acts as the body\u2019s natural defense system to protect it from xenobiotic chemicals; infectious agents, such as viruses or bacteria; and neoplastic cells, which give rise to cancerous tissue. Adverse effects on the body\u2019s immune system are being increasingly recognized as important consequences of exposure to hazardous substances. Toxicants can cause immunosuppression, which is the impairment of the body\u2019s natural defense mechanisms. Xenobiotics can also cause the immune system to lose its ability to control cell proliferation, resulting in leukemia or lymphoma. Another major toxic response of the immune system is allergy or hypersensitivity. This kind of condition results when the immune system overreacts to the presence of a foreign agent or its metabolites in a self-destructive manner. Among the xenobiotic materials that can cause such reactions are beryllium, chromium, nickel, formaldehyde, some kinds of pesticides, resins, and plasticizers. 23.8.6 ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION Some pollutants are of particular concern because of their potential to disrupt the crucial endocrine gland activities that regulate the metabolism and reproductive functions of organisms.5 Because they live in water, fish, frogs, and reptiles such as alligators are particularly susceptible to such substances present as water pollutants. Exposed fish have exhibited reproductive dysfunction, alterations in secondary sex characteristics, and abnormal serum steroid levels. Substances that exhibit hormone-like activity in test subjects are called hormonally active agents. Of particular concern are the substances that act like estrogen, the female sex hormone, that survive wastewater treatment and get into waterways receiving treated wastewater. Examples of such compounds are shown in Figure 23.16. Among such substances are estrogen, an endogenous sex hormone; 17a-ethinylestradiol, an ingredient of oral contraceptives, and chemicals from industrial and consumer sources, such as the last two examples in Figure 23.16. Estrogenic substances from artificial sources are called xeno estrogens and include antioxidants, bisphenol A, dioxins, PCBs, phytoestrogens (from plants), some pesticides (chlordecone, dieldrin, DDT and its metabolites, methoxychlor, toxaphene), preservatives, and phthalic esters (butylbenzyl phthalate). 23.9 HEALTH HAZARDS In recent years attention in toxicology has shifted away from readily recognized, usually severe, acute maladies that developed on a short time scale as a result of brief, intense exposure to toxicants, toward delayed, chronic, often less severe illnesses caused by long-term exposure to low levels of toxicants. Although the total impact of the latter kinds of health effects may be substantial, their assessment is very difficult because of factors such as uncertainties in exposure, low occurrence above background levels of disease, and long latency periods.

Both 4-tert-octylphenol and p-nonylphenol are breakdown products of nonionic surfactants, bisphenol A is an ingredient of epoxy resins and other polymers, genistein is synthesized by trees to make the wood disease-resistant and is present in pulp mill discharges, and dibutylphthalate is a plasticizer in plastics. 23.9.1 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE A critical step in assessing exposure to toxic substances, such as those from hazardous waste sites is evaluation of potentially exposed populations. The most direct approach to this is to determine chemicals or their metabolic products in organisms. For inorganic species this is most readily done for heavy metals, radionuclides, and some minerals, such as asbestos. Symptoms associated with exposure to particular chemicals may also be evaluated. Examples of such effects include readily apparent effects, for example, skin rashes, or subclinical effects, such as chromosomal damage. 23.9.2 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE Epidemiological studies applied to toxic environmental pollutants, such as those from hazardous wastes, attempt to correlate observations of particular illnesses with probable exposure to such wastes. There are two major approaches to such studies. One approach is to look for diseases known to be caused by particular agents in areas where exposure is likely from such agents in hazardous wastes. A second approach is to look for clusters consisting of an abnormally large number of cases of a particular disease in a limited geographic area, then attempt to locate sources of exposure to hazardous wastes that may be responsible. The most common types of maladies observed in clusters are spontaneous abortions, birth defects, and particular types of cancer. Epidemiologic studies are complicated by long latency periods from exposure to onset of disease, lack of specificity in the correlation between exposure to a particular waste and the occurrence of a disease, and background levels of a disease in the absence of exposure to a hazardous waste capable of causing the disease. 23.9.3 ESTIMATION OF HEALTH EFFECTS RISKS An important part of estimating the risks of adverse health effects from exposure to toxicants involves extrapolation from experimentally observable data. Usually the end result needed is an estimate of a low occurrence of a disease in humans after a long latency period resulting from low-level exposure to a toxicant for a long period of time. The data available are almost always taken from animals exposed to high levels of the substance for a relatively short period of time. Extrapolation is then made using linear or curvilinear projections to estimate the risk to human populations. There are, of course, very substantial uncertainties in this kind of approach. 23.9.4 RISK ASSESSMENT Toxicological considerations are very important in estimating potential dangers of pollutants and hazardous waste chemicals. One of the major ways in which toxicology interfaces with the area of hazardous wastes is in health risk assessment, providing guidance for risk management, cleanup, or regulation needed at a hazardous waste site based upon knowledge about the site and the chemical and toxicological properties of wastes in it. Risk assessment includes the factors of site characteristics; substances present, including indicator species; potential receptors; potential exposure pathways; and uncertainty analysis. It may be divided into the following major components: \u2022 Identification of hazard \u2022 Exposure assessment \u2022 Dose\u2013response assessment \u2022 Risk characterization LITERATURE CITED 1.

This chapter discusses this relationship with regard to some of the major pollutants and hazardous substances. The first section deals with toxicological aspects of elements (particularly heavy metals), the presence of which in a compound frequently means that the compound is toxic. It also discusses the toxicities of some commonly used elemental forms, such as the chemically uncombined elemental halogens. The following section discusses the toxicological chemistry of inorganic compounds, many of which are produced from industrial processes. It also provides a brief discussion of organometallic compounds. The next section deals with the toxicology of organic compounds. The toxicological properties of hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing organic compounds are discussed along with other organic substances containing functional groups, such as alcohols and ketones. This section also discusses the toxicities of organic nitrogen, halide, sulfur, and phosphorus compounds, some of which are used as pesticides or military poisons. Finally, toxic natural products are discussed. 24.1.1 ATSDR TOXICOLOGICAL PROFILES A very useful source of information about the toxicological chemistry of various kinds of toxic substances is published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances, and Disease Registry ATSDR\u2019s Toxicological Profi les. The detailed documents pertaining to these substances, which are listed in Table 24.1, can be accessed through the website cited in the table. 24.2 TOXIC ELEMENTS AND ELEMENTAL FORMS 24.2.1 OZONE Ozone (O3, see Chapters 9, 13, and 14) has several toxic effects. Air containing 1 ppm by volume ozone has a distinct odor. Inhalation of ozone at this level causes severe irritation and headache. Ozone irritates the eyes, upper respiratory system, and lungs. Inhalation of ozone can sometimes cause fatal pulmonary edema. Pulmonary refers to lungs and edema to an accumulation of fl uid in tissue spaces; therefore, pulmonary edema is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in lung tissue. Chromosomal damage has been observed in subjects exposed to ozone. Ozone generates free radicals in tissue. These reactive species can cause lipid peroxidation, oxidation of sulfhydryl (\u2013SH) groups, and other destructive oxidation processes. Compounds that protect organisms from the effects of ozone include radical scavengers, antioxidants, and compounds containing sulfhydryl groups.

It is a systemic poison, that is, one that is transported through the body to sites remote from its entry site. White phosphorus causes anemia, gastrointestinal system dysfunction, bone brittleness, and eye damage. Exposure also causes phossy jaw, a condition in which the jawbone deteriorates and becomes fractured. 24.2.3 ELEMENTAL HALOGENS Elemental fl uorine (F2) is a pale yellow, highly reactive gas that is a strong oxidant. It is a toxic irritant and attacks skin, eye tissue, and the mucous membranes of the nose and respiratory tract. Chlorine (Cl2) gas reacts in water to produce a strongly oxidizing solution. This reaction is responsible for some of the damage caused to the moist tissue lining the respiratory tract when the tissue is exposed to chlorine. The respiratory tract is rapidly irritated by exposure to 10\u201320 ppm of chlorine gas in air, causing acute discomfort that warns of the presence of the toxicant. Even brief exposure to 1000 ppm of Cl2 can be fatal. Bromine (Br2) is a volatile, dark red liquid that is toxic when inhaled or ingested. Like chlorine and fluorine, it is strongly irritating to the mucous tissue of the respiratory tract and eyes and may cause pulmonary edema. The toxicological hazard of bromine is limited somewhat because its irritating odor elicits a withdrawal response. Elemental solid iodine (I2) is irritating to the lungs much like Cl2 or Br2. However, the relatively low vapor pressure of iodine limits exposure to I2 vapor. 24.2.4 HEAVY METALS Heavy metals (Section 7.3) are toxic in their chemically combined forms and some, notably mercury, are toxic in the elemental form. The toxic properties of some of the most hazardous heavy metals and metalloids are discussed here. Although not truly a heavy metal, beryllium (atomic mass 9.01) is one of the more hazardous toxic elements. Its most serious toxic effect is berylliosis, a condition manifested by lung fi brosis and pneumonitis, which may develop after a latency period of 5\u201320 years. Beryllium is a hypersensitizing agent and exposure to it causes skin granulomas and ulcerated skin. Beryllium was used in the nuclear weapons program in the United States, and it is believed that 500\u20131000 cases of beryllium poisoning have occurred or will occur in the future as a result of exposure to workers. In July 1999, the U.S. Department of Energy acknowledged these cases of beryllium poisoning and proposed legislation to compensate the victims. This resulted in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program of 2000 under which qualifi ed workers with beryllium disease can receive a lump sum payment of $150,000 as reimbursement for disability and medical care resulting from the disease.1 Cadmium adversely affects several important enzymes; it can also cause painful osteomalacia (bone disease) and kidney damage.", "Inhalation of cadmium oxide dusts and fumes results in cadmium pneumonitis characterized by edema and pulmonary epithelium necrosis (death of tissue lining lungs). Lead, widely distributed as metallic lead, inorganic compounds, and organometallic compounds, has a number of toxic effects, including inhibition of the synthesis of hemoglobin. It also adversely affects the central and peripheral nervous systems and the kidneys. Its toxicological effects have been widely studied. Arsenic is a metalloid that forms a number of toxic compounds. The toxic +3 oxide, As2O3, is absorbed through the lungs and intestines. Biochemically, arsenic acts to coagulate proteins, forms complexes with coenzymes, and inhibits the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in essential metabolic processes involving the utilization of energy. Arsenic is the toxic agent in one of the greatest environmental catastrophes of the last century, the result of its ingestion through well water in Bangladesh is discussed in Chapter 7, Section 7.4. An interesting historical footnote with respect to arsenic poisoning is that of the arsenic eaters who were smugglers traversing the Alps of southern Austria as recently as the early 1900s. By carrying heavy loads on their backs through the mountains, they were able to evade tolls levied by local governmental bodies in the region. Starting with doses of arsenic trioxide of 10 mg twice a week, these individuals gradually raised their intake to more than 450 mg per week, which is almost 10 times the lower fatal dose for nonacclimated individuals. This enabled their bodies to switch from oxic sugar metabolism to the anoxic lactic acid cycle for their energy needs so that they could endure the vigorous exercise of carrying heavy loads of smuggled goods at high altitudes! One can only wonder how many potential arsenic eaters died in attempts to acclimate their bodies to this deadly poison. Elemental mercury vapor can enter the body through inhalation and be carried by the bloodstream to the brain where it penetrates the blood\u2013brain barrier. It disrupts metabolic processes in the brain causing tremor and psychopathological symptoms such as shyness, insomnia, depression, and irritability. Divalent ionic mercury, Hg2+, damages the kidney. Organometallic mercury compounds are also very toxic, dimethylmercury, Hg(CH3)2, spectacularly so, killing most of the early investigators who first synthesized it. 24.3 TOXIC INORGANIC COMPOUNDS 24.3.1 CYANIDE Both hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and cyanide salts (which contain CN-ion) are rapidly acting poisons; a dose of only 60\u201390 mg is sufficient to kill a human. Metabolically, cyanide bonds to iron(III) in iron-containing ferricytochrome oxidase enzyme (see enzymes, Section 22.6), preventing its reduction to iron(II) in the oxidative phosphorylation process by which the body utilizes O2. This prevents utilization of oxygen in cells, so that metabolic processes cease. 24.3.2 CARBON MONOXIDE Carbon monoxide, CO, is a common cause of accidental poisonings. At CO levels in air of 10 ppm, impairment of judgment and visual perception occur; exposure to 100 ppm causes dizziness, headache, and weariness; loss of consciousness occurs at 250 ppm; and inhalation of 1000 ppm results in rapid death. Chronic long-term exposures to low levels of carbon monoxide are suspected of causing disorders of the respiratory system and the heart. After entering the blood stream through the lungs, carbon monoxide reacts with hemoglobin (Hb) to convert oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) to carboxyhemoglobin (COHb): O2Hb + CO COHb + O2 (24.1) In this case, hemoglobin is the receptor (Section 23.7) acted on by the carbon monoxide toxicant. Carboxyhemoglobin is much more stable than oxyhemoglobin so that its formation prevents hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to body tissues. The equilibrium constant expression for the preceding reaction is [COHb] _______ PCO = M \u00a5 . (24.2) [O2Hb] PCO2 where [COHb] and [O2Hb] are the equilibrium concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin, respectively, in blood, P denotes the partial pressures of CO and O2 in air, and M is the Haldane constant for which values of 210\u2013220 are commonly used for adult human hemoglobin. 24.3.3 NITROGEN OXIDES The two most common toxic oxides of nitrogen are NO and NO2, of which the latter is regarded as the more toxic. Nitrogen dioxide causes severe irritation of the innermost parts of the lungs resulting in pulmonary edema. In cases of severe exposures, fatal bronchiolitis fibrosa obliterans may develop approximately 3 weeks after exposure to NO2. Fatalities may result from even brief periods of inhalation of air containing 200\u2013700 ppm of NO2. Biochemically, NO2 disrupts lactic dehydrogenase and some other enzyme systems, possibly acting much like ozone, a stronger oxidant mentioned in Section 24.2.", "Free radicals, particularly HO\u2022, are likely formed in the body by the action of nitrogen dioxide and the compound probably causes lipid peroxidation in which the C=C double bonds in unsaturated body lipids are attacked by free radicals and undergo chain reactions in the presence of O2, resulting in their oxidative destruction. Nitrous oxide, N2O, is used as an oxidant gas and in dental surgery as a general anesthetic. This gas was once known as \u201claughing gas,\u201d and was used in the late 1800s as a \u201crecreational gas\u201d at parties held by some of our not-so-staid Victorian ancestors. Nitrous oxide is a central nervous system depressant and can act as an asphyxiant. 24.3.4 HYDROGEN HALIDES Hydrogen halides (general formula HX, where X is F, Cl, Br, or I) are relatively toxic gases. The most widely used of these gases are HF and HCl; their toxicities are discussed here. 24.3.4.1 Hydrogen Fluoride Hydrogen fluoride (HF, mp -83.1\u00b0C, bp 19.5\u00b0C) is used as a clear, colorless liquid or gas or as a 30\u201360% aqueous solution of hydrofl uoric acid, both referred to as HF here. Both are extreme irritants to any part of the body that they contact, causing ulcers in affected areas of the upper respiratory tract. Lesions caused by contact with HF heal poorly, and tend to develop gangrene. Fluoride ion, F-, is toxic in soluble fluoride salts, such as NaF, causing fl uorosis, a condition characterized by bone abnormalities and mottled, soft teeth. Livestock are especially susceptible to poisoning from fluoride fallout on grazing land; severely affl icted animals become lame and even die. Industrial pollution has been a common source of toxic levels of fluoride. However, about 1 ppm of fluoride used in some drinking water supplies prevents tooth decay. 24.3.4.2 Hydrogen Chloride Gaseous hydrogen chloride and its aqueous solution, called hydrochloric acid, both denoted as HCl, are much less toxic than HF. Hydrochloric acid is a natural physiological fluid present as a dilute solution in the stomachs of humans and other animals. However, the inhalation of HCl vapor can cause spasms of the larynx as well as pulmonary edema and even death at high levels. The high affi nity of hydrogen chloride vapor for water tends to dehydrate the eyes and respiratory tract tissue. 24.3.5 INTERHALOGEN COMPOUNDS AND HALOGEN OXIDES Interhalogen compounds, including ClF, BrCl, and BrF3, are extremely reactive and are potent oxidants. They react with water to produce hydrohalic acid solutions (HF, HCl) and nascent oxygen {O}. Too reactive to enter biological systems in their original chemical state, interhalogen compounds tend to be powerful corrosive irritants that acidify, oxidize, and dehydrate tissue, much like those of the elemental forms of the elements from which they are composed. Because of these effects, the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and pulmonary systems are especially susceptible to attack. Major halogen oxides, including fluorine monoxide (OF2), chlorine monoxide (Cl2O), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), chlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7), and bromine monoxide (Br2O), tend to be unstable, highly reactive, and toxic compounds that pose hazards similar to those of the interhalogen compounds discussed above. Chlorine dioxide, the most commonly used halogen oxide, is employed for odor control and bleaching wood pulp. As a substitute for chlorine in water disinfection, it produces fewer undesirable chemical by-products, particularly trihalomethanes. The most important of the oxyacids and their salts formed by halogens are hypochlorous acid, HOCl, and hypochlorites, such as NaOCl, used for bleaching and disinfection. The hypochlorites irritate the eyes, skin, and mucous membrane tissue because they react to produce active (nascent) oxygen ({O}) and acid as shown by the reaction below: HClO \u00c6 H++ Cl-+ {O} (24.3) 24.3.6 INORGANIC COMPOUNDS OF SILICON Silica (SiO2, quartz) occurs in a variety of types of rocks such as sand, sandstone, and diatomaceous earth. Silicosis resulting from human exposure to silica dust from construction materials, sandblasting, and other sources has been a common occupational disease. A type of pulmonary fibrosis that causes lung nodules and makes victims more susceptible to pneumonia and other lung diseases, silicosis is one of the most common disabling conditions resulting from industrial exposure to hazardous substances. It can cause death from insufficient oxygen or from heart failure in severe cases. Silane, SiH4, and disilane, H3SiSiH3, are examples of inorganic silanes, which have H\u2013Si bonds. Numerous organic (\u201corganometallic\u201d) silanes exist in which alkyl moieties are substituted for H. Little information is available regarding the toxicities of silanes.", "Silicon tetrachloride, SiCl4, is the only industrially significant compound of the silicon tetrahalides, a group of compounds with the general formula SiX4, where X is a halogen. The two commercially produced silicon halohydrides, general formula H4-xSiXx, are dichlorosilane (SiH2Cl2) and trichlorosilane (SiHCl3). These compounds are used as intermediates in the synthesis of organosilicon compounds and in the production of high-purity silicon for semiconductors. Silicon tetrachloride and trichlorosilane, fuming liquids that react with water to give off HCl vapor have suffocating odors and are irritants to the eyes, nasal, and lung tissue. 24.3.7 ASBESTOS Asbestos is the name given to a group of fibrous silicate minerals, typically those of the serpentine group, for which the approximate chemical formula is Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4. Asbestos has been widely used in structural materials, brake linings, insulation, and pipe manufacture. Inhalation of asbestos may cause asbestosis (a pneumonia condition), mesothelioma (tumor of the mesothelial tissue lining the chest cavity adjacent to the lungs), and bronchogenic carcinoma (cancer originating with the air passages in the lungs) so that uses of asbestos have been severely curtailed and widespread programs have been undertaken to remove the material from buildings. 24.3.8 INORGANIC PHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS Phosphine (PH3), a colorless gas that undergoes autoignition at 100\u00b0C, is a potential hazard in industrial processes and in the laboratory. Symptoms of potentially fatal poisoning from phosphine gas include pulmonary tract irritation, depression of the central nervous system, fatigue, vomiting, and difficult, painful breathing. Tetraphosphorus decoxide, P4O10, is produced as a fluffy white powder from the combustion of elemental phosphorus and reacts with water from air to form syrupy orthophosphoric acid. Because of the formation of acid by this reaction and its dehydrating action, P4O10 is a corrosive irritant to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. The most important of the phosphorus halides, general formulas PX3 and PX5, is phosphorus pentachloride used as a catalyst in organic synthesis, as a chlorinating agent, and as a raw material to make phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3). Because they react violently with water to produce the corresponding hydrogen halides and oxo phosphorus acids, PCl5 + 4H2O \u00c6 H3PO4 + 5HCl (24.4) the phosphorus halides are strong irritants to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. The major phosphorus oxyhalide in commercial use is phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3), a faintly yellow fuming liquid. Reacting with water to form toxic vapors of hydrochloric acid and phosphorus acid (H3PO3), phosphorus oxyhalide is a strong irritant to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. 24.3.9 INORGANIC COMPOUNDS OF SULFUR A colorless gas with a foul, rotten egg odor, hydrogen sulfide is very toxic. In some cases, inhalation of H2S kills faster than even hydrogen cyanide; rapid death ensues from exposure to air containing more than about 1000 ppm H2S due to asphyxiation from respiratory system paralysis. Lower doses cause symptoms that include headache, dizziness, and excitement due to damage to the central nervous system. General debility is one of the numerous effects of chronic H2S poisoning. Sulfur dioxide, SO2, dissolves in water to produce sulfurous acid, H2SO3; hydrogen sulfi te ion, HSO3 -; and sulfite ion, SO32-. Because of its water solubility, sulfur dioxide is largely removed in the upper respiratory tract. It is an irritant to the eyes, skin, mucous membranes, and respiratory tract. Some individuals are hypersensitive to sodium sulfi te (Na2SO3), which has been used as a chemical food preservative. Because of threats to hypersensitive individuals, these uses were severely restricted in the United States in early 1990. Number one in synthetic chemical production, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a severely corrosive poison and dehydrating agent in the concentrated liquid form; it readily penetrates the skin to reach subcutaneous tissue causing tissue necrosis with effects resembling those of severe thermal burns. Sulfuric acid fumes and mists irritate the eyes and respiratory tract tissue, and industrial exposure has even caused tooth erosion in workers.", "TABLE 24.2 Inorganic Sulfur Compounds Compound Name Formula Properties Sulfur Monofl uoride S2F2 Colorless gas, mp -104\u00b0C, bp 99\u00b0C, toxicity similar to HF Tetrafl uoride SF4 Gas, bp -40\u00b0C, mp -124\u00b0C, powerful irritant Hexafl uoride SF6 Colorless gas, mp -51\u00b0C, remarkably low toxicity when pure, but may be contaminated with toxic lower fl uorides Monochloride S2Cl2 Oily, fuming orange liquid, mp -80\u00b0C, bp 138\u00b0C, strong irritant to the eyes, skin, and lungs Tetrachloride SCl4 Brownish/yellow liquid/gas, mp -30\u00b0C, decomposes above 0\u00b0C, irritant Trioxide SO3 Solid anhydride of sulfuric acid reacts with moisture or steam to produce sulfuric acid Sulfuryl chloride SO2Cl2 Colorless liquid, mp -54\u00b0C, bp 69\u00b0C, used for organic synthesis, corrosive toxic irritant Thionyl chloride SOCl2 Colorless-to-orange fuming liquid, mp -105\u00b0C, bp 79\u00b0C, toxic corrosive irritant Carbon oxysulfide COS Volatile liquid by-product of natural gas or petroleum refining, toxic narcotic Carbon disulfi de CS2 Colorless liquid, industrial chemical, narcotic and central nervous system anesthetic The more important halides, oxides, and oxyhalides of sulfur are listed in Table 24.2. The major toxic effects of these compounds are given in the table. 24.3.10 PERCHLORATE Perchlorate anion, ClO4 -, is chemically unreactive and was long regarded as toxicologically insignificant, but it is now known that it inhibits the action of iodide, I-, required for proper functioning of the thyroid. Physiologically, ClO4 -competes with I- and diminishes iodide uptake by the thyroid to the - extent that it has even been used to treat cases of hyperthyroidism. The reduction of I- uptake by ClO4 competition inhibits the production of thyroid hormones. This is of particular concern because of the role of thyroid hormones in brain development before and after birth. Iodide carriers that are inhibited - by perchlorate have been studied in frogs.2 It is suspected that water contaminant ClO4 can alter sex ratios and inhibit metamorphosis, such as change from tadpoles to adult frogs, in amphibians. 24.3.11 ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS As discussed elsewhere in this book, a variety of toxic organometallic compounds are found in the environment. The toxicological properties of some organometallic compounds\u2014pharmaceutical organoarsenicals, organomercury fungicides, and tetraethyllead antiknock gasoline additives\u2014that were widely used in the past are well known. It is important to consider the potential toxicities of relatively newer organometallic compounds used in semiconductors as catalysts and for chemical synthesis. Organometallic compounds often behave in the body in ways totally unlike the inorganic forms of the metals that they contain. This is due in large part to the fact that, compared to inorganic forms, organometallic compounds have an organic nature and higher lipid solubility. 24.3.11.1 Organolead Compounds Perhaps the most notable toxic organometallic compound is tetraethyllead, Pb(C2H5)4, a colorless, oily liquid that was widely used as a gasoline additive to boost octane rating. Tetraethyllead has a strong affinity for lipids and can enter the body by all three common routes of inhalation, ingestion, and absorption through the skin. Acting differently from inorganic compounds in the body, it affects the central nervous system with symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, restlessness, ataxia, psychosis, and convulsions. Recovery from severe lead poisoning tends to be slow. In cases of fatal tetraethyllead poisoning, death has occurred as soon as 1 or 2 days after exposure. 24.3.11.2 Organotin Compounds The greatest number of organometallic compounds in commercial use are those of tin\u2014tributyltin chloride and related tributyltin (TBT) compounds. These compounds have bactericidal, fungicidal, and insecticidal properties. They have particular environmental significance because of their widespread applications as industrial biocides, now increasingly limited because of their environmental and toxicological effects. Organotin compounds are readily absorbed through the skin, sometimes causing a skin rash. They probably bind with sulfur groups on proteins and appear to interfere with mitochondrial function. 24.3.11.3 Carbonyls Metal carbonyls, regarded as extremely hazardous because of their toxicities include nickel tetracarbonyl [Ni(CO)4], cobalt carbonyl, and iron pentacarbonyl. Some of the hazardous carbonyls are volatile and readily taken into the body through the respiratory tract or through the skin. The carbonyls affect tissue directly and they break down to toxic carbon monoxide and products of the metal, which have additional toxic effects. 24.3.11.4 Reaction Products of Organometallic Compounds An example of the production of a toxic substance from the burning of an organometallic compound is provided by the combustion of diethylzinc: Zn(C2H5)2 + 7O2 \u00c6 ZnO(s) + 5H2O(g) + 4CO2(g) (24.5) Zinc oxide is used as a healing agent and food additive. However, inhalation of zinc oxide fume particles produced by the combustion of zinc organometallic compounds causes zinc metal fume fever.", "This is an uncomfortable condition characterized by elevated temperature and \u201cchills.\u201d 24.4 TOXICOLOGY OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 24.4.1 ALKANE HYDROCARBONS Gaseous methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane (both C4H10) are regarded as simple asphyxiants that form mixtures with air containing insufficient oxygen to support respiration. The most common toxicological occupational problem associated with the use of hydrocarbon liquids in the workplace is dermatitis, caused by dissolution of the fat portions of the skin and characterized by inflamed, dry, scaly skin. Inhalation of volatile liquid 5\u20138 carbon n-alkanes and branched-chain alkanes may cause central nervous system depression manifested by dizziness and loss of coordination. Exposure to n-hexane and cyclohexane results in loss of myelin (a fatty substance constituting a sheath around certain nerve fibers) and degeneration of axons (part of a nerve cell through which nerve impulses are transferred out of the cell). This has resulted in multiple disorders of the nervous system (polyneuropathy) including muscle weakness and impaired sensory function of the hands and feet. In the body, n-hexane is metabolized to 2,5-hexanedione, a Phase I oxidation product that can be observed in urine of exposed individuals and used as a biological monitor of exposure to n-hexane. H H O H H H C C C 2,5-hexanedioneC CCH H H O H H 24.4.2 ALKENE AND ALKYNE HYDROCARBONS Ethylene, a widely used colorless gas with a somewhat sweet odor, acts as a simple asphyxiant and anesthetic to animals and is phytotoxic (toxic to plants). The toxicological properties of propylene (C3H6) are very similar to those of ethylene. Colorless, odorless, gaseous 1,3-butadiene is an irritant to the eyes and respiratory system mucous membranes; at higher levels it can cause unconsciousness and even death. It causes cancer in animals and is rated as a probable human carcinogen. Acetylene, H-C\u222bC-H, is a colorless gas with a garlic odor. It acts as an asphyxiant and narcotic, causing headache, dizziness, and gastric disturbances. Some of these effects may be due to the presence of impurities in the commercial product. 24.4.3 BENZENE AND AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS Inhaled benzene is readily absorbed by blood, from which it is strongly taken up by fatty tissues. For the nonmetabolized compound, the process is reversible and benzene is excreted through the lungs. As shown in Figure 24.1, benzene is converted to phenol by a Phase I oxidation reaction (see Section 23.6) in the liver. The reactive and short-lived benzene epoxide intermediate known to occur in this reaction is probably responsible for much of the unique toxicity of benzene, which involves damage to bone marrow. In addition to phenol, several other oxygenated derivatives of benzene are produced when it is metabolized, as is trans,trans-muconic acid, produced by cleavage of the benzene ring. Benzene is a skin irritant, and progressively higher local exposures can cause skin redness (erythema), burning sensations, fluid accumulation (edema), and blistering. Inhalation of air containing about 7 g/m3 of benzene causes acute poisoning within an hour because of a narcotic effect upon the central nervous system manifested progressively by excitation, depression, respiratory system failure, and death. Inhalation of air containing more than about 60 g/m3 of benzene can be fatal within a few minutes. Long-term exposures to lower levels of benzene cause nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue, headache, and appetite loss. Chronic benzene poisoning causes blood abnormalities, including a lowered white cell count, an abnormal increase in blood lymphocytes (colorless corpuscles introduced to the blood from the lymph glands), anemia, a decrease in the number of blood platelets required for clotting (thrombocytopenia), and damage to bone marrow. It is thought that preleukemia, leukemia, or cancer may result.

Toluene can be tolerated without noticeable ill effects in ambient air up to 200 ppm. Exposure to 500 ppm may cause headache, nausea, lassitude, and impaired coordination without detectable physiological effects. Massive exposure to toluene has a narcotic effect, which can lead to coma.", "Because it possesses an aliphatic side chain that can be oxidized enzymatically to products that are readily excreted from the body (see the metabolic reaction scheme in Figure 24.2), toluene is much less toxic than benzene. 24.4.3.2 Naphthalene As is the case with benzene, naphthalene undergoes a Phase I oxidation reaction that places an epoxide group on the aromatic ring. This process is followed by Phase II conjugation reactions to yield products that can be eliminated from the body in the urine. Exposure to naphthalene can cause anemia and marked reductions in red cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit in individuals exhibiting genetic susceptibility to these conditions. Naphthalene causes skin irritation or severe dermatitis in sensitized individuals. Headaches, confusion, and vomiting may result from inhalation or ingestion of naphthalene. Death from kidney failure occurs in severe instances of poisoning. 24.4.3.3 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Benzo[a]pyrene (see Section 10.4) is the most studied of the PAHs. Some metabolites of PAH compounds, particularly the 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide of benzo[a]pyrene shown in Figure 24.3, are known to cause cancer. There are two stereoisomers of this metabolite, both of which are known to be potent mutagens and presumably can cause cancer. They act by forming adducts with DNA. 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide Benzo[a]pyrene OH of benzo[a]pyrene FIGURE 24.3 Benzo[a]pyrene and its carcinogenic metabolic product. 24.4.4 OXYGEN-CONTAINING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 24.4.4.1 Oxides Hydrocarbon oxides such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, O O H H C C H H C C C H H H H H H Ethylene oxide Propylene oxide which are characterized by an epoxide functional group bridging oxygen between two adjacent C atoms, are widely used and toxic. Ethylene oxide, a gaseous colorless, sweet-smelling, fl ammable, explosive gas used as a chemical intermediate, sterilant, and fumigant, is moderately to highly toxic, a mutagen, and carcinogenic to experimental animals. Inhalation of relatively low levels of this gas results in respiratory tract irritation, headache, drowsiness, and dyspnea, whereas exposure to higher levels causes cyanosis, pulmonary edema, kidney damage, peripheral nerve damage, and even death. Propylene oxide is a colorless, reactive, volatile liquid (bp 34\u00b0C) with uses similar to those of ethylene oxide and similar, though less severe, toxic effects. The toxicity of 1,2,3,4-butadiene epoxide, the oxidation product of 1,3-butadiene, is notable in that it is a direct-acting (primary) carcinogen. 24.4.4.2 Alcohols Human exposure to the three light alcohols shown in Figure 24.4 is common because they are widely used industrially and in consumer products. Methanol, which has caused many fatalities when ingested accidentally or consumed as a substitute for beverage ethanol, is metabolically oxidized to formaldehyde and formic acid. In addition to causing acidosis, these products affect the central nervous system and the optic nerve. Acute exposure to lethal doses causes an initially mild inebriation, followed in about 10\u201320 h by unconsciousness, cardiac depression, and death. Sublethal exposures can cause blindness from deterioration of the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells. Inhalation of methanol fumes may result in chronic, low-level exposure. Ethanol is usually ingested through the gastrointestinal tract, but can be absorbed as vapor by the alveoli of the lungs. Ethanol is oxidized metabolically more rapidly than methanol, first to acetaldehyde (discussed later in this section), then to CO2. Ethanol has numerous acute effects resulting from central nervous system depression. These range from decreased inhibitions and slowed reaction times at 0.05% blood ethanol, through intoxication, stupor, and\u2014at more than 0.5% blood ethanol\u2014death. Ethanol also has a number of chronic effects, of which the addictive condition of alcoholism and cirrhosis of the liver are the most prominent. Despite its widespread use in automobile cooling systems, exposure to ethylene glycol is limited by its low vapor pressure. However, inhalation of droplets of ethylene glycol can be very dangerous. In the body, ethylene glycol initially stimulates the central nervous system, then depresses it. Glycolic acid, chemical formula HOCH2CO2H, formed as an intermediate metabolite in the metabolism of ethylene glycol, may cause acidemia, and oxalic acid produced by further oxidation may precipitate in the kidneys as solid calcium oxalate, CaC2O4, causing clogging. H H H H H H C OH H C C OH HO C C OH H H H H H Methanol Ethanol Ethylene glycol FIGURE 24.4 Alcohols such as these three compounds are oxygenated compounds in which the hydroxyl functional group is attached to an alkyl or alkenyl hydrocarbon skeleton. Of the higher alcohols, 1-butanol is an irritant, but its toxicity is limited by its low vapor pressure.", "Unsaturated (alkenyl) allyl alcohol, CH2 =CHCH2OH, has a pungent odor and is strongly irritating to the eyes, mouth, and lungs. 24.4.5 PHENOLS Figure 24.5 shows some of the more important phenolic compounds, aryl analogs of alcohols which have properties much different from those of the aliphatic and olefinic alcohols. Nitro groups (\u2013NO2) and halogen atoms (particularly Cl) bonded to the aromatic rings strongly affect the chemical and toxicological behavior of phenolic compounds. Although the first antiseptic to be used on wounds and in surgery, phenol is a protoplasmic poison that damages all kinds of cells and is alleged to have caused \u201can astonishing number of poisonings\u201d since it came into general use.3 The acute toxicological effects of phenol are largely upon the central nervous system and death can occur as soon as one and half hour after exposure. Acute poisoning by phenol can cause severe gastrointestinal disturbances, kidney malfunction, circulatory system failure, lung edema, and convulsions. Fatal doses of phenol may be absorbed through the skin. Key organs damaged by chronic phenol exposure include the spleen, pancreas, and kidneys. The toxic effects of other phenols resemble those of phenol. 24.4.5.1 Aldehydes and Ketones Some of the more common carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) are shown in Figure 24.6. Because of their widespread use, these compounds are toxicologically signifi cant. Formaldehyde is uniquely important because of its widespread use and toxicity. In the pure form, formaldehyde is a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor. It is commonly encountered as formalin, a 37\u201350% aqueous solution of formaldehyde containing some methanol. Exposure to inhaled formaldehyde via the respiratory tract is usually due to molecular formaldehyde vapor, whereas exposure by other routes is usually due to formalin. Prolonged, continuous exposure to formaldehyde can cause hypersensitivity. A severe irritant to the mucous membrane linings of both the respiratory and alimentary tracts, formaldehyde reacts strongly with functional groups in molecules. Formaldehyde has been shown to be a lung carcinogen in experimental animals. The toxicity of formaldehyde is largely due to its metabolic oxidation product, formic acid (see Section 24.4.5.2). H O C H H H C H O C H H CH H C O C H Formaldehyde Acetaldehyde Acrolein H O H H O H H H C C C H H C C C C H H H H H H Acetone Methylethyl ketone FIGURE 24.6 Commercially and toxicologically significant aldehydes and ketones. The lower aldehydes are relatively water-soluble and intensely irritating. These compounds attack exposed moist tissue, particularly the eyes and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. (Some of the irritating properties of photochemical smog, Chapter 13, are due to the presence of aldehydes.) However, aldehydes that are relatively less soluble can penetrate further into the respiratory tract and affect the lungs. Colorless, liquid acetaldehyde is relatively less toxic than acrolein and acts as an irritant and systemically as a narcotic to the central nervous system. Extremely irritating, lachrimating acrolein vapor has a choking odor and inhalation of it can cause severe damage to respiratory tract membranes. Tissue exposed to acrolein may undergo severe necrosis, and direct contact with the eye can be especially hazardous. The ketones shown in Figure 24.6 are relatively less toxic than the aldehydes. Pleasant-smelling acetone can act as a narcotic; it causes dermatitis by dissolving fats from skin. Not many toxic effects have been attributed to methyl ethyl ketone. It is suspected of having caused neuropathic disorders in shoe factory workers. 24.4.5.2 Carboxylic Acids Formic acid, HCO2H, is a relatively strong acid that is corrosive to tissue. In Europe, decalcifi er formulations for removing mineral scale that contain about 75% formic acid are sold; and children ingesting these solutions have suffered corrosive lesions to the mouth and esophageal tissue. Although acetic acid as a 4\u20136% solution in vinegar is an ingredient of many foods, pure acetic acid (glacial acetic acid) is extremely corrosive to the tissue that it contacts. Ingestion of or skin contact with acrylic acid can cause severe damage to tissues. 24.4.5.3 Ethers The common ethers have relatively low toxicities because of the low reactivity of the C\u2013O\u2013C functional group which has very strong carbon\u2013oxygen bonds. Exposure to volatile diethyl ether is usually by inhalation and about 80% of this compound that gets into the body is eliminated unmetabolized as the vapor through the lungs. Diethyl ether depresses the central nervous system and is a depressant widely used as an anesthetic for surgery.", "Low doses of diethyl ether cause drowsiness, intoxication, and stupor, whereas higher exposures cause unconsciousness and even death. 24.4.5.4 Acid Anhydrides Strong-smelling, intensely lachrimating acetic anhydride, H O O H H C C O C C H Acetic anhydride H H is a systemic poison. It is very corrosive to the skin, eyes, and upper respiratory tract, causing blisters and burns that heal only slowly. Levels in the air should not exceed 0.04 mg/m3 and adverse effects to the eyes can occur at about 0.4 mg/m3. 24.4.5.5 Esters Many esters (Figure 24.7) have relatively high volatilities so that the pulmonary system is a major route of exposure. Because of their generally good solvent properties, esters penetrate tissues and tend to dissolve body lipids. For example, vinyl acetate acts as a skin defatting agent. Because they hydrolyze in water, ester toxicities tend to be the same as the toxicities of the acids and alcohols H O H H O H H H O H H H C O C C H C C O C C H C C C O C C H H H H H H H H H Methyl acetate Vinyl acetate Allyl acetate C2H5 O H H H H H C O C C C C C C H H H H H H H Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalateH H H H H H C O C C C C C C H H H H H H C2H5 FIGURE 24.7 Examples of esters. from which they were formed. Many volatile esters exhibit asphyxiant and narcotic action. Whereas many of the naturally occurring esters have insignificant toxicities at low doses, allyl acetate and some of the other synthetic esters are relatively toxic. Insofar as potential health effects are concerned, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is arguably the ester of most concern. This is because of the use of this ester at levels of around 30% as a plasticizer to impart flexibility to PVC plastic. As a consequence of the widespread use of DEHP-containing PVC plastics, DEHP has become a ubiquitous contaminant found in water, sediment, food, and biological samples. There has been concern about its use in medical applications such as in bags used to hold intravenous solutions administered to medical patients. Although the acute toxic effects of DEHP are low, widespread direct exposure of humans is worrisome. 24.4.6 ORGANONITROGEN COMPOUNDS Organonitrogen compounds constitute a large group of compounds with diverse toxicities. Examples of several of the kinds of organonitrogen compounds discussed here are given in Figure 24.8. 24.4.6.1 Aliphatic Amines The lower amines, such as the methylamines, are rapidly and easily taken into the body by all common exposure routes. They are basic and react with water in tissue, R3N + H2O \u00c6 R3NH++ OH- (24.6) CH3 H H N H2N C C NH2 N H H Trimethylamine Ethylenediamine Pyridine H3C CH3 H NH2 H C C C N NH2 H Aniline 2-Naphthylamine Acrylonitrile H2N NH2 NO2 Benzidine Nitrobenzene FIGURE 24.8 Some toxicologically significant organonitrogen compounds. thereby raising the pH of the tissue to harmful levels, acting as corrosive poisons (especially to sensitive eye tissue), and causing tissue necrosis at the point of contact. Among the systemic effects of amines are necrosis of the liver and kidneys, lung hemorrhage and edema, and sensitization of the immune system. The lower amines are among the more toxic substances in routine, large-scale use. Ethylenediamine is the most common of the alkyl polyamines, compounds in which two or more amino groups are bonded to alkane moieties. Its toxicity rating is only 3, but it is a strong skin sensitizer and can damage eye tissue. 24.4.6.2 Carbocyclic Aromatic Amines Aniline is a widely used industrial chemical and is the simplest of the carbocyclic aromatic amines, a class of compounds in which at least one substituent group is an aromatic hydrocarbon ring bonded directly to the amino group. There are numerous compounds with many industrial uses in this class of amines. Some of the carbocyclic aromatic amines have been shown to cause cancer in the human bladder, ureter, and pelvis, and are suspected of being lung, liver, and prostate carcinogens. A very toxic colorless liquid with an oily consistency and distinct odor, aniline readily enters the body by inhalation, ingestion, and through the skin. Metabolically, aniline converts iron(II) in hemoglobin to iron(III). This causes a condition called methemoglobinemia, characterized by cyanosis and a brown-black color of the blood, in which the hemoglobin can no longer transport oxygen in the body.", "This condition is not reversed by oxygen therapy. Both 1-naphthylamine (a-naphthylamine) and 2-naphthylamine (b-naphthylamine) are proven human bladder carcinogens. In addition to being a proven human carcinogen, benzidine, 4,4\u00a2diaminobiphenyl, is highly toxic and has systemic effects that include blood hemolysis, bone marrow depression, and kidney and liver damage. It can be taken into the body orally, by inhalation into the lungs, and by skin sorption. 24.4.6.3 Pyridine Pyridine, a colorless liquid with a sharp, penetrating, \u201cterrible\u201d odor, is an aromatic amine in which an N atom is part of a 6-membered ring. This widely used industrial chemical is only moderately toxic with a toxicity rating of 3. Symptoms of pyridine poisoning include anorexia, nausea, fatigue, and, in cases of chronic poisoning, mental depression. In a few rare cases, pyridine poisoning has been fatal. 24.4.6.4 Acrylamide: Toxic Potato Chips? In 2002, Swedish investigators reported finding potentially harmful amounts of acrylamide in fried and baked foods, but not in boiled foods. Acrylamide is known to be a neurotoxin and is a carcinogen to rats and possibly to humans as well. The formation of acrylamide has been shown to occur when glucose and the amino acid asparagine are heated together to temperatures exceeding 120\u00b0C. The reaction sequence below, known as the Maillard reaction, results in the formation of acrylamide from glucose and asparagine: OH HO H2N \u2013H2OHO O + CCCNH2 \u2013CO2OH HOC HO H OH O Glucose Asparagine (24.7) OH HO O HHO HO H Several NCCCNH2 CCCNH2HO steps OH HH Acrylamide 24.4.6.5 Nitriles Nitriles contain the \u2013C\u222bN functional group. Colorless, liquid acetonitrile, CH3CN, is widely used in the chemical industry. With a toxicity rating of 3\u20134, acetonitrile is considered relatively safe, although it has caused human deaths, perhaps by metabolic release of cyanide. Acrylonitrile, a colorless liquid with a peach-seed (cyanide) odor, is highly reactive because it contains both nitrile and C=C groups. Ingested, absorbed through the skin, or inhaled as vapor, acrylonitrile metabolizes to release deadly HCN, which it resembles toxicologically. 24.4.6.6 Nitro Compounds The simplest of the nitro compounds, nitromethane H3CNO2, is an oily liquid that causes anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting and damages the kidneys and liver. Nitrobenzene, a pale yellow, oily liquid with an odor of bitter almonds or shoe polish, can enter the body by all routes. It has a toxic action much like that of aniline, converting hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which cannot carry oxygen to body tissue. Nitrobenzene poisoning is manifested by cyanosis. 24.4.6.7 Nitrosamines N-nitroso compounds (nitrosamines) contain the N\u2013N=O functional group and have been found in a variety of materials to which humans may be exposed, including beer, whiskey, and cutting oils used in machining. Cancer may result from exposure to a single large dose or from chronic exposure to relatively small doses of some nitrosamines. Once widely used as an industrial solvent and known to cause liver damage and jaundice in exposed workers, dimethylnitrosamine was shown to be carcinogenic from studies starting in the 1950s. CH3 Dimethylnitrosamine N N O (N-nitrosodimethylamine) CH3 24.4.6.8 Isocyanates and Methyl Isocyanate Compounds with the general formula R\u2013N=C=O, isocyanates are widely used industrial chemicals noted for the high chemical and metabolic reactivity of their characteristic functional group. Methyl isocyanate, H3C\u2013N=C=O, was the toxic agent involved in the catastrophic industrial poisoning in Bhopal, India, on December 2, 1984, the worst industrial accident in history. In this incident, several tons of methyl isocyanate were released, killing 2000 people and affecting about 100,000. The lungs of victims were attacked; survivors suffered long-term shortness of breath and weakness from lung damage, as well as numerous other toxic effects including nausea and bodily pain. 24.4.6.9 Organonitrogen Pesticides Pesticidal carbamates are characterized by the structural skeleton of carbamic acid outlined by the dashed box in the structural formula of carbaryl in Figure 24.9. Widely used on lawns and gardens, insecticidal carbaryl has a low toxicity to mammals. Highly water-soluble carbofuran is a systemic insecticide in that it is taken up by the roots and leaves of plants; insects that feed on the leaves are poisoned. The toxic effects on animals exposed to carbamates are due to the fact that they inhibit acetylcholinesterase directly without the need to first undergo biotransformation. This effect is relatively reversible because of metabolic hydrolysis of the carbamate ester. Reputed to have \u201cbeen responsible for hundreds of human deaths,\u201d4 herbicidal paraquat has a toxicity rating of 5. Dangerous or even fatal acute exposures can occur by inhalation of spray, skin contact, and ingestion.", "Paraquat is a systemic poison that affects enzyme activity and is devastating to a number of organs. Pulmonary fibrosis results in animals that have inhaled paraquat aerosols, + N+ H3C N CH3 N+ +N Diquat Paraquat FIGURE 24.9 Examples of organonitrogen pesticides. and the lungs are also adversely affected by nonpulmonary exposure. Acute exposure may cause variations in the levels of catecholamine, glucose, and insulin. The most prominent initial symptom of poisoning is vomiting, followed within a few days by dyspnea, cyanosis, and evidence of impairment of the kidneys, liver, and heart. Pulmonary fibrosis, often accompanied by pulmonary edema and hemorrhaging, is observed in fatal cases. Arguably the most widely encountered organonitrogen herbicide is atrazine, the structural formula of which is shown in Figure 7.12.5 This compound is frequently encountered in drinking water supplies, especially in agricultural areas. 24.4.7 ORGANOHALIDE COMPOUNDS Because of their persistence and tendency to accumulate in lipid tissues, the ecotoxicology of organohalide compounds is quite important. Their occurrence in the environment has become less prevalent as their manufacture has been curtailed for environmental reasons. An interesting aspect of these compounds is their occurrence in human mothers\u2019 milk, which can be analyzed for environmental exposure to them.6 24.4.7.1 Alkyl Halides The toxicities of alkyl halides, such as carbon tetrachloride, CCl4, vary a great deal with the compound. Most of these compounds cause depression of the central nervous system, and individual compounds exhibit specific toxic effects. Carbon tetrachloride was once widely available in general merchandise stores as a product to remove grease stains from clothing. It was also sold sealed in baseball-sized spherical glass containers that could be hurled at kitchen fires to extinguish the flames. During many years of its use as a consumer product, carbon tetrachloride compiled a grim record of toxic effects which led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prohibit its household use in 1970. It is a systemic poison that affects the nervous system when inhaled, and the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys when ingested. The biochemical mechanism of carbon tetrachloride toxicity involves reactive radical species, including the following, Cl Cl Cl C\u2022 \u2022OOCCl Cl Cl Unpaired electrons that react with biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA. The most damaging such reaction occurs in the liver as lipid peroxidation, consisting of the attack of free radicals on unsaturated lipid molecules, followed by oxidation of the lipids through a free radical mechanism. 24.4.7.2 Alkenyl Halides The most signifi cant alkenyl or olefi nic organohalides are the lighter chlorinated compounds, such as vinyl chloride and tetrachloroethylene: H H Cl Cl C C C C H Cl Cl Cl Vinyl chloride Tetrachloroethylene Because of their widespread use and disposal in the environment, the numerous acute and chronic toxic effects of the alkenyl halides are of considerable concern. The central nervous system, respiratory system, liver, and blood and lymph systems are all affected by vinyl chloride exposure, which has been widespread because of this compound\u2019s use in polyvinylchloride manufacture. Most notably, vinyl chloride is carcinogenic, causing a rare angiosarcoma of the liver. This deadly form of cancer has been observed in workers chronically exposed to vinyl chloride while cleaning autoclaves in the polyvinylchloride fabrication industry. The alkenyl organohalide, 1,1-dichloroethylene, is a suspect human carcinogen based upon animal studies and its structural similarity to vinyl chloride. The toxicities of both 1,2-dichloroethylene isomers are relatively low. These compounds act in different ways in that the cis isomer is an irritant and narcotic, whereas the trans isomer affects both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract, causing weakness, tremors, cramps, and nausea. A suspect human carcinogen, trichloroethylene has caused liver carcinoma in experimental animals and is known to affect numerous body organs. Like other organohalide solvents, trichloroethylene causes skin dermatitis from dissolution of skin lipids, and it can affect the central nervous and respiratory systems, liver, kidneys, and heart. Symptoms of exposure include disturbed vision, headaches, nausea, cardiac arrhythmias, and burning/tingling sensations in the nerves (paresthesia). Tetrachloroethylene damages the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. It is a suspect human carcinogen. It is metabolically oxidized to tetrachloroethylene oxide, OCl Cl {O} C C ClC CCl P450 (24.8) Cl Cl ClCl Tetrachloroethylene oxide which is probably the reactive intermediate reponsible for its toxicity. The tetrachloroethylene oxide intermediate is further metabolized to trichloroacetic acid, Cl3CO2H, and other products. 24.4.7.3 Aryl Halides Individuals exposed to irritant monochlorobenzene by inhalation or skin contact suffer symptoms to the respiratory system, liver, skin, and eyes.", "Ingestion of this compound causes effects similar to those of toxic aniline, including incoordination, pallor, cyanosis, and eventual collapse. The dichlorobenzenes are irritants that affect the same organs as monochlorobenzene. Some animal tests have suggested that 1,2-dichlorobenzene is a potential cancer-causing substance. Para-dichlorobenzene (1,4-dichlorobenzene), a chemical used in air fresheners and mothballs, has been known to cause profuse rhinitis (running nose), nausea, jaundice, liver cirrhosis, and weight loss associated with anorexia. It is not known to be a carcinogen. Its major urinary metabolite is 2,5-dichlorophenol, which is eliminated principally as the glucuronide or sulfate. Because of their once widespread use in electrical equipment, as hydraulic fluids, and in many other applications, PCBs (see Section 7.12) became widespread, extremely persistent environmental pollutants. PCBs have a strong tendency to undergo bioaccumulation in lipid tissue. Polybrominated biphenyl analogs (PBBs) were much less widely used and distributed. However, PBBs were involved in one major incident that resulted in catastrophic agricultural losses when livestock feed contaminated with PBB flame retardant caused massive livestock poisoning in Michigan in 1973. The greatest current concerns with brominated compounds are centered around brominated fire retardants. These are primarily pentabromo, octabromo, and decabromodiphenyl ethers (see below): Br Decabromodiphenyl ether They are very persistent pollutants and, although their toxicities to humans are not well established, environmental exposure to them is a matter of some concern. Unfortunately, effective substitutes for these compounds as fire retardants are lacking. Tightened standards for polybrominated compounds by the EU are causing concerns among electrical and electronic manufacturers who must comply with more stringent fi reproofing standards in the face of expected phaseout of polybrominated fi re retardants. 24.4.8 ORGANOHALIDE PESTICIDES Exhibiting a wide range of kind and degree of toxic effects, many organohalide insecticides (see Section 7.11) affect the central nervous system, causing tremor, irregular eye jerking, changes in personality, and loss of memory. Such symptoms are characteristic of acute DDT poisoning. However, the acute toxicity of DDT to humans is very low and, when used for the control of typhus and malaria in World War II, it was applied directly to people. The chlorinated cyclodiene insecticides\u2014aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, chlordane, heptachlor, endosulfan, and isodrin\u2014act on the brain, releasing betaine esters and causing headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, jerking muscles, and convulsions. Dieldrin, chlordane, and heptachlor have caused liver cancer in test animals, and some chlorinated cyclodiene insecticides are teratogenic or fetotoxic. Because of these effects, aldrin, dieldrin, heptachlor, and chlordane have been prohibited from use in the United States. The major chlorophenoxy herbicides are 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T or Agent Orange, now banned), and Silvex. Large doses of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid have been shown to cause nerve damage, (peripheral neuropathy), convulsions, and brain damage. With a toxicity somewhat less than that of 2,4-D, Silvex is largely excreted unchanged in the urine. The toxic effects of 2,4,5-T (used as a herbicidal warfare chemical called \u201cAgent Orange\u201d) have resulted from the presence of TCDD (commonly known as \u201cdioxin,\u201d discussed below), a manufacturing by-product. Autopsied carcasses of sheep poisoned by this herbicide have exhibited nephritis, hepatitis, and enteritis. 24.4.8.1 TCDD Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins are compounds which have the same basic structure as that of TCDD, Cl TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) Cl but have different numbers and locations of chlorine atoms on the ring structure. Extremely toxic to some animals, the toxicity of TCDD to humans is rather uncertain; it is known to cause a skin condition called chloracne. TCDD has been a manufacturing by-product of some commercial products (see the discussion of 2,4,5-T, above), a contaminant identifi ed in some municipal incineration emissions, and a widespread environmental pollutant from improper waste disposal. This compound has been released in a number of industrial accidents, the most massive of which exposed several tens of thousands of people to a cloud of chemical emissions spread over an approximately 3-square-mile area at the Givaudan-La Roche Icmesa manufacturing plant near Seveso, Italy, in 1976. On an encouraging note from a toxicological perspective, no abnormal occurrences of major malformations were found in a study of several thousand children born in the area within 6 years after the release. 24.4.8.2 Chlorinated Phenols The chlorinated phenols used in largest quantities have been pentachlorophenol (Chapter 7) and the trichlorophenol isomers used as wood preservatives. Although exposure to these compounds has been correlated with liver malfunction and dermatitis, contaminant polychlorinated dibenzodioxins may have caused some of the observed effects. 24.4.9 ORGANOSULFUR COMPOUNDS Despite the high toxicity of H2S, not all organosulfur compounds are particularly toxic.", "Their hazards are often reduced by their strong, offensive odors that warn of their presence. Inhalation of even very low concentrations of the alkyl thiols, such as methanethiol, H3CSH, can cause nausea and headaches; higher levels can cause increased pulse rate, cold hands and feet, and cyanosis. In extreme cases, unconsciousness, coma, and death occur. Like H2S, the alkyl thiols are precursors to cytochrome oxidase poisons. An oily, water-soluble liquid, methylsulfuric acid is a strong irritant to the skin, eyes, and mucous tissue. Colorless, odorless dimethyl sulfate is highly toxic and is a primary carcinogen that does not require bioactivation to cause cancer. Skin or mucous membranes exposed to dimethyl sulfate develop conjunctivitis and inflammation of nasal tissue and respiratory tract mucous membranes following an initial latent period during which few symptoms are observed. Damage to the liver and kidneys, pulmonary edema, cloudiness of the cornea, and death within 3\u20134 days can result from heavier exposures. O H3C O S OH O O H3C O S OCH3 O Methylsulfuric acid Dimethylsulfate 24.4.9.1 Sulfur Mustards A typical example of deadly sulfur mustards, compounds used as military poisons or \u201cpoison gases,\u201d is mustard oil [bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfi de]: An experimental mutagen and primary carcinogen, mustard oil produces vapors that penetrate deep within tissue, resulting in destruction and damage at some depth from the point of contact; penetration is very rapid, so that efforts to remove the toxic agent from the exposed area are ineffective after 30 min. This military \u201cblistering gas\u201d poison causes tissue to become severely inflamed with lesions that often become infected. These lesions in the lung can cause death. 24.4.10 ORGANOPHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS Organophosphorus compounds have varying degrees of toxicity. Some of these compounds, such as the \u201cnerve gases\u201d produced as industrial poisons, are deadly in minute quantities. The toxicities of major classes of organophosphate compounds are discussed in this section. 24.4.10.1 Organophosphate Esters Some organophosphate esters are shown in Figure 24.10. Trimethyl phosphate is probably moderately toxic when ingested or absorbed through the skin, whereas moderately toxic triethyl phosphate, (C2H5O)3PO, damages nerves and inhibits acetylcholinesterase. Notoriously toxic tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) apparently is metabolized to products that inhibit acetylcholinesterase. Exposure to TOCP causes degeneration of the neurons in the body\u2019s central and peripheral nervous systems with early symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea accompanied by severe abdominal pain. About 1\u20133 weeks after these symptoms have subsided, peripheral paralysis develops manifested by \u201cwrist drop\u201d and \u201cfoot drop,\u201d followed by slow recovery, which may be complete or leave a permanent partial paralysis, whereas the toxic effects of tetraethyl pyrophosphate (TEPP) or paraoxon develop much more rapidly. Humans poisoned by parathion exhibit skin twitching and respiratory distress. In fatal cases, respiratory failure occurs due to central nervous system paralysis. Briefly used in Germany as a substitute for insecticidal nicotine, TEPP is a very potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. With a toxicity rating of 6 (supertoxic), TEPP is deadly to humans and other mammals. 24.4.10.2 Phosphorothionate and Phosphorodithioate Ester Insecticides Because esters containing the P=S (thiono) group are resistant to nonenzymatic hydrolysis and are not as effective as P=O compounds in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, they exhibit higher insect:mammal toxicity ratios than their nonsulfur analogs. Therefore, phosphorothionate and phosphorodithioate esters (Figure 24.11) have been widely used as insecticides. The insecticidal activity of these compounds requires metabolic conversion of P=S to P=O (oxidative desulfu ration). Environmentally, organophosphate insecticides are superior to many of the organochlorine insecticides because the organophosphates readily undergo biodegradation and do not bioaccumulate. The first commercially successful phosphorothionate/phosphorodithioate ester insecticide was parathion, O,O-diethyl-O-p-nitrophenylphosphorothionate, first licensed for use in 1944. This insecticide, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase, has a toxicity rating of 6 (supertoxic). Since its use began, several hundred people have been killed by parathion, including 17 of 79 people exposed to H O H H H O H C O P O C H H C C O P O NO2 H O H H H O H C H H C H H H C H Paraoxon Trimethylphosphate H H3C O O P O O O OO P O P O C2H5 C2H5 CH3 CH3C2H5 O O C2H5 Tetraethylpyrophosphate Tri-o-cresylphosphate , TOCP FIGURE 24.10 Some organophosphate esters.

As little as 120 mg of parathion has been known to kill an adult human, and a dose of 2 mg has been fatal to a child. Most accidental poisonings have occurred by absorption through the skin. Methylparathion (a closely related compound with methyl groups instead of ethyl groups) is regarded as extremely toxic, and it is no longer used. In order for parathion to have a toxic effect, it must be converted metabolically to paraoxon (Figure 24.10), which is a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Because of the time required for this conversion, symptoms develop several hours after exposure. Malathion is the best known of the phosphorodithioate insecticides. It has a relatively high insect:mammal toxicity ratio because of its two carboxyester linkages which are hydrolyzable by carboxylase enzymes (possessed by mammals, but not insects) to relatively nontoxic products. For example, although malathion is a very effective insecticide, its LD50 for adult male rats is about 100 times that of parathion. 24.4.10.3 Organophosphorus Military Poisons Powerful inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase enzyme, organophosphorus \u201cnerve gas\u201d military poisons include Sarin and VX, for which structural formulas are shown below. (The possibility that military poisons such as these might be used in war was a major concern during the 1991 Mid-East confl ict, which, fortunately, ended without their being employed. The existence of military poison nerve gas was one of the justifications for the 2003 Iraqi war, but these \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d were not found.) A systemic poison to the central nervous system that is readily absorbed as a liquid through the skin, Sarin may be lethal at doses as low as about 0.0l mg/kg; a single drop can kill a human.

People can ingest toxic natural products in a variety of forms and food can be a source of mutagens that can be cancer-suspect agents. One of the most toxic substances known is botulinum toxin produced by anaerobic Clostridium botulinum bacteria. (Despite its extreme toxicity, botulinum toxin has a number of medicinal uses primarily as a muscle relaxant; it is the active ingredient in Botox used to treat wrinkles.) A number of organisms wage forms of chemical warfare. Venomous serpents produce venoms of various kinds to kill prey and for defense. Food poisoning of various kinds can be caused by ingestion of natural products. One of the most severe forms of food poisoning is paralytic shellfish poisoning in which various varieties of shellfi sh accumulate toxins from single-celled dinoflagellates. These toxins block neuronal transmission and can be fatal. Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites from fungi that have a wide range of structures and a variety of toxic effects. Human and animal exposure to mycotoxins usually result from ingestion of food upon which fungal molds have grown. Among the many kinds of molds that produce mycotoxins are Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Aspergillus, and Penicillium. Perhaps the most well-known mycotoxins are the afl atoxins, such as afl atoxin B1 produced by Aspergillus: Molds that produce mycotoxins grow on a variety of food products including corn, cereal grains, rice, apples, peanuts, and milk. Other mycotoxins include ergot alkaloids, ochratoxins, fumonisins, trichothecenes, tremorgenic toxins, satratoxin, zearalenone, and vomitotoxin. LITERATURE CITED 1.

Very widespread 25 Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastewater 25.1 GENERAL ASPECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ANALYSIS Scientists\u2019 understanding of the environment can only be as good as their knowledge of the identities and quantities of pollutants and other chemical species in water, air, soil, and biological systems. Therefore, proven, state-of-the-art techniques of chemical analysis, properly employed, are essential to environmental chemistry. The present time is a very exciting period in the evolution of analytical chemistry, characterized by the development of new and improved analysis techniques that enable detection of much lower levels of chemical species and a vastly increased data throughput. These developments pose some challenges. Because of the lower detection limits of some instruments, it is now possible to see quantities of pollutants that would have escaped detection previously, resulting in difficult questions regarding the setting of maximum allowable limits of various pollutants. The increased output of data from automated instruments has in many cases overwhelmed human capacity to assimilate and understand it. Challenging problems still remain in developing and utilizing techniques of environmental chemical analysis. Not the least of these problems is knowing which species should be measured, or even whether or not an analysis should be performed at all. The quality and choice of analyses is much more important than the number of analyses performed. Indeed, a persuasive argument can be made that, given modern capabilities in analytical chemistry, too many analyses of environmental samples are performed, whereas fewer, more carefully planned analyses would yield more useful information. In addition to a discussion of water analysis, this chapter covers some of the general aspects of environmental chemical analysis and the major techniques that are used to determine a wide range of analytes (species measured). Many techniques are common to water, air, soil, and biological sample analyses, and reference is made to them in chapters that follow. 25.1.1 ERROR AND QUALITY CONTROL A crucial aspect of any chemical analysis is the validity and quality of the data that it produces. All measurements are subject to error, which may be systematic (of the same magnitude and same direction) or random (varying in both magnitude and direction). Systematic errors cause the measured values to vary consistently from the true values; this variation is known as the bias.", "The degree to which a measured value comes close to the actual value of an analytical measurement is called the accuracy of the measurement, reflecting both systematic and random errors. It is essential for the analyst to determine these error components in the measurement of environmental samples, including water samples. The identification and control of systematic and random errors falls in the category of quality control (QC) procedures. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to go into any detail on these crucial procedures for which the reader is referred to a work on standard methods for the analysis of water.1 In order for the results from a laboratory to be meaningful, the laboratory needs a quality assurance plan specifying measures taken to produce data of known quality. An important aspect of such a plan is the use of laboratory control standards consisting of samples with very accurately known analyte levels in a carefully controlled matrix. Such standard reference materials are available in the United States from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for many kinds of samples. Many environmental analytes are present at very low levels, which challenge the ability of the method used to detect and accurately quantify them. (Typically, pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are present at nanogram to low-picogram per liter levels in wastewater.) Therefore, the detection limit of a method of analysis is quite important. Defining detection limit has long been a controversial topic in chemical analysis. Every analytical method has a certain degree of noise. The detection limit is an expression of the lowest concentration of analytes that can be measured above the noise level with a specified degree of confidence in an analytical procedure. In the detection of analytes, two kinds of errors can be defined. A Type I error occurs when the measurement fi nds an analyte present when it is actually absent. A Type II error occurs when the measurement fi nds an analyte absent when it is actually present. Detection limits can be further categorized into several different subcategories. The instrument detection limit (IDL) is the analyte concentration capable of producing a signal 3 times the standard deviation of the noise. The lower level of detection (LLD) is the quantity of analyte that will produce a measurable signal 99% of the time; it is about 2 times the IDL. The method detection limit (MDL) is measured like the LLD, except that the analyte is taken through the whole analytical procedure, including steps such as extraction and sample cleanup; it is about 4 times the IDL. Finally, the practical quantitation limit (PQL), which is about 20 times the IDL, is the lowest level achievable in routine analysis in laboratories. 25.1.2 WATER ANALYSIS METHODS Methods of analysis are published for a huge number of water constituents and contaminants. It is not possible to cover them in a comprehensive manner in one short chapter. For analytical procedures, the reader is referred to sources of methods. The most comprehensive of these is the classic Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater.2 The U.S. EPA publishes methods for water analysis that are listed in an index of methods3 and available from the National Technical Information Service.4 Another useful source of methods is available on a CD ROM from Genium Publishing Corp.5 Current issues in water analysis are reviewed periodically in the journal Analytical Chemistry.6 25.2 CLASSICAL METHODS Before sophisticated instrumentation became available, most important water quality parameters and some air pollutant analyses were done by classical methods, which require only chemicals, balances to measure masses, burettes, volumetric flasks and pipettes to measure volumes, and other simple laboratory glassware. The two major classical methods are volumetric analysis, in which volumes of reagents are measured, and gravimetric analysis, in which masses are measured. Some of these methods are still used today, and many have been adapted to instrumental and automated procedures. The most common classical methods for pollutant analysis are titrations, largely used for water analysis. Some of the titration procedures used are discussed in this section. Acidity (see Section 3.7) is determined simply by titrating hydrogen ion with base. Titration to the methyl orange endpoint (pH 4.5) yields the \u201cfree acidity\u201d due to strong acids (HCl and H2SO4). Carbon dioxide does not, of course, appear in this category. Titration to the phenolphthalein end - point (pH 8.3) yields total acidity and accounts for all acids except those weaker than HCO3 .", "Alkalinity may be determined by titration with H2SO4 to pH 8.3 to neutralize bases as strong as, or stronger than, carbonate ion, 2- CO3 + H+\u00c6 HCO3 (25.1) or by titration to pH 4.5 to neutralize bases weaker than CO32-, but as strong as, or stronger than, HCO3 -: - HCO3 + H+\u00c6 H2O + CO2(g) (25.2) Titration to the lower pH yields total alkalinity. The calcium and magnesium ions responsible for water hardness are readily titrated at pH 10 with a solution of EDTA, a chelating agent discussed in Sections 3.10 and 3.13. The titration reaction is Ca2+(or Mg2+) + H2Y2-\u00c6 CaY2-(or MgY2-) + 2H+ (25.3) where H2Y2- is the partially ionized EDTA chelating agent. Eriochrome Black T is used as an indicator, and it requires the presence of magnesium, with which it forms a wine red complex. Several oxidation\u2013reduction titrations can be used for environmental chemical analysis. Oxygen is determined in water by the Winkler titration. The first reaction in the Winkler method is the oxidation of manganese(II) to manganese(IV) by the oxygen analyte in a basic medium; this reaction is followed by acidification of the brown hydrated MnO2 in the presence of I- ion to release free I2, and then titration of the liberated iodine with standard thiosulfate, using starch as an endpoint indicator: (25.4) Mn2++ 2OH-+ 1O2 \u00c6 MnO2(s) + H2O 2 MnO2(s) + 2I-+ 4H+\u00c6 Mn2++ I2 + 2H2O (25.5) 2-2 I2 + 2S2O3 \u00c6 S4O6 + 2I- (25.6) A back-calculation from the amount of thiosulfate required yields the original quantity of dissolved oxygen (DO) present. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (see Section 7.9), is determined by adding a microbial \u201cseed\u201d to the diluted sample, saturating with air, incubating for five days, and determining the oxygen remaining. The results are calculated to show BOD as mg/L of O2. A BOD of 80 mg/L, for example, means that biodegradation of the organic matter in a liter of the sample would consume 80 mg of oxygen. 25.3 SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC METHODS 25.3.1 ABSORPTION SPECTROPHOTOMETRY Absorption spectrophotometry of light-absorbing species in solution, historically called colorimetry when visible light is absorbed, is still used for the analysis of some water and air pollutants. Basically, absorption spectrophotometry consists of measuring the percent transmittance (%T) of monochromatic light passing through a light-absorbing solution as compared to the amount of light passing through a blank solution containing everything in the medium but the sought-for constituent (100%). The absorbance (A) is defi ned as A = log 100 (25.7) %T The relationship between A and the concentration (C) of the absorbing substance is given by Beer\u2019s law: A = abC (25.8) where a is the absorptivity, a wavelength-dependent parameter characteristic of the absorbing substance; b is the path length of the light through the absorbing solution; and C is the concentration of the absorbing substance. A linear relationship between A and C at constant path length indicates adherence to Beer\u2019s law. In many cases, analyses may be performed even when Beer\u2019s law is not obeyed, if a suitable calibration curve is prepared. A color-developing step is usually required in which the sought-for substance reacts to form a colored species, and in some cases a colored species is extracted into a nonaqueous solvent to provide a more intense color and a more concentrated solution. A number of solution spectrophotometric methods have been used for the determination of water and air pollutants. Some of these are summarized in Table 25.1. 25.3.2 ATOMIC ABSORPTION AND EMISSION ANALYSES Atomic absorption analysis is commonly used for the determination of metals in environmental samples. This technique is based on the absorption of monochromatic light by a cloud of atoms of the analyte metal. The monochromatic light can be produced by a source composed of the same atoms as those being analyzed. The source produces intense electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength exactly the same as that absorbed by the atoms, resulting in extremely high selectivity. The basic components of an atomic absorption instrument are shown in Figure 25.1. The key element is the hollow cathode lamp in which atoms of the analyte metal are energized such that they become electronically excited and emit radiation with a very narrow wavelength band characteristic of the metal. This radiation is guided by the appropriate optics through a flame into which the sample is aspirated. In the fl ame, most metallic compounds are decomposed, and the metal is reduced to the elemental state, forming a cloud of atoms.", "These atoms absorb a fraction of radiation in the fl ame. The fraction of radiation absorbed increases with the concentration of the sought-for element in the sample according to the Beer\u2019s law relationship (Equation 25.8). The attenuated light beam next goes to a monochromator to eliminate extraneous light resulting from the flame, and then to a detector.

The most common of these is the graphite furnace, an electrothermal atomization device that consists of a hollow graphite cylinder placed so that the light beam passes through it. A small sample of up to 100 mL is inserted through a hole on the upper side of the horizontally oriented tube. An electric current is passed through the tube to heat it\u2014 gradually at first to dry the sample, then rapidly to vaporize and excite the metal analyte. The absorption of metal atoms in the hollow portion of the tube is measured and recorded as a spike-shaped signal. A diagram of a graphite furnace with a typical output signal is shown in Figure 25.2. The major advantage of the graphite furnace is that it gives detection limits up to 1000 times lower than those of conventional fl ame devices. graphite cylinder containing 3 ppb lead) A special technique for the flameless atomic absorption analysis of mercury involves room temperature reduction of mercury to the elemental state by tin(II) chloride in solution, followed by sweeping the mercury into an absorption cell with air. Nanogram (10-9 g) quantities of mercury can be determined by measuring mercury absorption at 253.7 nm. 25.3.3 ATOMIC EMISSION TECHNIQUES Metals may be determined in water, atmospheric particulate matter, and biological samples very well by observing the spectral lines emitted when they are heated to a very high temperature. An especially useful atomic emission technique is inductively coupled with plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP/AES). The \u201cfl ame\u201d in which analyte atoms are excited in plasma emission consists of an incandescent plasma (ionized gas) of argon heated inductively by radiofrequency energy at 4\u201350 MHz and 2\u20135 kW (Figure 25.3). The energy is transferred to a stream of argon through an induction coil, producing temperatures up to 10,000 K. The sample atoms are subjected to temperatures around 7000 K, twice those of the hottest conventional flames (e.g., nitrous oxide\u2013acetylene operates at 3200 K). Since emission of light increases exponentially with temperature, lower detection limits are obtained. Furthermore, the technique enables emission analysis of some of the environmentally important metalloids such as arsenic, boron, and selenium. Interfering chemical reactions and interactions in the plasma are minimized as compared to flames. Of greatest significance, however, is the capability of analyzing as many as 30 elements simultaneously, enabling a true multielement analysis technique. Plasma atomization combined with mass spectrometric measurement of analyte elements (ICP/MS) has developed as an especially powerful means for multielement analysis that can even be used for some nonmetals. 25.4 ELECTROCHEMICAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS Potentiometric, voltammetric, and amperometric water analyses utilize electrochemical sensors.", "Potentiometry is based on the general principle that the relationship between the potential of a Plasma flame T to 10,000 K, ~7000 K(ionized gas) that of hottest flame Hottest part Quartz tube Tangential argonflow cools walls Argon and sample aerosol High frequency input,4\u201350 MHz, 2\u20135 kW Argon coolant(tangential flow) measuring electrode and that of a reference electrode is a function of the log of the activity of an ion in solution. For a measuring electrode responding selectively to a particular ion, this relationship is given by the Nernst equation, E = E0 + 2.303RT log(a ) (25.9) zF z where E is the measured potential; E0 is the standard electrode potential; R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature; z is the signed charge (+ for cations, -for anions); F is the Faraday constant; and a is the activity of the ion being measured. At a given temperature, the quantity 2.303RT/F has a constant value; at 25\u00b0C, it is 0.0592 V (59.2 mV). At constant ionic strength, the activity, a, is directly proportional to concentration, and the Nernst equation for electrodes responding to Cd2+ - and F may be written as E (in mV) = E0 + 59.2 log[Cd2+] (25.10) 2 E = E0 - 59.2 log[F -] (25.11) Electrodes that respond more or less selectively to various ions are called ion-selective electrodes. Generally, the potential-developing component is a membrane of some kind that allows for selective exchange of the sought-for ion. The glass electrode used for the measurement of hydrogen-ion activity and pH is the oldest and most widely used ion-selective electrode. The potential is developed at a glass membrane that selectively exchanges hydrogen ion in preference to other cations, giving a Nernstian response to hydrogen ion activity, aH+: (25.12) E = E0 + 59.2 log(aH+), E = E0 - 59.2 pH The pH meters used with glass electrodes are calibrated directly in pH units using standard buffer solutions. Of the ion-selective electrodes other than glass electrodes, the fl uoride electrode is the most successful. It is well behaved, relatively free of interferences, and has an adequately low detection limit and a long range of linear response. Like all ion-selective electrodes, its electrical output is in the form of a potential signal that is proportional to log of concentration. Because of the logarithmic response of potential to concentration, small errors in E lead to relatively high concentration errors. Voltammetric techniques, the measurement of current resulting from potential applied to a microelectrode, have found some applications in water analysis. One such technique is differential-pulse polarography, in which the potential is applied to the microelectrode in the form of small pulses superimposed on a linearly increasing potential. The current is read near the end of the voltage pulse and compared to the current just before the pulse was applied. It has the advantage of minimizing the capacitive current from charging the microelectrode surface, which sometimes obscures the current due to the reduction or oxidation of the species being analyzed. Anodic-stripping voltammetry involves deposition of metals on an electrode surface over a period of several minutes followed by stripping them off very rapidly using a linear anodic sweep. The electrodeposition concentrates the metals on the electrode surface, and increased sensitivity results. An even better technique is to strip the metals off using a differential-pulse signal. A differential-pulse anodic-stripping voltammogram of copper, lead, cadmium, and zinc in tap water is shown in Figure 25.4. 25.5 CHROMATOGRAPHY First described in the literature in the early 1950s, gas chromatography (GC) has played an essential role in the analysis of organic materials. GC is both a qualitative and a quantitative technique; for 0.0 \u20130.2 \u20130.4 \u20130.6 \u20130.8 \u20131.0 \u20131.2 \u20131.4 Electrode potential vs. saturated calomel electrode FIGURE 25.4 Differential-pulse anodic-stripping voltammogram of tap water at a mercury-plated, wax-impregnated graphite electrode. some analytical applications of environmental importance, it is remarkably sensitive and selective. GC is based on the principle that when a mixture of volatile materials transported by a carrier gas is passed through a column containing an adsorbent solid phase or, more commonly, an absorbing liquid phase coated on a solid material, each volatile component will be partitioned between the carrier gas and the solid or liquid. The length of time required for the volatile component to traverse the column is proportional to the degree to which it is retained by the nongaseous phase.", "Since different components may be retained to different degrees, they will emerge from the end of the column at different times. If a suitable detector is available, the time at which the component emerges from the column and the quantity of the component are both measured. A recorder trace of the detector response appears as peaks of different sizes, depending on the quantity of material producing the detector response. Both quantitative and (within limits) qualitative analyses of the sought-for substances are obtained. The essential features of a gas chromatograph are shown schematically in Figure 25.5. The carrier gas generally is argon, helium, hydrogen, or nitrogen. The sample is injected as a single compact plug into the carrier gas stream immediately ahead of the column entrance. If the sample is liquid, the injection chamber is heated to vaporize the liquid rapidly. The separation column may consist of a metal or glass tube packed with an inert solid of high surface area covered with a liquid phase, or it may consist of an active solid, which enables the separation to occur. More commonly, capillary columns are employed, which consist of very small diameter, very long tubes in which the liquid phase is coated on the inside of the column. The component that primarily determines the sensitivity of gas chromatographic analysis and, for some classes of compounds, the selectivity as well, is the detector. One such device is the thermal conductivity detector, which responds to changes in the thermal conductivity of gases passing over it. The electron-capture detector, which is especially useful for halogenated hydrocarbons and phosphorus compounds, operates through the capture of electrons emitted by a b-particle source. The flame-ionization gas chromatographic detector is very sensitive for the detection of organic compounds. It is based on the phenomenon by which organic compounds form highly conducting fragments, such as C+, in a flame. Application of a potential gradient across the flame results in a small current that may be readily measured. The mass spectrometer, described in Section 25.6, may be used as a detector for a GC. A combined GC/MS instrument is an especially powerful analytical tool for organic compounds. Chromatographic analysis requires that a compound exhibit at least a few mm of vapor pressure at the highest temperature at which it is stable. In many cases, organic compounds that cannot be chromatographed directly may be converted to derivatives that are amenable to gas chromatographic analysis. It is seldom possible to analyze organic compounds in water by direct injection of the water into the GC; higher concentration is usually required. Two techniques commonly employed to remove volatile compounds from water and concentrate them are extraction with solvents and purging volatile compounds with a gas, such as helium; concentrating the purged gases on a short column; and driving them off by heat into the chromatograph. 25.5.1 HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY A liquid mobile phase used with very small column-packing particles enables high-resolution chromatographic separation of materials in the liquid phase. Very high pressures up to several thousand psi are required to get a reasonable flow rate in such systems. Analysis using such devices is called high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and offers an enormous advantage in that the materials analyzed need not be changed to the vapor phase, a step that often requires preparation of a volatile derivative or results in decomposition of the sample. The basic features of a high-performance liquid chromatograph are the same as those of a gas chromatograph shown in Figure 25.5, except that a solvent reservoir and high-pressure pump are substituted for the carrier gas source and regulator. A hypothetical HPLC chromatogram is shown in Figure 25.6. Refractive index and ultraviolet detectors are both used for the detection of peaks coming from the liquid chromatograph column. Fluorescence detection can be especially sensitive for some classes of compounds. Mass spectrometric detection of HPLC effluents has led to the development of LC/MS analysis. This powerful tool enables measurement of highly polar water contaminants without the necessity of forming volatile derivatives of analytes to be separated by GC and can be used to measure analytes down to the nanogram per liter levels. LC/MS is especially useful for the determination of a variety of emerging contaminants including pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, hormones, and endocrine-disrupting species. Time 25.5.2 CHROMATOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF WATER POLLUTANTS The U.S. EPA has developed a number of chromatography-based standard methods for determining water pollutants.", "Some of these methods use the purge-and-trap technique, bubbling gas through a column of water to purge volatile organics from the water followed by trapping the organics on solid sorbents, whereas others use solvent extraction to isolate and concentrate the organics. These methods are summarized in Table 25.2. 25.5.3 ION CHROMATOGRAPHY The liquid chromatographic determination of ions, particularly anions, by ion chromatography has enabled the measurement of species that used to be very troublesome for water chemists. The development of this technique has been facilitated by special detection techniques using suppressors to enable detection of analyte ions in the chromatographic effluent. Ion chromatography has been developed for the determination of most of the common anions, including arsenate, arsenite, borate, carbonate, chlorate, chlorite, cyanide, the halides, hypochlorite, hypophosphite, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, phosphite, pyrophosphate, selenate, selenite, sulfate, sulfi te, sulfi de, trimetaphosphate, and tripolyphosphate. Cations, including the common metal ions, can also be determined by ion chromatography. 25.6 MASS SPECTROMETRY Mass spectrometry (MS) is particularly useful for the identification of specific organic pollutants. It depends on the production of ions by an electrical discharge or chemical process, followed by m/e separation based on the charge-to-mass ratio and measurement of the ions produced. The output of a mass spectrometer is a mass spectrum, such as the one shown in Figure 25.7. A mass spectrum is characteristic of a compound and serves to identify it. Computerized data banks for mass spectra have been established and are stored in computers interfaced with mass spectrometers. Identifi cation of a mass spectrum depends on the purity of the compound from which the spectrum is taken. Prior separation by GC with continual sampling of the column effluent by a mass spectrometer, commonly called GC-MS, is particularly effective in the analysis of organic pollutants. 25.7 ANALYSIS OF WATER SAMPLES The preceding sections of this chapter have covered the major kinds of analysis techniques that are used on water. In this section, several specific aspects of water analysis are addressed. 25.7.1 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES MEASURED IN WATER The commonly determined physical properties of water are color, residue (solids), odor, temperature, specific conductance, and turbidity. Most of these terms are self-explanatory and will not be discussed in detail. All of these properties either influence or reflect the chemistry of the water. Solids, for example, arise from chemical substances either suspended or dissolved in the water and are classified physically as total, fi lterable, nonfilterable, or volatile. Specific conductance is a measure of the degree to which water conducts alternating current and refl ects, therefore, the total concentration of dissolved ionic material. By necessity, some physical properties must be measured in the water without sampling (see discussion of water sampling below). 25.7.2 WATER SAMPLING It is beyond the scope of this text to describe water sampling procedures in detail. It must be emphasized, however, that the acquisition of meaningful data demands that correct sampling and storage procedures be used. These procedures may be quite different for various species in water. In general, separate samples must be collected for chemical and biological analysis because the sampling and preservation techniques differ significantly. Usually, the shorter the time interval between sample collection and analysis, the more accurate the analysis will be. Indeed, some analyses must be performed in the field within minutes of sample collection. Others, such as the determination of temperature, must be performed on the body of water itself. Within a few minutes after collection, water pH may change, dissolved gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfi de, and chlorine) may be lost, or other gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) may be absorbed from the atmosphere. Therefore, analyses of temperature, pH, and dissolved gases should always be performed in the field. Furthermore, precipitation of calcium carbonate accompanies changes in the pH-alkalinity-calcium carbonate relationship following sample collection. Analysis of a sample after standing may thus give erroneously low values for calcium and total hardness. Oxidation\u2013reduction reactions may cause substantial errors in analysis. For example, soluble iron(II) and manganese(II) are oxidized to insoluble iron(III) and manganese(IV) compounds when an anaerobic water sample is exposed to atmospheric oxygen. Microbial activity may decrease phenol or biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values, change the nitrate\u2013nitrite\u2013ammonia balance, or alter the relative proportions of sulfate and sulfide. Iodide and cyanide are frequently oxidized. Chromium(VI) in solution may be reduced to insoluble chromium(III). Sodium, silicate, and boron are leached from glass container walls. Samples can be divided into two major categories. Grab samples are taken at a single time and in a single place.", "Therefore, they are very specific with respect to time and location. Composite samples are collected over an extended time and may encompass different locations as well. In principle, the average results from a large number of grab samples give the same information as a composite sample. A composite sample has the advantage of providing an overall picture from only one analysis. On the other hand, it may miss extreme concentrations and important variations that occur over time and space. 25.7.2.1 Extractors The ease and effectiveness of various kinds of solid-phase devices for water sampling is steadily increasing their use in water analysis. Based on size and physical configuration, several categories of such devices are available. One of these is the conventional solid-phase extractor (SPE) containing an extracting solid in a column. Activated carbon has been used for decades for this purpose, but synthetic materials, such as those composed of long hydrocarbon chains (C18) bound to solids have been found to be quite useful. A typical procedure uses a polymer-divinylstyrene extraction column to remove pesticides from water. The pesticide analytes are eluted from the SPE with ethyl acetate and measured by GC. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) devices constitute a second kind of SPE. These make use of very small diameter tubes in which analytes are bonded directly to the extractor walls, and then eluted directly into a chromatograph. The use of SPME devices for the determination of haloethers in water has been described. A third kind of device that is simple, convenient, and available for a number of classes of compounds consists of disks composed of substances that bind with and remove analytes from water when the water is filtered through them. As an example, solid-phase extraction disks can be used to remove and concentrate radionuclides from water, including 99Tc, 137Cs, 90Sr, and 238Pu. Organic materials sampled from water with such disks include haloacetic acids and acidic and neutral herbicides. Liquid\u2013liquid extraction of organic-soluble analytes has long been used to extract these materials from water and isolate them in a solvent that can be reduced to a small volume in which analytes can be further concentrated by a Kuderna\u2013Danish evaporator or nitrogen blowing. Relatively high consumption of solvent (creating a disposal problem) and emulsion formation can be problems with liquid\u2013liquid extraction. As an alternative for volatile and semivolatile analytes, membrane extraction can be used. This procedure entails running the water sample over one side of a membrane through which the analytes migrate to another solvent on the other side. Water can even be used as a collector solvent. In the case of ionizable organics, for example, the pH on the sample side can be adjusted such that the analyte species are neutral, in which form they can migrate through an organophilic membrane, and be collected in an aqueous solution that is at a pH adjusted such that the analyte species are ionized and hence cannot permeate back through the membrane. A procedure exists for the determination of semivolatile compounds in water in which the extracting solvent traverses the interior of hollow fibers and collects analytes from the water sample flowing over the outer surface of the fibers. By pressurizing the solvent, a significant fraction of it is forced through the membrane into the water thereby concentrating the organic-soluble analytes in the solvent phase. 25.7.3 WATER SAMPLE PRESERVATION It is not possible to completely protect a water sample from changes in composition. However, various additives and treatment techniques can be employed to minimize sample deterioration. These methods are summarized in Table 25.3. The most general method of sample preservation is refrigeration to 4\u00b0C. Freezing normally should be avoided because physical changes including precipitate formation and gas loss may adversely affect sample composition. Acidification is commonly applied to metal samples to prevent their precipitation, and it also slows microbial action. In the case of metals, the samples should be fi ltered before adding acid to enable determination of dissolved metals. Sample holding times vary from zero for parameters such as temperature or DO measured by a probe to 6 months for metals. Many different kinds of samples, including those to be analyzed for acidity, alkalinity, and various forms of nitrogen or phosphorus, should not be held for more than 24 h. Details on water sample preservation are to be found in standard references on water analysis listed at the end of this chapter. 25.7.4 TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON IN WATER", "It is important to measure dissolved organic carbon (Chapter 7) in water because it exerts an oxygen demand in water, often is in the form of toxic substances, and is a general indicator of water pollution. The measurement of total organic carbon, TOC, in water is performed by methods that, for the most part, totally oxidize the dissolved organic material to produce carbon dioxide. The amount of carbon dioxide evolved is taken as a measure of TOC. TOC can be determined by a technique that uses a dissolved oxidizing agent, commonly potassium peroxydisulfate, K2S2O8, promoted by ultraviolet light to oxidize the organic carbon to CO2. Phosphoric acid is added to the sample, which is sparged with nitrogen to drive off inorganic CO2. After sparging, the sample is pumped to a chamber containing a lamp emitting ultraviolet radiation of 184.9 nm. This radiation produces reactive free radical species such as the hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211, TABLE 25.3 Preservatives and Preservation Methods Used with Water Samples Preservative or Type of Samples for Which the Technique Used Effect on Sample Method is Employed Nitric acid Keeps metals in solution Metal-containing samples Sulfuric acid Bactericide Biodegradable samples containing organic carbon, oil, or grease Formation of sulfates with volatile bases Samples containing amines or ammonia Sodium hydroxide Formation of sodium salts from volatile Samples containing volatile organic acids acids or cyanides Chemical Fix a particular reaction constituent Samples to be analyzed for DO using the Winkler method Septum for injecting sample and reagents Water sample Gas for sparging Gas for spargingunoxidized sample Sample oxidized sample FIGURE 25.8 TOC analyzer employing UV-promoted sample oxidation. (see Chapters 9, 12, and 13). These active species bring about the rapid oxidation of dissolved organic compounds as shown in the following general reaction: Organics + HO\u2211\u00c6 CO2 + H2O (25.13) After the completion of oxidation, the CO2 is sparged from the system and measured with a gas chromatographic detector or by absorption in ultrapure water followed by a conductivity measurement. Figure 25.8 is a schematic of a TOC analyzer. 25.7.5 MEASUREMENT OF RADIOACTIVITY IN WATER There are several potential sources of radioactive materials that may contaminate water (see Section 7.13). Radioactive contamination of water is normally detected by measurements of gross b and gross a activity, a procedure that is simpler than detecting individual isotopes. The measurement is made from a sample formed by evaporating water to a very thin layer on a small pan, which is then inserted inside an internal proportional counter. This setup is necessary because b particles can penetrate only very thin detector windows, and a particles have essentially no penetrating power. More detailed information can be obtained for radionuclides that emit g rays by the use of g spectrum analysis. This technique employs solid-state detectors to resolve rather closely spaced g peaks in the sample\u2019s spectra. In conjunction with multichannel spectrometric data analysis, it is possible to determine a number of radionuclides in the same sample without chemical separation. This method requires minimal sample preparation. 25.7.6 BIOLOGICAL TOXINS Toxic substances produced by microorganisms are of some concern in water. Photosynthetic cyanobacteria and some kinds of algae growing in water produce potentially troublesome toxic substances. An HPLC/MS method of analysis for such toxins has been described.7 25.7.7 SUMMARY OF WATER ANALYSIS PROCEDURES The main chemical parameters commonly determined in water are summarized in Table 25.4. In addition to these, a number of other solutes, especially specific organic pollutants, may be determined in connection with specific health hazards or incidents of pollution.", "TABLE 25.4 Chemical Parameters Commonly Determined in Water Chemical Species Signifcance in Water Methods of Analysis Acidity Indicative of industrial pollution or Titration acid mine drainage Alkalinity Water treatment, buffering, algal Titration productivity Aluminum Water treatment, buffering AAa, ICPb Ammonia Algal productivity, pollutant Spectrophotometry Arsenic Toxic pollutant Spectrophotometry, AA, ICP Barium Toxic pollutant AA, ICP Beryllium Toxic pollutant AA, ICP, fl uorimetry Boron Toxic to plants Spectrophotometry, ICP Bromide Seawater intrusion, industrial waste Spectrophotometry, potentiometry, ion chromatography Cadmium Toxic pollutant AA, ICP Calcium Hardness, productivity, treatment AA, ICP, titration Carbon dioxide Bacterial action, corrosion Titration, calculation Chloride Saline water contamination Titration, electrochemical, ion chromatography Chlorine Water treatment Spectrophotometry Chromium Toxic pollutant (hexavalent Cr) AA, ICP, colorimetry Copper Plant growth AA, ICP Cyanide Toxic pollutant Spectrophotometry, potentiometry, ion chromatography Fluoride Water treatment, toxic at high levels Spectrophotometry, potentiometry, ion chromatography Hardness Water quality, water treatment AA, titration Iodide Seawater intrusion, industrial waste Catalytic effect, potentiometry ion chromatography Iron Water quality, water treatment AA, ICP, colorimetry Lead Toxic pollutant AA, ICP, voltammetry Lithium May indicate some pollution AA, ICP, fl ame photometry Magnesium Hardness AA, ICP Manganese Water quality (staining) AA, ICP Mercury Toxic pollutant Flameless atomic absorption Methane Anaerobic bacterial action Combustible-gas indicator Nitrate Algal productivity, toxicity Spectrophotometry, ion chromatography Nitrite Toxic pollutant Spectrophotometry, ion chromatography Nitrogen (albuminoid) Proteinaceous material Spectrophotometry (organic) Organic pollution indicator Spectrophotometry Oil and grease Industrial pollution Gravimetry Organic carbon Organic pollution indicator Oxidation-CO2 measurement Organic contaminants Organic pollution indicator Activated carbon adsorption Oxygen Water quality Titration, electrochemical Oxygen demand (biochemical) Water quality and pollution Microbiological titration (chemical) Water quality and pollution Chemical oxidation-titration Ozone Water treatment Titration Pesticides Water pollution GC pH Water quality and pollution Potentiometry Phenols Water pollution Distillation-colorimetry Phosphate Productivity, pollution Spectrophotometry continued TABLE 25.4 (continued) Chemical Parameters Commonly Determined in Water Chemical Species Signifcance in Water Methods of Analysis Phosphorus Water quality and pollution Spectrophotometry (hydrolyzable) Potassium Productivity, pollution AA, ICP, fl ame photometry Selenium Toxic pollutant Spectrophotometry, ICP, neutron activation Silica Water quality Spectrophotometry, ICP Silver Water pollution AA, ICP Sodium Water quality, saltwater intrusion AA, ICP, fl ame photometry Strontium Water quality AA, ICP, fl ame photometry Sulfate Water quality, water pollution Ion chromatography Sulfide Water quality, water pollution Spectrophotometry, titration, chromatography Sulfite Water pollution, oxygen scavenger Titration, ion chromatography Surfactants Water pollution Spectrophotometry Tannin, lignin Water quality, water pollution Spectrophotometry Vanadium Water quality, water pollution ICP Zinc Water quality, water pollution AA, ICP a AA denotes atomic absorption. b ICP stands for inductively coupled plasma techniques in which the atoms in the atomized plasma are detected by atomic emission or by MS. 25.8 AUTOMATED WATER ANALYSES Huge numbers of water analyses must often be performed in order to get meaningful results and for reasons of economics. This has resulted in the development of a number of automated procedures in which the samples are introduced through a sampler and the analyses performed and results posted without manual manipulation of reagents and apparatus. Such procedures have been developed and instruments marketed for the determination of a number of analytes, including alkalinity, sulfate, ammonia, nitrate/nitrite, and metals. Colorimetric procedures are popular for such automated analytical instruments, using simple, rugged colorimeters for absorbance measurements. Figure 25.9 shows an automated analytical system for the determination of alkalinity. The reagents and sample liquids are transported through the analyzer by a peristaltic pump consisting basically of rollers moving over flexible tubing. By using different sizes of tubing, the flow rates of the reagents are proportioned. Air bubbles are introduced into the liquid stream to aid mixing and to separate one sample from another. Mixing of the sample and various reagents is accomplished in mixing coils. Since many color-developing reactions are not rapid, a delay coil is provided that allows the color to develop before reaching the colorimeter. Bubbles are removed from the liquid stream by a debubbler prior to introduction into the flow cell for colorimetric analysis. 25.9 SPECIATION Speciation refers to the determination of specific species of elements rather than simply analysis of the elements. It applies especially to metals and metalloids, which may be relatively easy to measure as the element, but much more difficult to determine as specific species of the element. For example, it is a relatively straightforward process to measure total tin in water, but much more challenging (and important) to determine organotin species that might be present as pollutants. Arsenic provides an important example of significant elemental species in water.", "Inorganic arsenic can be present as either As(III) or As(V), of which the former is generally more toxic. Organoarsenic compounds can be produced microbially and include monomethylarsonate and dimethylarsinate. Organoarsenic compounds are also used as additives to livestock feed and get into water supplies as runoff from feeding operations; roxarsone is one such compound. The most generally applicable means of measuring elemental species is separation by chromatography followed by measurement of elemental levels in the effl uent. Specifically for arsenic, separation by anion exchange chromatography followed by measurement of arsenic with inductively coupled plasma-MS is a good technique. 25.10 EMERGING CONTAMINANTS IN WATER ANALYSIS Emerging contaminants in water analysis refers to species that have been recognized as signifi cant water contaminants relatively recently, the long-term effects of which are not very well known. Approximately 3000 different substances are now used as pharmaceutical ingredients including antibiotics, painkillers, antidiabetics, contraceptives, antidepressants, impotence drugs, and a blockers and these substances and their metabolites get into water at very low levels. Major classes of emerging contaminants include the following: \u2022 Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites \u2022 Endocrine disruptors \u2022 Polybrominated compounds \u2022 Microbial toxins \u2022 Personal care products \u2022 Disinfection products \u2022 Organometallic compounds \u2022 Nanomaterials Some specific substances that have been recognized as emerging contaminants relatively recently include the following: benzotriazoles, complexing agents used as anticorrosives; naphthenic acids, which are toxic endocrine disruptors remaining from the extraction of crude oil from tar sands, particularly in Alberta, Canada; ethylenedibromide, formerly added to leaded gasoline but still a problem in some groundwaters; and dioxane, widely produced as a solvent stabilizer. Emerging contaminants in drinking water supplies are generally indicative of contamination by incompletely treated wastewater. Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have the potential to cause direct health effects. Endocrine disruptors may affect health as well as sexual development in aquatic organisms. The organometallic compounds of most concern are the organotin compounds, which have industrial uses and have been used as biocides. Microbial toxins include substances produced by photosynthetic bacteria and algae growing in water supplies. An example consists of microcystins, cyclic peptides produced by cyanobacteria. A variety of analytical methods are used to determine concentrations of emerging contaminants in water. Especially useful are chromatographic methods coupled with MS or tandem MS (two mass spectrometers in tandem). Some of the specific emerging contaminants that can be determined by solid-phase extraction of water contaminants measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) using electrospray ionization include meprobamate, ethynylestradiol, progesterone, caffeine, testosterone, androstenedione, acetaminophen, erythromycin, TCEP, hydrocodone, oxybenzone, DEET, carbamazepine, diazepam, dilantin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, atrazine, triclosan, pentoxifylline, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfi brozil, fl uoxetine, and iopromide. Including pharmaceuticals, steroids, personal care products, and pesticides, this list gives an idea of compounds included among emerging contaminants. 25.11 CHIRAL CONTAMINANTS Chiral molecules are those in which four different groups are arranged in three dimensions around an atom, usually of carbon, that constitutes a chiral center (see alanine below) such that the molecule cannot be directly superimposed over its mirror image. Two chiral molecules of the same compound, called enantiomers, have identical melting points, boiling points, and solubilities as well as generally identical chemical properties. They differ, often markedly, in their biochemical properties because of the exact fit required between enzyme active sites and the substrate molecules upon which the enzymes act. Therefore, chiral isomers may exhibit completely different environmental and toxicological behaviors. For example, one enantiomer of a herbicide may undergo biodegradation readily whereas the other is resistant to it. Biochemical differences between enantiomers may be especially pronounced for pesticides. For example, one enantiomer of a herbicide may kill weeds very effectively whereas the other has no effect. An example is the R enantiomer of herbicidal mecoprop (Figure 7.14), which is now marketed as a herbicide in place of the racemic mixture with the S enantiomer. + + NH3 NH3 CH3 CH3 The two enantiomers of the amino acid alanine Although important, the ability to determine specific enantiomers of contaminants in water is relatively new. Most commonly, the compounds are separated by LC and measured by MS. This requires a separation medium that is selective for particular enantiomers. Cyclodextrins are most commonly used for this purpose. LITERATURE CITED 1. \u201cData Quality,\u201d Section 1030 in Eaton, A. D., L. S. Clesceri, E. W. Rice, A. E. Greenberg, and M. A. H.

This chapter is a brief overview of several of the main considerations applied to the analysis of wastes. Here, wastes are broadly defined to include all kinds of solids, semisolids, sludges, liquids, contaminated soils, sediments, and other kinds of materials that are either wastes themselves or are contaminated by wastes. For the most part, the substances determined as part of waste analysis, the analytes, are measured by techniques that are used for the determination of the same analytes in water (see methods described in Chapter 25) and, to a lesser extent, in air. However, the preparation techniques that must be employed for waste analysis are usually more complex than those used for the same analytes in water. That is because the matrices in which the waste analytes are contained are usually relatively complicated, which makes it difficult to recover all the analytes from the waste and which introduces interfering substances. As a result, the lower limits at which substances can be measured in wastes (the practical quantitation limit, see Section 25.1) are usually much higher than in water. There are several distinct steps in the analysis of a waste. Compared to water, wastes are often highly heterogeneous, which makes the first step, collection of representative samples, diffi cult. Whereas water samples can often be introduced into an analytical instrument with minimal preparation, the processing of hazardous wastes to get a sample that can be introduced into an instrument is often relatively complicated. Such processing can consist of dilution of oily samples with an organic solvent, extraction of organic analytes into an organic solvent, extraction with supercritical or subcritical hot liquids, evolution and collection of volatile organic analytes, or digestion of solids with strong acids and oxidants to extract metals for atomic spectrometric analysis.", "The products of these processes must often be subjected to relatively involved sample cleanup procedures to remove contaminants that might interfere with the analysis or damage the analytical instrument. Over a number of years, the U.S. EPA has developed specialized methods for the characterization of wastes. These methods are given in the publication entitled Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods, which is periodically updated to keep it current.2 Because of the difficult and exacting nature of many of the procedures in this work and because of the hazards associated with the use of reagents such as strong acids and oxidants used for sample digestion and solvents employed to extract organic analytes, anyone attempting analyses of hazardous waste materials should use this resource and follow procedures carefully with special attention to precautions. \u201cSW-846,\u201d as it is commonly known, is available in a convenient CD/ROM form as part of a comprehensive summary of environmental analytical methods.3 ASTM International, originally known as the American Society for Testing and Materials publishes comprehensive works on the analysis of environmental samples including solid wastes.4 26.2 SAMPLE DIGESTION FOR ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS In order to analyze a solid waste sample by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy, graphite furnace absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled argon plasma spectroscopy, or inductively coupled argon plasma mass spectrometry (MS), the sample must first be digested to get the analyte metals in solution. Digestion dissolves only those fractions of metals that can be put into solution under relatively extreme conditions and therefore enables measurement of available metals. It should be noted that sample digestion procedures generally use highly corrosive, dangerous reagents that are strong acids and strong oxidants. Therefore, digestion should be carried out only by carefully trained personnel using the proper equipment, including fume hoods and adequate personnel protection. EPA Method 3050 is a procedure for acid digestion of sediments, sludges, and soils. A sample of up to 2 g is treated with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide; the sample is then refl uxed with either conc. HNO3 or conc. HCl, then refluxed with dilute HCl, filtered, and the fi ltrate analyzed for metals. Microwave heating can be used to assist the digestion of samples. The procedure for the digestion of aqueous liquids consists of mixing a 45-mL sample with 5 mL of concentrated nitric acid, placing it in a fl uorocarbon (Teflon) digestion vessel, and heating for 20 min. After digestion is complete, the sample is cooled, solids are separated by filtration or centrifugation, and the liquid remaining is analyzed by the appropriate atomic spectrometric technique. Method 3052 is a procedure for microwave-assisted acid digestion of siliceous and organically based matrices. It can be used on a variety of kinds of samples including biological tissues, oils, oil-contaminated soils, sediments, sludges, and soil. This method is not appropriate for analyses of leachable metals, but is used for the measurement of total metals. A sample of up to 0.5 g is digested with microwave heating for 15 min in an appropriate acid mixture held in a fl uorocarbon polymer container. Commonly, the reagents employed are a mixture of 9 mL of conc. nitric acid and 3 mL of hydrofluoric acid, although other acid mixtures employing reagents such as conc. HCl and hydrogen peroxide may be used. The sample is heated in the microwave oven to 180\u00b0C and held at that temperature for at least 9.5 min. After heating, the residual solids are filtered off and the fi ltrate is analyzed for metals. Many kinds of hazardous waste samples contain metals dissolved or suspended in viscous petroleum products, including oils, oil sludges, tars, waxes, paints, paint sludges, and other hydrocarbon materials. Method 3031 can be used to dissolve these metals\u2014including antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead molybdenum, nickel, selenium, silver, thallium, vanadium, and zinc\u2014in a form suitable for atomic spectrometric analysis. The procedure involves mixing 0.5 g of sample with 0.5 g of finely ground KMnO4 and 1.0 mL of conc. H2SO4, which causes a strongly exothermic reaction to occur as the hydrocarbon matrix is oxidized. After the reaction has subsided, 2 mL of conc. HNO3 and 2 mL of conc. HCl are added, the sample is filtered with fi lter paper, the filter paper is digested with conc. HCl, and the sample is diluted and analyzed for metals. 26.3 ANALYTE ISOLATION FOR ORGANICS ANALYSIS The determination of organic analytes requires that they be isolated from the sample matrix.", "Since organic analytes are generally soluble in organic solvents, they can usually be extracted from samples with a suitable solvent. Although extraction works well for nonvolatile and semivolatile analytes, it is not so suitable for VOCs, which are readily vaporized during sample processing. The volatile materials are commonly isolated by techniques that take advantage of their high vapor pressures. 26.3.1 SOLVENT EXTRACTION Method 3500 is a procedure for extracting nonvolatile or semivolatile compounds from a liquid or solid sample. The sample is extracted with an appropriate solvent, dried, and concentrated by evaporating solvent in a Kuderna\u2013Danish apparatus prior to further processing for analysis. A number of methods more complicated than Method 3500 have been devised for extracting nonvolatile and semivolatile analytes from waste samples. Method 3540 uses extraction with a Soxhlet extractor. This device, illustrated in Chapter 22, Figure 22.6, for the extraction of lipids from biological tissue, provides for recirculation of continuously redistilled fresh solvent over a sample of soils, sludges, and wastes. The sample is first mixed with anhydrous Na2SO4 to dry it, then placed inside an extraction thimble in the Soxhlet apparatus, which redistills a relatively small volume of extraction solvent over the sample. After extraction, the sample may be dried, concentrated, and exchanged into another solvent prior to analysis. Method 3545 uses pressurized fluid extraction at 100\u00b0C and a pressure up to 2000 psi to remove organophilic analyte species from solid samples including soils, clays, sediments, sludges, and waste solids. Used for the extraction of semivolatile organic compounds, organophosphorus pesticides, organochlorine pesticides, chlorinated herbicides, and PCBs, it requires less solvent and takes less time than the Soxhlet extraction described above. Before extraction, the fi nely ground 10\u201330 g sample should be dried to prevent residual water from interfering with the extraction. It may be air-dried or dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 or pelletized diatomaceous Earth. An extraction time of 5 min is typically used. Method 3550 uses sonication with ultrasound to expedite the extraction of nonvolatile and semivolatile organic compounds from solids including soils, sludges, and wastes. The procedure calls for subjecting the finely divided dried sample mixed with solvent to ultrasound for a brief period of time. Low concentration samples may be subjected to multiple extractions with additional fresh solvent. 26.3.2 SUPERCRITICAL FLUID EXTRACTION Although the requirement for specialized high-pressure equipment has limited its application, extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide maintained at temperatures and pressures above the critical point where separate liquid and vapor phases do not exist is a very effective means of extracting some organic analytes from solid waste samples. A typical example of this technique is the extraction of estrogenic bisphenol A from sewage sludge for analysis. Method 3561 is used to extract PAHs such as acenaphthene, benzo(a)pyrene, fluorene, and pyrene from solid samples with supercritical carbon dioxide. The actual procedure is relatively complicated and is divided into three steps. The first step extracts the more volatile compounds with pure supercritical carbon dioxide at moderately low density and temperature. Less volatile PAHs are removed in the second step using supercritical carbon dioxide and methanol modifi er. A third step using pure carbon dioxide is employed to purge the modifier from the system. 26.3.3 PRESSURIZED LIQUID EXTRACTION AND SUBCRITICAL WATER EXTRACTION Pressurized liquid extraction and subcritical water extraction offer some of the advantages of supercritical fl uid extraction but under generally less severe conditions. Compared to conventional solvent extraction, both of these techniques are faster and consume less solvent. Pressurized liquid extraction, also called accelerated solvent extraction, uses relatively small volumes (60 mL or less) of organic solvents heated to 50\u00b0C to 200\u00b0C under sufficient pressure to maintain the liquid state. This enables extraction of solid samples within 30 min. Typically, polyhalogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and benzo-p-furans have been extracted from solid samples within 15 min with a 1/1 mixture of n-hexane and acetone at 130\u00b0C.4 Compound degradation was minimal. Subcritical water extraction, or pressurized hot water extraction uses water heated to 100\u00b0C to 374\u00b0C pressurized to maintain the liquid state. The dielectric constant of water under these conditions changes with temperature, which can be adjusted to change the extraction characteristics and make it an effective extractant for organophilic analytes. Specifically, as the temperature of sub-critical liquid water is raised, its dielectric constant and polarity decrease making it a more \u201corganic-like\u201d extractant. Because it is more polar than organic solvents, water can also be more effective than common organic solvents in extracting polar analytes.", "Because of these characteristics and the environmentally friendly character of water, hot water extraction is finding greater use in the analysis of solid waste materials and sludges. A typical application of subcritical water extraction is the extraction of brominated fl ame retardants from sediment samples. The technique is reputed to be more effective than conventional Soxhlet extraction with solvents. 26.4 SAMPLE CLEANUP Processing of most waste, soil, and sediment samples results in the extraction of extraneous substances that can cause the observation of extraneous peaks, be detrimental to peak resolution and column efficiency, and be damaging to expensive columns and detectors. In order to obtain meaningful analytical results from the often complex samples of solid wastes, proper extraction and processing prior to analysis are critical. Sample cleanup refers to a variety of measures that can be taken to remove these constituents from sample extracts by a number of procedures including distillation, partitioning with immiscible solvents, adsorption chromatography, gel permeation chromatography, or chemical destruction of interfering substances with acid, alkali, or oxidizing agents; two or more of these techniques may be used in combination. The most widely applicable cleanup technique is gel permeation chromatography, which can be used to separate substances with high molecular masses from the analytes of interest. Treatment by adsorption column chromatography with alumina, Florisil, or silica gel can be used to isolate a relatively narrow polarity range of analytes away from interfering substances. Acid\u2013base partitioning can be used in the determination of materials such as chlorophenoxy herbicides and phenols to separate acidic, basic, and neutral organics. Table 26.1 shows the uses of the main sample cleanup techniques. Alumina column cleanup makes use of highly porous granular aluminum oxide. Available in acidic, neutral, and basic pH ranges, this solid is packed into a column topped with a water-absorbing substance over which the sample is eluted with a suitable solvent, which leaves interferences on the column. After elution, the sample is concentrated, exchanged with another solvent if necessary, then analyzed. Florisil is an acidic magnesium silicate and a registered trade name of Floridin Co. It is used in a column cleanup procedure in a manner similar to alumina. Silica gel is a weakly acidic amorphous silicon oxide. It can be activated by heating for several hours at 150\u00b0C to 160\u00b0C and used for the separation of hydrocarbons. Deactivated silica gel containing 10\u201320% water acts as an adsorbent for compounds with ionic and nonionic functionalities such as dyes, alkali metal cations, terpenoids, and plasticizers. It is used in a column as described for alumina above. Gel-permeation chromatography separates solutes by size carried over a hydrophobic gel by organic solvents. A gel must be chosen that will separate the appropriate size range of analytes and interferences. The gel is preswelled before loading onto a column and flushed extensively with solvent before the sample is introduced for separation. TABLE 26.1 Sample Cleanup Techniques and Their Applications Number Type Applications 3610 Alumina column Phthalate esters, nitrosamines 3611 Alumina column cleanup and PAHs, petroleum wastes separation of petroleum wastes 3620 Florisil column Phthalate esters, nitrosamines, organochlorine pesticides, PCBs, chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphorus pesticides 3630 Silica gel PAHs 3630(b) Silica gel Phenols 3640 Gel permeation chromatography Phenols, phthalate esters, nitrosamines, organochlorine pesticides, PCBs, nitroaromatics, cyclic ketones, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphorus pesticides, priority pollutant semivolatiles 3650 Acid\u2013base liquid-liquid partition Phenols, priority pollutant semivolatiles 3660 Sulfur cleanup Organochlorine pesticides, PCBs, priority pollutant semivolatiles 26.5 SAMPLE PREPARATION FOR VOCs Many different VOCs are found at waste sites and in various kinds of waste solid and sludge samples. These include benzene, bromomethane, chloroform, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, styrene, toluene, vinyl chloride, and the xylene isomers. Various methods are employed to isolate and concentrate VOCs from the solid, sludge, or liquid matrices in which they are contained. Method 5021, \u201cvolatile organic compounds in soils and other solid matrices using equilibrium headspace analysis\u201d is used to isolate VOCs from soil, sediment, or solid waste samples for determination by gas chromatography (GC) or GC/MS. This procedure makes use of a special glass headspace vial that contains at least 2 g of sample. A matrix-modifying preservative solution, internal standards, and surrogate compounds may be added to the sample and mixed thoroughly by rotating the vial. The sample is heated to 85\u00b0C for approximately 1 h prior to injection into the gas chromatograph.", "For injection, helium is forced under pressure into the vial and a sample of the gas in the headspace above the solid sample is forced out of the vial and into the gas chromatograph system for quantitation. Method 5030 is a purge-and-trap procedure that can be used to collect for gas chromatographic analysis poorly water-soluble compounds that have boiling points below 200\u00b0C, which includes a wide variety of compounds commonly occurring in hazardous wastes. For samples in water, helium is bubbled through the sample and the volatile analyte compounds are absorbed on a sorbent column. Solid samples can be dispersed in methanol and the methanol added to water for the purging step. After the purging is complete, the sorbent column is heated and flushed with carrier gas to sweep the sample compounds into the gas chromatograph for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the VOCs present. Method 5035 is a closed-system, purge-and-trap and extraction method applicable to the determination of VOCs in soil, sediment, and waste samples. For the determination of very low levels of VOCs in soil, a sealed sample vial is used that remains sealed throughout the sample processing operations. An approximately 5-g sample is weighed into a sample vial containing a stirring bar and sodium bisulfate preservative solution, and the vial is sealed and transported to the laboratory as soon as possible. For analysis, reagent water, surrogates, and internal standards are injected into the vial without opening it. The contents of the vial are purged with helium gas into an appropriate sampling trap, then flushed into the gas chromatograph for measurement. Method 5031 is used to isolate volatile, nonpurgeable, water-soluble compounds by azeotropic distillation. The analyte compounds for which it is suitable include acetone, acetonitrile, acrylonitrile, allyl alcohol, 1-butanol, t-butyl alcohol, crotonaldehyde, 1,4-dioxane, ethanol, ethyl acetate, ethylene oxide, isobutyl alcohol, methanol, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone, n-nitroso-di-n-butylamine, paraldehyde, 2-pentanone, 2-picoline, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, propionitrile, pyridine, and o-toluidine. The technique takes advantage of the formation of an azeotrope liquid mixture of water and analytes that boil at a constant temperature and give off vapors of a constant composition. For separation of the analyte species, a 1-L sample is adjusted to pH 7 with a buffer, and a small sample of condensate enriched in analyte species is collected. The organics are measured in the azeotrope solution distilled from the sample. Method 5032 employs vacuum distillation to isolate volatile organic analytes from liquid, solid, and oily waste matrices, and even animal tissues. Examples of compounds isolated for analysis by this procedure include acetone, benzene, carbon disulfide, chloroform, ethanol, styrene, tetrachloroethene, vinyl chloride, and the o-, m-, p-xylene isomers. Such compounds should be no more than minimally soluble in water and should boil below 180\u00b0C. The sample in water is distilled under a vacuum and the water condensed in a chilled condenser. Volatile analyte constituents not condensed with the water vapor are swept into a cryogenic trap maintained at liquid nitrogen temperature of \u2212196\u00b0C for collection. For analysis, the contents of the trap are evaporated at an elevated temperature and swept into the chromatograph. Method 3585, waste dilution for volatile organics, is employed to place a nonaqueous waste sample of volatile organics into the appropriate form for injection into a gas chromatograph. It is applicable to samples containing analytes at levels of 1 mg/kg or higher. The procedure calls for placing a 1 g oil-phase sample into a vial marked for a volume of 10 mL, diluting with n-hexadecane or other appropriate solvent, sealing the vial, and mixing to dissolve the sample. Because the diluted sample usually contains residual materials from the sample with a tendency to foul the gas chromatograph, the sample is injected through a replaceable direct injection liner containing Pyrex glass wool. 26.6 BIOASSAY AND IMMUNOASSAY SCREENING OF WASTES Several important biologically based methods are used to characterize wastes and particularly to assess the dangers that they pose to the biosphere.5 Acute toxicity tests that cover a relatively short period of the life cycle of organisms can be useful in finding materials that may pose immediate hazards. Long-lasting effects are assayed by chronic toxicity tests that measure such things as fertilization, growth, and reproduction. These tests normally have been conducted over the full life cycle of the organism or shortened to 30 days, an \u201cearly-stage test.\u201d The U.S. EPA has developed a 7-day chronic toxicity test that applies to early life-cycle stages of organisms, a time period during which the organisms are most sensitive to toxicants.", "Immunoassay has emerged as a useful technique for screening wastes for specific kinds of pollutants.6 Commercial immunoassay techniques have been developed that permit very rapid analyses of large numbers of samples. A variety of immunoassay techniques have been developed. These techniques all use biologically produced antibodies that bind specifically to analytes or classes of analytes. This binding is combined with chemical processes that enable detection through a signal-producing species (reporter reagent) such as enzymes, chromophores, fluorophores, and luminescent compounds. The reporter reagent binds with the antibody. When an analyte is added to the antibody to displace the reagent, the concentration of displaced reagent is proportional to the level of analyte displacing it from the antibody. Detection of the displaced reporter reagent enables quantification of the analyte. Immunoassay techniques are divided into the two major categories: heterogeneous and homogeneous; the former requires a separation (washing) step whereas the latter does not require such a step. Typically, when heterogeneous procedures are used, the antibody is immobilized on a solid support on the inner surface of a disposable test tube. The sample is contacted with the antibody displacing reporter reagent, which is removed by washing. The amount of reagent displaced, commonly measured spectrophotometrically, is proportional to the amount of analyte added. Very widely used enzyme immunoassays make use of reporter reagent molecules bound with enzymes, and kits are available for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) of a number of organic species likely to be found in hazardous wastes. Immunoassay techniques have been approved for the determination of numerous analytes commonly found in hazardous wastes. Where the EPA method numbers are given in parentheses, these include pentachlorophenol (4010), 2,4-D (4015), PCBs (4020), petroleum hydrocarbons (4030), PAHs (4035), toxaphene (4040), chlordane (4041), DDT (4042), TNT explosives in soil (4050), and hexahydro1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) in soil (4051). ELISA have been reported for monitoring pentachlorophenol, BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-, m-, and p-xylene) in industrial effl uents. 26.7 DETERMINATION OF CHELATING AGENTS Strong chelating agents in wastes have been found to play an important role in the mobility of heavy metals and metal radionuclides at waste disposal sites, with their potential to contaminate groundwater. Therefore, the determination of chelating agents, such as EDTA and N-(2-hydroxyethyl) ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA), is an important analytical procedure for wastes. Most chelating agents of concern at waste sites are polar and nonvolatile, which prevents their determination by direct gas chromatographic methods. One of the more satisfactory methods for their determination makes use of derivatization to produce volatile species suitable for gas chromatographic analysis. A method has been described for the determination of chelating agents in hazardous wastes from radioactive wastes using derivatization followed by gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analysis.7 The study involved wastes contained in a potentially leaking double-shell storage tank at the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford site. Treatment with BF3 and methanol produced volatile derivatives that were measured by GC/MS. In addition to EDTA and HEDTA, the study showed the presence of NTA and citrate chelating agents, and chelating nitrosoiminiodiacetate was produced as an artifact of the analytical procedure. 26.8 TOXICITY CHARACTERISTIC LEACHING PROCEDURE The TCLP is specified to determine the potential toxicity hazard of various kinds of wastes.8 The test was designed to estimate the availability to organisms of both inorganic and organic species in TABLE 26.2 Contaminants Determined in TCLP EPA EPA Hazardous Hazardous Waste Regulatory Waste Regulatory Number Contaminant Level (mg/L) Number Contaminant Level (mg/L) Heavy Metals (Metalloids) D004 Arsenic 5.0 D032 Hexachlorobenzene 0.13b D005 Barium 100.0 D033 Hexachlorobutadiene 0.5 D006 Cadmium 1.0 D034 Hexachloroethane 3.0 D007 Chromium 5.0 D035 Methylethyl ketone 200.0 D008 Lead 5.0 D036 Nitrobenzene 2.0b D009 Mercury 0.2 D037 Pentachlorophenol 100.0 D010 Selenium 1.0 D038 Pyridine 5.0b D011 Silver 5.0 D039 Tetrachloroethylene 0.7 Organics D040 Trichloroethylene 0.5 D018 Benzene 0.5 D041 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol 400.0 0.5 D019 Carbon tetrachloride D042 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol 2.0 D021 Chlorobenzene 100.0 D043 Vinyl chloride 0.2 D022 Chloroform 6.0 Pesticides D023 o-cresol 200.0a D012 Endrin 0.02 D024 m-cresol 200.0a D013 Lindane 0.4 D025 p-cresol 200.0a D014 Methoxychlor 10.0 D026 Cresol 200.0a D015 Toxaphene 0.5 D027 1,4 -Dichlorobenzene 7.5 D016 2,4-D 10.0 D028 1,2-Dichloroethane 0.5 D017 2,4,5-TP (Silvex) 1.0 D029 1,1-Dichloroethylene 0.7 D020 Chlordane 0.03 D030 2,4-Dinitrotoluene 0.13b D031 Heptachlor (and its epoxide) 0.008 a If o-, m-, and p-cresol concentrations cannot be differentiated, the total cresol (D026) concentration is used.

The quantitation limit therefore becomes the regulatory level.", "hazardous materials present as liquids, solids, or multiple phase mixtures by producing a leachate, the TCLP extract, which is analyzed for the specific toxicants listed in Table 26.2. The procedure for conducting the TCLP is rather involved. The procedure need not be run at all if a total analysis of the sample reveals that none of the pollutants specified in the procedure could exceed regulatory levels. At the opposite end of the scale, analysis of any of the liquid fractions of the sample showing that any regulated species would exceed regulatory levels even after the dilutions involved in the TCLP measurement have been carried out designate the sample as hazardous, and the TCLP measurement is not required. In conducting the TCLP test, if the waste is a liquid containing less than 0.5% solids, it is fi ltered through a 0.6\u20130.8 \u03bcm glass fi ber filter and the filtrate is designated as the TCLP extract. At levels of the solids exceeding 0.5%, any liquid present is filtered off for separate analysis and the solid is extracted to provide a TCLP extract (after size reduction, if the particles exceed certain size limitations). The choice of the extraction fluid is determined by the pH of the aqueous solution produced by shaking a mixture of 5 g of solids and 96.5 mL of water. If the pH is <5.0, a pH 4.93 acetic acid/sodium acetate buffer is used for extraction; otherwise, the extraction fluid used is a pH of 2.88 \u00b1 0.05 solution of dilute acetic acid. Extractions are carried out in a sealed container rotated end-over-end for 18 h. The liquid portion is then separated and analyzed for the specifi c substances given in Table 26.2. If values exceed the regulatory limits, the waste is designated as \u201ctoxic.\u201d LITERATURE CITED 1. Taricksa, J. R., Y. T. Hung, and K. H.

The atmosphere is a particularly difficult analytical system because of the very low levels of substances to be analyzed; sharp variations in pollutant level with time and location; differences in temperature and humidity; and difficulties encountered in reaching desired sampling points, particularly those substantially above the earth\u2019s surface. Furthermore, although improved techniques for the analysis of air pollutants are continually being developed, a need still exists for new analytical methodology and the improvement of existing methodology. Much of the earlier data on air pollutant levels were unreliable as a result of inadequate analysis and sampling methods. An atmospheric pollutant analysis method does not have to give the actual value to be useful. One which gives a relative value may still be helpful in establishing trends in pollutants levels, determining pollutant effects, and locating pollution sources. Such methods may continue to be used while others are being developed. Atmospheric analysis is a dynamic area that continues to benefit from advances in instrumentation and techniques. Standard methods of atmospheric chemical analysis have been summarized.1,2 27.1.1 AIR POLLUTANTS MEASURED The air pollutants generally measured may be placed in several different categories. In the United States, one such category contains materials for which ambient (surrounding atmosphere) standards have been set by the EPA. These are sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. The standards are categorized as primary and secondary. Primary standards are those defining the level of air quality necessary to protect public health. Secondary standards are designed to provide protection against known or expected adverse effects of air pollutants, particularly upon materials, vegetation, and animals. Another group of air pollutants to be measured consists of those known to be specifically hazardous to human health, such as asbestos, beryllium, and mercury. Still another category of air pollutants contains those regulated in new installations of selected stationary sources, such as coal-cleaning plants, cotton gins, lime plants, and paper mills.", "Some pollutants in this category are visible emissions, acid (H2SO4) mist, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides. These substances often must be monitored in the stack to ensure that emission standards are being met. A fourth category consists of the emissions of mobile sources (motor vehicles)\u2014hydrocarbons, CO, and NOx. A fifth group consists of miscellaneous elements and compounds, such as certain heavy metals, fluoride, chlorine, phosphorus, PAHs, PCBs, odorous compounds, reactive organic compounds, and radionuclides. Much of the remainder of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the analytical methods for most of the species mentioned above. The units in which air pollutants and air-quality parameters are expressed include for gases and vapors, mg/m3 (alternatively, ppm by volume); for mass of particulate matter, mg/m3; for particulate matter count, number per cubic meter; for visibility, km; for instantaneous light transmission, percentage of light transmitted; for emission and sampling rates, m3/min; for pressure, mm Hg; and for temperature, \u00b0C. Air volumes should be converted to conditions of 10\u00b0C and 760 mm Hg (1 atm), assuming ideal gas behavior. 27.2 SAMPLING The ideal atmospheric analysis techniques are those that work successfully without sampling, such as long-path laser resonance absorption monitoring. For many analyses, however, various types of sampling are required. In some very sophisticated monitoring systems, samples are collected and analyzed automatically and the results are transmitted to a central receiving station. Often, however, a batch sample is collected for later chemical analysis. The analytical result from a sample can only be as good as the method employed to obtain that sample. A number of factors enter into obtaining a good sample. The size of the sample required (total volume of air sampled) decreases with increasing concentration of pollutant and increasing sensitivity of the analytical method. Often a sample of 10 or more cubic meters is required. The sampling rate is determined by the equipment used and generally ranges from approximately 0.003 to 3.0 m3/min. The duration of sampling time influences the result obtained, as shown in Figure 27.1. The actual concentration of the pollutant is shown by the solid line. A sample collected over an 8-h period has the concentration shown by the dashed line, whereas samples taken over 1-h intervals exhibit the concentration levels shown by the dotted line. Sampling techniques are discussed briefly for specific kinds of analytes later in this chapter. Methods for sampling atmospheric particles are discussed in Section 27.9. The main methods for particle sampling are simple sedimentation, filtration, and impingement of an airstream onto a surface that collects particles. Sampling for vapors and gases may range from methods intended to collect only one specifi c pollutant to those designed to collect all pollutants. The most fundamental method of sampling is whole-air sampling in which a volume of air is collected in a bag or steel or glass container. Loss of analyte by adsorption onto container walls can be a problem with this technique. Essentially, all pollutants may be removed from an air sample cryogenically by freezing or by liquifying the air in collectors maintained at a low temperature. Analytes can be collected on solid sorbents over which air is filtered or by bubbling through liquids. Collection methods can be dynamic in which air is pumped through a sampling medium or passive in which a sampling medium, such as a semipermeable bag filled with sorbent material, is simply exposed to air over a period of time (see below). 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Time (h) FIGURE 27.1 Effect of duration of sampling upon observed values of air pollutant levels. Also used in water analysis, solid-phase microextraction combines sampling and preconcentration in which VOCs are collected from air by pumping over a small amount of fiber holding an extraction medium. The analyte can then be evolved from the extraction device directly into a gas chromatograph for measurement. Denuders are among the more useful sampling devices for certain kinds of air pollutants. Denuders solve a major sampling problem by enabling collection of gas-phase pollutants free of contamination by particles. Otherwise, for some pollutants such as acids, it is not possible to distinguish relative amounts of analytes in the gas phase from those in particulate form. Diffusion denuders run a laminar flow airstream through a tube, the walls of which are covered with a sorptive or reactive collecting medium for the analytes of interest.", "The diffusion coefficients of small particles are only about 10-4 those of gases, so that the particles go through the tube, and the gases diffuse to the walls and are collected. Open-bore denuders consist of tubes with coated walls. A more efficient device is the annular denuder composed of concentric tubes separated by 1\u20132 mm of annular space. Thermodenuders use heat to drive off analytes collected by the device. They can be used for semicontinuous analysis by employing a collection/analysis cycle involving alternate collection and thermal desorption. Diffusion scrubbers are denuders in which walls are composed of membranes such that gas from the sample goes through the wall and is collected in a collecting liquid. An annular denuder coated with citric acid can be used to collect gaseous ammonia in air. Gaseous HCl, HNO2, and SO2 can be collected on the wall of a denuder coated with sodium carbonate. Passive air sampling devices can be used for semiquantitative analysis of air contaminants. POP, such as PCBs may be collected from ambient air by devices consisting of triolein lipid material held inside tubes of permeable membrane material suspended in contact with the air. Such samplers may be left in place for many days or weeks and yield an integrated value of air contaminants. Somewhat related to passive air sampling devices in principle are surrogate sampling media consisting of materials that are in contact with the air naturally for prolonged periods of time. Pine needles and tree bark have been used as surrogate sampling media. An interesting surrogate sampling medium is butter from cows\u2019 milk. This medium is especially useful for lipophilic POP, such as PCBs. These materials deposit from air onto forage eaten by cows and become concentrated in the milk fat and hence in butter. Chemisorption reactions in which analytes react chemically with substances on a solid surface can be used to capture some air pollutants for analysis. One such process uses 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine contained in a cartridge through which air is pumped to sample the important class of carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) in the atmosphere. The adsorbent reacts with carbonyl compounds to form hydrazone compounds as shown by the reaction of acetaldehyde below and the hydrazone products are eluted with acetonitrile and measured by high-performance liquid chromatography using spectrophotometric detection. 27.3 METHODS OF ANALYSIS A very large number of different analytical techniques are used for atmospheric pollutant analysis. Some of these, the uses of which are not confined to atmospheric analysis, were discussed in Chapters 25 and 26. Techniques confined largely to atmospheric analysis are discussed in the remainder of this chapter. A summary of some of the main instrumental techniques for air monitoring is presented in Table 27.1.

These methods are published annually in the Code of Federal Regulations.3 They are not necessarily state-of-the art, and in some cases are outdated and cumbersome. However, for regulatory and legal purposes they provide reliable measurements proven to be valid. 27.4 DETERMINATION OF SULFUR DIOXIDE The reference method for the analysis of sulfur dioxide is the spectrophotometric pararosaniline method developed by West and Gaeke.4 It is applicable to the analysis of 0.005\u20135 ppm SO2 in ambient air. The method makes use of a collecting solution of 0.04 M potassium tetrachloromercurate to collect sulfur dioxide according to the following reaction: HgCl42-+ SO2 + H2O \u00c6 HgCl2SO32-+ 2H++ 2Cl- (27.2)", "Typically, sampling involves scrubbing 30 L of air through 10 mL of scrubbing solution with a collection efficiency of around 95%. The HgCl2SO23 -complex stabilizes readily oxidized sulfur dioxide against the oxidizing agents of oxidants such as ozone and nitrogen oxides. For analysis, sulfur dioxide in the scrubbing medium is reacted with formaldehyde: HCHO + SO2 + H2O \u00c6 HOCH2SO3H (27.3) The adduct formed is then reacted with uncolored organic pararosaniline hydrochloride to produce a red-violet dye. Although NO2 at levels above about 2 ppm interferes, the interference may be eliminated by reducing the NO2 to N2 gas with sulfamic acid, H2NSO3H. The level of SO2 measured Waste gas p-Rosaniline hydrochlorideMix FormaldehydeAir Air (formixing) MixAbsorbing Samplereagent Sulfamic acid Mix Waste 45\u00b0C FIGURE 27.2 Block diagram of an automated system for the determination of sulfur dioxide by the pararosaniline method. spectrophotometrically is corrected to standard ambient conditions of 25\u00b0C and atmospheric pressure (101 kPa). The lower limit of detection of SO2 in 10 mL of the collecting solution is 0.75 mg. This represents a concentration of 25 mg SO2/m3 (0.01 ppm) in an air sample of 30 standard liters (short-term sampling), and a concentration of 13 mg SO2/m3 (0.005 ppm) in an air sample of 288 standard liters (long-term sampling). Performed manually, the West\u2013Gaeke method for sulfur dioxide analysis is cumbersome and complicated. However, the method has been refined to the point that it can be done automatically with continuous-monitoring equipment. A block diagram of such an analyzer is shown in Figure 27.2. Conductimetry (amperometry) was used as the basis for a commercial continuous sulfur dioxide analyzer as early as 1929. Generally, the sulfur dioxide is collected in a solution of hydrogen peroxide, which oxidizes the SO2 to H2SO4, and the resulting increased electrical conductance of the sulfuric acid solution is measured. Sulfur dioxide can be determined by ion chromatography by bubbling SO2 through hydrogen peroxide solution to produce SO42-, followed by analysis of the sulfate by ion chromatography, a method that separates ions on a chromatography column and detects them very sensitively by conductivity measurement. Flame photometry, sometimes in combination with GC, is used for the detection of sulfur dioxide and other gaseous sulfur compounds. The gas is burned in a hydrogen flame, and the sulfur emission line at 394 nm is measured. Several direct spectrophotometric methods are used for sulfur dioxide measurement, including nondispersive infrared absorption, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, ultraviolet absorption, molecular resonance fluorescence, and second-derivative spectrophotometry. The principles of these methods are the same for any gas measured. 27.5 NITROGEN OXIDES Several methods have been used to determine nitrogen oxides. As noted in Table 27.1, these methods include electrochemical methods, direct measurements of nitrogen oxides spectrophotometrically in the gas phase, and a wet chemical method based on formation of an azo dye. However, gas-phase chemiluminescence is the favored method of NOx analysis.5 The general phenomenon of chemiluminescence was defined in Section 9.8. It results from the emission of light from electronically excited species formed by a chemical reaction. In the case of NO, ozone is used to bring about the reaction, producing electronically excited nitrogen dioxide: NO + O3 \u00c6 NO*2 + O2 (27.4) The species loses energy and returns to the ground state through emission of light in the 600\u2013 3000 nm range. The emitted light is measured by a photomultiplier; its intensity is proportional to the concentration of NO. A schematic diagram of the device used is shown in Figure 27.3. Chamber linedWindow (\ufb01lter) with aluminum excluding lightbelow 600 nm L To vacuum Ozone FIGURE 27.3 Chemiluminescence detector for NOx. Since the chemiluminescence detector system depends upon the reaction of O3 with NO, it is necessary to convert NO2 to NO in the sample prior to analysis. This is accomplished by passing the air sample over a thermal converter, which brings about the desired conversion. Analysis of such a sample gives NOx, the sum of NO and NO2. Chemiluminescence analysis of a sample that has not been passed over the thermal converter gives NO. The difference between these two results is NO2. Other nitrogen compounds besides NO and NO2 undergo chemiluminescence by reacting with O3, and these may interfere with the analysis if present at an excessive level. Particulate matter also causes interference which may be overcome by employing a membrane filter on the air inlet. This analysis technique is illustrative of chemiluminescence analysis in general.", "Chemiluminescence is an inherently desirable technique for the analysis of atmospheric pollutants because it can avoid wet chemistry, is basically simple, and lends itself well to continuous monitoring and instrumental methods. Another chemiluminescence method, that employed for the analysis of ozone, is described in the next section. 27.6 ANALYSIS OF OXIDANTS The atmospheric oxidants that are commonly analyzed include ozone, hydrogen peroxide, organic per oxides, and chlorine. The classic manual method for the analysis of oxidants is based upon their oxidation of I- ion followed by spectrophotometric measurement of the product. The sample is collected in 1% KI buffered at pH 6.8. Oxidants react with iodide ion as shown by the following reaction of ozone: - O3 + 2H++ 3I-\u00c6 I3 + O2 + H2O (27.5) - The absorbance of the colored I3 product is measured spectrophotometrically at 352 nm. Generally, the level of oxidant is expressed in terms of ozone, although it should be noted that not all oxidants\u2014PAN, for example\u2014react with the same efficiency as O3. Oxidation of I- may be used to determine oxidants in a concentration range of several hundredths of a ppm to approximately 10 ppm. Nitrogen dioxide gives a limited response to the method, and reducing substances interfere seriously. Now the favored method for oxidant analysis uses chemiluminescence.6 The chemiluminescent reaction is that between ozone and ethylene. Chemiluminescent radiation from this reaction is emitted over a range of 300\u20136000 nm, with a maximum at 435 nm. The intensity of emitted light is directly proportional to the level of ozone. Ozone concentrations ranging from 0.003 to 30 ppm may be measured. Ozone for calibrating the instrument is generated photochemically from the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by oxygen. 27.7 ANALYSIS OF CARBON MONOXIDE Carbon monoxide can be measured in the atmosphere by absorption of infrared radiation at 4.7 mm. Observation of the absorbance of solar radiation at this wavelength through the atmosphere can be used to calculate total column abundance and column concentrations of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is analyzed in the atmosphere by nondispersive infrared spectrometry.7 This technique depends upon the fact that carbon monoxide absorbs infrared radiation strongly at certain wavelengths. Therefore, when such radiation is passed through a long (typically 100 cm) cell containing trace levels of carbon monoxide, more of the infrared radiant energy is absorbed. A nondispersive infrared spectrometer differs from standard infrared spectrometers in that the infrared radiation from the source is not dispersed according to wavelength by a prism or grating. The nondispersive infrared spectrometer is made very specific for a given compound, or type of compound, by using the sought-for material as part of the detector, or by placing it in a filter cell in the optical path. A diagram of a nondispersive infrared spectrometer selective for CO is shown in Figure 27.4. Radiation from an infrared source is \u201cchopped\u201d by a rotating device so that it alternately passes through a sample cell and a reference cell. In this particular instrument, both beams of light fall on a detector which is filled with CO gas and separated into two compartments by a fl exible diaphragm. The relative amounts of infrared radiation absorbed by the CO in the two sections of the detector depend upon the level of CO in the sample. The difference in the amount of infrared radiation absorbed in the two-compartments causes slight differences in heating, so that the diaphragm bulges slightly toward one side. Very slight movement of the diaphragm can be detected and recorded. By means of this device, carbon monoxide can be measured from 0 to 150 ppm, with a relative accuracy of \u00b15% in the optimum concentration range. Flame-ionization GC detection can also be used for the analysis of carbon monoxide. This detector system was described in Chapter 25, Section 25.5. It is selective for hydrocarbons, and conversion of CO to methane in the sample is required. This is accomplished by reaction with hydrogen over a nickel catalyst at 360\u00b0C: CO + 3H2 \u00c6 CH4 + H2O (27.6) A major advantage of this approach is that the same basic instrumentation may be used to measure hydrocarbons. Chopper Reference cell Detector (alternately sending (containing CO gas in twoinfrared beam through compartments separated bysample cell and a \ufb02exible diaphragm) reference cell) FIGURE 27.4 Nondispersive infrared spectrometer for the determination of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere.", "Carbon monoxide may also be analyzed by measuring the heat produced by its catalytic oxidation to CO2 over a catalyst consisting of a mixture of MnO2 and CuO. Differences in temperature between a cell in which the oxidation is occurring and a reference cell through which part of the sample is flowing are measured by thermistors. A vanadium oxide catalyst can be used for the oxidation of hydrocarbons, enabling their simultaneous analysis. 27.8 DETERMINATION OF HYDROCARBONS AND ORGANICS Monitoring of hydrocarbons in atmospheric samples takes advantage of the very high sensitivity of the hydrogen flame ionization detector to measure this class of compounds. Known quantities of air are run through the flame ionization detector 4 to 12 times per hour to provide a measure of total hydrocarbon content. A separate portion of each sample goes into a stripper column to remove water, carbon dioxide, and nonmethane hydrocarbons. Methane and carbon monoxide, which are not retained by the stripper column, are separated by a chromatographic column, passed through a catalytic reduction tube, and then to a flame ionization detector. Eluting first, methane is not changed by the reduction tube and is detected as methane by the detector. The carbon monoxide is reduced to methane, as shown by Reaction 27.6 in the preceding section, then detected as the methane product by the flame ionization detector. Concentrations of nonmethane hydrocarbons are given by subtracting the methane concentrations from the total hydrocarbons. Using the method described above, total hydrocarbons can be determined in a range of 0\u201313 mg/ m3, corresponding to 0\u201310 ppm. Methane can be measured over a range of 0\u20136.5 mg/m3 (0\u201310 ppm). 27.8.1 DETERMINATION OF SPECIFIC ORGANICS IN THE ATMOSPHERE The method for hydrocarbons described above gives total hydrocarbons and methanes. In some cases it is important to have a method to determine individual organics because of their toxicities, ability to form photochemical smog, as indicators of photochemical smog, and as means of tracing sources of pollution. Numerous techniques have been published for the determination of organic compounds in the atmosphere. For example, whole-air samples can be collected in Tedlar bags, concentrated cryogenically at \u2212180\u00b0C, then thermally desorbed and measured with high-resolution capillary column GC. The U.S. EPA has published several procedures for determining the identities and concentrations of key organic air pollutants classified as air toxics.8 These include VOCs, such as benzene, vinyl chloride, and chloroform; organochlorine pesticides and PCBs; aldehydes and ketones; phosgene; N-nitroso compounds; phenols, dioxin; nonmethane hydrocarbons, and PAHs. Sampling methods for various ones of these analytes include collection in canisters or bags, adsorption onto various solid sorbents, collection in liquids, and collection and reactions in reagent solutions. GC predominates as an analysis technique with detection by MS, flame ionization and electron capture. High-performance liquid chromatography is also used for the determination of some analytes. 27.9 ANALYSIS OF PARTICULATE MATTER Particles are almost always removed from air or gas (such as exhaust flue gas) prior to analysis. The two main approaches to particle isolation are fi ltration and removal by methods that cause the gas stream to undergo a sharp bend such that particles are collected on a surface. 27.9.1 FILTRATION The method commonly used for determining the quantity of total suspended particulate matter in the atmosphere draws air over filters that remove the particles.9 A Hi-Vol sampler for particles is essentially a glorified vacuum cleaner that draws air through a filter. The samplers are usually placed under a shelter which excludes precipitation and particles larger than about 0.1 mm in diameter, favoring collection of particles up to 25\u201350 mm diameter. These devices efficiently collect particles from a large volume of air, typically 2000 m3, and typically over a 24-h period (Figure 27.5). The filters used in a Hi-Vol sampler are usually composed of glass fibers and have a collection efficiency of at least 99% for particles with 0.3 mm diameter. Particles with diameters exceeding 100 mm remain on the filter surface, whereas particles with diameters down to approximately 0.1 mm are collected on the glass fibers in the fi lters. Efficient collection is achieved by using very small diameter fi bers (<1 mm) for the fi lter material. The technique described here is most useful for determining total levels of particulate matter. Prior to taking the sample, the filter is maintained at 15\u201335\u00b0C at 50% relative humidity for 24 h, then weighed.", "After sampling for 24 h, the filter is removed and equilibrated for 24 h under the same conditions used prior to its installation on the sampler. The filter is then weighed and the quantity of particulate matter per unit volume of air is calculated. The range over which particulate matter can be measured is approximately 2\u2013750 mg/m3, where volume is expressed at 25\u00b0C and 1 atm (760 mm Hg, 101 kPa) pressure. The lower limit is determined by limitations in measuring mass, and the upper limit by limited flow rate when the fi lter becomes clogged. Size separation of particles can be achieved by filtration through successively smaller filters in a stacked filter unit. Another approach uses the virtual impactor, a combination of an air filter and an impactor (discussed below). In the virtual impactor, the gas stream being sampled is forced to make a sharp bend. Particles larger than about 2.5 mm do not make the bend and are collected on a fi lter. The remaining gas stream is then fi ltered to remove smaller particles. A similar approach is the basis for a reference method for the collection of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 mm, PM10.10 As discussed in Chapter 10, small particulate matter is of special concern because of its respirability and other properties. This has led to the definition of another category of particulate matter, PM2.5, consisting of particles having an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 mm. To determine PM2.5, ambient air is drawn into an inertial particle size separator and the PM2.5 particles are collected on a polytetrafl uoroethylene (PTFE) fi lter for weighing over a period of about 24 h.11 The lower detection limit of the method is about 2 mg/m3. Results obtained by the analysis of particulate matter collected by filters should be treated with some caution. A number of reactions may occur on the filter and during the process of removing the sample from the fi lter. This can cause serious misinterpretation of data. For example, volatile particulate matter may be lost from the filter. Furthermore, because of chemical reactions on the fi lter, the material analyzed may not be the material that was collected. Artifact particulate matter forms from the oxidation of acid gases on alkaline glass fibers. This is a major problem with sulfur dioxide retained and oxidized to sulfate, especially on alkaline filters. Artifact particulate matter gives an exaggerated value of particulate matter concentration. 27.9.2 COLLECTION BY IMPACTORS Impactors cause a relatively high velocity gas stream to undergo a sharp bend such that particles are collected on a surface impacted by the stream. The device may be called a dry or wet impactor depending upon whether collecting surface is dry or wet; wet surfaces aid particle retention. Size segregation can be achieved with an impactor because larger particles are preferentially impacted, and smaller particles continue in the gas stream. The cascade impactor, accomplishes size separation by directing the gas stream onto a series of collection slides through successively smaller orifices, which yield successively higher gas velocities. Particles may break up into smaller pieces from the impact of impingement; therefore, in some cases impingers yield erroneously high values for levels of smaller particles. One of the major difficulties in particle analysis is the lack of suitable filter material. Different filter materials serve very well for specific applications, but none is satisfactory for all applications. Fiber filters composed of polystyrene are very good for elemental analysis because of low background levels of inorganic materials. However, they are not useful for organic analysis. Glass-fi ber filters have good weighing qualities and are therefore very useful for determining total particle concentration; however, metals, silicates, sulfates, and other species are readily leached from the fine glass fibers, introducing error into analysis for inorganic pollutant analysis. 27.9.3 PARTICLE ANALYSIS A number of chemical analysis techniques can be used to characterize atmospheric particulate pollutants.12 These include atomic absorption, inductively coupled plasma techniques, x-ray fl uorescence, neutron activation analysis, and ion-selective electrodes for fluoride analysis. Chemical microscopy is an extremely useful technique for the characterization of atmospheric particles. Either visible or electron microscopy may be employed. Particle morphology and shape tell the experienced microscopist a great deal about the material being examined. Refl ection, refraction, microchemical tests, and other techniques may be employed to further characterize the materials being examined.", "Microscopy may be used for determining levels of specific kinds of particles and for determining particle size. 27.9.4 X-RAY FLUORESCENCE X-ray fluorescence is another multielement analysis technique that can be applied to a wide variety of environmental samples. It is especially useful for the characterization of atmospheric particulate matter, but it can be applied to some water and soil samples as well. This technique is based upon measurement of x-rays emitted when electrons fall back into inner shell vacancies created by bombardment with energetic x-rays, gamma radiation, or protons. The emitted x-rays have an energy characteristic of the particular atom. The wavelength (energy) of the emitted radiation yields a qualitative analysis of the elements, and the intensity of radiation from a particular element provides a quantitative analysis. A schematic diagram of a wavelength-dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrophotometer is shown in Figure 27.6. An excitation source, normally an x-ray tube emitting \u201cwhite\u201d x-rays (a continuum), produces a primary beam of energetic radiation which excites fl uorescent x-rays in the sample. A radioactive source emitting gamma rays or protons from an accelerator may also be used for excitation. For best results, the sample should be mounted as a thin layer, which means that segments of air fi lters containing fine particulate matter make ideal samples. The fluorescent x-rays are passed through a collimator to select a parallel secondary beam, which is dispersed according to wavelength by diffraction with a crystal monochromator. The monochromatic x-rays in the secondary beam are counted by a detector which rotates at a degree twice that of the crystal to scan the spectrum of emitted radiation. Energy-selective detectors of the Si(Li) semiconductor type enable measurement of fl uorescent x-rays of different energies without the need for wavelength dispersion. Instead, the energies of a number of lines falling on a detector simultaneously are distinguished electronically. An energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrum from an atmospheric particulate sample is shown in Figure 27.7. A significant advantage of x-ray fluorescence multielement analysis is that sensitivities and detection limits do not vary greatly across the periodic table as they do with methods such as neutron activation analysis or atomic absorption. Proton-excited x-ray emission is particularly sensitive. 27.9.5 DETERMINATION OF LEAD IN PARTICULATE MATTER Because of its toxicity, widespread industrial use, and former use in gasoline, lead is one of the most important contaminants in atmospheric particulate matter. The U.S. EPA specifies a method for the determination of lead in atmospheric particulate matter.13 Lead collected from the atmosphere is 105 103 1 X-ray energy (KeV) extracted from particulate matter with heated nitric acid or by a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid facilitated by ultrasonication. The lead in the extract is then measured by fl ame atomic absorption spectrometry. The lower detection limit is typically 0.07 mg Pb/m3, using a collection volume of 2400 m3 of air. 27.10 DIRECT SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF GASEOUS AIR POLLUTANTS From the foregoing discussion, it is obvious that measurement techniques that depend upon the use of chemical reagents, particularly liquids, are cumbersome and complicated. It is a tribute to the ingenuity of instrument designers that such techniques are being applied successfully to atmospheric pollutant monitoring. Direct spectrophotometric techniques are much more desirable when they are available and when they are capable of accurate analysis at the low levels required. One such technique, nondispersive infrared spectrophotometry, was described in Section 27.7 for the analysis of carbon monoxide. Three other direct spectrophotometric methods are FTIR spectroscopy, tunable diode laser spectroscopy, and differential optical absorption spectroscopy. These techniques may be used for point air monitoring, in which a sample is monitored at a given point, generally by measurement in a long absorption cell. In-stack monitoring may be performed to measure effl uents. A final possibility is the collection of long-line data (sometimes using sunlight as a radiation source), yielding concentrations in units of concentration-length (ppm-m). If the path length is known, the concentration may be calculated. This approach is particularly useful for measuring concentrations in stack plumes. The low levels of typical air constituents require long path lengths, sometimes up to several kilometers, for spectroscopic measurements. These may be achieved by locating the radiation source some distance from the detector, by the use of a distant retroreflector to reflect the radiation back to the vicinity of the source, or by cells in which a beam is refl ected multiple times to achieve a long path length.", "A typical open-path FTIR system for remote monitoring of air pollutants uses a single unit (telescope) that functions as both a transmitter and receiver of infrared radiation (Figure 27.8). The radiation is generated by a silicon carbide glower, modulated by a Michaelson inteferometer, and transmitted to a retroreflector, which reflects it back to the telescope where its intensity is measured. The modulated infrared signal, called an inteferogram, is processed by a mathematical algorithm, the Fourier transform, to give a spectrum of the absorbing substances. This spectrum is fi tted mathematically to spectra of the absorbing species to give their concentrations. Dispersive absorption spectrometers are basically standard spectrometers with a monochromator for selection of the wavelength to be measured. They are used to measure air pollutants by determining absorption at a specified part of the spectrum of the sought-for material. Of course, other gases or particulate matter that absorb or scatter light at the chosen wavelength interfere. These instruments are generally applied to in-stack monitoring. Sensitivity is increased by using long path lengths or by pressurizing the cell. Second-derivative spectroscopy is a useful technique for trace gas analysis. Basically, this technique varies the wavelength by a small value around a specified nominal wavelength. The second derivative of light intensity versus wavelength is obtained. In conventional absorption spectrophotometry, a decrease in light intensity as the light passes through a sample indicates the presence of at least one substance\u2014and possibly many\u2014absorbing at that wavelength. Second-derivative spectroscopy, however, provides information regarding the change in intensity with wavelength, thereby indicating the presence of specific absorption lines or bands which may be superimposed on a relatively high background of absorption. Much higher specificity is obtained. The spectra obtained by second-derivative spectrometry in the ultraviolet region show a great deal of structure and are quite characteristic of the compounds being observed. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging (analogous to radar, radio detection and ranging), is fi nding numerous applications in atmospheric monitoring. Lidar systems send short pulses of light or infrared radiation into the atmosphere and collect radiation scattered back from molecules or particles in the atmosphere. Computer analysis of the signal enables measurement of species in the atmosphere. Differential absorption lidar uses two different laser wavelengths, one of which is absorbed by the analyte molecules and the other of which is not. The intensity difference of the two return signals provides a measure of the analyte concentration. Target velocities can be measured by Doppler lidar. Target molecules moving toward the detector exhibit slightly reduced wavelengths in the return signal (blue shift) and those moving away give slightly longer wavelengths (red shift). This technique is very useful for the analysis of aerosol particles and, since these are carried at the essentially the same velocity as the wind, it provides a remote measurement of wind velocity.

What device is employed to make a nondispersive infrared analyzer selective for the compound being determined? 2. Suggest how MS would be most useful in air pollutant analysis. 3. What is a required characteristic of the absorption cell used for the direct spectrophotometric measurement of gaseous pollutants in the atmosphere, and how may this characteristic be achieved in a cell of manageable dimensions? 4. If 0.250 g of particulate matter is the minimum quantity required for accurate weighing on a Hi-Vol sampler filter, how long must such a sampler be operated at a flow rate of 2.00 m3/ min to collect a sufficiently large sample in an atmosphere containing 5 mg/m3 of particulate matter? 5. The atmosphere around a chemical plant is suspected of containing a number of heavy metals in the form of particulate matter. After a review of Chapter 10, suggest several methods that would be useful for a qualitative and roughly quantitative analysis of the metals in the particulate matter. 6. Assume that the signal from a chemiluminescence analyzer for NO is proportional to NO concentration. For the same rate of air flow, an instrument gave a signal of 135 mamp for an air sample that had been passed over a thermal converter and 49 mamp with the converter out of the stream. A standard sample containing 0.233 ppm NO gave a signal of 80 mamp. What was the level of NO2 in the atmospheric sample? 7. Using internet resources, look up the function of permeation tubes in providing standards for atmospheric analysis. A permeation tube containing NO2 lost 208 mg of the gas in 124 min at 20\u00b0C. What fl ow rate of air at 20\u00b0C should be used with the tube to prepare a standard atmospheric sample containing exactly 1.00 ppm by volume of NO2? 8.

An atmosphere contains 0.10 ppm by volume of SO2 at 25\u00b0C and 1.00 atm pressure. What volume of air would have to be sampled to collect 1.00 mg of SO2 in tetrachloromercurate solution? 10. Assume that 20% of the surface of a membrane filter used to collect particulate matter consists of circular openings with a uniform diameter of 0.45 mm. How many openings are on the surface of a filter with a diameter of 5.0 cm? 11. Some atmospheric pollutant analysis methods have been used in the past that later have been shown not to give the \u201ctrue\u201d value. In what respects may such methods still be useful? 12. How may ion chromatography be used for the analysis of nonionic gases? 13.", "A total of 40 L of air saturated with water vapor at atmospheric pressure and 25\u00b0C was bubbled through 500 mL of an oxidizing solution, converting all sulfur dioxide in the air to sulfate. The concentration of sulfate was determined by ion chromatography to be 2 \u00a5 10\u20133 mol/L. Calculate the concentration by volume of SO2 in the atmosphere on a dry air basis. 14. When large numbers of analyses are performed, an important consideration is the degree to which an analytical procedure is \u201cgreen.\u201d Compare the analyses for atmospheric sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide described in References given in this chapter and from the internet with respect to the degree to which they are \u201cgreen.\u201d 28 Analysis of Biological Materials and Xenobiotics 28.1 INTRODUCTION As defined in Chapter 23, Section 23.5, a xenobiotic species is one that is foreign to living systems. Common examples include heavy metals, such as lead, that serve no physiologic function, and synthetic organic compounds that are not natural. Exposure of organisms to xenobiotic materials is a very important consideration in environmental and toxicological chemistry. Therefore, the determination of exposure by various analytical techniques is one of the more crucial aspects of environmental chemistry. This chapter deals with the determination of xenobiotic substances in biological materials. Although such substances can be measured in a variety of tissues, the greatest concern is their presence in human tissues and other samples of human origin. Therefore, the methods described in this chapter apply primarily to exposed human subjects. They are essentially identical to methods used on other animals and, in fact, most were developed through animal studies. Signifi cantly, different techniques may be required for plant or microbiological samples. The measurement of xenobiotic substances and their metabolites in blood, urine, breath, and other samples of biological origin to determine exposure to toxic substances is called biological monitoring. Comparison of the levels of analytes measured with the degree and type of exposure to foreign substances is a crucial aspect of toxicological chemistry. It is an area in which rapid advances are being made. A complete reference on standardized methods for laboratory analysis practiced by clinical toxicologists confirming to standards stipulated by the International Standards Organization (ISO) was published in 2009.1 Several books on biological monitoring such as those by Angerer, Draper, Baselt, and Kneip and coauthors are listed at the end of this chapter under \u201csupplementary references.\u201d The two main approaches to workplace monitoring of toxic chemicals are workplace monitoring, using samplers that sample xenobiotic substances from workplace air, and biological monitoring. Although the analyses are generally much more difficult, biological monitoring is a much better indicator of exposure because it measures exposure through all routes\u2014oral and dermal as well as inhalation\u2014and it gives an integrated value of exposure. Furthermore, biological monitoring is very useful in determining the effectiveness of measures taken to prevent exposure, such as protective clothing and hygienic measures. 28.2 INDICATORS OF EXPOSURE TO XENOBIOTICS Biological markers or biomarkers refer to evidence used to monitor exposure, effects, and recovery from effects of xenobiotic substances. They (1) provide confirmation of exposure, (2) enable assessment of ill effects, and (3) provide evidence of an individual\u2019s response to exposure. Effects on the liver are especially useful as biomarkers because of the liver\u2019s key role in xenobiotic metabolism and its response to virtually all toxicants. In dealing with toxic substances, the liver often suffers damage, including cell death, lesions, fat abnormalities (fatty liver), impairment of bile flow, and vascular disorders. Prominent among the indicators of liver damage from toxicants are proteins indicating such damage that occur in blood (serum and plasma) and urine. The two major considerations in determining exposure to xenobiotics are the type of sample and the type of analyte. Both of these are influenced by what happens to a xenobiotic material when it gets into the body. For some exposures, the entry site composes the sample. This is the case, for example, in exposure to asbestos fibers in the air, which is manifested by lesions to the lung. More commonly, the analyte may appear at some distance from the site of exposure, such as lead in bone that was originally taken in by the respiratory route. In other cases, the original xenobiotic is not even present in the analyte. An example of this is methemoglobin in blood, the result of exposure to aniline absorbed through the skin. The two major kinds of samples analyzed for xenobiotics exposure are blood and urine.", "Both these samples are analyzed for systemic xenobiotics, which are those that are transported in the body and metabolized in various tissues. Xenobiotic substances and their metabolites and adducts are absorbed into the body and transported through the bloodstream. Therefore, blood is of unique importance as a sample for biological monitoring. Blood is not a simple sample to process, and subjects often object to the process of taking it. Upon collection, blood may be treated with an anticoagulant, usually a salt of EDTA, and processed for analysis as whole blood. It may also be allowed to clot and be centrifuged to remove solids; the liquid remaining is blood serum. Recall from Chapter 22 that as the result of Phase I and Phase II reactions, xenobiotics tend to be converted to more polar and water-soluble metabolites. These are eliminated with the urine, making urine a good sample to analyze as evidence of exposure to xenobiotic substances. Urine has the advantage of being a simpler matrix than blood and one that subjects more readily give for analysis. Other kinds of samples that may be analyzed include breath (for volatile xenobiotics and volatile metabolites), hair or nails (for trace elements, such as selenium), adipose tissue (fat), and milk (obviously limited to lactating females). Various kinds of organ tissue can be analyzed in cadavers, which can be useful in trying to determine the cause of death by poisoning. The choice of the analyte actually measured varies with the xenobiotic substance to which the subject has been exposed. Therefore, it is convenient to divide xenobiotic analysis on the basis of the type of chemical species determined. The most straightforward analyte is, of course, the xenobiotic itself. This applies to elemental xenobiotics, especially metals, which are almost always determined in the elemental form. In a few cases, organic xenobiotics can also be determined as the parent compound. However, organic xenobiotics are commonly metabolized to other products by Phase I and Phase II reactions. Usually, the Phase I reaction product is measured, often after it is hydrolyzed from the Phase II conjugate, using enzymes or acid hydrolysis procedures. Thus, for example, trans,trans-muconic acid can be measured as evidence of exposure to the parent compound benzene. In other cases, a Phase II reaction product is measured; for example, hippuric acid is determined as evidence of exposure to toluene. Some xenobiotics or their metabolites form adducts with endogenous materials in the body, which are then measured as evidence of exposure. A simple example is the adduct formed between carbon monoxide and hemoglobin, namely carboxyhemoglobin. More complicated examples are the adducts formed by the carcinogenic Phase I reaction products of PAHs with DNA or hemoglobin. Another class of analytes consists of endogenous substances produced on exposure to a xenobiotic material. Methemoglobin formed as a result of exposure to nitrobenzene, aniline, and related compounds is an example of such a substance that does not contain any of the original xenobiotic material but is formed as the result of exposure to a toxic substance. Another class of substance causes measurable alterations in enzyme activity. The most common example of this is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzyme by organophosphates or carbamate insecticides. 28.3 DETERMINATION OF METALS 28.3.1 DIRECT ANALYSIS OF METALS Several biologically important metals can be determined directly in body fluids, especially urine, by atomic absorption. In the simplest cases, the urine is diluted with water or with acid and a portion analyzed directly by graphite furnace atomic absorption, taking advantage of the very high sensitivity of that technique for some metals. Metals that can be determined directly in urine by this approach include chromium, copper, lead, lithium, and zinc. Very low levels of metals can be measured using a graphite furnace atomic absorption technique, and Zeeman background correction with a graphite furnace enables measurement of metals in samples that contain enough biological material to cause significant amounts of \u201csmoke\u201d during the atomization process, so that ashing the samples is less necessary. A variety of metals may be determined in blood and serum simply diluted with appropriate reagents such as ammonia, TritonX-100 surfactant, and EDTA using inductively coupled plasma atomization with mass spectrometric detection. This procedure enables analyses giving adequate detection limits for the measurement of cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, rubidium, and zinc. 28.3.2 METALS IN WET-ASHED BLOOD AND URINE Several toxicologically important metals are readily determined from wet-ashed blood or urine using atomic spectroscopic techniques.", "The ashing procedure may vary, but always entails heating the sample with strong acid and oxidant to dryness and redissolving the residue in acid. A typical procedure is digestion of blood or urine for cadmium analysis, which consists of mixing the sample with a comparable volume of concentrated nitric acid, heating to a reduced volume, adding 30% hydrogen peroxide oxidant, heating to dryness, and dissolving in nitric acid prior to measurement by atomic absorption or emission. Mixtures of nitric, sulfuric, and perchloric acid are effective although they are somewhat hazardous media for digesting blood, urine, or tissue. Wet ashing followed by atomic absorption analysis can be used for the determination in blood or urine of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, and zinc, among other metals. Although atomic absorption, especially highly sensitive graphite furnace atomic absorption, has long been favored for measuring metals in biological samples, the multielement capability and other advantages of inductively coupled plasma atomic spectroscopy has led to its use for determining metals in blood and urine samples. 28.3.3 EXTRACTION OF METALS FOR ATOMIC ABSORPTION ANALYSIS A number of procedures for the determination of metals and biological samples call for the extraction of the metal with an organic chelating agent in order to remove interferences and concentrate the metal to enable detection of low levels. The urine or blood sample may be first subjected to wet ashing to enable extraction of the metal. Beryllium from an acid-digested blood or urine sample may be extracted by acetylacetone into methylisobutyl ketone prior to atomic absorption analysis. Almost all of the common metals can be determined by this approach using appropriate extractants. The availability of strongly chelating extractant reagents for a number of metals has led to the development of procedures in which the metal is extracted from minimally treated blood or urine, then quantified by atomic absorption analysis. The metals for which such extractions can be used include cobalt, lead, and thallium extracted into organic solvent as the dithiocarbamate chelate, and nickel extracted into methylisobutyl ketone as a chelate formed with ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate. Several metals or metalloids are converted to a volatile form, usually hydrides, for analysis. Arsenic, antimony, and selenium can be reduced to AsH3, SbH3, and H2Se, respectively, which can be determined by atomic absorption or other means. Mercury is reduced to a volatile metal, which is evolved from solution and measured by cold vapor atomic absorption. 28.4 DETERMINATION OF NONMETALS AND INORGANIC COMPOUNDS Several nonmetals and nonmetallic species are determined in biological samples. One important example is fluoride, which occurs in biological fluids as the fluoride ion, F-. In some cases of occupational exposure or exposure through food or drinking water, excessive levels of fluoride in the body can be a health concern. Fluoride is readily determined potentiometrically with a fl uoride ion-selective electrode. The sample is diluted with an appropriate buffer and the potential of the fl uoride electrode measured very accurately versus a reference electrode, with the concentration calculated from a calibration plot. Even more accurate values can be obtained by the use of standard addition in which the potential of the electrode system in a known volume of sample is read, a measured amount of standard fluoride is added, and the shift in potential is used to calculate the unknown concentration of fl uoride. Another nonmetal for which a method of determining biological exposure would be useful is white phosphorus, the most common and relatively toxic elemental form. Unfortunately, there is no chemical method suitable for the determination of exposure to white phosphorus that would distinguish such exposure from relatively high background levels of organic and inorganic phosphorus in body fluids and tissues. Toxic cyanide can be isolated in a special device called a Conway microdiffusion cell by treatment with acid, followed by collection of the weakly acidic HCN gas that is evolved in a base solution. The cyanide released can be measured spectrophotometrically by the formation of a colored species. Carbon monoxide is readily determined in blood by virtue of the colored carboxyhemoglobin that it forms with hemoglobin. The procedure consists of measuring the absorbances at wavelengths of 414, 421, and 428 nm of the blood sample, a sample through which oxygen has been bubbled to change all the hemoglobin to the oxyhemoglobin form, and a sample through which carbon monoxide has been bubbled to change all the hemoglobin to carboxyhemoglobin. With the appropriate calculations, a percentage conversion to carboxyhemoglobin can be obtained. 28.5 DETERMINATION OF PARENT ORGANIC COMPOUNDS", "A number of organic compounds can be measured as the unmetabolized compound in blood, urine, and breath. In some cases, the sample can be injected along with its water content directly into a gas chromatograph. Direct injection is used for the measurement of acetone, n-butanol, dimethylformamide, cyclopropane, halothane, methoxyflurane, diethyl ether, isopropanol, methanol, methyl n-butyl ketone, methyl chloride, methylethyl ketone, toluene, trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene. For the determination of volatile compounds in blood or urine, a straightforward approach is to liberate the analyte at an elevated temperature, allowing the volatile compound to accumulate in headspace above the sample followed by direct injection of the headspace gas into a gas chromatograph. A reagent such as perchloric acid may be added to deproteinize the blood or urine sample and facilitate release of the volatile xenobiotic compound. Among the compounds determined by this approach are acetaldehyde, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, trichloroethylene, toluene, cyclohexane, and ethylene oxide. The use of multiple detectors for the gas chromatographic determination of analytes in headspace increases the versatility of this technique and enables the determination of a variety of physiologically important volatile organic compounds. Purge-and-trap techniques are those in which volatile analytes are evolved from blood or urine in a gas stream and collected on a trap for subsequent chromatographic analysis. Such techniques employing gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection can be used to determine a number of volatile organic compounds in blood, for example. 28.6 MEASUREMENT OF PHASE I AND PHASE II REACTION PRODUCTS 28.6.1 PHASE I REACTION PRODUCTS For a number of organic compounds, the most accurate indication of exposure is to be obtained by determining their Phase I reaction products. This is because many compounds are metabolized in the body and do not show up as the parent compound. And those fractions of volatile organic compounds that are not metabolized may be readily eliminated with expired air from the lungs and may thus be missed. In cases where a significant fraction of the xenobiotic compound has undergone a Phase II reaction, the Phase I product may be regenerated by acid hydrolysis. One of the compounds commonly determined as its Phase I metabolite is benzene, which undergoes the following reactions in the body (see Chapter 24, Section 24.4): Benzene epoxide Benzene oxepin (28.1) Therefore, exposure to benzene can be determined by analysis of urine for phenol. Although a very sensitive colorimetric method for phenol involving diazotized p-nitroaniline has long been available, gas chromatographic analysis is now favored. The urine sample is treated with perchloric acid to hydrolyze phenol conjugates and the phenol is extracted into diisopropyl ether for chromatographic analysis. Two other metabolic products of benzene, trans,trans-muconic acid, and S-phenyl mercapturic acid are now commonly measured as more specific biomarkers of benzene exposure. HHO HO C C C C CC OH HH Trans,trans-muconic acidO Insecticidal carbaryl undergoes the metabolic reaction shown in Reaction 28.2. Therefore, the analysis of 1-naphthol in urine indicates exposure to carbaryl. The 1-naphthol that is conjugated by a Phase II reaction is liberated by acid hydrolysis, and is then determined spectrophotometrically or by chromatography + Other products (28.2) In addition to the examples discussed above, a number of other xenobiotics are measured by their Phase I reaction products. These compounds and their metabolites are listed in Table 28.1. These methods are used for determining metabolites in urine. Normally the urine sample is acidifi ed to release the Phase I metabolites from the Phase II conjugates that they might have formed and, except where direct sample injection is employed, the analyte is collected as vapor or extracted into an organic solvent. In some cases, the analyte is reacted with a reagent that produces a volatile derivative that is readily separated and detected by gas chromatography.

The formation of hippuric acid from toluene is shown in Chapter 23, Figure 23.2, and the formation of 4-methylhippuric acid from p-xylene is shown below: H H Phase I H3C CH+{O} H3C COH Oxidation HH + 2{O} Other metabolites that may be formed from aryl solvent precursors include mandelic acid and phenylgloxylic acid. Exposure to toluene can be detected by extracting hippuric acid from acidified urine into diethyl ether/isopropanol and direct ultraviolet absorbance measurement of the extracted acid at 230 nm. Potentially, methylhippuric acid can be measured in urine as evidence of exposure to xylenes. However, when the analysis is designed to detect the xylenes, ethylbenzene, and related compounds, several metabolites related to hippuric acid may be formed and the ultraviolet spectrometric method lacks specificity. To improve specificity, the various acids produced from these compounds can be extracted from acidified urine into ethyl acetate, derivatized to produce volatile species, and quantified by gas chromatography. A disadvantage in measuring toluene exposure by hippuric acid is the production of this metabolite from natural sources other than toluene, and the determination of tolulylmercapturic acid is now favored as a biomarker of toluene exposure. An interesting sidelight is that dietary habits can cause uncertainties in the measurement of xenobiotic metabolites. An example of this is the measurement of exposure of workers to 3-chloropropene by the production of allylmercapturic acid. This metabolite is also produced by garlic, and garlic consumption by workers can be a confounding factor in the method. Thiocyanate monitored as evidence of exposure to cyanide is increased markedly by the consumption of cooked cassava! 28.6.3 MERCAPTURATES Mercapturates have proven to be very useful Phase II reaction products for measuring exposure to xenobiotics, especially because of the sensitive determination of these substances by HPLC separation, and fluorescence detection of their o-phthaldialdehyde derivatives. In addition to toluene mentioned above, the xenobiotics for which mercapturates may be monitored include styrene, structurally similar to toluene; acrylonitrile; allyl chloride; atrazine; butadiene; and epichlorohydrin. The formation of mercapturates or mercapturic acid derivatives by metabolism of xenobiotics is the result of Phase II conjugation by glutathione. Glutathione (commonly abbreviated GSH) is a crucial conjugating agent in the body. This compound is a tripeptide, meaning that it is composed of three amino acids linked together. These amino acids and their abbreviations are glutamic acid (Glu), cysteine (Cys), and glycine (Gly). The formula of GSH may be represented as illustrated in Figure 28.1, where the SH is shown specifi cally because of its crucial role in forming the covalent link to a xenobiotic compound. GSH conjugate may be excreted directly, although this is rare. More commonly, the GSH conjugate undergoes further biochemical reactions that produce mercapturic acids (compounds with N-acetylcysteine attached) or other species. The specific mercapturic acids can be monitored as biological markers of exposure to the xenobiotic species that result in their formation. The overall process for the production of mercapturic acids as applied to a generic xenobiotic species, HX-R (see previous discussion), is illustrated in Figure 28.1. An interesting application of mercapturate analysis for ingestion of specific compounds is the measurement of S-allylmercapturic acid (structural formula below) in urine as a biomarker of ingestion of garlic for health reasons.", "The precursor to this compound is g-glutamyl-S-allyl-l-cysteine that occurs naturally in garlic. CH3 OH S-allylmercapturic acid 28.7 DETERMINATION OF ADDUCTS Determination of adducts is often a useful and elegant means of measuring exposure to xenobiotics. Adducts, as the name implies, are substances produced when xenobiotic substances add to endogenous Glutathione Glu Cys Gly + HX R Glu Cys Gly transferase SH Xenobiotic S Glutathione Glutathione conjugate X Direct R excretion in bile Loss of glutamyl and glycinyl H HO Acetylation (addition RXSC CCOH of C CH3) HN O HH Cysteine conjugateH HO RXSC CCOH Readily excreted mercapturic acid conjugateHN H C CH3 O chemical species. The measurement of carbon monoxide from its hemoglobin adduct was discussed in Section 28.4. In general, adducts are produced when a relatively simple xenobiotic molecule adds to a large macromolecular biomolecule that is naturally present in the body. The fact that adduct formation is a mode of toxic action, such as that occurs in the methylation of DNA during carcinogenesis (Chapter 23, Section 23.8), makes adduct measurement as a means of biolog ical monitoring even more pertinent. Adducts to hemoglobin are perhaps the most useful means of biological monitoring by adduct formation. Hemoglobin is, of course, present in blood, which is the most accurate type of sample for biological monitoring. Adducts to blood plasma albumin are also useful monitors and have been applied to the determination of exposure to toluene diisocyanate, benzo(a)pyrene, styrene, styrene oxide, and afl atoxin B1. The DNA adduct of styrene oxide has been measured to indicate exposure to carcinogenic styrene oxide. Another example of how DNA adducts can be measured as evidence of xenobiotic exposure is provided by the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, which is activated by metabolic processes and adds to deoxyguanosine in DNA to give the guanine adduct, O6-[1-oxo-1-(3-pyridyl)but-4-yl]dGuo, as shown in Figure 28.2. Measurement of this adduct by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) or LC/ESItandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) can provide evidence of exposure to the carcinogen. One disadvantage of biological monitoring by adduct formation can be the relatively complicated procedures and expensive, specialized instruments required. Lysing red blood cells may be required to release the hemoglobin adducts, derivatization may be necessary, and the measurements of the final analyte species can require relatively sophisticated instrumental techniques. Despite these complexities, the measurement of hemoglobin adducts is emerging as a method of choice for a number of xenobiotics including acrylamide, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, 3,3\u00a2-dichlorobenzidine, ethylene oxide, and hexahydrophthalic anhydride. 28.8 THE PROMISE OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS As discussed in Chapter 26, Section 26.6, immunoassay methods offer distinct advantages in specificity, selectivity, simplicity, and costs. Although used in simple test kits for blood glucose and (deoxyribose) tobacco-specifi c carcinogen.

Because of their inherent advantages, however, it can be anticipated that immunoassays will grow in importance for biological monitoring of xenobiotics. As an example of such an application, PCBs have been measured in blood plasma by immunoassays. Methods have been developed for the immunoassay of cyanobacterial toxins (saxitoxins, microcystins, and nodularins) in biological samples. Calves are aborted from pregnant cows that ingest isocupressic acid by eating vegetation from lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, common juniper, and Monterey cypress. As evidence of exposure to this toxic agent, an immunoassay has been developed that responds to the abortifacient agent as well as its major metabolites, agathic acid, dihydroagathic acid, and tetrahydroagathic acid (Figure 28.3).2 The method can be used to determine these compounds in both blood serum and urine of cattle. In addition to immunoassay measurement of xenobiotics and their metabolites, immunological techniques can be used for the separation of analytes from complex biological samples employing immobilized antibodies. This approach has been used to isolate aflatoxicol from urine and enable its determination along with aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2, M1, and Q1 using high-performance liquid chromatography and postcolumn derivatization/fl uorescence detection.3 A monoclonal antibody reactive with S-phenylmercapturic acid, an important Phase II reaction product of benzene resulting from GSH conjugation, has been generated from an appropriate hapten\u2013protein conjugate.", "The immobilized antibody has been used in a column to enrich S-phenylmercapturic acid from the urine of workers exposed to benzene.4 Significantly, more such applications can be anticipated in future years.
