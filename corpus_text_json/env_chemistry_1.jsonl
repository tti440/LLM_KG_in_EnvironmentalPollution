The World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001, as well as later attacks on the London subway system, trains in Madrid, hotels in Mumbai, and other places around the world showed the vulnerability of our civilization to malevolent actions of those who feel compelled to commit evil acts and raised concerns about the possibilities for even more damaging attacks with chemical, biological, or radioactive agents. The first part of 2008 saw runaway prices for key commodities including petroleum, metals such as copper, and grain. Crude oil prices reached almost $150 per barrel in July 2008 and predictions were made that gasoline prices in the United States would exceed $5.00 per gallon for the foreseeable future. These trends were reversed in the latter part of 2008 with the occurrence of the greatest economic collapse the world had seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Housing prices, which had reached levels unsupportable by people with ordinary incomes, collapsed, and the prices of some commodities plummeted. In early 2009, world leaders were struggling to find solutions to severe economic problems. As humans and their governments struggle with economic challenges, evidence has continued to gather that their activities are degrading the Earth\u2019s life support system upon which they depend for their existence. The emission to the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is almost certainly causing global warming. During the early 2000s, the Arctic ice cap diminished to a level never before observed in recorded history. Discharge of pollutants has degraded the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere in industrialized areas. Natural resources including minerals, fossil fuels, freshwater, and biomass have become stressed and depleted. The productivity of agricultural land has been diminished by water and soil erosion, deforestation, desertifi cation, contamination, and conversion to nonagricultural uses. Wildlife habitats including woodlands, grasslands, estuaries, and wetlands have been destroyed or damaged. About 3 billion people (half of the world\u2019s population) live in dire poverty on less than the equivalent of U.S. $2 per day. The majority of these people lack access to sanitary sewers and the conditions under which they live give rise to debilitating viral, bacterial, and protozoal diseases including malaria and diarrhea. At the other end of the standard of living scale, a relatively small fraction of the world\u2019s population consumes an inordinate amount of resources with lifestyles that involve living too far from where they work, in energy-wasting houses that are far larger than they need, commuting long distances in large \u201csport utility vehicles\u201d that consume far too much fuel, and overeating to the point of unhealthy obesity with accompanying problems of heart disease, diabetes, and other obesity-related maladies. In a sense, the history of humankind and its relationship to Planet Earth is a story of \u201cfrom the sun to fossil fuels and back again.\u201d During virtually all their existence on Earth, humans have been dependent upon the bounty provided by the sun. Solar radiation provided the warmth required for humans to exist and was augmented by fi re from burning of biomass generated by photosynthesis and by garments made of skins of animals that had fed upon photosynthetically produced biomass. Food consumed by humans came from plants that converted solar energy into biomass chemical energy and from meat produced by plant-eating animals. As human societies developed, indirect means of utilizing solar energy were harnessed as well. Wind generated by solar heating of the atmosphere was utilized to drive windmills and to propel sailboats used for transportation. Humans learned to impound water and to convert the energy of flowing water to mechanical energy with waterwheels. The circulation of this water was part of the solar-powered hydrological cycle. Essentially everything that humans used and depended upon for their existence came ultimately from the sun. 1.1.1 THE BRIEF BUT SPECTACULAR ERA OF FOSSIL FUELS As civilizations developed, humans discovered the uses of fossil fuels for energy.", "Although coal in those few locations where it was readily accessible from the surface had been used as a source of heat for centuries, the development of this energy source really took off around 1800, especially with the development of the steam engine as a practical power source. This began a massive shift from solar and biomass energy sources to fossil fuels, progressing from coal to petroleum and eventually natural gas. The result was an enormous revolution in human society with the development of huge heavy industries; transportation systems including rail, motor vehicles, and aircraft; and means of greatly increased food production. In Germany in the early 1900s, Carl Bosch and Fritz Haber developed the process for converting atmospheric elemental nitrogen to ammonia (NH3), a high-pressure, energy-intensive process that required large amounts of fossil fuels. This discovery enabled the production of huge quantities of relatively inexpensive nitrogen fertilizer and the resulting increase in agricultural production may well have saved Europe, with a rapidly developing population at the time, from widespread starvation. So it was that the era of fossil fuel, which has been described as \u201cfossiled sunshine,\u201d1 dating from about 1800 enabled humankind to enjoy unprecedented material prosperity and to increase in numbers from around 1 billion to over 6 billion. Now, however, it is apparent that the fossil fuel era, if not ending, will no longer be sustainable as the bedrock of industrial society. Approximately half of the world\u2019s total petroleum resource has already been consumed and, despite periods of reduced demand such as occurred during the global economic downturn in 2009, petroleum will continue to become more scarce and expensive and can last for only a few more decades as the dominant fuel and organic chemicals source for humankind. Coal is much more abundant, but its utilization has troubling environmental implications, especially as the major source of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Natural gas, an ideal, clean-burning fossil fuel that produces the least amount of carbon dioxide per unit energy generated, is relatively abundant and means have now been developed to extract it from previously inaccessible tight shale formations; it can serve as a \u201cbridging fuel\u201d for several decades until other sources can be developed. Nuclear energy, properly used with nuclear fuel reprocessing, can take on a greater share of energy production, especially for base load electricity generation. 1.1.2 BACK TO THE SUN Given the fact that humans cannot rely upon fossil hydrocarbons for future fuel and raw materials, it is back to the sun for meeting basic human needs. The most direct use of the sun is for solar heating and for photovoltaic power generation. But there are probably even greater indirect uses of the sun for the production of energy and material. Arguably the fastest growing energy source in the world is electricity generated by wind. Wind is solar powered; basically, the sun heats masses of air, the air expands, and the wind blows. Biomass generated by solar-powered photosynthesis can be used as a raw material to replace petroleum in petrochemicals manufacture. Furthermore, biomass can be converted to any of the hydrocarbon fuels including methane, diesel fuel, and gasoline as discussed in Chapter 19. The use of biomass for making liquid fuels has not gotten off to a particularly auspicious start in the United States and some other countries. This is because the two major synthetic fuels made from biomass, ethanol from fermentation of sugar and biodiesel fuel made from plant lipid oils, largely use the most valuable parts of food plants\u2014corn grain to get sugar for fermentation to ethanol and soybeans to get oil for the synthesis of biodiesel fuel. The yields from these pathways are relatively low and almost as much energy is required to grow and process grain to make fuel as is obtained from the fuel itself. The demand for corn and soybeans to make synthetic fuels has caused disruptions in the agricultural grain markets and resulted in inflated prices that have created hardships for people dependent upon these crops for food. Sugarcane grown in more tropical regions, especially Brazil, produces very high yields of fermentable carbohydrate and is a practical energy source. Oil palm trees produce fruits and seeds with high contents of oils used to make biodiesel fuel, but the intensive cultivation of oil palm trees in countries such as Malaysia has resulted in environmentally harmful destruction of rain forests. The diversion of palm oil to make fuel has resulted in less of it being available for food.", "Fortunately, means exist to produce the biomass needed for fuel and raw material without seriously disrupting the world\u2019s food supply. The main pathway for doing so is through the thermo-chemical conversion of biomass to synthesis gas, a mixture of CO and H2, followed by chemical synthesis of methane and other hydrocarbons by long-established technology discussed in Chapter 19. The raw material for doing so may come from a number of renewable sources including crop by-products, dedicated crops, and algae. Crop by-products generated in huge quantities in agricultural areas include corn stover (stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs of the plant), wheat straw, and rice straw. Although a certain amount of these materials needs to be returned to soil to maintain soil quality, a significant fraction can be removed for fuel and chemical synthesis (until the practice was prohibited because of air pollution, rice straw was commonly burned in the fields to prevent excess accumulation of residues on soil). Dedicated crops such as hybrid poplar trees and sawgrass can be grown in large quantities for biomass. Microscopic aquatic algae can be vastly more productive of biomass than plants grown on soil and can thrive in brackish (somewhat saline) water in containments in desert areas. In all these cases mineral nutrients from the residues of thermochemical processing, especially potassium, can be returned to the soil. Clearly, photosynthetically produced biomass will have a large role to play in \u201cre-entering the solar age.\u201d 1.2 THE SCIENCE OF SUSTAINABILITY Environmentalists, including the practitioners of environmental chemistry, are often accused of being gloomy and pessimistic. A close look at the state of the world can certainly give credence to such a view. However, the will and ingenuity of humans that have been directed toward exploiting world resources, giving rise to conditions leading to deterioration of Planet Earth, can be\u2014indeed, are being\u2014harnessed to preserve the planet, its resources, and its characteristics that are conducive to healthy and productive human life. The key is sustainability or sustainable development defi ned by the Bruntland Commission in 1987 as industrial progress that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.2 A key aspect of sustainability is the maintenance of the Earth\u2019s carrying capacity, that is, its ability to maintain an acceptable level of human activity and consumption over a sustained period of time.3 Interviewed in February 2009, Dr. Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who had just been appointed Secretary of Energy in U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s new administration, listed three main areas that require Nobel-level breakthroughs in the achievement of sustainability: solar power, electric batteries, and the development of new crops that can be turned into fuel. He contended that the efficiency of solar energy capture and conversion to electricity needed to improve several-fold. Improved electric batteries are needed to store electrical energy generated by renewable means and to enable practical driving ranges in electric vehicles. Improved crops are needed that convert solar energy to chemical energy in biomass at higher efficiencies than current crops. In this case the potential for improvement is enormous because most plants convert <1% of the solar energy falling on them to chemical energy through photosynthesis. Through genetic engineering, it is likely that this efficiency could be improved several-fold leading to vastly increased generation of biomass. Clearly, the achievement of sustainability employing high-level scientifi c developments will be an exciting development in decades to come. 1.2.1 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE This book is about environmental chemistry. To understand that topic, it is important to have some appreciation of environmental science and sustainability science as a whole. Environmental science in its broadest sense is the science of the complex interactions that occur among the terrestrial, atmospheric, aquatic, living, and anthropological systems that compose Earth and the surroundings that may affect living things. It includes all the disciplines, such as chemistry, biology, ecology, sociology, and government, that affect or describe these interactions.4 For the purposes of this book, environmental science will be defined as the study of the earth, air, water, and living environments, and the effects of technology thereon. To a significant degree, environmental science has evolved from investigations of the ways by which, and places in which, living organisms carry out their life cycles. This discipline used to be known as natural history, which later evolved into ecology, the study of environmental factors that affect organisms and how organisms interact with these factors and with each other.", "1.2.2 GREEN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY In recent years the environmental movement has seen a shift away from emphasis primarily upon pollution, its effects, and how to overcome these ill effects toward a broader view of sustainability. The more modern orientation is often labeled as \u201cgreen.\u201d As applied to chemistry, the practice of inherently safer and more environmentally friendly chemical science is called green chemistry,5 a topic that is discussed in more detail later in this book. A spin-off of green chemistry to engineering\u2014especially chemical engineering\u2014is known as green engineering.6 In the most general sense, the practice of sustainable science and technology can be called green science and technology. As humankind attempts to provide for numbers of people that are already very large for a planet of limited resources, the practice of green science and technology has become a matter of crucial importance. 1.3 CHEMISTRY AND THE ENVIRONMENT As the science of all matter, chemistry obviously has a large role in understanding the environment and preserving its quality. In the past, grievous damage was done to the environment by misguided and ignorant practices of chemical science and engineering. Wastes from chemical processes were discarded by the cheapest, most convenient routes, which usually meant up the stack, down the drain, or onto the ground (Figure 1.1). Biologists observed the effects of these practices in the form of fish kills, declining bird populations, and deformed animals. Physicians noticed maladies caused by air and water pollution, such as respiratory problems from breathing polluted air. And ordinary citizens without any special scientific knowledge could observe obscured visibility in polluted atmospheres and waterways choked with excessive plant growth from nutrients discharged into the water; eyes and nose alone were often sufficient to detect significant pollution problems. But, as the science of matter, chemistry has an essential role to play in environmental protection and improvement. Increasingly, chemists have become familiar with chemical processes that occur in the environment and have developed means of directing chemical science toward environmental improvement. Since about 1970, the science of chemistry in the environment\u2014environmental chemistry, the topic of this book\u2014has emerged as a strong and dynamic science that has made enormous contributions to understanding the environment and the chemical and biochemical processes that occur in it. Toxicological chemistry has developed as a discipline that relates the chemical nature of substances to their toxic effects.7 But to understand environmental problems is not enough. Measures need to be taken to not only alleviate such problems, but to prevent their developing in the first place. Toward those ends, other disciplines are developing that point the way to more environmentally friendly ways of doing things. Sustainable development, the practice of industrial ecology, and the practice of green chemistry are all directed toward enabling human societies and industrial systems to exist in better harmony with the Earth\u2019s support systems upon which all living beings ultimately depend for their existence. These areas, all dependent upon environmental chemistry, are developed in detail later in this book. 1.4 WATER, AIR, EARTH, LIFE, AND TECHNOLOGY Water, air, earth, life, and technology are strongly interconnected as shown in Figure 1.2, which, in a sense, summarizes and outlines the theme of the rest of this book. Traditionally, environmental science has been divided into the study of the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the geosphere, and the biosphere. However, for better or for worse, the environment in which all humans must live has been affected irreversibly by technology. Therefore, technology is considered strongly in this book within a separate environmental sphere called the anthrosphere in terms of how it affects the environment and in the ways by which, applied intelligently by those knowledgeable of environmental science, it can serve, rather than damage, this Earth upon which all living beings depend for their welfare and existence. The strong interactions among living organisms and the various spheres of the abiotic (nonliving) environment are best described by cycles of matter that involve biological, chemical, and geological processes and phenomena. Such cycles are called biogeochemical cycles, and are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2 and elsewhere in this book. In light of the above definitions, it is now possible to consider environmental chemistry from the viewpoint of the interactions among water, air, earth, life, and the anthrosphere as outlined in Figure 1.2. These five environmental \u201cspheres\u201d and the interrelationships among them are summarized in this section. In addition, the chapters in which each of these topics is discussed in greater detail are designated here.", "1.4.1 WATER AND THE HYDROSPHERE The hydrosphere contains the Earth\u2019s water, a vitally important substance in all parts of the environment. Water, the environmental chemistry of which is discussed in detail in Chapters 3 through 8, is an essential part of all living systems and is the medium from which life evolved and in which life exists. Water covers about 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface. Over 97% of the Earth\u2019s water is in oceans, and most of the remaining freshwater is in the form of ice. Therefore, only a relatively small percentage of the total water on Earth is actually involved with terrestrial, atmospheric, and biological processes. Water plays a key role in many segments of the anthrosphere, such as in boilers or municipal water distribution systems. Energy and matter are carried through various spheres of the environment by water. Water leaches soluble constituents from mineral matter and carries them to the ocean or leaves them as mineral deposits some distance from their sources. Water carries plant nutrients from soil into the bodies of plants by way of plant roots. Solar energy absorbed in the evaporation of ocean water is carried as latent heat and released inland. This process provides a large fraction of the energy that is transported from equatorial regions toward the Earth\u2019s poles and that powers massive storms in the atmosphere. 1.4.2 AIR AND THE ATMOSPHERE The atmosphere is a thin protective blanket that nurtures life on Earth and protects it from the hostile environment of outer space by absorbing energy and damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun and by moderating the Earth\u2019s temperature to within a range conducive to life. It is the source of carbon dioxide for plant photosynthesis and of oxygen for respiration. It provides the elemental nitrogen that nitrogen-fixing bacteria and ammonia-manufacturing industrial plants use to produce chemically bound nitrogen, an essential component of life molecules. As a basic part of the hydro-logic cycle (Chapter 3, Figure 3.1), the atmosphere transports water from the oceans to land. Atmospheric science deals with the movement of air masses in the atmosphere, atmospheric heat balance, and atmospheric chemical composition and reactions. Atmospheric chemistry is covered in Chapters 9 through 14 of this book. 1.4.3 EARTH, THE GEOSPHERE The geosphere, discussed in general in Chapter 15, consists of the solid earth, including soil, which supports most plant life (Chapter 16). The geosphere is composed of a solid, iron-rich inner core, a molten outer core, mantle, and the crust. The crust, only 5\u201340 km thick, is a thin outer skin composed largely of lighter silicate-based minerals and is the most important part of the geosphere insofar as interactions with the other spheres of the environment are concerned. It is that part of the Earth upon which humans live and from which they extract most of their food, minerals, and fuels. Geology is the science of the geosphere and is very important in considerations of the environment. It pertains mostly to the solid mineral portions of the Earth\u2019s crust. But it must also consider water, which is involved in weathering rocks and in producing mineral formations; the atmosphere and climate, which have profound effects on the geosphere and interchange matter and energy with it; and living systems, which largely exist on the geosphere and in turn have significant effects on it. Modern technology, for example, the ability to move massive quantities of dirt and rock around, has a profound influence on the geosphere. 1.4.4 LIFE, THE BIOSPHERE All living entities on the Earth compose the biosphere. Living organisms and the aspects of the environment pertaining directly to them are called biotic, and other portions of the environment are abiotic. Biology is the science of life. It is based on biologically synthesized chemical species, many of which exist as large molecules called macromolecules. As living beings, the ultimate concern of humans with their environment is the interaction of the environment with life. Therefore, biological science is a key component of environmental science and environmental chemistry. The role of life in environmental science is discussed in the following section and in numerous other parts of this book. The crucial effects of microorganisms on aquatic chemistry are covered in Chapter 6. Chapter 22 addresses biochemistry as it applies to the environment. The effects on living beings of toxic substances, many of which are environmental pollutants, are addressed in Chapters 23 and 24. Other chapters discuss aspects of the interaction of living systems with various parts of the environment.", "1.4.5 TECHNOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT Technology refers to the ways in which humans do and make things with materials and energy, that is, how they construct and operate the anthrosphere. Technology is the product of engineering based on science, which explains interrelated natural phenomena of energy, matter, time, and space. Engineering applies science to provide the plans and means to achieve specific practical objectives. Technology uses these plans to carry out desired objectives. It is essential to consider technology, engineering, and industrial activities in studying environmental science because of the enormous influence that they have on the environment. Humans will use technology to provide the food, shelter, goods, and transportation that they need for their wellbeing and survival. The challenge is to integrate technology with considerations of the environment and ecology such that the two are mutually advantageous rather than in opposition to each other. Technology, properly applied, is an enormously positive influence for environmental protection. The most obvious such application is in air and water pollution control. As necessary as \u201cend-of-pipe\u201d measures are for the control of air and water pollution, it is much better to use technology in manufacturing processes to prevent the formation of pollutants. Technology is being used increasingly to develop highly efficient processes of energy conversion, renewable energy resource utilization, and conversion of raw materials to finished goods with minimum generation of hazardous waste byproducts. In the transportation area, properly applied technology in areas such as high-speed train transport can enormously increase the speed, energy efficiency, and safety of means by which people and goods are moved. Until very recently, technological advances were made largely without heed to environmental impacts. Now, however, the greatest technological challenge is to reconcile technology with environmental consequences. The survival of humankind and of the planet that supports it now requires that the established two-way interaction between science and technology become a three-way relationship including environmental protection and emphasizing sustainability. 1.5 ECOLOGY, ECOTOXICOLOGY, AND THE BIOSPHERE 1.5.1 THE BIOSPHERE Virtually the entire biosphere composed of living organisms is contained by the geosphere and hydrosphere in the very thin layer where these environmental spheres interface with the atmosphere. There are some specialized life forms at extreme depths in the ocean, but these are still relatively close to the atmospheric interface. The biosphere strongly influences, and in turn is strongly influenced by, the other parts of the environment. It is believed that organisms were responsible for converting the Earth\u2019s original reducing atmosphere to an oxygen-rich one. Photosynthetic organisms remove CO2 from the atmosphere, thus preventing runaway greenhouse warming of the Earth\u2019s surface. Organisms largely determine aquatic chemistry in bodies of water, and are strongly involved in weathering processes that break down rocks in the geosphere and convert rock matter to soil. The biosphere is based upon plant photosynthesis, which fixes solar energy (hn) and carbon from atmospheric CO2 in the form of high-energy biomass, represented as {CH2O}: CO2 + H2O + hn\u00c6 {CH2O} + O2 (g) (1.1) In so doing, plants and algae function as autotrophic organisms, those that utilize solar or chemical energy to fix elements from simple, nonliving inorganic material into complex life molecules that compose living organisms. Carbon that was originally fixed photosynthetically forms the basis of all fossil fuels in the geosphere. The opposite process of photosynthesis, namely biodegradation, breaks down biomass, preventing its accumulation in the environment, and releasing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere: {CH2O} + O2 (g) \u00c6 CO2 + H2O (1.2) There is a strong interconnection between the biosphere and the anthrosphere. Humans depend upon the biosphere for food, fuel, and raw materials. Sustainability in the face of diminishing supplies of petroleum will increasingly rely on the biosphere for the production of raw materials and fuel in the future. Human infl uence on the biosphere continues to change it drastically. Fertilizers, pesticides, and cultivation practices have vastly increased yields of biomass, grains, and food. Destruction of habitat is resulting in the extinction of many species, in some cases even before they are discovered. Bioengineering of organisms with recombinant DNA technology and older techniques of selection and hybridization are causing great changes in the characteristics of organisms and promise to result in even more striking alterations in the future. It is the responsibility of humankind to make such changes intelligently and to protect and nurture the biosphere. 1.5.2 ECOLOGY Ecology is the science that deals with the relationships between living organisms with their physical environment and with each other.", "An ecosystem consists of an assembly of mutually interacting organisms (a community) and their environment in which materials are interchanged in a largely cyclical manner. An ecosystem has physical, chemical, and biological components along with energy sources and pathways of energy and materials interchange. The environment in which a particular organism lives is called its habitat. The role of an organism in a habitat is its niche. A major community of organisms based on predominant producers of biomass and adaptations of various organisms in the community to their environment is called a biome. To study ecology it is often convenient to divide the environment into general categories. The terrestrial environment is based on land and consists of biomes, such as grasslands, savannas, d eserts, or one of several kinds of forests. The freshwater environment can be further subdivided into standing-water habitats (lakes and reservoirs) and running-water habitats (streams and rivers). The oceanic marine environment is characterized by saltwater and may be divided broadly into the shallow waters of the continental shelf composing the neritic zone and the deeper waters of the ocean that constitute the oceanic region. An environment in which two or more kinds of organisms exist to their mutual benefit is termed a symbiotic environment. A particularly important factor in describing ecosystems is that of populations consisting of numbers of a specifi c species occupying a specifi c habitat. Populations may be stable, or they may grow exponentially as a population explosion. A population explosion that is unchecked results in resource depletion, waste accumulation, and predation, culminating in an abrupt decline called a population crash. Behavior in areas such as hierarchies, territoriality, social stress, and feeding patterns plays a strong role in determining the fates of populations. All of these aspects, including the possibility of a population crash, apply to human populations as well. 1.5.3 ECOTOXICOLOGY As discussed in detail in Chapters 23 and 24, toxicology refers to the detrimental effects of substances on organisms. Substances with such effects are called toxic substances, toxicants, or poisons. Whether or not a substance is toxic depends upon the amount of the substance an organism is exposed to and the manner of exposure. Some substances that are harmless or even beneficial at low levels are toxic at higher levels of exposure. Toxic substances have a strong influence on ecosystems and the organisms in ecosystems, so the interactions between ecology and toxicology are very important. These interactions may be complex and involve a number of organisms. They may involve food chains and complex food webs. For example, persistent organohalide compounds may become more highly concentrated through food chains and exert their most adverse effects on organisms such as birds of prey at the top of the food chain. The combination of ecology and toxicology\u2014the study of the effects of toxic substances upon ecosystems\u2014has come to be known as ecotoxicology, which has been developed into an important discipline in environmental science. Ecotoxicological effects may be considered through several different organizational levels. The first is introduction of a toxicant or pollutant into the system. This may result in biochemical changes at the molecular level. As a result, physiological changes may occur in tissues and organs. These may result in detrimental alterations of organisms. As a result, the organisms affected may undergo population changes, such as those that occurred in the 1950s and 1960s with decreased populations of hawks exposed to DDT. Such changes can alter communities; for example, decreased numbers of hawks may allow increased numbers of rodents accompanied by greater destruction of grain crops. Finally, whole ecosystems may be altered signifi cantly. Whereas toxicology usually deals with the effects of toxic substances on individuals, ecotoxicology emphasizes populations. Large numbers of individuals may be poisoned by toxic substances, whereas the population may survive. Dealing with populations as it does, ecotoxicology is signifi cantly more complex than toxicology. In reducing risk, emphasis is usually placed upon the protection of species composition since that automatically protects ecosystem processes. 1.6 ENERGY AND CYCLES OF ENERGY Biogeochemical cycles and virtually all other processes on the Earth are driven by energy from the sun. The sun acts as a so-called blackbody radiator with an effective surface temperature of 5780 K (absolute temperature in which each unit is the same as a Celsius degree, but with zero taken at absolute zero). It transmits energy to the Earth as electromagnetic radiation (see below) with a maximum energy flux at about 500 nm, which is in the visible region of the spectrum.", "A 1 m2 area perpendicular to the line of solar flux at the top of the atmosphere receives energy at a rate of 1340 W, suffi cient, for example, to power an electric iron. This is called the solar flux (see Chapter 9, Figure 9.3). 1.6.1 LIGHT AND ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION Electromagnetic radiation, particularly light, is of utmost importance in considering energy in environmental systems. Therefore, the following important points related to electromagnetic radiation should be noted: \u2022 Energy can be carried through space at the speed of light (c), 3.00 \u00a5 108 meters per second (m/s) in a vacuum, by electromagnetic radiation, which includes visible light, ultraviolet radiation, infrared radiation, microwaves, radio waves, g-rays, and x-rays. \u2022 Electromagnetic radiation has the character of a wave. The waves move at the speed of light, c, and have the characteristics of wavelength (l), amplitude, and frequency (n, Greek \u201cnu\u201d) as illustrated below: higher frequencyWavelength \u2022 The wavelength is the distance required for one complete cycle, and the frequency is the number of cycles per unit time. They are related by the following equation: nl = c where n is expressed in units of cycles per second [s\u22121, a unit called the hertz (Hz)] and l is in meters (m). \u2022 In addition to behaving as a wave, electromagnetic radiation has the characteristics of particles. \u2022 The dual wave/particle nature of electromagnetic radiation is the basis of the quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation, which states that radiant energy may be absorbed or emitted only in discrete packets called quanta or photons. The energy, E, of each photon is given by E = hn where h is Planck\u2019s constant, 6.63 \u00a5 10\u221234 J s. \u2022 From the preceding, it is seen that the energy of a photon is higher when the frequency of the associated wave is higher (and the wavelength shorter). 1.6.2 ENERGY FLOW AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN LIVING SYSTEMS Whereas materials are recycled through ecosystems, the flow of useful energy is essentially a one-way process. Incoming solar energy can be regarded as high-grade energy because it can cause useful reactions to occur, such as production of electricity in photovoltaic cells or photosynthesis in plants. As shown in Figure 1.3, solar energy captured by green plants energizes chlorophyll, which in turn powers metabolic processes that produce carbohydrates from water and carbon dioxide. These carbohydrates are repositories of stored chemical energy that can be converted to heat and work by metabolic reactions with oxygen in organisms. Ultimately, most of the energy is converted to low-grade heat, which is eventually reradiated away from the Earth by infrared radiation. 1.6.3 ENERGY UTILIZATION During the last two centuries, the growing, enormous human impact on energy utilization has resulted in many of the environmental problems now facing humankind. This time period has seen a transition from the almost exclusive use of energy captured by photosynthesis and utilized as biomass (food to provide muscle power, wood for heat) to the use of fossil fuel petroleum, natural gas, and coal for about 90%, and nuclear energy for about 5%, of all energy employed commercially. By 2008, it had become painfully obvious that resources of the most desirable fossil fuels (petroleum and natural gas) were becoming depleted and falling behind in meeting demand. Of particular importance is the fact that all fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is almost certainly causing global warming. Therefore, as noted at the beginning of this chapter, it will be necessary to move toward the utilization of alternate renewable energy sources, including solar energy and biomass. The study of energy utilization is crucial in sustainability science, and it is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 19. 1.7 HUMAN IMPACT AND POLLUTION The demands of increasing population coupled with the desire of most people for a higher material standard of living are resulting in worldwide pollution on a massive scale. All five of the major environmental spheres can suffer from pollution and all are linked with respect to pollution phenomena. For example, some gases emitted to the atmosphere can be converted to strong acids by atmospheric chemical processes, fall to the Earth as acid rain, and pollute water with acidity. Improperly discarded hazardous wastes can leach into groundwater that is eventually released as polluted water into streams. 1.7.1 SOME DEFINITIONS PERTAINING TO POLLUTION In some cases, pollution is a clear-cut phenomenon, while in other cases it lies largely in the eyes of the beholder. Frequently, time and place determine what may be called a pollutant.", "The phosphate that the sewage treatment plant operator has to remove from wastewater is chemically the same as the phosphate that the farmer a few miles away has to buy at high prices for fertilizer. Most pollutants are, in fact, resources gone to waste; as resources become scarcer and more expensive, economic pressures can provide impetus for solutions to many pollution problems. A key aspect of sustainability is the diversion of matter in pollutants to useful applications. A reasonable definition of a pollutant is a substance present in greater than natural concentration as a result of human activity that has a net detrimental effect upon its environment or upon something of value in that environment. Contaminants, which are not classified as pollutants unless they have some detrimental effect, cause deviations from the normal composition of an environment. Every pollutant originates from a source. The source is particularly important because it is generally the logical place to eliminate pollution. After a pollutant is released from a source, it may act upon a receptor. The receptor is anything that is affected by the pollutant. Humans whose eyes smart from oxidants in the atmosphere are receptors. Trout fingerlings that may die after exposure to acid from acid rain in water are also receptors. Eventually, if the pollutant is long-lived, it may be deposited in a sink, a long-time repository of the pollutant. Here it will remain for a long time, though not necessarily permanently. Thus, a limestone wall may be a sink for atmospheric sulfuric acid by conversion of CaCO3 in limestone into CaSO4. 1.7.2 POLLUTION OF VARIOUS SPHERES OF THE ENVIRONMENT Pollution of surface water and groundwater is discussed in some detail in Chapter 7. Particulate air pollutants are covered in Chapter 10, gaseous inorganic air pollutants in Chapter 11, and organic air pollutants and associated photochemical smog in Chapters 12 and 13. Some air pollutants, particularly those that may result in irreversible global warming or destruction of the protective stratospheric ozone layer, are of such a magnitude that they have the potential to threaten life on the Earth. These are discussed in Chapter 14. Hazardous wastes are discussed in Chapters 20 and 21. Toxic pollutants are addressed in Chapters 23 and 24. 1.8 CHEMICAL FATE AND TRANSPORT The movement and fate of environmental pollutants is a key consideration in determining their impacts. This concern is addressed by the discipline of chemical fate and transport or environmental fate and transport. Figure 1.4 illustrates the major pathways involved in chemical fate and transport. Substances regarded as pollutants almost always originate from the anthrosphere (although substances such as sulfur-containing volcanic gases can act as pollutants as well). They may move into the air, onto the ground, into water (surface water or groundwater), into sediments, and into biota (plants and animals). Where such substances go and what they do depend upon their properties Irrigation and the conditions of the environment into which they are introduced. As a general rule, the fate and transport of contaminants are controlled by their physical transport (movement without reacting or interacting with other phases) and their reactivity, including chemical or biochemical reactions or physical interactions with other phases. It is convenient to view environmental fate and transport in terms of three major environmental compartments: (1) the atmosphere, (2) surface waters, and (3) the terrestrial or subsurface including soil, mineral strata, and groundwater. These compartments are illustrated in Figure 1.5. Terrestrial and subsurface FIGURE 1.5 The three major environmental compartments considered in environmental fate and transport. 1.8.1 PHYSICAL TRANSPORT Although there are numerous physical transport processes depending upon the medium in which the contaminants are found, they may be divided into two categories. The first of these is advection due to movement of masses of fluids that simply carry pollutants with them. Vertical advection of air or water is called convection. The second type of movement of chemical species is diffusive transport or Fickian transport, most commonly regarded as molecular diffusion, the natural tendency of molecules to move from regions of higher to regions of lower concentration by the random movement of molecules. Diffusive transport is also approximated by turbulent mixing. Turbulent mixing can be seen in the eddies of a flowing stream, and a similar phenomenon occurs in air. The mixing that occurs as water flows around and among small particles as it flows underground is also treated as a form of diffusive transport.", "Air contaminants move with wind and air currents, by diffusion processes, and by settling and suspension of atmospheric aerosol particles. Water contaminants move by currents in water, by turbulent mixing processes, by diffusion, and by settling and suspension of particles. In solids, such as mineral formations, contaminants move by the action of groundwater or by diffusion in the vapor phase. The mobility of contaminants depends upon the fluidity of the medium in which they are contained. Contaminants in the atmosphere may move by as much as several kilometers per hour in wind, whereas their movement in soil and solids may be almost imperceptible. 1.8.2 REACTIVITY Reactivity includes chemical reactions, biological uptake, and binding to and release from surfaces. Reactivity processes include the two broad categories of chemical reactions and interphase exchange. In water, interphase exchange could include the binding of soluble species to suspended particles in water and in air it could include evaporation and condensation of species. Biological processes fall into the broad category of interphase exchange, but any biochemical reactions that pollutants taken up by organisms undergo are obviously chemical changes. 1.8.3 MASS BALANCE EXPRESSION Like all matter, pollutants are governed by mass conservation, which simply accounts for all the matter in a pollutant wherever it is moved and whatever reactions it might undergo. In considering mass conservation in the environment, it is useful to defi ne a control volume as a part of the environment within which all sources and sinks of a pollutant can be accounted for and across the boundaries of which movement of pollutants may be known. In relationship to such a portion of the environment, a pollutant is described by the mass balance relationship as shown in Figure 1.6. A special case of the mass balance relationship that often simplifies the study of environmental fate and transport is when there is no net change in the mass of pollutant within the control volume, a condition of steady state. A typical control volume might be the water in a lake, not including the sediment layer. Uptake of a substance by the sediment would depend upon the relative affinity of the substance for water and sediment. For example, a relatively hydrophobic substance would have a strong tendency to leave the water phase and enter the organic phase in the sediment. A substance that is volatile would tend to evaporate at the surface. The substance might be changed by biodegradation processes mediated by microorganisms suspended in the lake water. Water might fl ow into the lake from a stream source and out of the lake through an outlet stream. From these considerations it should be obvious that although the concept of the mass balance relationship is straightforward, its calculation for a substance in a particular control volume can become quite complicated. Environmental compartment 1.8.4 DISTRIBUTION AMONG PHASES Distribution among phases is very important in environmental fate and transport. This may involve movement between major environmental compartments shown in Figure 1.5. Or it may entail partitioning between phases within an environmental compartment. For example, a gaseous air pollutant in the atmosphere might be taken up by plant leaves and move from the atmospheric to the terrestrial compartment. Or it might absorb onto particulate matter in the atmosphere. A chemical species in the subsurface may be absorbed to soil particles, dissolve in soil water, or even partition into air spaces in the Earth. The various factors involved in partitioning environmental species between phases are addressed in more detail in Chapters 5 (water), 9 (the atmosphere), and 15 (terrestrial); several examples are mentioned here. The tendency of a substance to partition between water and solids in contact with the water depends upon the substance\u2019s water solubility or hydrophilic tendencies. A substance in water that has a high vapor pressure will tend to evaporate into the atmosphere. Species in the atmosphere that are organophilic may be taken up by the wax-like surfaces of plant structures, such as pine needles. There are two major ways in which a substance may be sequestered by another phase. It may bind with the surface, such as occurs when some organic contaminants in water are taken up by surface interactions with solids, a process called adsorption. Or it may actually be incorporated into the body of material to which it is bound, a process called absorption. A more general term that applies to both processes is sorption.", "A substance is said to be sorbed; it is called the sorbate and the material to which it is bound is called the sorbent. 1.9 CHEMICAL FATE AND TRANSPORT IN THE ATMOSPHERE, HYDROSPHERE, AND GEOSPHERE This section briefly addresses chemical fate and transport in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere. It is important to have a rudimentary perspective of chemical fate and transport in these spheres to understand chemical fate and transport in later parts of the book. These aspects are discussed in more detail in later chapters dealing with specific spheres of the environment. 1.9.1 POLLUTANTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE Substances that tend to be transported to the atmosphere are those that are relatively volatile. Such substances include those that are gases under normal ambient conditions, including compounds such as nitric oxide (NO) or carbon monoxide (CO). A number of organic compounds including those in gasoline or chlorofluorocarbons are called volatile organic compounds (VOC). Organic compounds that are less volatile nevertheless get into air are classifi ed as semivolatile organic compounds. An important consideration regarding substances that get into the atmosphere is the degree to which they are hydrophobic. Hydrophobic substances, including a number of the VOC and semi-volatile organic compounds, are those that are repelled by water. Their opposites, hydrophilic compounds, readily dissolve in water and are removed by precipitation (rain). For example, both methanol and dichloromethane are VOC, but methanol is highly water soluble and is rapidly removed from the atmosphere with rainfall, whereas dichloromethane is hydrophobic and tends to stay in the air. A number of important air pollutants are in the form of particulate matter, popularly called particulates. Particles may be emitted directly to the atmosphere from sources such as power plants emitting fly ash. Or they may be formed by the reactions of gases as occurs when particles characteristic of photochemical smog are formed from hydrocarbon vapors, nitrogen oxides, and oxygen in the atmosphere. Heavy particles tend to settle rapidly and deposit on soil or on the surfaces of plant leaves. Lighter particles tend to stay in the atmosphere longer and travel farther from their sources. Particles of water-soluble materials or with hydrophilic surfaces are readily removed by rainfall and may get into water. 1.9.2 POLLUTANTS IN THE HYDROSPHERE Pollutants may be discharged directly to water or may get into water from the atmosphere or from soil runoff. Both surface water and water under the ground\u2014groundwater\u2014must be considered. Groundwater may pick up pollutants as contaminated surface water that flows from the surface into underground aquifers as part of the process of recharge. Another pollutant source of major concern is leachate from wastes that have been improperly disposed on the surface or in landfi lls. Particularly, soluble (hydrophilic) chemicals have a strong tendency to stay dissolved in water and to move with the flow of surface water or groundwater. More hydrophobic species in water will have a greater tendency to be held on mineral surfaces (in groundwater) or in sediments (in surface water). The tendency of a solute in water to be retained by soil, sediment, or aquifer mineral is expressed by a parameter Kd, commonly called the soil\u2013water partition coefficient and expressed as Cs Kd = (1.3) Cw where Cs is the equilibrium concentration of the contaminant in the solid and Cw is the equilibrium concentration of the contaminant in water. The organic fraction of the solid material in soil, sediments, and even minerals is generally the material with the predominant affinity for organic contaminants. Designating this fraction as foc and the partition coefficient of the organic contaminant for the pure organic solid as Koc, the following holds: Kd = f \u00a5 K (1.4) oc oc This relationship shows that as the fraction of organic sorbent in the solid increases, the effective value of Kd increases as well. 1.9.3 POLLUTANTS IN THE GEOSPHERE The transport of contaminants in the geosphere is largely by movement of groundwater through rock formations composing aquifers. In cases where the aquifer mineral material is composed of fi nely divided matter such as sand, the contaminants in the groundwater are continuously exposed to the mineral surface and may be absorbed by it. Very commonly, however, the aquifer consists of solid rock fragmented by fractures through which groundwater may move rapidly and over long distances. In such a case, contaminants do not have a good opportunity to be taken up by the mineral surface.", "This can result in the rapid appearance of contaminants from an infiltrating water source in well water supplies of drinking water. Numerous cases have occurred in which surface pollution, such as by heavy metals or organic solvents, have rapidly infi ltrated groundwater and moved to a well used as a water source. An interesting case consists of dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) that sink to the bottom of the aquifer and accumulate as pools of material that might get into a water source. 1.10 ENVIRONMENTAL MISCHIEF AND TERRORISM Unfortunately, chemistry has a great deal of potential for wreaking havoc in the hands of those who would do evil deeds. The potential of chemistry to cause harm in the wrong hands comes to mind in considering terrorism. The terrorists\u2019 favorite weapons, explosives, act by means of very rapid chemical reactions that very rapidly release large amounts of energy and heat. Another potentially deadly terrorist tool consists of toxic substances made by chemists. Some of these, such as hydrogen cyanide, are used industrially. Others, such as deadly nerve gases, are made specifically for military poisons. But chemistry also works to thwart terrorism, for example, by the use of very sensitive analytical techniques that can detect threats, such as explosives or toxic chemicals. Environmental chemistry certainly has a strong connection to understanding and combating terrorism. It is not much of an exaggeration to consider widespread environmental harm, such as that inflicted by the improper use of chemicals and chemical processes, as a form of terrorism. It takes no great stretch of the imagination to believe that a crowded urban area afflicted with smoke, gasoline fumes, nitrogen oxides, and ozone is under a form of terrorist attack. Some of the great environmental catastrophes, such as the release of methyl isocyanate in Bhopal, India, in 1984 that killed 3500 people, or the catastrophic explosion and fi re of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the former Soviet Union in 1986, have resembled terrorist attacks in their development and effects. So did a release of natural gas containing deadly hydrogen sulfide and accompanying fire from a natural gas well in China in December 2003, killing almost 200 people. Such attacks can take the form of environmental damage to water supplies or soil. The study of unfortunate environmental catastrophes of the past can provide guidance in dealing with terrorist attacks in the future. 1.10.1 PROTECTION THROUGH GREEN CHEMISTRY AND ENGINEERING The single best way that chemical science can avoid terrorist threats is to follow the precepts of green chemistry, a topic that is developed further in Chapter 2 and later in this book. This is so because green chemistry is safe chemistry and sustainable chemistry. Green chemistry avoids the hazards that might be turned to malevolent ends. Sustainable chemistry means that the chemical industry and other enterprises that depend upon it are resistant to disruptive incidents such as those that could cause problems when supplies of essential raw materials are curtailed. Green chemistry avoids the use or generation of substances that pose hazards to humans and the environment. When such substances are not made or used, they are simply unavailable for theft or diversion by criminal elements. Green chemical products are as effective as possible for their designated purpose, but with minimum toxicity. Chemical products that do what they are supposed to do when used in minimum quantities reduce the hazards posed by potential improper use. Green chemistry minimizes or avoids the use of auxiliary substances. These may include materials, such as fl ammable solvents, that may be hazardous, so reducing or minimizing their use can increase safety. Green chemistry avoids the use or generation of substances that are likely to react violently, burn, build up excessive pressures, or otherwise cause unforeseen incidents in the manufacturing process; the safety aspects of avoiding such substances are obvious. Green chemistry attempts to minimize the severity of conditions, particularly those of temperature and pressure, under which chemical processing is c arried out. This can have the effect of greatly reducing damage that would occur through damage to chemical reactors and other processing equipment in the event of a malfunction. The practice of green chemistry minimizes energy consumption. One way in which this is done is to use biological processes, which, because of the conditions under which organisms grow and their enzymes function, must occur at moderate temperatures and in the absence of toxic substances, thereby enhancing safety.", "Any measures that reduce the dependence on potentially hostile foreign sources of energy indirectly reduce vulnerability to terrorism. The same principle applies to reduced use of critical raw materials by the application of green chemistry. The successful practice of green chemistry requires real-time, in-process monitoring techniques coupled with process control. Such a control is consistent with minimizing hazards including those caused by sabotage. It should be noted that passive systems of safety should be employed that will work by default if intricate control systems fail or are damaged (e.g., passive cooling of nuclear reactors by water flowing under gravity in the event of cooling system malfunction). It should be noted that the chemical industry and related enterprises are taking steps to implement the practice of green chemistry to reduce vulnerabilities to attack. For example, manufacturing operations that once stored highly toxic methyl isocyanate, the agent of the catastrophic 1984 Bhopal, India, disaster, now make this material on demand as needed at the plant. Some water treatment plants that used to store reactive, toxic liquid chlorine disinfectant under pressure in 90-ton rail cars located on site have replaced it with much safer solid sodium hypochlorite. 1.11 ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS Environmental forensics is the science that deals with the legal and medical aspects of environmental pollution.8 It is an important area because of the health effects of pollutants and because often large sums of money are at stake in lawsuits aimed at determining parties responsible for environmental contamination, such as hazardous waste sites. Furthermore, environmental forensics can be used for determining parties responsible for terrorist attacks that had used chemical agents. This discipline studies the sources, transport, and effects of pollutants with the goal of determining parties responsible for pollution and harmful environmental events. Important aspects are the source, timing, or extent of an environmental incident. Typically, in cases where hazardous chemical wastes are improperly disposed, soil and groundwater are examined to determine the site history through studies of groundwater flow, groundwater chemical and physical analyses, and modeling. The chemical analysis of groundwater can provide a fingerprint of the source of pollution leading to knowledge of its location and extent, often pointing the way to parties responsible for it. In addition to chemical analysis, other disciplines that may be involved include chemical use history (which can help establish a time frame for when the contamination occurred), geology and forensic geochemistry, hydrogeology, and historical aerial photo interpretation. Computerized contaminant transport modeling of complex subsurface environments can also be very useful. As discussed later in this book, the renovation of land areas damaged by chemical pollution\u2014the restoration of so-called brownfields\u2014is an important aspect of sustainability. Before a brownfi eld land area that has been damaged by dumping of wastes can be restored and used for commercial or residential applications, the nature and extent of contamination must be assessed and measures must be taken to remove or neutralize any hazardous material, in some cases with charges addressed to parties responsible for the wastes. Environmental forensics has a role to play in these activities. The findings of environmental forensics can reduce the time and costs of legal proceedings leading to negotiated settlements between the parties involved. LITERATURE CITED 1. Baum, R.

These would include such things as constants and conversion factors as well as additional information needed to complete an answer. 1. Under what circumstances does a contaminant become a pollutant? 2. Chemical plants and the chemical industry have been the subject of much concern regarding the potential for terrorist attack. Look up this subject in the Internet and attempt to discern which products and processes pose the greater risks. What is being done to reduce these risks? Can you find reports of any major incidents in which the products of chemical manufacturing have been used for attacks? 3. The argument has been made that nuclear power generation and spent nuclear fuel transport and processing pose less danger of terrorist attacks than do corresponding operations in the chemical industry. Suggest the rationale for such an argument. If criminals were to obtain highly radioactive materials, explain why it might be very difficult for them to do anything with them. 4. Explain how toxicological chemistry differs from environmental biochemistry. 5. Distinguish between the geosphere, lithosphere, and crust of the Earth. Which science deals with these parts of the environment? 6. Define ecology and explain how it relates to at least one of the major biogeochemical cycles, such as the carbon cycle. 7. Although energy is not destroyed, why is it true that the fl ow of useful energy through an environmental system is essentially a one-way process? 8. Describe some ways in which patterns of energy use have \u201cresulted in many of the environmental problems now facing humankind.\u201d 9. Compare nuclear energy to fossil fuel energy sources and defend or refute the statement, \u201cNuclear energy, with modern, safe, and effi cient reactors, is gaining increasing attention as a reliable, environmentally friendly energy source.\u201d 10. The sun powers a cycle of matter that is key to the indirect utilization of solar energy through the medium of water. What is this cycle? How does it enable solar energy to be converted to mechanical energy and ultimately to electrical energy? 11. Using Internet resources, look up the percentages of carbon and hydrogen in natural gas (hint: What is the major hydrocarbon compound in natural gas?), gasoline, and typical bituminous coal and come up with a chemical formula in the form of CHh for each of these fuels, where h will not necessarily be a whole number. Write a chemical reaction for the combustion of each in the form of CHh + h/4O2 \u00c6 h/2H2O. Noting that the combustion of both hydrocarbon-bound C and H produces heat, rank these three kinds of fuels in order from the one that produces the least greenhouse gas CO2 per molecule burned to the one that produces the most. 12. A former industrial site (\u201cbrownfield\u201d) has been chosen for an urban renewal project. It is known to be contaminated with potentially harmful materials released from previous manufacturing operations. Suggest an environmental forensics program that could be used as part of the effort to renovate the site. 13. In China in 2003, the release of gas from a gas well killed about 200 people. To help remedy the problem, the gas was deliberately set on fire.", "What pollutant species (other than CO2) was produced by the fire? Despite generation of this pollutant, why was setting the gas on fire the best emergency measure to take until the well could be capped? 14. In 1995, people in Tokyo were the victims of a terrorist attack using a chemical agent. What were the effects of this attack? What agent was used? 15. What did Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen have to say about the anthrosphere? Name and describe the term that Dr. Crutzen coined pertaining to the anthrosphere. 16. Suppose that each of the molecules in a mole of \u201ccompound X\u201d absorbed a photon of ultraviolet radiation from the sun of wavelength 300 nm to become an energetically \u201cexcited\u201d species (see Chapter 9). Calculate the energy in joules absorbed. 17. As a general rule, the fate and transport of contaminants are controlled by their physical transport and their reactivity. Can these two factors be considered to be entirely separate? Explain. 18. Conventionally, environmental fate and transport are considered in terms of three major environmental compartments: (1) the atmosphere, (2) surface waters, and (3) the terrestrial or subsurface environment. Should the biosphere and anthrosphere be considered as separate compartments? Give arguments for and against doing so. 19. The fate and transport of contaminants is controlled in part by their reactivity. Suggest examples of chemical, biological, and physical reactivity processes. 20. Explain the significance of mass conservation, control volume, and steady state in the mass balance relationship. 21. How may volatility, hydrophobic tendency, and hydrophilic tendency be involved in environmental fate and transport in the atmosphere? 22. A pollutant, \u201cX,\u201d was found to be in equilibrium between soil and water in contact with the soil. Its concentration in the soil was determined to be 0.44 mg/kg of dry soil and its concentration in water was measured as 0.037 mg/L. What is the value of Kd and what are its units? 23. If the soil in the preceding question was 5.2% organic matter and the entire affinity of the soil for \u201cX\u201d was due to organic matter, what is the value of the partition coeffi cient of the organic contaminant for the pure organic solid, Koc? 24. Even though the ability of contaminants to move through solid soil is usually very low, transport of a contaminant from one terrestrial location to another often occurs rather quickly. Explain. 25. Using Internet resources, find at least one case in which criminal penalties have been assessed for environmental pollution and discuss how environmental forensics were used in the case. 2 Chemistry and the Anthrosphere: Environmental Chemistry and Green Chemistry 2.1 ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY In Chapter 1, the environment was defined as consisting of five spheres: the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, the geosphere, the biosphere, and the anthrosphere; that is, water, air, the Earth, life, and those parts of the environment consisting of human constructs and activities. The chemistry of the environment, environmental chemistry, may be defi ned as the study of the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, the geosphere, and the anthrosphere and the effects of human activities thereon. This definition is illustrated for a typical environmental pollutant in Figure 2.1. The pollutant sulfur dioxide is generated during the combustion of sulfur in coal, transported to the atmosphere with flue gas, and oxidized by chemical and photochemical processes to sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid, in turn, falls as acidic precipitation, where it may have detrimental effects such as toxic effects on trees and other plants. Eventually, sulfuric acid is carried by stream runoff to a lake or ocean where its ultimate fate is to be stored in solution in the water or precipitated as solid sulfates. Environmental chemistry is complicated by the continuous and variable interchange of chemical species among various environmental spheres. This complexity is illustrated for sulfur species in Figure 2.1. The sulfur in coal is taken from the geosphere, converted to gaseous sulfur dioxide by an anthrospheric process (combustion), transported and undergoes chemical reactions in the atmosphere, may affect plants in the biosphere, and ends up in a sink in the hydrosphere or back in the geosphere. Throughout this sequence, sulfur takes on several forms including organically bound sulfur or pyrite (FeS2) in coal, sulfur dioxide produced in the combustion of coal, sulfuric acid produced by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, and sulfate salts produced from sulfuric acid when it reaches the geosphere.", "Throughout an environmental system there are variations in temperature, mixing, intensity of solar radiation, input of materials, and various other factors that strongly influence chemical conditions and behavior. Because of its complexity, environmental chemistry must be approached with simplifi ed models. Green chemistry, the practice of chemical science and technology in a nonpolluting, safe, and sustainable manner, and industrial ecology, which treats industrial systems in a manner analogous to natural ecosystems, are discussed in detail later in this chapter and in Chapter 17. Environmental chemistry has a strong connection to both of these disciplines. A major goal of green chemistry is to avoid environmental pollution, an endeavor that requires knowledge of environmental chemistry. The design of an integrated system of industrial ecology must consider the principles and processes of environmental chemistry. Environmental chemistry must be considered in the extraction of materials from the geosphere and other environmental spheres to provide the materials required by industrial systems in a manner consistent with minimum environmental impact. The facilities and processes of an industrial ecology system can be sited and operated for minimal adverse environmental impact if environmental chemistry is considered in their planning and operation. Environmental chemistry clearly points the way to minimize the environmental impacts of the emissions and byproducts of industrial systems, and is very helpful in reaching the ultimate goal of a system of industrial ecology, which is to reduce these emissions and by-products to zero. Environmental chemistry can be divided into several categories. The first of these addressed in this book is aquatic chemistry, which deals with chemical phenomena in water. Various aspects of aquatic chemistry are discussed in Chapters 3 through 8. As the name implies, atmospheric chemistry deals with chemical phenomena in the atmosphere. Atmospheric chemistry is discussed in Chapters 9 through 14. General aspects of the environmental chemistry of the geosphere are discussed in Chapter 15, and soil chemistry is the topic of Chapter 16. The anthrosphere and environmental chemistry are discussed in Chapters 17 through 21. The biosphere related to environmental chemistry is mentioned in various contexts throughout the book as it relates to environmental chemical processes in water and soil. It is the main topic of discussion of Chapters 22 through 24. Toxicological chemistry defi ned as the chemistry of toxic substances with emphasis on their interactions with biologic tissue and living organisms 1 is addressed specifically in Chapters 23 and 24. Analytical chemistry is uniquely important in environmental chemistry. Environmental chemical analysis is discussed in Chapters 25 through 28. 2.2 MATTER AND CYCLES OF MATTER Very much connected with environmental chemistry, cycles of matter, often based on elemental cycles, are of utmost importance in the environment. Global geochemical cycles can be regarded from the viewpoint of various reservoirs, such as oceans, sediments, and the atmosphere, connected by conduits through which matter moves continuously among the hydrosphere, atmosphere, geosphere, biosphere, and, increasingly, the anthrosphere. The movement of a specific kind of matter between two particular reservoirs may be reversible or irreversible. The fluxes of movement for particular kinds of matter vary greatly as do the contents of such matter in a specifi ed reservoir. Most cycles of matter have a strong biotic component, especially through the biochemical processes of plants and microorganisms. The cycles in which organisms participate are called biogeochemical cycles, which describe the circulation of matter, particularly plant and animal nutrients, through ecosystems. Most biogeochemical cycles can be described as elemental cycles involving nutrient elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. As part of the carbon cycle, atmospheric carbon in CO2 is fixed as biomass; as part of the nitrogen cycle, atmospheric N2 is fi xed in organic matter. The reverse of these kinds of processes is mineralization, in which biologically bound elements are returned to inorganic states. Biogeochemical cycles are ultimately powered by solar energy, which is fine-tuned and directed by energy expended by organisms. In a sense, the solar-energy-powered hydrological cycle (Figure 3.1) acts as an endless conveyer belt to move materials essential for life through ecosystems. Cycles of matter are also very much involved with the chemical fate and transport of pollutants discussed in Section 1.8. As shown in Figure 2.2, cycles of matter may be divided into two major categories. Exogenic cycles occur largely on the Earth\u2019s surface and are those in which the element in question spends part of the cycle in the atmosphere\u2014O2 for oxygen, N2 for nitrogen, and CO2 for carbon.", "Endogenic cycles, notably the sulfur cycle, predominantly involve subsurface rocks of various kinds and are without a gaseous component. In general, sediment and soil can be viewed as being shared between the two cycles and constitute the predominant interface between them. All sedimentary cycles involve salt solutions or soil solutions (see Section 16.2) that contain dissolved substances leached from weathered minerals; these substances may be deposited as mineral formations, or they may be taken up by organisms as nutrients. 2.2.1 CARBON CYCLE Carbon circulates through the carbon cycle shown in Figure 2.3. It shows that carbon may be present as gaseous atmospheric CO2, constituting a relatively small but highly significant portion of global carbon. Some of the carbon is dissolved in surface water and groundwater as HCO3\u2212 or Xenobiotics manufacture with petroleumfeedstock molecular CO2 (aq). A very large amount of carbon is present in minerals, particularly magnesium and calcium carbonates such as CaCO3. Photosynthesis fixes inorganic C as biological carbon, represented as {CH2O}, which is a constituent of all life molecules. Another fraction of carbon is fixed as petroleum and natural gas, with a much larger amount as hydrocarbonaceous kerogen (the organic matter in oil shale), coal, and lignite. Manufacturing processes are used to convert hydrocarbons to xenobiotic compounds with functional groups containing halogens, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur. Although a very small amount of total environmental carbon, these compounds are particularly significant because of their toxicological chemical effects. An important aspect of the carbon cycle is that it is the one by which solar energy is transferred to biological systems and ultimately to the geosphere and anthrosphere as fossil carbon and fossil fuels. Organic, or biological, carbon, {CH2O}, is contained in energy-rich molecules that can react biochemically with O2, to regenerate carbon dioxide and to produce energy. This can occur biochemically in an organism through aerobic respiration as shown in Equation 1.2, or it may occur as combustion, such as when wood or fossil fuels are burned. Microorganisms are strongly involved in the carbon cycle, mediating crucial biochemical reactions discussed later in this section. Photosynthetic algae are the predominant carbon-fi xing agents in water; as they consume CO2 to produce biomass, the pH of the water increases, enabling precipitation of CaCO3 and CaCO3 . MgCO3. Biogeochemical processes transform organic carbon fixed by microorganisms to fossil petroleum, kerogen, coal, and lignite. Microorganisms degrade organic carbon from biomass, petroleum, and xenobiotic sources, ultimately returning it to the atmosphere as CO2. Hydrocarbons such as those in crude oil and some synthetic hydrocarbons are degraded by microorganisms. This is an important mechanism for eliminating pollutant hydrocarbons, such as those that are accidentally spilled on soil or in water. Biodegradation also acts to destroy carbon-containing compounds in hazardous wastes. 2.2.2 NITROGEN CYCLE As shown in Figure 2.4, nitrogen occurs prominently in all the spheres of the environment. The atmosphere is 78% elemental nitrogen, N2, by volume and comprises an inexhaustible reservoir of this essential element. Nitrogen, although constituting much less of biomass than carbon or oxygen, is an essential constituent of proteins. The N2 molecule is very stable so that breaking it down into atoms that can be incorporated with inorganic and organic chemical forms of nitrogen is the limiting step in the nitrogen cycle. This does occur by highly energetic processes in lightning discharges that produce nitrogen oxides. Elemental nitrogen is also incorporated into chemically bound forms, or fixed by biochemical processes mediated by microorganisms. The biological nitrogen is mineralized to the inorganic form during the decay of biomass. Large quantities of nitrogen are fi xed synthetically under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions according to the following overall reaction: N + 3H \u00c6 2NH (2.1) 22 3 The production of gaseous N2 and N2O by microorganisms and the evolution of these gases to the atmosphere complete the nitrogen cycle through a process called denitrifi cation. The nitrogen cycle is discussed from the viewpoint of microbial processes in Section 6.11. 2.2.3 OXYGEN CYCLE The oxygen cycle is discussed in Chapter 9 and is illustrated in Figure 9.11. It involves the interchange of oxygen between the elemental form of gaseous O2, contained in a huge reservoir in the atmosphere, and chemically bound O in CO2, H2O, minerals, and organic matter. It is strongly tied with other elemental cycles, particularly the carbon cycle. Elemental oxygen becomes chemically bound by various energy-yielding processes, particularly combustion and metabolic processes in organisms. It is released in photosynthesis.", "This element readily combines with and oxidizes other species such as carbon in the process of aerobic respiration (Reaction 1.2), or carbon and hydrogen in the combustion of fossil fuels such as methane: CH + 2O \u00c6 CO + 2H O (2.2) 42 22 Elemental oxygen also oxidizes inorganic substances such as iron(II) in minerals: 4FeO + O \u2192 2Fe O (2.3) 2 23 A particularly important aspect of the oxygen cycle is stratospheric ozone, O3. As discussed in Chapter 9, Section 9.10, a relatively small concentration of ozone in the stratosphere, more than 10 km high in the atmosphere, filters out ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength range of 220\u2013330 nm, thus protecting life on the Earth from the highly damaging effects of this radiation. The oxygen cycle is completed by the return of elemental O2 to the atmosphere. The only signifi cant way in which this is done is through photosynthesis mediated by plants. The overall reaction for photosynthesis is given in Reaction 1.1. 2.2.4 PHOSPHORUS CYCLE The phosphorus cycle, Figure 2.5, is crucial because phosphorus is usually the limiting nutrient in ecosystems. There are no common stable gaseous forms of phosphorus, so the phosphorus cycle is endogenic. In the geosphere, phosphorus is held largely in poorly soluble minerals, such as hydroxyapatite, a calcium salt, deposits of which constitute the major reservoir of environmental phosphate. Soluble phosphorus from phosphate minerals and other sources such as fertilizers is taken up by plants and incorporated into nucleic acids that make up the genetic material of organisms. Mineralization of biomass by microbial decay returns phosphorus to the salt solution from which it may precipitate as mineral matter. The anthrosphere is a major reservoir of phosphorus in the environment with large quantities of phosphates extracted from phosphate minerals for fertilizer, chemicals, and food additives. Phosphorus is a constituent of some extremely toxic compounds, especially organophosphate insecticides and military poison nerve gases including the infamous Sarin and VX (see Chapter 24). 2.2.5 SULFUR CYCLE The sulfur cycle, which is illustrated in Figure 2.6, is relatively complex in that it involves several gaseous species, poorly soluble minerals, and several species in solution. It is tied with the oxygen cycle in that sulfur combines with oxygen to form gaseous sulfur dioxide, SO2, an atmospheric pollutant, and soluble sulfate ion, SO42\u2212. Among the significant species involved in the sulfur cycle are gaseous hydrogen sulfi de, H2S; volatile dimethyl sulfi de, (CH3)2S, released to the atmosphere by biological processes in the ocean; mineral sulfides, such as PbS; sulfuric acid, H2SO4, the main constituent of acid rain; and biologically bound sulfur in sulfur-containing proteins. Insofar as pollution is concerned, the most signifi cant part of the sulfur cycle is the presence of pollutant SO2 gas and H2SO4 in the atmosphere. The former is a somewhat toxic gaseous air pollutant evolved in the combustion of sulfur-containing fossil fuels. Sulfur dioxide is discussed further as an air pollutant in Chapter 11, and its toxicological chemistry is covered in Chapter 24. The major detrimental effect of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is its tendency to oxidize in the atmosphere to produce sulfuric acid. This species is responsible for acidic precipitation, \u201cacid rain,\u201d discussed as a major atmospheric pollutant in Chapter 14. 2.3 ANTHROSPHERE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY As the source of most environmental pollution, the anthrosphere has a strong connection with environmental chemistry. The anthrosphere may be defined as that part of the environment made or modified by humans and used for their activities. Of course, there are some ambiguities associated with that definition. Clearly, a factory building used for manufacture is part of the anthrosphere as is an ocean-going ship used to ship goods made in the factory. The ocean on which the ship moves belongs to the hydrosphere, but it is clearly used by humans. A pier constructed on the ocean shore and used to load the ship is part of the anthrosphere, but it is closely associated with the hydrosphere and anchored to the geosphere. During most of its time on the Earth, humankind made comparatively little impact on the planet. Simple huts or tents for dwellings, narrow trails worn across the land for movement, and food gathered largely from nature\u2019s sources affected the environment minimally. Even so, there is evidence to suggest that prehistoric humans were beginning to have an impact on nature, probably hunting some species to extinction and burning forests to provide grazing land to attract wild game.", "However, with increasing effect as the industrial revolution developed, and especially during the last century, humans have built structures and modified the other environmental spheres, especially the geosphere, such that it is necessary to consider the anthrosphere as a separate area with a pronounced, sometimes overwhelming influence on the environment as a whole. The influence of the anthrosphere and human activities is so great that some authorities on the environment assert that a transition is under way to a new era, the anthropocene, in which the nature of the Earth\u2019s environment is largely determined by human activities in the anthrosphere. 2.3.1 COMPONENTS OF THE ANTHROSPHERE Like other spheres of the environment, the anthrosphere consists of a number of different parts. These may be categorized by considering where humans live; how they move; how they make or provide the things or services they need or want; how they produce food, fiber, and wood; how they obtain, distribute, and use energy; how they communicate; how they extract and process nonrenewable minerals; and how they collect, treat, and dispose of wastes. With these factors in mind, it is possible to divide the anthrosphere into the following categories (Figure 2.7): \u2022 Structures used for dwellings \u2022 Structures used for manufacturing, commerce, education, and other activities \u2022 Utilities, including water, fuel, and electricity distribution systems, and waste distribution systems, such as sewers \u2022 Structures used for transportation, including roads, railroads, airports, and waterways constructed or modified for water transport \u2022 Structures and other parts of the environment modified for food production, such as fields used for growing crops and water systems used to irrigate the fields \u2022 Machines of various kinds, including automobiles, farm machinery, and airplanes \u2022 Structures and devices used for communications, such as telephone lines or radio transmitter towers \u2022 Structures, such as mines or oil wells, associated with extractive industries From the list given above it is obvious that the anthrosphere is very complex with an enormous potential to affect the environment. Prior to addressing these environmental effects, several aspects of the anthrosphere will be discussed in more detail. 2.4 TECHNOLOGY AND THE ANTHROSPHERE Since the anthrosphere is the result of technology, it is appropriate to discuss technology at this point. Technology refers to the ways in which humans do and make things with materials and energy. In the modern era, technology is to a large extent the product of engineering based on scientifi c principles. Science deals with the discovery, explanation, and development of theories pertaining to interrelated natural phenomena of energy, matter, time, and space. Based on the fundamental knowledge of science, engineering provides the plans and means to achieve specific practical objectives. Technology uses these plans to carry out the desired objectives. Technology has a long history and, indeed, goes back into prehistory to times when humans used primitive tools made from stone, wood, and bone. As humans settled in cities, human and material resources became concentrated and focused such that technology began to develop at an accelerating pace. Technological advances predating the Roman era include the development of metallurgy, beginning with native copper around 4000 bc, domestication of the horse, discovery of the wheel, architecture to enable construction of substantial buildings, control of water for canals and irrigation, and writing for communication. The Greek and Roman eras saw the development of machines, including the windlass, pulley, inclined plane, screw, catapult for throwing missiles in warfare, and water screw for moving water. Later, the water wheel was developed for power transmitted by wooden gears. Many technological innovations, such as printing with wood blocks starting around the year 740 and gunpowder about a century later, originated in China. The 1800s saw an explosion in technology. Among the major advances during this century were widespread use of steam power, steam-powered railroads, the telegraph, telephone, electricity as a power source, textiles, the use of iron and steel in building and bridge construction, cement, photography, and the invention of the internal combustion engine, which revolutionized transportation in the following century. Since about 1900, advancing technology has been characterized by vastly increased uses of energy; much higher speed in manufacturing processes, information transfer, computation, transportation, and communication; automated control; a vast new variety of chemicals; new and improved materials for new applications; and, more recently, the widespread application of computers to manufacturing, communication, and transportation. In transportation, the development of passenger-carrying airplanes has enabled an astounding change in the ways in which people get around and how high-priority freight is moved.", "Rapid advances in biotechnology now promise to revolutionize food production and medical care. The technological advances of the 1900s were largely attributable to two factors. The fi rst of these was the application of electronics, now based on solid state devices, to technology in areas such as communications, sensors, and computers for manufacturing control. The second area largely responsible for modern technological innovations has been based on improved materials. For example, special strong light alloys of aluminum were used in the construction of airliners before World War II and more recently these alloys have been supplanted to a degree by even more advanced composites. Synthetic materials with a significant impact on modern technology include plastics, fiber-reinforced materials, composites, and ceramics. Until fairly recently, technological advances were made largely without heed to environmental impacts. Now, however, the greatest technological challenge is to reconcile technology with environmental consequences. The survival of humankind and of the planet that supports it now requires that the established two-way interaction between science and technology become a three-way relationship including environmental protection and sustainability. 2.4.1 ENGINEERING Engineering uses fundamental knowledge acquired through science to provide the plans and means to achieve specific objectives in areas such as manufacturing, communication, and transportation. There are many engineering specialties including chemical, electrical, environmental, aerospace, agricultural, biomedical, computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), ceramic, industrial, materials, metallurgical, mining, and petroleum engineering. Some other categories of engineering are defi ned below. \u2022 Mechanical engineering, which deals with machines and the manner in which they handle forces, motion, and power \u2022 Electrical engineering dealing with the generation, transmission, and utilization of electrical energy \u2022 Electronics engineering dealing with phenomena based on the behavior of electrons in vacuum tubes and other devices \u2022 Chemical engineering, which uses the principles of chemical science, physics, and mathematics to design and operate processes that generate products and materials \u2022 Civil engineering dealing largely with infrastructure components, such as highways, airports, and water distribution systems \u2022 Environmental engineering involving pollution control, waste treatment, and pollution prevention The role of engineering in constructing and operating the various components of the anthrosphere is obvious. In the past, engineering was often applied without much, if any, consideration of environmental factors. As examples, huge machines designed by mechanical engineers were used to dig up and rearrange the Earth\u2019s surface without regard for the environmental consequences, and chemical engineering was used to make a broad range of products without consideration of the wastes produced. Fortunately, that approach is changing rapidly. Examples of environmentally friendly engineering include machinery designed to minimize noise, much improved energy effi ciency in machines, and the use of earth-moving equipments for environmentally benefi cial purposes, such as restoration of strip-mined lands and construction of wetlands. Effi cient generation, distribution, and utilization of electrical energy based on the principles of electrical engineering constitute one of the most promising avenues of endeavor leading to environmental improvement. Automated factories developed through applications of electronic engineering and controlled by computers can turn out goods with the lowest possible consumption of energy and materials while minimizing air and water pollutants, production of hazardous wastes, and worker exposure to hazards. Chemical factories can be engineered to maximize the most efficient utilization of energy and materials while minimizing waste production. In recent years, environmentally friendly and sustainable engineering have been formalized as green engineering.2 2.5 INFRASTRUCTURE The infrastructure consists of the utilities, facilities, and systems used in common by members of a society and upon which the society depends for its normal function. The infrastructure includes both physical components\u2014roads, bridges, and pipelines\u2014and the instructions\u2014laws, regulations, and operational procedures\u2014under which the physical infrastructure operates. Parts of the infrastructure may be publicly owned, such as the U.S. Interstate Highway System and some European railroads, or privately owned, as is the case with virtually all railroads in the United States. Some of the major components of the infrastructure of a modern society are the following. \u2022 Transportation systems, including railroads, highways, and air transport systems \u2022 Energy-generating and distribution systems \u2022 Buildings \u2022 Telecommunications systems \u2022 Water supply and distribution systems \u2022 Waste treatment and disposal systems, including those for municipal wastewater, municipal solid refuse, and industrial wastes In general, the infrastructure refers to the facilities that large segments of a population must use in common in order for a society to function. In a sense, the infrastructure is analogous to the operating system of a computer.", "A computer operating system determines how individual applications operate and the manner in which they distribute and store the documents, spreadsheets, illustrations, and communications created by the applications. Similarly, the infrastructure is used to move raw materials and power to factories and to distribute and store their output. Just as an outdated, cumbersome computer operating system with a tendency to crash is detrimental to the effi cient operation of a computer, an outdated, cumbersome, broken-down infrastructure, which has become all to common in many countries including the United States, causes society to operate in a very inefficient manner and is subject to catastrophic failure. For a society to be successful, it is of utmost importance to maintain a modern, viable infrastructure. Such an infrastructure is consistent with environmental protection. Properly designed utilities and other infrastructural elements, such as water supply systems and wastewater treatment systems, minimize pollution and environmental damage. Components of the infrastructure are subject to deterioration. To a large extent this is due to natural aging processes. Fortunately, many of these processes can be slowed or even reversed. Corrosion of steel structures, such as bridges, is a big problem for infrastructures; however, use of corrosion-resistant materials and maintenance with corrosion-resistant coatings can virtually stop this deterioration process. The infrastructure is subject to human insult, such as vandalism, misuse, and neglect. Often the problem begins with the design and basic concept of a particular component of the infrastructure. For example, many river dikes destroyed by fl ooding should never have been built because they attempt to thwart to an impossible extent the natural tendency of rivers to fl ood periodically. Technology plays a major role in building and maintaining a successful infrastructure. Many of the most notable technological advances applied to the infrastructure were made from 150 to 100 years ago. By the year 1900, railroads, electric utilities, telephones, and steel building skeletons had been developed. The net effect of most of these technological innovations was to enable humankind to \u201cconquer\u201d or at least temporarily subdue nature. The telegraph and telephone helped to overcome isolation, high-speed rail transport and later air transport conquered distance, and dams were used to control rivers and water flow. The development of new and improved materials, such as stronger, lighter steel structural elements, continues to have a signifi cant influence on the infrastructure. The major challenge in designing and operating the infrastructure in the future will be to use it to work with the environment and to enhance environmental quality to the benefit of humankind. Obvious examples of environmentally friendly infrastructures are state-of-the-art sewage treatment systems, high-speed rail systems that can replace inefficient highway transport, and stack gas emission control systems in power plants. More subtle approaches with a tremendous potential for making the infrastructure more environmentally friendly include employment of workers at computer terminals in their homes so that they do not need to commute, instantaneous electronic mail that avoids the necessity of moving letters physically, and solar electric-powered installations to operate remote signals and relay stations, so that electric power lines do not need to be run to them. Developments in electronics and computers are enabling significant advances in infrastructure. One of the areas in which the influence of modern electronics and computers is most visible is in telecommunications. Dial telephones and mechanical relays were satisfactory in their time, but have been made totally obsolete by innovations in electronics, computer control, and fiber optics. Air transport controlled by a truly modern, state-of-the-art computerized control system can enable present airports to handle many more airplanes safely and efficiently, thus reducing the need for airport construction. Sensors for monitoring strain, temperature, movement, and other parameters can be imbedded in the structural members of bridges and other structures. Information from these sensors can be processed by computers to warn of failure and to aid in proper maintenance. Many similar examples can be cited. 2.5.1 VULNERABLE INFRASTRUCTURE Almost any part of the infrastructure is vulnerable to attack and disruption. In the modern era, an action that disables a segment of infrastructure may cause severe disruptions throughout the system. This is because of vulnerability due to interconnectivity, which is a characteristic of modern electrical, transportation, communications, and other infrastructure systems, the components of which are interconnected and mutually dependent to an extreme degree.", "This was illustrated dramatically on August 14, 2003, when electrical power was abruptly terminated to tens of millions of people in the Northeastern United States and Ontario including the major cities of New York City, Detroit, Cleveland, and Toronto. About 100 powerplants, an astounding 68,100 MW of generating capacity, and dozens of transmission lines were shut down. All of these facilities stopped operations within about 5 min, although the core of the actual event probably occurred within only about 10 s, after which the shutdown was irreversible. The incident that caused the great blackout of August 2003 was so minor that even 2 days later experts were not certain of the actual precipitating event. Although it was quickly established that the event was not a deliberate incident of terrorism or sabotage, it well could have been and it stands as an ominous symbol of the potential of terrorist attacks to disrupt essential infrastructure services. This power failure was an illustration of cascading failures on complex networks. In the case of electrical power, hundreds of generating plants are interconnected by power lines and the load is continually redistributed to meet fluctuating demand. This provides adequate power with much less total capacity and hence lower cost than would be the case if individual power plants had to have extra capacity to provide for fluctuating local demand. The computer Internet works by means of many interconnected computing facilities. Routers on the Internet are programmed to redirect traffic around malfunctioning routers. Modern manufacturing operations depend on \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery of dozens of components. Occasional power outages, Internet failures, and assembly line shutdowns due to the lack of an essential part serve as reminders of the vulnerability of such networks to cascading failures and the ever-present possibility of sabotage in causing such failures. As the complexity of urban infrastructure systems has grown, so has the importance of emergency operations centers in charge of managing damages to the infrastructure that can result in disruption. Historically, these centers have dealt with natural disasters such as tornadoes, fl oods, and earthquakes and they have also handled major fires, explosions, and building collapses caused by human error and design flaws. With increased concern over terrorist threats, however, emergency operations centers have had to become equipped to deal with attacks. Terrorist attacks that may entail highly toxic chemicals, pathogens, or nuclear materials present a special challenge to fi rst responders, who may be put in serious personal danger due to the event. Fortunately, fire and other emergency personnel have long been trained to handle spills and releases of toxic and otherwise hazardous substances. Toxic vapors are almost always associated with fires so that fi re-fighting personnel possess protective and breathing gear that would protect them in case of a chemical attack. Military personnel have been trained to respond to attack with military poisons and have appropriate gear to protect them from such attack. The various elements of the infrastructure are highly connected and interdependent. Perhaps no component is more central to the correct functioning of the other elements of the infrastructure than the electrical supply. Without electricity, water pumping systems fail and water may become unavailable for fi ghting fires. Larger cities with subway systems depend on electricity for moving subway trains. Traffi c light systems require electricity and, without them, traffi c in urban areas quickly disintegrates into chaos and gridlock. Electricity is required to run elevators in large buildings. Buildings can also be regarded as part of the essential infrastructure. And buildings are vulnerable as illustrated most vividly by the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center in New York in which two huge buildings collapsed due to fires from the fuel of impacting aircraft. Other examples illustrating the vulnerability of buildings to attack include the 1995 attack on the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and terrorist attacks on hotels in Mumbai, India, in 2008. Chemistry certainly has a role to play in protecting infrastructure. Materials that resist attack, such as flame-resistant building structural materials, can greatly reduce damage from attack. In general those design characteristics that are consistent with the best practices of environmental chemistry and green chemistry likewise increase the resistance of elements of the infrastructure to attack. Sensitive, portable instruments for the detection of toxic substances and explosives can reduce the hazards of these materials to the infrastructure. 2.6 COMPONENTS OF THE ANTHROSPHERE THAT INFLUENCE THE ENVIRONMENT Several components of the anthrosphere have especially strong influences on the environment.", "They also have enormous potential for modification and improvement to achieve the goal of sustainability. Several of these are mentioned briefl y here. \u2022 Dwellings and buildings: Although much of the world dwells in substandard housing, a large part of the current housing in the United States and other industrialized countries is not in keeping with the best practices of sustainability and has a very high environmental impact. There is a need to locate dwellings closer to where people work and to commercial areas. Homes should be of reasonable size, efficiently laid out, and as energy effi cient as possible. Buildings should be versatile so that they can be converted to alternate uses without destroying the entire structure. Technological advances can be used to make buildings much more environmentally friendly. Advanced window design and effective insulating materials can significantly reduce energy consumption. Modern heating and air conditioning systems operate with a high degree of efficiency. Automated and computerized control of building utilities, particularly those used for cooling and heating, can significantly reduce energy consumption by regulating temperatures and lighting to the desired levels at specific locations and times as needed in the building. \u2022 Transportation: The widespread use of automobiles, trucks, and buses has enormous effects on the environment. Entire landscapes have been entirely rearranged to construct highways, interchanges, and parking lots. Emissions from the internal combustion engines used in automobiles are the major source of air pollution in many urban areas. The automobile has made possible the \u201curban sprawl\u201d that is characteristic of residential and commercial patterns of development in the United States, and in many other industrialized countries as well. Huge new suburban housing tracts and the commercial developments, streets, and parking lots constructed to support them continue to consume productive farmland at a frightening rate. Applications of advanced engineering and technology to transportation can be of tremendous benefit to the environment. Modern rail and subway transportation systems, concentrated in urban areas and carefully connected to airports for longer distance travel, can enable the movement of people rapidly, conveniently, and safely with minimum environmental damage. The telecommuter society, composed of workers who do their work at home and \u201ccommute\u201d through their computers, modems, fax machines, and the Internet connected by way of high-speed communication lines, can signifi cantly relieve the strain on transportation systems and reduce their adverse environmental effects. \u2022 Communications: The major areas to consider with respect to information are its acquisition, recording, computing, storing, displaying, and transmission. All these have been tremendously augmented by recent technological advances. Perhaps the greatest such advance has been that of silicon-integrated circuits. Optical memory consisting of information recorded and read by microscopic beams of laser light has enabled the storage of astounding quantities of information on a single compact disk. The use of optical fibers to transmit information digitally by light has resulted in a comparable advance in the communication of information. The central characteristic of communication in the modern age is the combination of telecommunications with computers called telematics, such as is employed in automatic bank teller machines. An important capability in modern communications is the ability to rapidly and accurately acquire, analyze, and communicate information about the environment. \u2022 Food and agriculture: The environmental impact of agriculture is enormous. One of the most rapid and profound changes in the environment that has ever taken place was the conversion of vast areas of the North American continent from forests and grasslands to cropland, which occurred predominantly during the 1800s. This enabled the production of huge amounts of food but also resulted in damaging water and wind erosion. Recognition of these problems led to intense soil conservation efforts starting around 1900 and continuing to the present. In recent decades, valuable farmland has faced the threat posed by the urbanization of rural areas\u2014urban sprawl\u2014as prime agricultural land has been turned into subdivisions and paved over to create parking lots and streets. Increasing population and higher living standards will put more pressure on the agricultural resources. It is likely that production of synthetic fuels from biomass will also increase the demands on the agricultural sector. Global warming and resulting climate change will likely have profound effects on agriculture. \u2022 Manufacturing: The manufacture of goods carries with it the potential to cause signifi cant air and water pollution and production of hazardous wastes. The earlier in the design and development process that environmental considerations are taken into account, the more \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d a manufacturing process will be.", "Application of the principles of industrial ecology and green chemistry can greatly increase the sustainability of manufacturing. Three relatively new developments that have revolutionized manufacturing and that continue to do so are automation, robotics, and computers. Automation uses automatic devices to perform repetitive tasks such as assembly line operations. Robotics refers to the use of machines to simulate human movements and activities. CAD is employed to convert an idea to a manufactured product, replacing innumerable sketches, engineering drawings, and physical mockups that used to be employed. CAM uses computers to plan and control manufacturing operations, for quality control, and to manage entire manufacturing plants. This increases the efficiency of manufacturing and contributes to sustainability. 2.7 EFFECTS OF THE ANTHROSPHERE ON EARTH The effects of the anthrosphere on Earth have been many and profound. Persistent and potentially harmful products of human activities have been widely dispersed and concentrated in specifi c locations in the anthrosphere as well as other spheres of the environment as the result of human activities. Among the most troublesome of these are toxic heavy metals and organochlorine compounds. Such materials have accumulated in the anthrosphere in painted and coated surfaces, such as organotin-containing paints used to prevent biofouling on boats; under and adjacent to airport runways; under and along highway paving; buried in old factory sites; in landfills; and in materials dredged from waterways and harbors that are sometimes used as landfill on which buildings, airport runways, and other structures have been placed. In many cases, productive topsoil used to grow food has been contaminated with discarded industrial wastes, phosphate fertilizers, and dried sewage sludge containing levels of metals harmful to crops. Some of the portions of the anthrosphere that may be severely contaminated by human activities are shown in Figure 2.8. In some cases the contamination has been so pervasive and persistent that the effects will remain for centuries. Some of the most vexsome environmental and waste problems are due to contamination of various parts of the anthrosphere by persistent and toxic waste materials. Potentially harmful wastes and pollutants of anthrospheric origin have found their way into water, air, soil, and living organisms. For example, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) (Freons) have been released to the atmosphere in such quantities and are so stable that they are now constituents of \u201cnormal\u201d atmospheric air and pose a threat to the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere. Lake sediments, stream beds, and deltas deposited by flowing rivers are contaminated with heavy metals and refractory organic compounds of anthrospheric origin. The most troubling repository of wastes in the hydrosphere is groundwater. Some organisms have accumulated high enough levels of persistent organic compounds or heavy metals to do harm to themselves or to humans who use them as a food source. 2.8 INTEGRATION OF THE ANTHROSPHERE INTO THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT Over the eons of the Earth\u2019s existence, natural processes free from sudden, catastrophic disturbances (such as those that have occurred from massive asteroid impacts, for example) have resulted in a finely tuned balance among the systems composing the Earth\u2019s natural environment. Fortuitously, these conditions\u2014adequate water, moderate temperatures, and an atmosphere that serves as a shield against damaging solar radiation\u2014have resulted in conditions amenable to various life forms. Indeed, these life forms have had a strong impact in changing their own environments. According to the Gaia hypothesis advanced by the British chemist James Lovelock, organisms on the Earth have modified the Earth\u2019s climate and other environmental conditions, such as by regulating the CO2/O2 balance in the atmosphere, in a manner conducive to the existence and reproduction of the organisms. To a degree, the early anthrosphere created by preindustrial humans caused minimal environmental degradation. The relatively harmonious relationship between the anthrosphere and the rest of the environment existed so long as the energy required to alter the environment came mainly from human and animal muscle power. This situation began to change markedly with the introduction of machines, particularly power sources, beginning with the steam engine, that greatly multiplied the capabilities of humans to alter their surroundings. As humans developed their use of machines and other attributes of industrialized civilization, they did so with little consideration of the environment and in a way that was out of synchronization with the other environmental spheres. A massive environmental imbalance has resulted, the magnitude of which has been realized only in recent decades. The most commonly cited manifestation of this imbalance has been pollution of air or water.", "Because of the detrimental effects of human activities undertaken without due consideration of environmental consequences, significant efforts have been made to reduce the environmental impacts of these activities. Figure 2.9 shows three stages of the evolution of the anthrosphere from an unintegrated appendage to the natural environment to a system more attuned to its surroundings. The first approach to dealing with the pollutants and wastes produced by industrial activities\u2014 particulate matter from power plant stacks, sulfur dioxide from copper smelters, and mercury-contaminated wastes from chlor-alkali manufacture\u2014was to ignore them. However, as smoke from uncontrolled factory furnaces, raw sewage, and other by-products of human activities became more troublesome, \u201cend-of-pipe\u201d measures were adopted to prevent the release of pollutants after they were generated. Such measures have included electrostatic precipitators and flue gas desulfurization to remove particulate matter and sulfur dioxide from flue gas; physical processes used in primary sewage treatment; microbial processes used for secondary sewage treatment; and physical, chemical, 3. Close the loop,integrate with thetotal environment FIGURE 2.9 Steps in evolution of the anthrosphere to a more environmentally compatible form. and biological processes for advanced (tertiary) sewage treatment. Such treatment measures are often very sophisticated and effective. Another kind of end-of-pipe treatment is the disposal of wastes in a supposedly safe place. In some cases, such as municipal solid wastes, radioactive materials, hazardous chemicals, power plant ash, and contaminated soil, the disposal of sequestered wastes in a secure location is practiced as a direct treatment process. In other cases, including fl ue-gas desulfurization sludge, sewage sludge, and sludge from chemical treatment of industrial wastewater, disposal is practiced as an adjunct to other end-of-pipe measures. Waste disposal practices later found to be inadequate have spawned an entirely separate end-of-pipe treatment activity called remediation in which discarded wastes are dug up, sometimes subjected to additional treatment, and then placed in a more secure disposal site. Although sometimes unavoidable, the production of pollutants followed by measures taken to control or remediate them to reduce the quantities and potential harmfulness of wastes are not very desirable. Such measures do not usually eliminate wastes and may, in fact, transfer a waste problem from one part of the environment to another. An example of this is the removal of air pollutants from stack gas and their disposal as wastes on land, where they have the potential to cause groundwater pollution. Clearly, it is now unacceptable to ignore pollution and to dump wastes, and the control of pollutants and wastes after they are produced is not a good permanent solution to waste problems. Therefore, it has become accepted practice to \u201cclose the loop\u201d on industrial processes, recycling materials as much as possible and allowing only benign waste products to be released to the environment. 2.8.1 ANTHROSPHERE AND INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY \u201cClosing the loop\u201d on industrial processes is the basis of industrial ecology and one of the most effective ways of integrating the anthrosphere into the total environment. Discussed in detail in Chapter 17, industrial ecology is practiced when industrial enterprises interact in a mutually advantageous manner to produce goods and services with maximum efficiency and with minimum environmental impact. Although practiced in rudimentary forms ever since industrial production began, modern practice of industrial ecology dates from a 1989 article by Frosch and Gallopoulos.3 Industrial ecology is carried out in industrial ecosystems analogous to natural ecosystems. The processing of matter and energy through industrial ecosystems is known as industrial metabolism. The efficient practice of industrial ecology is a crucial aspect of modern environmental chemistry. 2.9 GREEN CHEMISTRY As the modern environmental movement developed since around 1970, enormous progress has been made in environmental quality. This has been done largely through a command and control approach based on laws and regulations. Many of the measures taken to reduce pollution have been \u201cend-ofpipe\u201d measures in which water and air pollutants were produced but removed before discharge to the environment. However, in those countries with good, well-enforced pollution control regulations, most of the easy measures in pollution control have been taken and small additional reductions in pollutant emissions require high expenditures. Furthermore, enforcement is a continuous, expensive, and often litigious challenge. It has become obvious that, to the extent possible, systems are needed that are inherently nonpolluting and sustainable. Starting in the 1990s, this need has been approached through a system known as green chemistry.", "Green chemistry can be defi ned as the sustainable, safe, and nonpolluting practice of chemical science and manufacturing in a manner that consumes minimum amounts of materials and energy while producing little or no waste material. In a word, green chemistry is sustainable chemistry.4 Green chemistry is based on \u201cthe 12 principles of green chemistry\u201d5 addressed below. 1. Minimize or eliminate the need for waste cleanup by emphasizing waste prevention. 2. To the extent possible, all materials involved in making a product should be incorporated into it. This rule involves the key concept of atom economy discussed below. 3. Avoid the use and generation of hazardous substances that may harm humans or the environment. 4. Design and use chemical products that have minimum toxicity. 5. Minimize or eliminate the use of auxiliary substances that do not become part of the final product. Solvents are examples of such substances that should be avoided if possible. 6. Minimize energy consumption. 7. Use renewable raw materials instead of depletable feedstocks. For example, biomass raw material, which can be produced renewably by plants, is preferable to petroleum, of which there is a fi nite supply. 8. In organic synthesis, the use of protecting groups should be avoided because the material used in such groups does not become part of the fi nal product. 9. Reagents should be chosen for maximum selectivity of function. 10. Products that will be released to the environment or discarded as wastes should break down rapidly to innocuous materials. 11. Manufacturing processes should be monitored and controlled in-process and in real time with appropriate computerized systems. 12. Processes and materials that are likely to cause extreme temperatures or pressures or unforeseen incidents such as explosions, runaway reactions, and fires should be avoided. 2.9.1 GREEN SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY Much of what is known as green chemistry to date has been applied to synthetic chemistry, which is involved with the production of new and existing chemical products. In recent times, the costs of making chemical products have come to include substantial expenses beyond those associated with raw materials, energy, production, and marketing. Among these added costs are those of regulatory compliance, treatment and disposal of waste by-products, liability, and, more recently, operation of security measures to provide protection from the threats of terrorism. Ideally, the practice of green chemistry greatly reduces these added costs by avoiding hazardous feedstocks and catalysts, eliminating the generation of dangerous intermediates and by-products, and avoiding severe conditions that might lead to hazards. A key concept of green synthetic chemistry is that of high atom economy. In conventional synthesis, a high yield is obtained when the reaction making the product goes to completion. But even with 100% yield, by-products inherent to the synthesis may be generated posing disposal problems. Atom economy refers to the fraction of all reagents that go into the final product. Ideally, all materials that go into a synthetic process would be incorporated into the product, resulting in 100% atom economy. 2.9.2 RISK REDUCTION Risk reduction is an important goal of any manufacturing process and the products that are generated and marketed. In all cases risks should be minimized to workers, the surrounding community, customers, and the environment as a whole. Risk is a function of hazard and exposure: Risk = F{hazard \u00a5 exposure} (2.4) In past times, emphasis has been placed on reduction of exposure. For example, hazardous still bottoms from the distillation of a toxic insecticide have been placed in \u201csecure\u201d landfills to prevent exposure to the environment. The practice of green chemistry reduces the hazard by substituting insecticides whose synthesis does not generate such hazardous by-products. 2.9.3 SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF GREEN CHEMISTRY During its brief lifetime as a recognized discipline, green chemistry has seen the development of several specific kinds of processes and products that can fairly be deemed to be \u201cgreen.\u201d Since the discipline is still developing, new aspects are recognized each year. Several established specifi c aspects of green chemistry are those listed below. 1. Chemical transformations under mild conditions: Many chemical processes are carried out under conditions of high temperature and high pressure using potentially hazardous catalysts and media (solvents) that may present hazards. Enzymatic transformations using biological catalysts (enzymes) must occur under mild conditions and, wherever possible, are being substituted for more established harsh conditions. 2. Green catalysts: These are catalysts with maximum specificity and efficiency that do not themselves pose major hazards.", "Appropriate catalysts reduce energy and material requirements, decrease the need for separations because of their higher selectivity, and permit the use of less toxic reagents, such as H2O2, in place of more hazardous reagents, such as those containing heavy metals. 3. Solventless processes: Since many of the hazards and environmental problems associated with chemical processes arise from the use of solvents, processes that do not use solvents are favored. 4. Less dangerous and polluting solvents: Benign solvents, especially water, are favored for operations that require solvents. 5. Supercritical fluids: Supercritical carbon dioxide often provides good reaction media and makes product separation easier. 6. Process intensification: Small reactors such as channeled microreactors, spinning disc reactors, and tube-in-tube reactors can concentrate a chemical process in a small volume reducing the hazard posed by reacting large quantities of material in large-volume containers. 7. Electricity: In some cases, addition of electrons (reduction) and removal of electrons (oxidation) can be accomplished with electricity, a mass-less reagent that is cheap (only a few cents per mole) and easy to transport. 8. Renewable feedstocks: The chemical industry is based largely on petroleum feedstocks, which inevitably will become much less available and in short supply. Biomass sources from plants are being developed to substitute for petroleum and natural gas raw materials. 9. Design for degradability: Products that will be released into the environment are being designed for maximum degradability so that any hazard that they might present is transient and eliminated by natural processes. 10. Biodegradable polymers: Polymers used in textiles, plastic bags, and a vast number of other applications are likely to be discarded into the environment. Therefore, these polymers should be biodegradable. Biochemically synthesized polymeric materials including those from carbohydrate feedstocks are especially amenable to biodegradation. 2.9.4 THREE UNDESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHEMICALS: PERSISTENCE, BIOACCUMULATION, AND TOXICITY Green chemistry seeks to avoid substances that are most likely to cause problems in the environment, including those that (1) are persistent, (2) have a strong tendency to undergo bioaccumulation, and (3) are toxic. Basically, these are materials that stay around for a long time; accumulate in organisms, particularly the lipid tissues of animals; and once inside an organism are toxic to the host. Some of the once commonly used organohalide pesticides meet all three of these criteria. Certainly, DDT is persistent in the environment, undergoes biomagnifi cation in the food chain, and is toxic, through interference with reproductive processes, to birds of prey at the top of the food chain. Insecticidal parathion is quite toxic but its danger to the environment is relatively lower because it is readily biodegraded. Through years of careful study and often unfortunate experience, the persistence/bioaccumulation/ toxicity (PBT) characteristics of a number of common chemicals have become well established. The body of knowledge gathered from studies of such chemicals combined with increasingly sophisticated tools relating chemical structures to characteristics of substances has led to new ways to predict which chemicals may be troublesome. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has published a computerized PBT Profiler designed to predict undesirable PBT behavior.6 Although not a substitute for careful experimental study, this tool is helpful in warning of possible problems with new chemicals that may be introduced into the environment. 2.9.5 GREEN CHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY Green chemistry and environmental chemistry are closely linked. In order to develop green chemical processes, environmental chemistry must be carefully considered to know how these processes and their products will affect the environment. Environmental chemistry\u2019s goal of environmental protection can best be accomplished by the implementation of green chemistry. Green chemistry is closely linked with the practice of industrial ecology; both of these topics are discussed in more detail in Chapter 17. LITERATURE CITED 1. Manahan, S.

Calculate the energy in joules absorbed. 3 Fundamentals of Aquatic Chemistry 3.1 IMPORTANCE OF WATER Throughout history, the quality and quantity of water available to humans have been vital factors in determining their well-being. Whole civilizations have disappeared because of water shortages resulting from changes in climate. Even in temperate climates, fluctuations in precipitation cause problems. Devastating droughts and destructive floods are frequent occurrences in many areas of the world. Waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid killed millions of people in the past and still cause great misery in less developed countries. Ambitious programs of dam and dike construction have reduced flood damage, but they have had a number of undesirable side effects in some areas, such as inundation of farmland by reservoirs and failure of unsafe dams. Globally, problems with quantity and quality of water supply remain and in some respects are becoming more serious. These problems include increased water use due to population growth, contamination of drinking water by improperly discarded hazardous wastes (see Chapter 20), and destruction of wildlife by water pollution. Aquatic chemistry, the subject of this chapter, must consider water in rivers, lakes, estuaries, oceans, and underground, as well as the phenomena that determine the distribution and circulation of chemical species in natural waters. Its study requires some understanding of the sources, transport, characteristics, and composition of water.", "The chemical reactions that occur in water and the chemical species found in it are strongly influenced by the environment in which the water is found. The chemistry of water exposed to the atmosphere is quite different from that of water at the bottom of a lake. Microorganisms play an essential role in determining the chemical composition of water. Thus, in discussing water chemistry, it is necessary to consider the many general factors that influence this chemistry. The study of water is known as hydrology and is divided into a number of subcategories. Limnology is the branch of the science dealing with the characteristics of freshwater including biological properties, as well as chemical and physical properties. Oceanography is the science of the ocean and its physical and chemical characteristics. The chemistry and biology of the Earth\u2019s vast oceans are unique because of the ocean\u2019s high salt content, great depth, and other factors. Water and the hydrosphere are crucial in the processes involved with chemical fate and transport in the environment. These include the physical processes of volatilization, dissolution, precipitation, and uptake and release by sediments. The chemical processes involved with chemical fate and transport in water are chemical reactions that result in dissolution or precipitation, hydrolysis, complexation, oxidation\u2013reduction, and photochemical reactions. These processes are very much infl uenced by biochemical phenomena such as bioaccumulation and magnification in food chains and biodegradation. The fate and transport of pollutants in the hydrosphere are very important (Chapter 7). 3.2 WATER: FROM MOLECULES TO OCEANS 3.2.1 SOURCES AND USES OF WATER: THE HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE The world\u2019s water supply is found in the fi ve parts of the hydrologic cycle (Figure 3.1). About 97% of the Earth\u2019s water is found in the oceans. Another fraction is present as water vapor in the atmosphere (clouds). Some water is contained in the solid state as ice and snow in snowpacks, glaciers, and the polar ice caps. Surface water is found in lakes, streams, and reservoirs. Groundwater is located in aquifers underground. There is a strong connection between the hydrosphere, where water is found, and the lithosphere, which is that part of the geosphere accessible to water. Human activities affect both. For example, disturbance of land by conversion of grasslands or forests to agricultural land or intensification of agricultural production may reduce vegetation cover, decreasing transpiration (loss of water vapor by plants) and affecting the microclimate. The result is increased rain runoff, erosion, and accumulation of silt in bodies of water. The nutrient cycles may be accelerated, leading to nutrient enrichment of surface waters. This, in turn, can profoundly affect the chemical and biological characteristics of bodies of water. The water that humans use is primarily fresh surface water and groundwater, the sources of which may differ from each other significantly. In arid regions, a small fraction of the water supply comes from the ocean, a source that will continue to increase as the world\u2019s supply of freshwater dwindles relative to demand. Saline or brackish groundwaters can also be utilized in some areas. In the continental United States, an average of approximately 1.48 \u00a5 1013 L of water fall as precipitation each day, which translates to 76 cm/yr. Of that amount, approximately 1.02 \u00a5 1013 L/day, or 53 cm/yr, are lost by evaporation and transpiration. Thus, the water theoretically available for use is approximately 4.6 \u00a5 1012 L/day, or only 23 cm/yr. At present, the United States uses 1.6 \u00a5 1012 L/day, or 8 cm of the average annual precipitation. This amounts to an almost 10-fold increase from a usage of 1.66 \u00a5 1011 L/day in 1900. Even more striking is the per capita increase from about 40 L/day in 1900 to around 600 L/day now. Much of this increase is accounted for by high agricultural and industrial use, which each account for approximately 46% of total consumption. Municipal use consumes the remaining 8%. Starting around 1980, however, the increase in water use in the United States slowed signifi cantly. This trend, which is illustrated in Figure 3.2, has been attributed to the success of efforts to conserve water, especially in the industrial (including power generation) and agricultural sectors. Conservation and recycling have accounted for much of the decreased use in the industrial sector.", "Irrigation water has been used much more efficiently by replacing spray irrigators, which lose large quantities of water to the action of wind and to evaporation, with irrigation systems that apply water 195019551960196519701975 1980198519901995 Year Industrial, other than electric powerElectric power generation Publicly and privately supplieddomestic and commercial livestockIrrigation FIGURE 3.2 Trends in water use in the United States. (Data from U.S. Geological Survey.) directly to soil. Trickle irrigation systems that apply just the amount of water needed directly to plant roots are especially effi cient. A major problem with water supply is its nonuniform distribution with location and time. As shown in Figure 3.3, precipitation falls unevenly in the continental United States. This causes difficulties because people in areas with low precipitation often consume more water than people in regions with more rainfall. Rapid population growth in the more arid southwestern states of the United States during recent decades has further aggravated the problem. Water shortages are becoming more acute in this region, which contains six of the nation\u2019s 11 largest cities (Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, San Diego, Phoenix, and San Antonio). Other problem areas include Florida, where overdevelopment of coastal areas threatens Lake Okeechobee; the Northeast, plagued by deteriorating water systems; and the High Plains, ranging from the Texas panhandle to Nebraska, FIGURE 3.3 Distribution of precipitation in the continental United States, showing average annual rainfall in centimeters. where irrigation demands on the Ogallala aquifer are causing a drop in the water table steadily with no hope of recharge. These problems are minor, however, in comparison to those in some parts of Africa where water shortages are contributing to real famine conditions. 3.2.2 PROPERTIES OF WATER, A UNIQUE SUBSTANCE Water has a number of unique properties that are essential to life. Some of the special characteristics of water include its polar character, tendency to form hydrogen bonds, and ability to hydrate metal ions. These properties are listed in Table 3.1. 3.2.3 WATER MOLECULE Water\u2019s properties can best be understood by considering the structure and bonding of the water molecule shown in Figure 3.4. The water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom. The three atoms are not in a straight line; instead, as shown above, they form an angle of 105\u00b0. Because of water\u2019s bent structure and the fact that the oxygen atom attracts the negative electrons more strongly than do the hydrogen atoms, the water molecule behaves like a dipole having opposite electrical charges at either end. The water dipole may be attracted to either positively or negatively charged ions. For example, when NaCl dissolves in water as positive Na+ ions and negative Cl- ions, the positive sodium ions are surrounded by water molecules with their negative ends pointed at the ions, and the chloride ions are surrounded by water molecules with their positive ends pointing at the negative ions, as shown in Figure 3.4. This kind of attraction for ions is the reason why water dissolves many ionic compounds and salts that do not dissolve in other liquids. A second important characteristic of the water molecule is its ability to form hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are a special type of bond that can form between the hydrogen in one water molecule and the oxygen in another water molecule. This bonding takes place because the oxygen has a partial negative charge and the hydrogen a partial positive charge. Hydrogen bonds, shown in Figure 3.5 as dashed lines, hold the water molecules together in large groups. Hydrogen bonds also help to hold some solute molecules or ions in solution. This happens when hydrogen bonds form between the water molecules and hydrogen, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms on the solute molecule (see Figure 3.5). Hydrogen bonding also aids in retaining extremely small particles called colloidal particles in suspension in water (see Section 5.4).", "TABLE 3.1 Important Properties of Water Property Effects and Signif cance Excellent solvent Transport of nutrients and waste products, making biological processes possible in aqueous medium Highest dielectric constant of any common liquid High solubility of ionic substances and their ionization in solution Higher surface tension than any other liquid Controlling factor in physiology; governs drop and surface phenomena Transparent to visible and longer wavelength Colorless so that light required for photosynthesis reaches fraction of ultraviolet light considerable depths in bodies of water Maximum density as a liquid at 4\u00b0C Ice floats; vertical circulation in bodies of water Higher heat of evaporation than any other material Determines transfer of heat and water molecules between the atmosphere and bodies of water Higher latent heat of fusion of any common liquid Temperature stabilized at the freezing point of water Higher heat capacity than any other liquid except Stabilization of temperatures of organisms and geographical liquid ammonia regions Water is an excellent solvent for many materials; thus it is the basic transport medium for nutrients and waste products in life processes. The extremely high dielectric constant of water relative to other liquids has a profound effect upon its solvent properties in that most ionic materials are dissociated in water. With the exception of liquid ammonia, water has the highest heat capacity of any liquid or solid, 4.186 J/g/deg (l cal/g/deg). Because of this high heat capacity, a relatively large amount of heat is required to change appreciably the temperature of a mass of water; hence, a body of water can have a stabilizing effect upon the temperature of nearby geographic regions. In addition, this property prevents sudden large changes of temperature in large bodies of water and thereby protects aquatic organisms from the shock of abrupt temperature variations. The extremely high heat of vaporization of water, 2446 J/g at 25\u00b0C, likewise stabilizes the temperature of bodies of water and the surrounding geographic regions. It also influences the transfer of heat and water vapor between bodies of water and the atmosphere. Water has its maximum density at 4\u00b0C, a temperature above its freezing point. The fortunate consequence of this fact is that ice floats, so that few large bodies of water ever freeze solid. Furthermore, the pattern of vertical circulation of water in lakes, a determining factor in their chemistry and biology, is governed largely by the unique temperature\u2013density relationship of water. Hydrogen bonds between 3.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF BODIES OF WATER The physical condition of a body of water strongly influences the chemical and biological processes that occur in water. Surface water occurs primarily in streams, lakes, and reservoirs. Wetlands are flooded areas in which the water is shallow enough to enable growth of bottom-rooted plants. Estuaries are arms of the ocean into which streams fl ow. The mixing of fresh and salt water gives estuaries unique chemical and biological properties. Estuaries are the breeding grounds of much marine life, which makes their preservation very important. Water\u2019s unique temperature\u2013density relationship results in the formation of distinct layers within nonflowing bodies of water, as shown in Figure 3.6. During the summer a surface layer (epilimnion) is heated by solar radiation and, because of its lower density, floats upon the bottom layer, or hypolimnion. This phenomenon is called thermal stratification. When an appreciable temperature difference exists between the two layers, they do not mix but behave independently and have very different chemical and biological properties. Exposed to sunlight, the epilimnion may have a heavy growth of algae. As a result of exposure to the atmosphere and (during daylight hours) because of the photosynthetic activity of algae, the epilimnion contains relatively higher levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) and, generally, is aerobic. In the hypolimnion, bacterial action on biodegradable organic material may cause the water to become anaerobic (lacking DO). As a consequence, chemical species in a relatively reduced form tend to predominate in the hypolimnion. The shear plane, or layer between epilimnion and hypolimnion, is called the metalimnion or thermocline. During autumn, when the epilimnion cools, a point is reached at which the temperatures of the epilimnion and hypolimnion are equal. This disappearance of thermal stratifi cation causes the entire body of water to behave as a hydrological unit, and the resultant mixing is known as overturn. An overturn also generally occurs in the spring. During the overturn, the chemical and physical characteristics of the body of water become much more uniform, and a number of chemical, physical, and biological changes may result.", "Biological activity may increase from the mixing of nutrients. Changes in water composition during overturn may cause disruption in water treatment processes. 3.4 AQUATIC LIFE The living organisms (biota) in an aquatic ecosystem may be classified as either autotrophic or heterotrophic. Autotrophic organisms utilize solar or chemical energy to fix elements from simple, nonliving inorganic material into complex life molecules that compose living organisms. Algae are the most important autotrophic aquatic organisms because they are producers that utilize solar energy to generate biomass from CO2 and other simple inorganic species. Heterotrophic organisms utilize the organic substances produced by autotrophic organisms as energy sources and as the raw materials for the synthesis of their own biomass. Decomposers (or reducers) are a subclass of the heterotrophic organisms and consist of chiefly bacteria and fungi, which ultimately break down material of biological origin to the simple compounds originally fi xed by the autotrophic organisms. The ability of a body of water to produce living material is known as its productivity. Productivity results from a combination of physical and chemical factors. High productivity requires an adequate supply of carbon (CO2), nitrogen (nitrate), phosphorus (orthophosphate), and trace elements such as iron. Water of low productivity generally is desirable for water supply or for swimming. Relatively high productivity is required for the support of fish and to serve as the basis of the food chain in an aquatic ecosystem. Excessive productivity results in decay of the biomass produced, consumption of DO, and odor production, a condition called eutrophication. Life forms higher than algae and bacteria\u2014fi sh, for example\u2014comprise a comparatively small fraction of the biomass in most aquatic systems. The influence of these higher life forms upon aquatic chemistry is minimal. However, aquatic life is strongly influenced by the physical and chemical properties of the body of water in which it lives. Temperature, transparency, and turbulence are the three main physical properties affecting aquatic life. Very low water temperatures result in very slow biological processes, whereas very high temperatures are fatal to most organisms. The transparency of water is particularly important in determining the growth of algae. Turbulence is an important factor in mixing processes and transport of nutrients and waste products in water. Some small organisms (plankton) depend upon water currents for their own mobility. DO frequently is the key substance in determining the extent and kinds of life in a body of water. Oxygen deficiency is fatal to many aquatic animals such as fish. The presence of oxygen can be equally fatal to many kinds of anaerobic bacteria. Biochemical oxygen demand, BOD, discussed as a water pollutant in Section 7.9, refers to the amount of oxygen utilized when the organic matter in a given volume of water is degraded biologically. Carbon dioxide is produced by respiratory processes in water and sediments and can also enter water from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is required for the photosynthetic production of biomass by algae and, in some cases, is a limiting factor. High levels of carbon dioxide produced by the d egradation of organic matter in water can cause excessive algal growth and biomass productivity. The salinity of water also determines the kinds of life forms present. Irrigation waters may pick up harmful levels of salt. Marine life obviously requires or tolerates salt water, whereas many freshwater organisms are intolerant of salt. 3.5 INTRODUCTION TO AQUATIC CHEMISTRY To understand water pollution, it is first necessary to have an appreciation of chemical phenomena that occur in water. The remaining sections of this chapter discuss aquatic acid\u2013base and complexation phenomena. Oxidation\u2013reduction reactions and equilibria are discussed in Chapter 4, and the details of solubility calculations and interactions between liquid water and other phases are given in Chapter 5. The main categories of aquatic chemical phenomena are illustrated in Figure 3.7. Aquatic environmental chemical phenomena involve processes familiar to chemists, including acid\u2013base, solubility, oxidation\u2013reduction, and complexation reactions.1 Although most aquatic chemical phenomena are discussed here from the thermodynamic (equilibrium) viewpoint, it is important to keep in mind that reaction rates (kinetics) are very important in aquatic chemistry. Biological processes play a key role in aquatic chemistry. For example, algae undergoing photo - synthesis can raise the pH of water by removing aqueous CO2, thereby converting an HCO3 ion to a CO32- ion; this ion in turn reacts with Ca2+ in water to precipitate CaCO3. Compared with the carefully controlled conditions of the laboratory, it is much more diffi cult to describe chemical phenomena in natural water systems.", "Such systems are very complex and a description of their chemistry must take many variables into consideration. In addition to water, these systems contain Gas exchange with the atmosphere mineral phases, gas phases, and organisms. As open, dynamic systems, they have variable inputs and outputs of energy and mass. Therefore, except under unusual circumstances, a true equilibrium condition is not obtained, although an approximately steady-state aquatic system frequently exists. Most metals found in natural waters do not exist as simple hydrated cations in the water, and oxyanions often are found as polynuclear species, rather than as simple monomers. The nature of chemical species in water containing bacteria or algae is strongly influenced by the action of these organisms. Thus, an exact description of the chemistry of a natural water system based upon acid\u2013base, solubility, and complexation equilibrium constants, redox potential, pH, and other chemical parameters is not possible. Therefore, the systems must be described by simplifi ed models, often based around equilibrium chemical concepts. Though not exact, nor entirely realistic, such models can yield useful generalizations and insights pertaining to the nature of aquatic chemical processes, and provide guidelines for the description and measurement of natural water systems. Though greatly simplified, such models are very helpful in visualizing the conditions that determine chemical species and their reactions in natural waters and wastewaters. 3.6 GASES IN WATER Dissolved gases\u2014O2 for fish and CO2 for photosynthetic algae\u2014are crucial to the welfare of living species in water. Some gases in water can also cause problems, such as the death of fi sh from bubbles of nitrogen formed in the blood caused by exposure to water supersaturated with N2. Volcanic carbon dioxide evolved from supersaturated dissolved CO2 in the waters of Lake Nyos in the African country of Cameroon asphyxiated 1700 people in 1986. The solubilities of gases in water are calculated with Henry\u2019s law, which states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in contact with the liquid. These calculations are discussed in some detail in Chapter 5. 3.6.1 OXYGEN IN WATER Without an appreciable level of DO, many kinds of aquatic organisms cannot exist in water. DO is consumed by the degradation of organic matter in water. Many fish kills are caused not from the direct toxicity of pollutants but from a defi ciency of oxygen because of its consumption in the bio-degradation of pollutants. Most elemental oxygen comes from the atmosphere, which is 20.95% oxygen by volume of dry air. Therefore, the ability of a body of water to re-oxygenate itself by contact with the atmosphere is an important characteristic. Oxygen is produced by the photosynthetic action of algae, but this process is really not an efficient means of oxygenating water because some of the oxygen formed by photosynthesis during the daylight hours is lost at night when the algae consume oxygen as part of their metabolic processes. When the algae die, the degradation of their biomass also consumes oxygen. The solubility of oxygen in water depends upon water temperature, the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere, and the salt content of the water. It is important to distinguish between oxygen solubility, the maximum dissolved O2 concentration at equilibrium, and DO concentration, which is generally not the equilibrium concentration and is limited by the rate at which oxygen dissolves. The calculation of oxygen solubility as a function of partial pressure is discussed in Section 5.3, where it is shown that the concentration of oxygen in water at 25\u00b0C in equilibrium with air at atmospheric pressure is only 8.32 mg/ L. Thus, water in equilibrium with air cannot contain a high level of DO compared with many other solute species. If oxygen-consuming processes are occurring in the water, the DO level may rapidly approach zero unless some efficient mechanism for the reaeration of water is operative, such as turbulent flow in a shallow stream or air pumped into the aeration tank of an activated sludge secondary waste treatment facility (see Chapter 8). The problem becomes largely one of kinetics, in which there is a limit to the rate at which oxygen is transferred across the air\u2013water interface. This rate depends upon turbulence, air bubble size, temperature, and other factors. If organic matter of biological origin is represented by the formula {CH2O}, the consumption of oxygen in water by the degradation of organic matter may be expressed by the following biochemical reaction: {CH2O} + O2 \u00c6 CO2 + H2O (3.1)", "The mass of organic material required to consume the 8.3 mg of O2 in a liter of water in equilibrium with the atmosphere at 25\u00b0C is given by a simple stoichiometric calculation based on Equation 3.1, which yields a value of 7.8 mg of {CH2O}. Thus, the microorganism-mediated degradation of only 7 or 8 mg of organic material can completely consume the O2 in 1 L of water initially saturated with air at 25\u00b0C. The depletion of oxygen to levels below those that sustain oxic organisms requires the degradation of even less organic matter at higher temperatures (where the solubility of oxygen is less) or in water not initially saturated with atmospheric oxygen. Furthermore, there are no common aquatic chemical reactions that replenish DO; except for oxygen provided by photosynthesis, it must come from the atmosphere. The temperature effect on the solubility of gases in water is especially important in the case of oxygen. The solubility of oxygen in water in equilibrium with atmospheric air decreases from 14.74 mg/L at 0\u00b0C to 7.03 mg/L at 35\u00b0C. At higher temperatures, the decreased solubility of oxygen, combined with the increased respiration rate of aquatic organisms, frequently causes a condition in which a higher demand for oxygen accompanied by lower solubility of the gas in water results in severe oxygen depletion. 3.7 WATER ACIDITY AND CARBON DIOXIDE IN WATER Acid\u2013base phenomena in water involve loss and acceptance of H+ ion. Many species act as acids in water by releasing H+ ion, while others act as bases by accepting H+, and the water molecule itself does both. An important species in the acid\u2013base chemistry of water is bicarbonate ion, HCO3 -, which may act as either an acid or a base: -2-+ HCO3 CO3 + H (3.2) HCO-+ H+ CO (aq) + H O (3.3) 3 22 Acidity as applied to natural water and wastewater is the capacity of the water to neutralize OH-; it is analogous to alkalinity, the capacity to neutralize H+, which is discussed in the next section. Although virtually all water has some alkalinity, acidic water is not frequently encountered, except in cases of severe pollution. Acidity generally results from the presence of weak acids, particularly CO2, but sometimes includes others such as H2PO4 -, H2S, proteins, and fatty acids. Acidic metal ions, particularly Fe3+, may also contribute to acidity. Strong acids are the most important contributors to water pollutant acidity. The term free mineral acid is applied to strong acids such as H2SO4 and HCl in water. Acid mine water is a common water pollutant that contains an appreciable concentration of free mineral acid. Whereas total acidity is determined by titration with base to the phenolphthalein end point (pH 8.2), free mineral acid is determined by titration with base to the methyl orange end point (pH 4.3). As shown by the hydrolysis of hydrated Al3+ below, the acidic character of some hydrated metal ions may contribute to acidity. Some industrial wastes, such as spent steel pickling liquor, contain acidic metal ions and often some excess strong acid. The acidity of such wastes must be measured in calculating the amount of lime or other chemicals required to neutralize the acid. 3+ 2++ Al(H O) Al(H O) OH + H (3.4) 26 25 3.7.1 CARBON DIOXIDE IN WATER The most important weak acid in water is carbon dioxide, CO2. Because of the presence of carbon dioxide in air and its production from microbial decay of organic matter, dissolved CO2 is present in virtually all natural waters and wastewaters. Rainfall from even an absolutely unpolluted atmosphere is slightly acidic due to the presence of dissolved CO2. Dissolution in seawater is an important mechanism for the reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the \u201cgreenhouse\u201d gas that makes the greatest contribution to climate warming. Proposals have been made to pump CO2 from combustion into places in the ocean where seawater is sinking to sequester it from the atmosphere for thousands of years.2 Carbon dioxide, and its ionization products, bicarbonate ion (HCO3 -), and carbonate ion (CO32-), have an extremely important influence upon the chemistry of water. Many minerals are deposited as salts of the carbonate ion. Algae in water utilize dissolved CO2 in the synthesis of biomass. The equilibrium of dissolved CO2 with gaseous carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, CO2(water) CO2(atmosphere) (3.5) and the equilibrium of CO32- ion between aquatic solution and solid carbonate minerals, 2+ 2 MCO3(slightly soluble carbonate salt) M + CO3 (3.6) have a strong buffering effect upon the pH of water.", "Carbon dioxide is only about 0.039% by volume of normal dry air. As a consequence of the low level of atmospheric CO2, water totally lacking in alkalinity (capacity to neutralize H+, see Section 3.8) in equilibrium with the atmosphere contains only a very low level of carbon dioxide. However, the formation of HCO3 - and CO32- greatly increases the solubility of carbon dioxide. High concentrations of free carbon dioxide in water may adversely affect respiration and gas exchange of aquatic animals. It may even cause death and should not exceed levels of 25 mg/L in water. A large share of the carbon dioxide found in water is a product of the breakdown of organic matter by bacteria. Even algae, which utilize CO2 in photosynthesis, produce it through their metabolic processes in the absence of light. As water seeps through layers of decaying organic matter while infiltrating the ground, it may dissolve a great deal of CO2 produced by the respiration of organisms in the soil. Later, as water goes through limestone formations, it dissolves calcium carbonate because of the presence of the dissolved CO2: 2+- CaCO ( )s + CO (aq) + HO Ca + 2HCO (3.7) 322 3 This process is the one by which limestone caves are formed. The implications of the above reaction for aquatic chemistry are discussed in greater detail in Section 3.9. The concentration of gaseous CO2 in the atmosphere varies with location and season; it is increasing by about one part per million (ppm) by volume per year. For purposes of calculation here, the concentration of atmospheric CO2 will be taken as 390 ppm (0.0390%) in dry air. At 25\u00b0C, water in equilibrium with unpolluted air containing 390 ppm carbon dioxide has a CO2(aq) concentration of 1.276 \u00a5 10-5 M (see Henry\u2019s law calculation of gas solubility in Section 5.3), and this value will be used for subsequent calculations. Although CO2 in water is often represented as H2CO3, the equilibrium constant for the reaction CO (aq) + H O H CO (3.8) 2 223 is only around 2 \u00a5 10-3 at 25\u00b0C, so just a small fraction of the dissolved carbon dioxide is actually present as H2CO3. In this text, nonionized carbon dioxide in water will be designated simply as CO2, which in subsequent discussions will stand for the total of dissolved molecular CO2 and undissociated H2CO3. The CO2 -HCO3 --CO32- system in water may be described by the equations, CO (aq) + HO H++ HCO- (3.9) 22 3 [H+ ] [HCO-] -7 K = 3 = 4.45 \u00a5 10, pK = 6.35 (3.10) a1 a1 [CO2] -+ 2 HCO3 H + CO3 (3.11) + 2 [H ] [CO ] 3 -11 K == 4.69 \u00a5 10, pK = 10.33 (3.12) a2 -a2 [HCO3] where pKa = -log Ka. The predominant species formed by CO2 dissolved in water depends upon pH. This is best shown by a distribution of species diagram with pH as a master variable as illustrated in Figure 3.8. Such a diagram shows the major species present in solution as a function of pH. For CO2 in aqueous solution, the diagram is a series of plots of the fractions present as CO2, HCO3 -, and CO32as a function of pH. These fractions, designated as ax, are given by the following expressions: [CO ] a= 2 (3.13) CO -2 2 [CO ] + [HCO ] + [CO ] 2 33 [HCO3 -] a= (3.14) HCO3 --2 [CO ] + [HCO ] + [CO ] 2 33 4 5 6 7 8 9101112 pH -2 FIGURE 3.8 Distribution of species diagram for the CO2\u2013HCO3 \u2013CO3 system in water. [CO2-] a 2-= 3 (3.15) CO3 -2 [CO ] + [HCO ] + [CO ] 2 33 Substitution of the expressions for Ka1 and Ka2 into the a expressions gives the fractions of species as a function of acid dissociation constants and hydrogen ion concentration: [H+ ]2 aCO = (3.16) 2 + 2 + [H ] + K [H ] + Ka1K a1 a2 K [H ]+ a -= a1 (3.17) HCO3 + 2 + [H ] + K [H ] + KK a1 a1a2 KK a1 a2 a 2-= (3.18) CO3 + 2 + [H ] + K [H ] + KK a1 a1a2 Calculations from these expressions show the following: \u2022 For pH signifi cantly below pK , a is essentially 1 a1 CO2 \u2022", "When pH = pK , a =a a1 CO2 HCO3 \u2022 When pH = 1 (pK + pK ), a-is at its maximum value of 0.98 \u2022 When pH = pKa2, a=a 2 a1 a2 HCO3 HCO-2 3 CO3 \u2022 For pH signifi cantly above pK , a is essentially 1 a2 CO32 The distribution of species diagram in Figure 3.8 shows that hydrogen carbonate (bicarbonate) ion (HCO3 -) is the predominant species in the pH range found in most waters, with CO2 predominating in more acidic waters. As mentioned above, the value of [CO2 (aq)] in water at 25\u00b0C in equilibrium with air that is 390 ppm CO2 is 1.276 \u00a5 10-5 M. The carbon dioxide dissociates partially in water to produce equal concentrations of H+ and HCO3 -: CO + H O HCO-+ H+ (3.19) 22 3 - The concentrations of H+ and HCO3 are calculated from Ka1: +-+ 2 [H ] [HCO3] [H ] -7 K = == 4.45 \u00a5 10 (3.20) a1 -5 [CO2] 1.276 \u00a5 10 [H+] = [HCO3 -] = (1.276 \u00a5 10-5 \u00a5 4.45 \u00a5 10-7)1/2 = 2.38 \u00a5 10-6 pH = 5.62 This calculation explains why pure water that has equilibrated with the unpolluted atmosphere is slightly acidic with a pH somewhat below 7. 3.8 ALKALINITY The capacity of water to accept H+ ions (protons) is called alkalinity. Alkalinity is important in water treatment and in the chemistry and biology of natural waters. Frequently, the alkalinity of water must be known to calculate the quantities of chemicals to be added in treating the water. Highly alkaline water often has a high pH and generally contains elevated levels of dissolved solids. These characteristics may be detrimental for water to be used in boilers, food processing, and municipal water systems. Alkalinity serves as a pH buffer and reservoir for inorganic carbon, thus helping us to determine the ability of a water to support algal growth and other aquatic life, so it can be used as a measure of water fertility. Generally, the basic species responsible for alkalinity in water are bicarbonate ion, carbonate ion, and hydroxide ion: HCO-+ H+ CO + H O (3.21) 3 22 2-+ CO3 + H HCO3 (3.22) OH-+ H+ H2O (3.23) Other, usually minor, contributors to alkalinity are ammonia and the conjugate bases of phosphoric, silicic, boric, and organic acids. At pH values below 7, [H+] in water detracts significantly from alkalinity, and its concentration must be subtracted in computing the total alkalinity. Therefore, the following equation is the complete equation for alkalinity in a medium where the only contributors to it are HCO3 -, CO32-, and OH-: [alk] = [HCO3 -] + 2[CO32-] + [OH-] -[H+] (3.24) Alkalinity generally is expressed as phenolphthalein alkalinity, corresponding to titration with - acid to the pH at which HCO3 is the predominant carbonate species (pH 8.3), or total alkalinity, corresponding to titration with acid to the methyl orange end point (pH 4.3), where both bicarbonate and carbonate species have been converted to CO2. It is important to distinguish between high basicity, manifested by an elevated pH, and high alkalinity, the capacity to accept H+. Whereas pH is an intensity factor, alkalinity is a capacity factor. This may be illustrated by comparing a solution of 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 M NaOH with a solution of 0.100 M NaHCO3. The sodium hydroxide solution is very basic, pH 11, but a liter of it will neutralize only 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 mol of acid. The pH of the NaHCO3 solution is 8.34, much lower than that of the NaOH. However, a liter of the sodium bicarbonate solution will neutralize 0.100 mol of acid; therefore, its alkalinity is 100 times that of the more basic NaOH solution. In engineering terms, alkalinity frequently is expressed in units of mg/L of CaCO3, based upon the following acid-neutralizing reaction: CaCO + 2H+ Ca2+ + CO + H O (3.25) 3 22 The equivalent mass of calcium carbonate is one-half its formula mass. Expressing alkalinity in terms of mg/L of CaCO3 can, however, lead to confusion, and the preferable notation for the chemist is equivalents/L (eq/L), the number of moles of H+ neutralized by the alkalinity in a liter of solution. 3.8.1 CONTRIBUTORS TO ALKALINITY AT DIFFERENT PH VALUES Natural water typically has an alkalinity (\u201c[alk]\u201d) of 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 eq/L, meaning that the alkaline solutes in 1 L of the water will neutralize 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 mol of acid.", "The contributions made by different species to alkalinity depend upon pH. This is shown here by calculation of the relative contributions to alkalinity of HCO3 -, CO32-, and OH- at pH 7.0 and 10.0. First, for water at pH 7.0, [OH-] is too low to make any significant contribution to the alkalinity. Furthermore, as shown by Figure 3.8, - at pH 7.0, [HCO3 -] &#2; [CO32-]. Therefore, the alkalinity is due to HCO3 and [HCO3 -] = 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 M. Substitution into the expression for Ka1 shows that at pH 7.0 and [HCO3 -] = 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 M, the value of [CO2 (aq)] is 2.25 \u00a5 10-4 M, higher than the value that arises from water in equilibrium with atmospheric air, but readily reached due to the presence of carbon dioxide from bacterial decay in water and sediments. Consider next the case of water with the same alkalinity, 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 eq/L but with a pH of 10.0. At this higher pH both OH- and CO32- are present at significant concentrations compared with HCO3 and the following may be calculated: [alk] = [HCO3 -] + 2[CO32-] + [OH-] = 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 (3.26) The concentration of CO32- is multiplied by 2 because each CO32- ion can neutralize two H+ ions. The other two equations that must be solved to get the concentrations of HCO3, CO32-, and OH- are -KW 1.00 \u00a5 10-14 -4 [OH ] == = 1.00 \u00a5 10 (3.27) +-10 [H ] 1.00 \u00a5 10 and K [HCO-] 2-a2 3 [CO3 ] =+ (3.28) [H ] Solving these three equations gives [HCO3 -] = 4.64 \u00a5 10-4 M and [CO32-] = 2.18 \u00a5 10-4 M, so the contributions to the alkalinity of this solution are the following: 4.64 \u00a510-4 eq/L from HCO3 -4 -42 2 \u00a5 2.18 \u00a510 = 4.36 \u00a510 eq/L from CO3 1.00 \u00a510-4 eq/L from alk = 1.00 \u00a510-3 eq/L 3.8.2 DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON AND ALKALINITY The values given above can be used to show that at the same alkalinity value the concentration of total dissolved inorganic carbon, [C], [C] = [CO2] + [HCO3 -] + [CO32-] (3.29) varies with pH. At pH 7.0, [C]pH 7 = 2.25 \u00a5 10-4 + 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 + 0 = 1.22 \u00a5 10-3 (3.30) whereas at pH 10.0, [C]pH 10 = 0 + 4.64 \u00a5 10-4 + 2.18 \u00a5 10-4 = 6.82 \u00a5 10-4 (3.31) The calculation above shows that the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration at pH 10.0 is only about half that at pH 7.0. This is because at pH 10.0 major contributions to alkalinity are made by CO32- ion, each of which has twice the alkalinity of each HCO3 - ion, and by OH-, which does not contain any carbon. The lower inorganic carbon concentration at pH 10.0 shows that an initially relatively low pH aquatic system (pH 7.0) can donate dissolved inorganic carbon for use in photosynthesis with a change in pH but none in alkalinity. This pH-dependent difference in dissolved inorganic carbon concentration represents a significant potential source of carbon for algae growing in water, which fix carbon by the overall reactions CO + HO + hn {CH O} + O (3.32) 22 22 and HCO-+ HO + hn {CH O} + OH-+ O (3.33) 32 22 As dissolved inorganic carbon is used up to synthesize biomass, {CH2O}, the water becomes more basic. The amount of inorganic carbon that can be consumed before the water becomes too basic to allow algal reproduction is proportional to the alkalinity. In going from pH 7.0 to pH 10.0, the amount of inorganic carbon consumed from 1.00 L of water having an alkalinity of 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 eq/L is [C]pH 7 \u00a5 1 L -[C]pH 10 \u00a5 1 L = 1.22 \u00a5 10-3 mol -6.82 \u00a5 10-4 mol = 5.4 \u00a5 10-4 mol (3.34) This translates to an increase of 5.4 \u00a5 10-4 mol/L of biomass. Since the formula mass of {CH2O} is 30, the weight of biomass produced amounts to 16 mg/L. Assuming no input of additional CO2, at higher alkalinity more biomass is produced for the same change in pH, whereas at lower alkalinity less is produced. Because of this effect, biologists use alkalinity as a measure of water fertility.", "3.8.3 INFLUENCE OF ALKALINITY ON CO2 SOLUBILITY The increased solubility of carbon dioxide in water with an elevated alkalinity can be illustrated by comparing its solubility in pure water (alkalinity 0) to its solubility in water initially containing 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 M NaOH (alkalinity 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 eq/L). The number of moles of CO2 that will dissolve in a liter of pure water from the atmosphere containing 390 ppm carbon dioxide is Solubility = [CO2 (aq)] + [HCO3 -] (3.35) Substituting values calculated in Section 3.7 gives Solubility = 1.276 \u00a5 10-5 + 2.38 \u00a5 10-6 = 1.514 \u00a5 10-5 M The solubility of CO2 in water, initially 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 M in NaOH, is about 100-fold higher because of uptake of CO2 by the reaction - CO2 (aq) + OH-\u00c6 HCO3 (3.36) so that Solubility = [CO2 (aq)] + [HCO3 -] = 1.276 \u00a5 10-5 + 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 = 1.01 \u00a5 10-3 M (3.37) 3.9 CALCIUM AND OTHER METALS IN WATER The kinds and concentrations of metal ions in water are determined largely by the rocks that the water contacts. Metal ions in water, commonly denoted Mn+, exist in numerous forms. A bare metal ion, Ca2+ for example, cannot exist as a separate entity in water. In order to secure the highest stability of their outer electron shells, metal ions in water are bonded, or coordinated, to other species. These may be water molecules or other stronger bases (electron-donor partners) that might be pr esent. Therefore, metal ions in water solution are present in forms such as the hydrated metal cation M(H2O)xn+. Metal ions in aqueous solution seek to reach a state of maximum stability through chemical reactions including acid\u2013base, 3+ 2++ Fe(H O) Fe(H O) OH + H (3.38) 26 25 precipitation, 3++ Fe(H O) Fe(OH) ( )s + 3H O + 3H (3.39) 26 32 and oxidation\u2013reduction reactions: 2+ -+ Fe(H O) Fe(OH) ( )s + 3H O + e + 3H (3.40) 26 32 These all provide a means through which metal ions in water are transformed to more stable forms. Because of reactions such as these and the formation of dimeric species, such as Fe2(OH)24+, the concentration of simple hydrated Fe(H2O)63+ ions in water is vanishingly small; the same holds true for many other hydrated metal ions dissolved in water. 3.9.1 HYDRATED METAL IONS AS ACIDS Hydrated metal ions, particularly those with a charge of +3 or more, tend to lose H+ ions from the water molecules bound to them in aqueous solution, and fit the definition of Br\u00f6nsted acids, according to which acids are H+ donors and bases are H+ acceptors. The acidity of a metal ion increases with charge and decreases with increasing radius. As shown by the reaction, 3+ 2++ Fe(H O) Fe(H O) OH + H (3.41) 26 25 hydrated iron(III) ion is an acid, a relatively strong one with a Ka1 of 8.9 \u00a5 10-4, so that solutions of iron(III) tend to have low pH values. Hydrated trivalent metal ions, such as iron(III), generally are minus at least one hydrogen ion at neutral pH values or above. For tetravalent metal ions, the completely protonated forms, M(H2O)4 x +, are rare even at very low pH values. Commonly, O2- is coordinated to tetravalent metal ions; an example is the vanadium(IV) species, VO2+. Generally, divalent metal ions do not lose a hydrogen ion at pH values below 6, whereas monovalent metal ions such as Na+ do not act as acids at all, and exist in water solution as simple hydrated ions. The tendency of hydrated metal ions to behave as acids may have a profound effect upon the aquatic environment. A good example is acid mine water (see Chapter 7), which derives part of its acidic character from the acidic nature of hydrated iron(III): 3++ Fe(H O) Fe(OH) ( )s + 3H + 3H O (3.42) 263 2 Hydroxide, OH-, bonded to a metal ion, may function as a bridging group to join two or more metals together as shown by the following dehydration\u2013dimerization process: H O 2Fe(H2O)5OH2+ \u2192 (H2O)5Fe Fe(H2O)44+ + 2(H2O) (3.43) O H Among the metals other than iron(III) forming polymeric species with OH- as a bridging group are Al(III), Be(II), Bi(III), Ce(IV), Co(III), Cu(II), Ga(III), Mo(V), Pb(II), Sc(II), Sn(IV), and U(VI). Additional hydrogen ions may be lost from water molecules bonded to the dimers, furnishing OH-groups for further bonding and leading to the formation of polymeric hydrolytic species.", "If the process continues, colloidal hydroxy polymers are formed and, finally, precipitates are produced. This process is thought to be the general one by which hydrated iron(III) oxide, Fe2 O3 \u00b7 x(H2O) [also called iron(II) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3], is precipitated from solutions containing iron(III). 3.9.2 CALCIUM IN WATER Of the cations found in most freshwater systems, calcium generally has the highest concentration. The chemistry of calcium, although complicated enough, is simpler than that of the transition metal ions found in water. Calcium is a key element in many geochemical processes, and minerals constitute the primary sources of calcium ion in waters. Among the primary contributing minerals are gypsum, CaSO4 \u00b7 2H2O; anhydrite, CaSO4; dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2; and calcite and aragonite, which are different mineral forms of CaCO3. Calcium ion, along with magnesium and sometimes iron(II) ion, accounts for water hardness. The most common manifestation of water hardness is the curdy precipitate formed by soap in hard water. Temporary hardness is due to the presence of calcium and bicarbonate ions in water and may be eliminated by boiling the water: 2+ Ca + 2HCO CaCO ( )s + CO (g) + H O (3.44) 3 322 Increased temperature may force this reaction to the right by evolving CO2 gas, and a white precipitate of calcium carbonate may form in boiling water having temporary hardness. Water containing a high level of carbon dioxide readily dissolves calcium from its carbonate minerals: 2+- CaCO ( )s + CO (aq) + HO Ca + 2HCO (3.45) 322 3 When this reaction is reversed and CO2 is lost from the water, calcium carbonate deposits are formed. The concentration of CO2 in water determines the extent of dissolution of calcium carbonate. The carbon dioxide that water may gain by equilibration with the atmosphere is not sufficient to account for the levels of calcium dissolved in natural waters, especially groundwaters. Rather, the respiration of microorganisms degrading organic matter in water, sediments, and soil, {CHO} +O CO +HO (3.46) 22 22 accounts for the very high levels of CO2 and HCO3 - observed in water and is very important in aquatic chemical processes and geochemical transformations. 3.9.3 DISSOLVED CARBON DIOXIDE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE MINERALS The equilibrium between dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate minerals is important in determining several natural water chemistry parameters such as alkalinity, pH, and dissolved calcium concentration (Figure 3.9). For freshwater, the typical figures quoted for the concentrations of - both HCO 3 and Ca2+ are 1.00 \u00a510-3 M. It may be shown that these are reasonable values when the water is in equilibrium with limestone, CaCO3, and with atmospheric CO2. The concentration of CO2 in water in equilibrium with air has already been calculated as 1.276 \u00a510-5 M. The other - c onstants needed to calculate [HCO3] and [Ca2+] are the acid dissociation constant for CO2: + [H ][HCO3] -7 Ka1 ==4.45 \u00a510 (3.47) [CO2] - the acid dissociation constant of HCO3: + 2 [H ] [CO3 ] -11 Ka2 = -=4.69 \u00a510 (3.48) [HCO3] and the solubility product of calcium carbonate (calcite): Ksp = [Ca2+][CO32-] = 4.47 \u00a510-9 (3.49) The reaction between calcium carbonate and dissolved CO2 is 2+- CaCO ( )s+CO (aq) +HO Ca +2HCO (3.50) 322 3 for which the equilibrium expression is the following: 2+-2 ] [HCO ] sp a1 [Ca KK K\u00a2= 3 ==4.24 \u00a510-5 (3.51) [CO ] 2 Ka2 The stoichiometry of Reaction 3.50 gives a bicarbonate ion concentration that is twice that of calcium. Substitution of the value of CO2 concentration into the expression for K\u00a2 yields values of 5.14 \u00a5 10-4 M for [Ca2+] and 1.03 \u00a5 10-3 for [HCO3 -]. Substitution into the expression for Ksp yields 8.70 \u00a5 10-6 M for [CO32-]. When known concentrations are substituted into the product Ka1Ka2, + 22 [H][CO ] 3 -17 KK == 2.09 \u00a5 10 (3.52) a1 a2 [CO2] a value of 5.54 \u00a5 10-9 M is obtained for [H+] (pH 8.26). The alkalinity is essentially equal to [HCO3 -], which is much higher than [CO32-] or [OH-]. To summarize, for water in equilibrium with solid calcium carbonate and atmospheric CO2, the following concentrations are calculated: [CO2] = 1.276 \u00a5 10-5 M, [Ca2+] = 5.14 \u00a5 10-4 M [HCO3 -] = 1.03 \u00a5 10-3 M, [H+] = 5.54 \u00a5 10-9 M [CO32-] = 8.70 \u00a5 10-6 M, pH = 8.26 Factors such as nonequilibrium conditions, high CO2 concentrations in bottom regions, and increased pH due to algal uptake of CO2 cause deviations from these values.", "Nevertheless, they are close to the values found in a large number of natural water bodies. 3.10 COMPLEXATION AND CHELATION The properties of metals dissolved in water depend largely upon the nature of metal species dissolved in the water. Therefore, speciation of metals plays a crucial role in their environmental chemistry in natural waters and wastewaters. In addition to the hydrated metal ions, for example, Fe(H2O)63+ and hydroxy species such as FeOH(H2O)52+ discussed in the preceding section, metals may exist in water reversibly bound to inorganic anions or to organic compounds as metal complexes. For example, a cyanide ion can bond to dissolved iron(II): 2+-+ Fe(H O) + CN FeCN(H O) + H O (3.53) 26 252 Additional cyanide ions may bond to the iron to form Fe(CN)2, Fe(CN)3 -, Fe(CN)42-, Fe(CN)53-, and Fe(CN)64-, where the water molecules still bound to the iron(II) are omitted for simplicity. This phenomenon is called complexation; the species that binds with the metal ion, CN-, in the example above, is called a ligand, and the product in which the ligand is bound with the metal ion is a co mplex, complex ion, or coordination compound. A special case of complexation in which a ligand bonds in two or more places to a metal ion is called chelation. In addition to being present as metal complexes, metals may occur in water as organometallic compounds containing carbon-to-metal bonds. The solubilities, transport properties, and biological effects of such species are often vastly different from those of the metal ions themselves. Subsequent sections of this chapter consider metal species with an emphasis upon metal complexation, especially chelation, in which particularly strong metal complexes are formed. In the example above, the cyanide ion is a unidentate ligand, which means that it possesses only one site that bonds to a metal ion. Complexes of unidentate ligands are of relatively little importance in solution in natural waters. Of considerably more importance are complexes with chelating agents. A chelating agent has more than one atom that may be bonded to a central metal ion at one time to form a ring structure. Thus, pyrophosphate ion, P2O74-, bonds to two sites on a calcium ion to form a chelate: In general, since a chelating agent may bond to a metal ion in more than one place simultaneously (Figure 3.10), chelates are more stable than complexes with unidentate ligands. Stability tends to increase with the number of chelating sites available on the ligand. Structures of metal chelates take a number of different forms, all characterized by rings in various configurations. The structure of a tetrahedrally coordinated chelate of nitrilotriacetate (NTA) ion is shown in Figure 3.10. The ligands found in natural waters and wastewaters contain a variety of functional groups which can donate the electrons required to bond the ligand to a metal ion. Among the most common of these groups are: O N O\u2013 H O O\u2013 RN: ROP RCO\u2013 C H O Carboxylate Heterocyclic Phenoxide Aliphatic and Phosphate nitrogen aromatic amino These ligands complex most metal ions found in unpolluted waters and biological systems (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and VO2+). They also bind to contaminant metal ions such as Co2+, Ni2+, Sr2+, Cd2+, and Ba2+. Complexation may have a number of effects, including reactions of both ligands and metals. Among the ligand reactions are oxidation\u2013reduction, decarboxylation, hydrolysis, and biodegradation. Complexation may cause changes in oxidation state of the metal and may result in a metal becoming solubilized from an insoluble compound. The formation of insoluble complex compounds removes metal ions from solution. Complexation may strongly influence metals\u2019 adsorption, distribution, transport, and fate as well as biochemical effects including bioavailability, toxicity, and plant uptake.3 Complex compounds of metals such as iron (in hemoglobin) and magnesium (in chlorophyll) are vital to life processes. Naturally occurring chelating agents, such as humic substances and amino acids, are found in water and soil. The high concentration of chloride ion in seawater results in the formation of some chloro complexes. Synthetic chelating agents such as sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), sodium NTA, and sodium citrate are produced in large quantities for use in metal-plating baths, industrial water treatment, detergent formulations, and food preparation. These compounds may enter aquatic systems through waste discharges. O\u2013 3.10.1 OCCURRENCE AND IMPORTANCE OF CHELATING AGENTS IN WATER Chelating agents are common potential water pollutants. These substances can occur in sewage effluent and industrial wastewater such as metal plating wastewater.", "In addition to pollutant sources, there are natural sources of chelating agents. One such chelating agent is ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid, OH Ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid a metabolite of the soil actinomycete, Amycolatopsis orientalis. Unlike a number of common synthetic chelating agents, such as EDTA (see below), ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid is biodegradable and has been used as an extractant for phytoremediation (see Chapter 9, Section 21.9) of sites contaminated with heavy metals. The most important pollutant chelating agents are aminopolycarboxylates, of which the most common examples are NTA (Figure 3.10) and EDTA (structure illustrated at the beginning of Section 3.13). Both EDTA and NTA are common water pollutants.4 Because of their strong bonding to metal ions, the aminopolycarboxylate chelating agents are almost always encountered in the bound form, which has a strong effect on their chemistry and environmental fate and transport. To the extent that EDTA is present in wastewater, it prevents some metals from binding to and settling out with biomass sludge in biological wastewater treatment processes. Therefore, EDTA chelates compose most of the copper, nickel, and zinc in wastewater effluents (most of these metals in excess of strong chelating agents present are incorporated into the sludge). Chelation by EDTA has been shown to greatly increase the migration rates of radioactive 60Co from pits and trenches used by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for disposal of intermediate-level radioactive waste. EDTA was used as a cleaning and solubilizing agent for the decontamination of hot cells, equipment, and reactor components. Analysis of water from sample wells in the disposal pits showed EDTA concentrations of 3.4 \u00a5 10-7 M. The presence of EDTA 12\u201315 years after its burial attests to its low rate of biodegradation. In addition to cobalt, EDTA strongly chelates radioactive plutonium and radioisotopes of Am3+, Cm3+, and Th4+. Such chelates with negative charges are much less strongly sorbed by mineral matter and are vastly more mobile than the unchelated metal ions. Contrary to the above findings, only very low concentrations of chelatable radioactive plutonium were observed in groundwater near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant\u2019s low-level waste disposal well. No plutonium was observed in wells at any significant distance from the disposal well. The waste processing procedure used was designed to destroy any chelating agents in the waste prior to disposal, and no chelating agents were found in the water pumped from the test wells. The fate of radionuclide metal chelates that have been discarded in soil is obviously important. If some mechanism exists to destroy the chelating agents, the radioactive metals will be much less mobile. Although EDTA is only poorly biodegradable, NTA is degraded by the action of Chlatobacter heintzii bacteria. In addition to uncomplexed NTA, these bacteria have been shown to degrade NTA that is chelated to metals, including cobalt, iron, zinc, aluminum, copper, and nickel. Complexing agents in wastewater are of concern primarily because of their ability to solubilize heavy metals from plumbing, and from deposits containing heavy metals. Complexation may increase the leaching of heavy metals from waste disposal sites and reduce the effi ciency with which heavy metals are removed with sludge in conventional biological waste treatment. Removal of chelated iron is difficult with conventional municipal water treatment processes. Iron(III) and perhaps several other essential micronutrient metal ions are kept in solution by chelation in algal cultures. The availability of chelating agents may be a factor in determining growth of algae and plants in water.5 The yellow-brown color of some natural waters is due to naturally occurring chelates of iron. 3.11 BONDING AND STRUCTURE OF METAL COMPLEXES This section discusses some of the fundamentals of complexation in water. A complex consists of a central metal atom to which neutral or negatively charged ligands possessing electron-donor properties are bonded. The complex may be neutral or may have a positive or negative charge. The ligands are contained within the coordination sphere of the central metal atom. Depending upon the type of bonding involved, the ligands within the coordination sphere are held in a definite structural pattern. However, in solution, ligands of many complexes exchange rapidly between solution and the coordination sphere of the central metal ion. The coordination number of a metal atom, or ion, is the number of ligand electron-donor groups that are bonded to it. The most common coordination numbers are 2, 4, and 6. Polynuclear complexes contain two or more metal atoms joined together through bridging ligands, frequently OH, as shown for iron(III) in Reaction 3.43. 3.11.1 SELECTIVITY AND SPECIFICITY IN CHELATION", "Although chelating agents are never entirely specific for a particular metal ion, some complicated chelating agents of biological origin approach almost complete specificity for certain metal ions. One example of such a chelating agent is ferrichrome, synthesized by and extracted from fungi, which forms extremely stable chelates with iron(III). It has been observed that cyanobacteria of the Anabaena species secrete appreciable quantities of iron-selective hydroxamate chelating agents during periods of heavy algal bloom. These photosynthetic organisms readily take up iron chelated by hydroxamate-chelated iron, whereas some competing green algae, such as Scenedesmus, do not. Thus, the chelating agent serves a dual function of promoting the growth of certain cyanobacteria while suppressing the growth of competing species, allowing the cyanobacteria to exist as the predominant species. The production of chelating agents selective for iron(III) has been observed in cyanobacterial Plectonema and Spirulina as well as Chlorella, Scenedesmus, and Porphyrium algae. 3.12 CALCULATIONS OF SPECIES CONCENTRATIONS The stability of complex ions in solution is expressed in terms of formation constants. These can be stepwise formation constants (K expressions) representing the bonding of individual ligands to a metal ion, or overall formation constants (b expressions) representing the binding of two or more ligands to a metal ion. These concepts are illustrated for complexes of zinc ion with ammonia by the following: 2+ 2+ Zn + NH3 ZnNH3 (3.54) [ZnNH2+] K = 3 = 3.9 \u00a5 102 (Stepwise formation constant) (3.55) l2+ [Zn ][NH ]3 2+ 2+ ZnNH + NH Zn(NH ) (3.56) 33 32 [Zn(NH32)2+]2 K == 2.1 \u00a5 10 (3.57) 22+ [ZnNH3 ][NH ]3 2+ 2+ Zn +2NH Zn(NH ) (3.58) 3 32 [Zn(NH32)2+]4 b= =KK =8.2 \u00a510 (Overall formation constant) (3.59) 22+ 2 12 [Zn ][NH ]3 (For Zn(NH3)32+, b3 =K1K2K3 and for Zn(NH3)42+, b4 =K1K2K3K4.) The following sections show some calculations involving chelated metal ions in aquatic systems. Because of their complexity, the details of these calculations may be beyond the needs of some readers, who may choose to simply consider the results. In addition to the complexation itself, consideration must be given to competition of H+ for ligands, competition among metal ions for ligands, competition among different ligands for metal ions, and precipitation of metal ions by various precipitants. Not the least of the problems involved in such calculations is the lack of accurately known values of equilibrium constants to be used under the conditions being considered, a factor that can yield questionable results from even the most elegant computerized calculations. Furthermore, kinetic factors are often quite important. Such calculations, however, can be quite useful to provide an overall view of aquatic systems in which complexation is important, and as general guidelines to determine areas in which more data should be obtained. 3.13 COMPLEXATION BY DEPROTONATED LIGANDS Generally, calculation of complex species concentrations is complicated by competition between metal ions and H+ for ligands. First consider an example in which the ligand has lost all ionizable hydrogen. At pH values of 11 or above, EDTA is essentially all in the completely ionized tetranegative form, Y4-, illustrated below: Consider a wastewater with an alkaline pH of 11 containing copper(II) at a total level of 5.0 mg/L and excess uncomplexed EDTA at a level of 200 mg/L (expressed as the disodium salt, Na2H2C10H12O8N2 \u00b7 2H2O, formula mass 372). At this pH, uncomplexed EDTA is present as ionized Y4-. The questions to be asked are: Will most of the copper be present as the EDTA complex? If so, what will be the equilibrium concentration of the hydrated copper(II) ion, Cu2+? To answer the former question it is first necessary to calculate the molar concentration of uncomplexed excess EDTA, Y4-. Since disodium EDTA with a formula mass of 372 is present at 200 mg/L (ppm), the total molar concentration of EDTA as Y4- is 5.4 \u00a510-4 M. The formation constant K1 of the copper\u2013EDTA complex CuY2-is [CuY2-] K ==6.3 \u00a51018 (3.60) 12+ 4 [Cu ][Y ] The ratio of complexed to uncomplexed copper is 2[CuY] 4--4 18 15 =[Y ]K =5.4 \u00a510 \u00a56.3 \u00a510 =3.3 \u00a510 (3.61) 2+ 1 [Cu ] and, therefore, essentially all of the copper is present as the complex ion. The molar concentration of total copper(II) in a solution containing 5.0 mg/L copper(II) is 7.9 \u00a5 10-5 M, which in this case is essentially all in the form of the EDTA complex. The very low concentration of uncomplexed, hydrated copper(II) ion is given by 2--5 2+ [CuY ] 7.9 \u00a510 -20", "[Cu ] == = 2.3 \u00a510 M (3.62) 4-18 -4 K1[Y ] 6.3 \u00a510 \u00a5 5.4 \u00a510 In the medium described, the concentration of hydrated Cu2+ ion is extremely low compared to total copper(II). Solution phenomena that depend upon the concentration of the hydrated Cu2+ ion (such as a physiological effect or an electrode response) would differ greatly in the medium described, compared to the effect observed if all of the copper at a level of 5.0 mg/L were present as Cu2+ in a more acidic solution and in the absence of complexing agent. The phenomenon of reducing the concentration of hydrated metal ion to very low values through the action of strong chelating agents is one of the most important effects of complexation in natural aquatic systems. 3.14 COMPLEXATION BY PROTONATED LIGANDS Generally, complexing agents, particularly chelating compounds, are conjugate bases of Br\u00f6nsted - acids; for example, glycinate anion, H2NCH2CO2 -, is the conjugate base of glycine, +H3NCH2CO2. Therefore, in many cases hydrogen ion competes with metal ions for a ligand, so that the strength of chelation depends upon pH. In the nearly neutral pH range usually encountered in natural waters, most organic ligands are present in a conjugated acid form. In order to understand the competition between hydrogen ion and metal ion for a ligand, it is u seful to know the distribution of ligand species as a function of pH. Consider nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), commonly designated H3T, as an example. The trisodium salt of this compound is a strong chelating agent that can be used in metal plating, as a detergent phosphate substitute, and in other applications in which strong chelating capability is required. Biological processes are required for NTA degradation, and under some conditions it persists for long times in water. Given the ability of NTA to solubilize and transport heavy metal ions, this material is of potential environmental concern. Nitrilotriacetic acid, H3T, loses hydrogen ion in three steps to form the NTA anion, T3-, the structural formula of which is - The T3- species may coordinate through three -CO2 groups and through the nitrogen atom, as shown in Figure 3.10. Note the similarity of the NTA structure to that of EDTA, discussed in Section 3.13. The stepwise ionization of H3T is described by the following equilibria: HT H++ HT- (3.63) 32 + [H ][H2T ] -2 K == 2.18 \u00a510, pK = 1.66 (3.64) a1 a1 [H T] 3 TABLE 3.2 Fractions of NTA Species at Selected pH Values pH Value \u03b1HT \u03b1HT\u2212\u03b1 2\u2212\u03b1 3\u2212 3 2 HTT pH below 1.0 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 pH = pKa1 0.49 0.49 0.02 0.00 0.16 0.68 0.16 0.00 pH = 1 (pK + pK ) 2 a1 a2 pH = pKa2 0.02 0.49 0.49 0.00 1 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 pH = (pK + pK ) pH = pKa3 0.00 0.00 0.50 0.50 pH above 12 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 2 a1 a3 -+ 2 HT H + HT (3.65) 2 + 2 [H ] [HT ] -3 K == 1.12 \u00a5 10, pK = 2.95 (3.66) a2 -a2 [H2T ] 2-+ 3 HT H + T (3.67) + 3 [H][T ] -11 K == 5.25 \u00a510 ,pK = 10.28 (3.68) a3 2-a3 [HT ] NTA may exist in solution as any one of the four species, H3T, H2T-, HT2-, or T3-, depending upon the pH of the solution. As was shown for the CO2/HCO3 -/CO32- system in Section 3.7 and Figure 3.8, fractions of NTA species can be illustrated graphically by a diagram of the distribution-of-species with pH as a master (independent) variable. The key points used to plot such a diagram for NTA are given in Table 3.2, and the plot of fractions of species (a values) as a function of pH is shown in Figure 3.11. Examination of the plot shows that the complexing anion T3- is the predominant species only at relatively high pH values, much higher than would be usually encountered in natural waters. The HT2- species has an extremely wide range of predominance, however, spanning the entire normal pH range of ordinary freshwaters. 3.15 SOLUBILIZATION OF LEAD ION FROM SOLIDS BY NTA A major concern regarding the widespread introduction of strong chelating agents such as NTA into aquatic ecosystems from sources such as detergents or electroplating wastes is that of possible solubilization of toxic heavy metals from solids through the action of chelating agents.", "Experimentation is required to determine whether this may be a problem, but calculations are helpful in predicting probable effects. The extent of solubilization of heavy metals depends upon a number of factors, including the stability of the metal chelates, the concentration of the complexing agent in the water, pH, and the nature of the insoluble metal deposit. Several example calculations are given here. Consider first the solubilization of lead from solid Pb(OH)2 by NTA at pH 8.0. As illustrated in Figure 3.11, essentially all uncomplexed NTA is present as HT2- ion at pH 8.0. Therefore, the solubilization reaction is Pb(OH)2 (s) + HT2-PbT-+ OH-+ H2O (3.69) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 pH FIGURE 3.11 Plot of fraction of species \u03b1x as a function of pH for NTA species in water. which may be obtained by adding the following reactions: 2+ Pb(OH) ( )s Pb + 2OH (3.70) 2 Ksp = [Pb2+][OH-]2 = 1.61 \u00a5 10-20 (3.71) 2-+ 3 HT H + T (3.67) + 3 [H][T ] -11 Ka3 = 2-= 5.25 \u00a5 10 (3.68) [HT ] 2+ 3- Pb + T PbT (3.72) [PbT-] 11 K== 2.45 \u00a5 10 (3.73) f2+ 3 [Pb ][T ] H++ OH-H2O (3.74) 11 1 == (3.75) +--14 KW [H ][OH ] 1.00 \u00a510 2-- Pb(OH) (2 s) + HT PbT + OH + H2O (3.69) [PbT ][OH ] KKK sp a3 f -5 K= == 2.07 \u00a510 (3.76) [HT2-] KW Assume that a sample of water contains 25 mg/L of N(CH2CO2Na)3, the trisodium NTA salt, with a formula mass of 257. The total concentration of both complexed and uncomplexed NTAs is 9.7 \u00a5 10-5 mmol/mL. Assuming a system in which NTA at pH 8.0 is in equilibrium with solid Pb(OH)2, the NTA may be primarily in the uncomplexed form, HT2-, or in the lead complex, PbT-. The predominant species may be determined by calculating the [PbT-]/[HT2-] ratio from the expression for K, noting that at pH 8.0, [OH-] = 1.00 \u00a5 10-6 M. [PbT-] K 2.07 \u00a510-5 == = 20.7 (3.77) 2---6 [HT ] [OH ] 1.00 \u00a510 Since [PbT-]/[HT2-] is approximately from 20 to 1, most of the NTA in solution is present as the lead chelate. The molar concentration of PbT- is just slightly less than the 9.7 \u00a510-5 mmol/mL total NTA present. The atomic mass of lead is 207, so the concentration of lead in solution is approximately 20 mg/L. This reaction is pH dependent such that the fraction of NTA chelated decreases with increasing pH. 3.15.1 REACTION OF NTA WITH METAL CARBONATE Carbonates are common forms of heavy metal ion solids. Solid lead carbonate, PbCO3, is stable within the pH region and alkalinity conditions often found in natural waters and wastewaters. An example similar to the one in the preceding section may be worked, assuming that equilibrium is established with PbCO3 rather than with solid Pb(OH)2. In this example it is assumed that 25 mg/L of trisodium NTA is in equilibrium with PbCO3 at pH 7.0 and a calculation is made to determine whether the lead will be complexed appreciably by the NTA. The carbonate ion, CO32-, reacts with - H+ to form HCO3. As discussed in Section 3.7, the acid\u2013base equilibrium reactions for the CO2/ HCO3 -/CO32- system are CO (aq) +HO H++HCO- (3.9) 22 3 [H+][HCO3 -] -7 K\u00a2= =4.45 \u00a510 , pK =6.35 (3.10) a1 a1 [CO2] -+ 2 HCO3 H +CO3 (3.11) + 2 [H ] [CO3 ] -11 Ka2\u00a2= -=4.69 \u00a510 (3.12) [HCO3] where the acid dissociation constants of the carbonate species are designated with \u201c \u00a2\u201d to distinguish them from the acid dissociation constants of NTA. Figure 3.8 shows that within a pH range of about 7\u201310 the predominant carbonic species is HCO3 -; therefore, the CO32- released by the reaction - of NTA with PbCO3 will go into solution as HCO3: 2-- PbCO3( )s +HT PbT +HCO3 (3.78) This reaction and its equilibrium constant are obtained as follows: 2+ 2 PbCO3( )s Pb +CO3 (3.79) Ksp (s) = [Pb2+][CO32-] = 1.48 \u00a510-13 (3.80) 2+ 3- Pb +T PbT (3.72) [PbT-] 11 K ==2.45 \u00a510 (3.73) f2+ 3 [Pb ][T ] 2-+ 3 HT H +T (3.67) + 3 [H][T ] -11 K ==5.25 \u00a510 (3.68) a3 2 [HT ] + 2- H + CO3 HCO3 (3.81) 1 [HCO3 -]1 == (3.82) + 2--11 Ka2\u00a2 [H ] [CO3 ] 4.69 \u00a510 2-- PbCO3( )s+ HT PbT + HCO3 (3.78)", "[PbT ][HCO ] KKK 3 spa3 f -2 K= == 4.06 \u00a510 (3.83) [HT2-] K\u00a2a2 From the expression for K, Equation 3.83, it may be seen that the degree to which PbCO3 is solubilized as PbT- depends upon the concentration of HCO3 -. Although this concentration will vary appreciably, the figure commonly used to describe natural waters is a bicarbonate ion concentration of 1.00 \u00a5 10-3, as shown in Section 3.9. Using this value the following may be calculated: [PbT-] K 4.06 \u00a510-2 == = 40.6 (3.84) 2---3 [HT ] [HCO ]3 1.00 \u00a510 Thus, under the given conditions, most of the NTA in equilibrium with solid PbCO3 would be present as the lead complex. As in the previous example, at a trisodium NTA level of 25 mg/L, the concentration of soluble lead(II) would be approximately 20 mg/L. At relatively higher concentrations of HCO3 -, the tendency to solubilize lead would be diminished, whereas at lower concentrations of HCO3 -, NTA would be more effective in solubilizing lead. 3.15.2 EFFECT OF CALCIUM ION UPON THE REACTION OF CHELATING AGENTS WITH SLIGHTLY SOLUBLE SALTS Chelatable calcium ion, Ca2+, which is generally present in natural waters and wastewaters, competes for the chelating agent with a metal in a slightly soluble salt, such as PbCO3. At pH 7.0, the reaction between calcium ion and NTA is 2+ 2--+ Ca + HT CaT + H (3.85) described by the following equilibrium expression: [CaT-][H+]8 -11 -3 K\u00a2= = 1.48 \u00a510 \u00a5 5.25 \u00a510 = 7.75 \u00a510 (3.86) 2+ 2 [Ca ][HT ] The value of K\u00a2 is the product of the formation constant of CaT-, (1.48 \u00a5 108), and Ka3 of NTA, 5.25 \u00a5 10-11. The fraction of NTA bound as CaT- depends upon the concentration of Ca2+ and the pH. Typically, [Ca2+] in water is 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 M. Assuming this value and pH 7.0, the ratio of NTA present in solution as the calcium complex to that present as HT2-is -2+-3 [CaT ] [Ca ] 1.00 \u00a510 -3 = K\u00a2= \u00a5 7.75 \u00a510 = 77.5 (3.87) 2-+ -7 [HT ] [H] 1.00 \u00a510 Therefore, most of the NTA in equilibrium with 1.00 \u00a5 10-3 M Ca2+ would be present as the calcium complex, CaT-, which would react with PbCO3 as follows: -+ 2+ - PbCO3( )s+ CaT + H Ca + HCO3 + PbT (3.88) 2+ - [Ca ][HCO ][PbT ] K\u2264= -3 + (3.89) [CaT ][H ] Reaction 3.88 may be obtained by subtracting Reaction 3.85 from Reaction 3.78, and its equilibrium constant may be obtained by dividing the equilibrium constant of Reaction 3.85 by that of Reaction 3.78: 2-- PbCO3( )s +HT PbT +HCO3 (3.78) 2+ 2--+ -(Ca +HT CaT +H ) (3.85) [CaT-][H+] K\u00a2= =7.75 \u00a510-3 (3.86) 2+ 2 [Ca ][HT ] -+ 2+ - PbCO3( )s +CaT +H Ca +HCO3 +PbT (3.88) K 4.06 \u00a510-2 K\u2264== =5.24 (3.90) K\u00a2 7.75 \u00a510-3 Having obtained the value of K\u00a2\u00a2, it is now possible to determine the distribution of NTA between PbT- and CaT-. Thus, for water containing NTA chelated to calcium at pH 7.0, a concentration of HCO3 - of 1.00 \u00a510-3, a concentration of Ca2+ of 1.00 \u00a510-3, and in equilibrium with solid PbCO3, the distribution of NTA between the lead complex and the calcium complex is [PbT-] [H+]K \u2264 ==0.524 -2+ [CaT ] [Ca ][HCO3] It may be seen that only about one-third of the NTA would be present as the lead chelate, whereas under the identical conditions, but in the absence of Ca2+, approximately all of the NTA in equilibrium with solid PbCO3 was chelated to NTA. Since the fraction of NTA present as the lead chelate is directly proportional to the solubilization of PbCO3, differences in calcium concentration will affect the degree to which NTA solubilizes lead from lead carbonate. 3.16 POLYPHOSPHATES AND PHOSPHONATES IN WATER Phosphorus occurs as many oxoanions, anionic forms in combination with oxygen. Some of these are strong complexing agents. Since about 1930, salts of polymeric phosphorus oxoanions have been used for water treatment, for water softening, and as detergent builders. When used for water treatment, polyphosphates \u201csequester\u201d calcium ion in a soluble or suspended form. The effect is to reduce the equilibrium concentration of calcium ion and prevent the precipitation of calcium carbonate in installations such as water pipes and boilers. Furthermore, when water is softened properly with polyphosphates, calcium does not form precipitates with soaps or interact detrimentally with detergents.", "The simplest form of phosphate is orthophosphate, PO43-: O 3\u2013 P O O O Orthophosphate ion has three sites for attachment of H+. Orthophosphoric acid, H3PO4, has a pKa1 of 2.17, a pKa2 of 7.31, and a pKa3 of 12.36. Because the third hydrogen ion is so difficult to remove from orthophosphate, as evidenced by the very high value of pKa3, very basic conditions are required for PO43- to be present at significant levels in water. It is possible for orthophosphate in natural waters to originate from the hydrolysis of polymeric phosphate species. 3.16.1 POLYPHOSPHATES Pyrophosphate ion, P2O74-, is the first of a series of unbranched chain polyphosphates produced by the condensation of orthophosphate: 3-4- 2PO + HO PO + 2OH (3.91) 42 27 A long series of linear polyphosphates may be formed, the second of which is triphosphate ion, P3O105-. These species consist of PO4 tetrahedra with adjacent tetrahedra sharing a common oxygen atom at one corner. The structural formulas of the acidic forms, H4P2O7 and H5P3O10, are given in Figure 3.12. It is easy to visualize the longer chains composing the higher linear polyphosphates. Vitreous sodium phosphates are mixtures consisting of linear phosphate chains with from 4 to approximately 18 phosphorus atoms each. Those with intermediate chain lengths comprise the majority of the species present. 3.16.2 HYDROLYSIS OF POLYPHOSPHATES All of the polymeric phosphates hydrolyze to simpler products in water. The rate of hydrolysis depends upon a number of factors, including pH, and the ultimate product is always some form of orthophosphate. The simplest hydrolytic reaction of a polyphosphate is that of pyrophosphoric acid to produce orthophosphoric acid: HPO + H O 2H PO (3.92) 4272 34 Researchers have found evidence that algae and other microorganisms catalyze the hydrolysis of polyphosphates. Even in the absence of biological activity, polyphosphates hydrolyze chemically at a significant rate in water. Therefore, there is much less concern about the possibility of polyphosphates binding to heavy metal ions and transporting them than is the case with organic chelating agents such as NTA or EDTA, which must depend upon microbial degradation for their decomposition. 3.16.3 COMPLEXATION BY POLYPHOSPHATES In general, chain phosphates are good complexing agents and even form complexes with alkali-metal ions. Ring phosphates form much weaker complexes than do chain species. The different OH OH OHOH OH HO P OPOH HO POPO POH OO OO O Pyrophosphoric (diphosphoric) acid Triphosphoric acid FIGURE 3.12 Structural formulas of diphosphoric acid and triphosphoric acid. For diphosphoric acid, pKa1 is quite small (relatively strong acid), whereas pKa2 is 2.64, pKa3 is 6.76, and pKa4 is 9.42. For triphosphoric acid, pKa1 and pKa2 values are low, pKa3 is 2.30, pKa4 is 6.50, and pKa5 is 9.24. These values reflect the relative ease of removing H+ from OH groups on P atoms that have no other O- groups compared with those that already have one O- group. chelating abilities of chain and ring phosphates are due to structural hindrance of bonding by the ring polyphosphates. 3.16.4 PHOSPHONATES Phosphonate chelating agents are organic compounds structurally analogous to the aminopolycarboxylate chelating agents such as NTA and EDTA discussed earlier in this chapter. The structural formula of the undissociated acid form of a typical phosphonate chelating agent, nitrilotris(methylenephosphonic) acid, NTMP, is the following: Note the similarity of the structural formula of this compound to NTA discussed earlier in this chapter. The uses of phosphonate chelating agents are increasing steadily for applications that include inhibition of scale and corrosion, metal finishing, cleaning and laundry agents, ore recovery, and petroleum drilling. They are used in agricultural applications and in pulp, paper, and textile production. In part because of the difficulty in determining low levels of these substances in water, their environmental chemistry is not very well known. Although they are not very biodegradable, they interact strongly with surfaces and are removed with the sludge from biological waste treatment. 3.17 COMPLEXATION BY HUMIC SUBSTANCES The most important class of complexing agents that occur naturally are the humic substances. These are degradation-resistant materials formed during the decomposition of vegetation that occur as deposits in soil, marsh sediments, peat, coal, lignite, or in almost any location where large quantities of vegetation have decayed. Humic substances abound in natural waters and soil.6 They are commonly classified on the basis of solubility.", "If a material containing humic substances is extracted with strong base, and the resulting solution is acidified, the products are (a) a nonextractable plant residue called humin; (b) a material that precipitates from the acidified extract, called humic acid; and (c) an organic material that remains in the acidified solution, called fulvic acid. Because of their acid\u2013base, sorptive, and complexing properties, both the soluble and insoluble humic substances have a strong effect upon the properties of water. In general, fulvic acid dissolves in water and exerts its effects as the soluble species. Humin and humic acid remain insoluble and affect water quality through exchange of species, such as cations or organic materials, with water. Humic substances are high-molecular-mass, polyelectrolytic macromolecules. Molecular masses range from a few hundred for fulvic acid to tens of thousands for the humic acid and humin fractions. These substances contain a carbon skeleton with a high degree of aromatic character and with a large percentage of the molecular mass incorporated in functional groups, most of which contain oxygen. The elementary composition of most humic substances is within the following ranges: C, 45\u201355%; O, 30\u201345%; H, 3\u20136%; N, 1\u20135%; and S, 0\u20131%. The terms humin, humic acid, and f ulvic acid do not refer to single compounds but to a wide range of compounds of generally similar origin with many properties in common. Humic substances have been known since before 1800, but their structural and chemical characteristics are still being explained. Some feeling for the nature of humic substances may be obtained by considering the structure of a hypothetical molecule of fulvic acid shown: This structure is typical of the type of compound composing fulvic acid. The compound has a formula mass of 666, and its chemical formula may be represented as C20H15(CO2H)6(OH)5(CO)2. As shown in the hypothetical compound, the functional groups that may be present in fulvic acid are carboxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, alcoholic hydroxyl, and carbonyl. The functional groups vary with the particular acid sample. Approximate ranges in units of milliequivalents per gram of acid are total acidity, 12\u201314; carboxyl, 8\u20139; phenolic hydroxyl, 3\u20136; alcoholic hydroxyl, 3\u20135; and carbonyl, 1\u20133. In addition, some methoxyl groups, -OCH3, may be encountered at low levels. The binding of metal ions by humic substances is one of the most important environmental qualities of humic substances. This binding can occur as chelation between a carboxyl group and a phenolic hydroxyl group, as chelation between two carboxyl groups, or as complexation with a carboxyl group (see Figure 3.13). One of the most significant characteristics of humic substances is their ability to bind with metal cations. Iron and aluminum are very strongly bound to humic substances, whereas magnesium is rather weakly bound. Other common ions, such as Ni2+, Pb2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+, are intermediate in their binding to humic substances. The role played by soluble fulvic acid complexes of metals in natural waters is not well known. They probably keep some of the biologically important transition-metal ions in solution, and are particularly involved in iron solubilization and transport. Yellow fulvic acid-type compounds called Gelbstoffe, and frequently encountered along with soluble iron, are associated with color in water. Insoluble humins and humic acids, effectively exchange cations with water and may accumulate large quantities of metals. Lignite coal, which is largely a humic acid material, tends to remove some metal ions from water. Special attention has been given to humic substances since about 1970, following the discovery of trihalomethanes (THMs, such as chloroform and dibromochloromethane) in water supplies. It is now generally believed that these suspected carcinogens can be formed in the presence of humic substances during the disinfection of raw municipal drinking water by chlorination (see Chapter 8). The humic substances produce THMs by reaction with chlorine. The formation of THMs can be reduced by removing as much of the humic material as possible prior to chlorination. (a) O (b) O (c) O CC C OO O M MO M+ OC O FIGURE 3.13 Binding of a metal ion, M2+, by humic substances (a) by chelation between carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl, (b) by chelation between two carboxyl groups, and (c) by complexation with a carboxyl group. 3.18 COMPLEXATION AND REDOX PROCESSES Complexation may have a strong effect upon oxidation\u2013reduction equilibria by shifting reactions, such as that for the oxidation of lead, 2+ Pb Pb + 2e (3.93) strongly to the right by binding to the product ion, thus cutting its concentration down to very low levels.", "Perhaps more important is the fact that upon oxidation, M + 21 O2 MO (3.94) many metals form self-protective coatings of oxides, carbonates, or other insoluble species that prevent further chemical reaction. Copper and aluminum roofing and structural iron are examples of materials that are thus self-protecting. A chelating agent in contact with such metals can result in continual dissolution of the protective coating so that the exposed metal corrodes readily. For example, chelating agents in wastewater may increase the corrosion of metal plumbing, thus adding heavy metals to effluents. Solutions of chelating agents employed to clean metal surfaces in metal plating operations have a similar effect. LITERATURE CITED 1. Graham, M. C. and J. G.

In units of mol/L/ atm the Henry\u2019s law constant for CO2 is 3.38 \u00a5 10-2 and that of CH4 has a value of 1.34 \u00a5 10-3. At the depth at which the gas was being evolved, the total pressure was 1.10 atm and the temperature was 25\u00b0C, so the vapor pressure of water was 0.0313 atm. Calculate the concentrations of dissolved CO2 and dissolved CH4. 4 Oxidation\u2013Reduction in Aquatic Chemistry 4.1 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OXIDATION\u2013REDUCTION Oxidation\u2013reduction (redox) reactions are those involving changes of oxidation states of reactants. Such reactions are easiest to visualize as the transfer of electrons from one species to another. For example, soluble cadmium ion, Cd2+, is removed from wastewater by reaction with metallic iron. The overall reaction is 2+ 2+ Cd + Fe \u00c6 Cd + Fe (4.1) This reaction is the sum of two half-reactions, a reduction half-reaction in which cadmium ion accepts two electrons and is reduced, Cd2++ 2e -\u00c6 Cd (4.2) and an oxidation half-reaction in which elemental iron is oxidized: 2+ Fe \u00c6 Fe + 2e (4.3) When these two half-reactions are added algebraically, the electrons cancel on both sides and the result is the overall reaction given in Equation 4.1.", "Oxidation\u2013reduction phenomena are highly signifi cant in the environmental chemistry of natural waters and wastewaters. In a lake, for example, the reduction of oxygen (O2) by organic matter (represented by {CH2O}), {CHO} + O \u00c6 CO + HO (4.4) 22 22 results in oxygen depletion, which can kill fish. The rate at which sewage is oxidized is crucial to the operation of a waste treatment plant. Reduction of insoluble iron(III) to soluble iron(II), +-2+ Fe(OH) ( )s + 3H + e \u00c6 Fe + 3H O (4.5) 32 in a reservoir contaminates the water with dissolved iron, which is hard to remove in the water treat - ment plant. Oxidation of NH4 + to NO3 in water NH+ 4 + 2O2 \u00c6 NO3 -+ 2H++ H2O (4.6) converts ammonium nitrogen to nitrate, a form more assimilable by algae in the water. Many other examples can be cited of the ways in which the types, rates, and equilibria of redox reactions largely determine the nature of important solute species in water. This chapter discusses redox processes and equilibria in water. In so doing, it emphasizes the concept of pE, analogous to pH and defined as the negative log of electron activity. Low pE values are indicative of reducing conditions; high pE values reflect oxidizing conditions. Two important points should be stressed regarding redox reactions in natural waters and wastewaters. First, as is discussed in Chapter 6, \u201cAquatic Microbial Biochemistry,\u201d many of the most important redox reactions are catalyzed by microorganisms. Bacteria are the catalysts by which molecular oxygen reacts with organic matter, iron(III) is reduced to iron(II), and ammonia is oxidized to nitrate ion. The second important point regarding redox reactions in the hydrosphere is their close relationship to acid\u2013base reactions. Whereas the activity of the H+ ion is used to express the extent to which water is acidic or basic, the activity of the electron, e -, is used to express the degree to which an aquatic medium is oxidizing or reducing. Water with a high hydrogen-ion activity, such as runoff from \u201cacid rain,\u201d is acidic. By analogy, water with a high electron activity, such as that in the anoxic digester of a sewage treatment plant, is said to be reducing. Water with a low H+ ion activity (high concentration of OH-)\u2014such as landfill leachate contaminated with waste sodium hydroxide\u2014is basic, whereas water with a low electron activity\u2014highly chlorinated water, for example\u2014is said to be oxidizing. Actually, neither free electrons nor free H+ ions as such are found dissolved in aquatic solution; they are always strongly associated with solvent or solute species. However, the concept of electron activity, like that of hydrogen-ion activity, remains a very useful one to the aquatic chemist. Many species in water undergo exchange of both electrons and H+ ions. For example, acid mine water contains the hydrated iron(III) ion, Fe(H2O)63+, which readily loses H+ ion 3+ 2++ Fe(H O) Fe(H O) OH + H 26 25 (4.7) to contribute acidity to the medium. The same ion accepts an electron 3+-2+ Fe(H O) + e Fe(H O) 26 26 (4.8) to give iron(II). Generally, the transfer of electrons in a redox reaction is accompanied by H+ ion transfer, and there is a close relationship between redox and acid\u2013base processes. For example, if iron(II) loses an electron at pH 7, three hydrogen ions are also lost to form highly insoluble iron(II) hydroxide, 2+-+ Fe(H O) e + Fe(OH) ( )s + 3H O + 3H 26 32 (4.9) an insoluble, gelatinous solid. The stratified body of water shown in Figure 4.1 can be used to illustrate redox phenomena and relationships in an aquatic system. The anoxic sediment layer is so reducing that carbon can be reduced to its lowest possible oxidation state, -4 in CH4. If the lake becomes anoxic, the hypolimnion may contain elements in their reduced states: NH4 + for nitrogen, H2S for sulfur, and soluble Fe(H2O)62+ for iron. Saturation with atmospheric oxygen makes the surface layer a relatively oxidizing medium. If allowed to reach thermodynamic equilibrium, it is characterized by the more oxidized forms of the elements present: CO2 for carbon, NO3 - for nitrogen, iron as insoluble Fe(OH)3, and sulfur as SO42-. Substantial changes in the distribution of chemical species in water resulting from redox reactions are vitally important to aquatic organisms and have a tremendous influence on water quality.", "It should be pointed out that the systems presented in this chapter are assumed to be at equilibrium, a state almost never achieved in any real natural water or wastewater system. Most real aquatic systems are dynamic systems that may approach a steady state, rather than true equilibrium. Nevertheless, the picture of a system at equilibrium is very useful in visualizing trends in natural water and wastewater systems, yet the model is still simple enough to comprehend. It is important to realize the limitations of such a model, however, especially in trying to make measurements of the redox status of water. 4.2 ELECTRON AND REDOX REACTIONS In order to explain redox processes in natural waters, it is necessary to have an understanding of redox reactions. In a formal sense such reactions can be viewed as the transfer of electrons between species. This section considers such reactions in a simple system. All redox reactions involve changes in the oxidation states of some of the species that take part in the reaction. Consider, for example, a solution containing iron(II) and iron(III) that is sufficiently acidic to prevent precipitation of solid Fe(OH)3; such a medium might be acid mine water or a steel pickling liquor waste. Suppose that the solution is treated with elemental hydrogen gas over a suitable catalyst to bring about the reduction of iron(III) to iron(II). The overall reaction can be represented as 3+ 2++ 2Fe + H2 2Fe + 2H (4.10) The reaction is written with a double arrow, indicating that it is reversible and could proceed in either direction; for normal concentrations of reaction participants, this reaction goes to the right. As the reaction goes to the right, the hydrogen is oxidized as it changes from an oxidation state (number) of 0 in elemental H2 to a higher oxidation number of +1 in H+. The oxidation state of iron goes from +3 in Fe3+ to +2 in Fe2+; the oxidation number of iron decreases, which means that it is reduced. All redox reactions such as this one can be broken down into a reduction half-reaction, in this case 3+-2+ 2Fe + 2e 2Fe (4.11) 3+-3+ (for one electron, Fe + e Fe ), and an oxidation half-reaction, in this case H2 2H++ 2e - (4.12) Note that adding these two half-reactions together gives the overall reaction. The addition of an oxidation half-reaction and a reduction half-reaction, each expressed for the same number of electrons so that the electrons cancel on both sides of the arrows, gives a whole redox reaction. The equilibrium of a redox reaction, that is, the degree to which the reaction as written tends to lie to the right or left, can be deduced from information about its constituent half-reactions. To visualize this, assume that the two half-reactions can be separated into two half-cells of an electrochemical cell as shown for Reaction 4.10 in Figure 4.2. If the initial activities of H+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ were of the order of 1 (concentrations of 1 M), and if the pressure of H2 were 1 atm, H2 would be oxidized to H+ in the left half-cell, Fe3+ would be reduced to Fe2+ in the right half-cell, and ions would migrate through the salt bridge to maintain electro-neutrality in both half-cells. The net reaction occurring would be Reaction 4.10. If a voltmeter were inserted in the circuit between the two electrodes, no significant current could flow and the two half-reactions could not take place. However, the voltage registered by the voltmeter would be a measure of the relative tendencies of the two half-reactions to occur. In the left half-cell the oxidation half-reaction H2 2H++ 2e - (4.12) will tend to go to the right, releasing electrons to the platinum electrode in the half-cell and giving that electrode a relatively negative (-) potential. In the right half-cell, the reduction half-reaction 3+-2+ 2Fe + e Fe (4.11) will tend to go to the right, taking electrons from the platinum electrode in the half-cell and giving that electrode a relatively positive (+) potential. The difference in these potentials is a measure of the \u201cdriving force\u201d of the overall reaction. If each of the reaction participants were at unit activity, the potential difference would be 0.77 V. The left electrode shown in Figure 4.2 is the standard electrode against which all other electrode potentials are compared. It is called the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).", "This electrode has been assigned a potential value of exactly 0 V by convention, and its half-reaction is written as the following: 2H++ 2e -H2, E0 = 0.00V (4.13) The measured potential of the right-hand electrode in Figure 4.2 versus the SHE is called the electrode potential, E. If the Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions are both at unit activity, the potential is the standard electrode potential (according to IUPAC convention, the standard reduction potential), E 0. The standard electrode potential for the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple is 0.77 V expressed conventionally as follows: 3+-2+ 0 Fe + e Fe , E =+ 0.77V (4.14) 4.3 ELECTRON ACTIVITY AND pE In this book, for the most part, pE and pE0 are used instead of E and E0 to more clearly illustrate redox equilibria in aquatic systems over many orders of magnitude of electron activity in a manner analogous to pH. Numerically, pE and pE0 are simply the following: EE pE == (at 25\u00b0C) (4.15) 2.303RT /F 0.0591 E0 E0 pE0 == (at 25\u00b0C) (4.16) 2.303RT /F 0.0591 where R is the molar gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and F is the Faraday constant. The \u201cpE concept\u201d is explained below. Just as pH is defi ned as pH = -log(aH +) (4.17) where aH + is the activity of hydrogen ion in solution, pE is defi ned as pE = -log(ae -) (4.18) where ae - is the activity of the electron in solution. Since hydrogen-ion concentration may vary over many orders of magnitude, pH is a convenient way of expressing aH + in terms of manageable numbers. Similarly, electron activities in water may vary over more than 20 orders of magnitude so that it is convenient to express ae - as pE. Values of pE are defined in terms of the following half-reaction for which pE0 is defi ned as exactly zero:* +-00 2H (aq) + 2e H2(g), E =+0.00 V, pE = 0.00 (4.19) * Thermodynamically, the free-energy change for this reaction is defined as exactly zero when all reaction participants are at unit activity. For ionic solutes, activity\u2014the effective concentration in a sense\u2014approaches concentration at low concentrations and low ionic strengths. The activity of a gas is equal to its partial pressure. Furthermore, the free energy, G, decreases for spontaneous processes occurring at constant temperature and pressure. Processes for which the free-energy change, DG, is zero have no tendency toward spontaneous change and are in a state of equilibrium. Reaction 4.13 is the one upon which free energies of formation of all ions in aqueous solution are based. It also forms the basis for defi ning free-energy changes for oxidation\u2013reduction processes in water. It is relatively easy to visualize the activities of ions in terms of concentration, whereas it is harder to visualize the activity of the electron, and therefore pE, in similar terms. For example, at 25\u00b0C in pure water, a medium of zero ionic strength, the hydrogen-ion concentration is 1.0 \u00a5 10-7 M, the hydrogen-ion activity is 1.0 \u00a5 10-7, and the pH is 7.0. The electron activity, however, must be defi ned in terms of Equation 4.19. When H+ (aq) at unit activity is in equilibrium with hydrogen gas at 1 atm pressure (and likewise at unit activity), the activity of the electron in the medium is exactly 1.00 and the pE is 0.0. If the electron activity were increased by a factor of 10 (as would be the case if H+ (aq) at an activity of 0.100 were in equilibrium with H2 at an activity of 1.00), the electron activity would be 10 and the pE value would be -1.0. 4.4 THE NERNST EQUATION The Nernst equation is used to account for the effect of different activities upon electrode potential. Referring to Figure 4.2, if the Fe3+ ion concentration is increased relative to the Fe2+ ion concentration, it is readily visualized that the potential and the pE of the right electrode will become more positive because the higher concentration of electron-defi cient Fe3+ ions clustered around it tends to draw electrons from the electrode. Decreased Fe3+ ion or increased Fe2+ ion concentration has the opposite effect. Such concentration effects upon E and pE are expressed by the Nernst equation.", "As applied to the half-reaction 3+-2+ 00 Fe + e Fe , E =+0.77 V, pE = 13.2 (4.20) the Nernst equation is the following, where 2.303RT/F = 0.0591 at 25\u00b0C: 3+ 3+ 0 2.303RT [Fe ] 0 0.0591 [Fe ] =+ log = E + EE log (4.21) 2+ 2+ nF [Fe ] n [Fe ] where n is the number of electrons involved in the half-reaction (1 in this case), and the activities of Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions have been taken as their concentrations (a simplification valid for more dilute solutions, which will be made throughout this chapter). Considering that E 0 E0 pE = and pE = 2.303RT /F 2.303RT /F the Nernst equation can be expressed in terms of pE and pE0 1 Fe3+ pE = pE0 + log 2+ (in this case n = 1) (4.22) n Fe The Nernst equation in this form is quite simple and offers some advantages in calculating redox relationships. If, for example, the value of [Fe3+] is 2.35 \u00a5 10-3 M and [Fe2+] = 7.85 \u00a5 10-5 M, the value of pE is 2.35 \u00a5 10-3 pE = 13.2 + log = 14.7 (4.23) 7.85 \u00a5 10-5 As the concentration of Fe3+ increases relative to the concentration of Fe2+, the value of pE becomes higher (more positive) and as the concentration of Fe2+ increases relative to the concentration of Fe3+, the value of pE becomes lower (more negative). 4.5 REACTION TENDENCY: WHOLE REACTION FROM HALF-REACTIONS This section discusses how half-reactions can be combined to give whole reactions and how the pE0 values of the half-reactions can be used to predict the directions in which reactions will go. The half-reactions discussed here are the following: 2+-0 Hg + 2e Hg, pE = 13.35 (4.24) 3+-2+ 0 Fe + e Fe , pE = 13.2 (4.25) 2+-0 Cu + 2e Cu, pE = 5.71 (4.26) 2H++ 2e -H2, pE0 = 0.00 (4.27) 2+-0 Pb + 2e Pb, pE =-2.13 (4.28) Such half-reactions and their pE0 values can be used to explain observations such as the following: A solution of Cu2+ fl ows through a lead pipe and the lead acquires a layer of copper metal through the reaction Cu2++ Pb \u00c6 Cu + Pb2+ (4.29) This reaction occurs because the copper(II) ion has a greater tendency to acquire electrons than the lead ion has to retain them. This reaction can be obtained by subtracting the lead half-reaction, Equation 4.28, from the copper half-reaction, Equation 4.26: 2+-0 Cu + 2e Cu, pE = 5.71 (4.26) 2+-0 -(Pb + 2e Pb), pE =-2.13 (4.28) 2+ 2+ 0 Cu + Pb Cu + Pb , pE = 7.84 (4.30) The positive value of pE0 for this reaction, 7.84, indicates that the reaction tends to go to the right as written. This occurs when lead metal directly contacts a solution of copper(II) ion. Therefore, if a waste solution containing copper(II) ion, a relatively innocuous pollutant, comes into contact with lead in plumbing, toxic lead may go into solution. In principle, half-reactions may be allowed to occur in separate electrochemical half-cells, as could occur for Reaction 4.30 in the cell shown in Figure 4.3 if the meter (pE) were bypassed by an electrical conductor; they are therefore called cell reactions. If the activities of Cu2+ and Pb2+ are not unity, the direction of the reaction and value of pE are deduced from the Nernst equation. For Reaction 4.30 the Nernst equation is 2+ 2+ 0 1 [Cu ] 1 [Cu ] pE = pE + log = 7.84 + log (4.31) 2+ 2+ n [Pb ] 2 [Pb ] Salt bridge By combining the appropriate half-reactions, it can be shown that copper metal will not cause hydrogen gas to be evolved from solutions of strong acid [hydrogen ion has less attraction for electrons than does copper(II) ion], whereas lead metal, in contrast, will displace hydrogen gas from acidic solutions. 4.6 THE NERNST EQUATION AND CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM Refer again to Figure 4.3. Imagine that instead of the cell being set up to measure the potential between the copper and lead electrodes, the voltmeter used to measure pE was removed and the electrodes directly connected with a wire so that the current might flow between them. The reaction 2+ 2+ 0 Cu + Pb Cu + Pb , pE = 7.84 (4.30) will occur until the concentration of lead ion becomes so high, and that of copper ion so low, that the reaction stops.", "The system is at equilibrium and, since current no longer fl ows, pE is exactly zero. The equilibrium constant K for the reaction is given by the expression [Pb2+] K = (4.32) [Cu2+] The equilibrium constant can be calculated from the Nernst equation, noting that under equilibrium conditions pE is zero and [Cu2+] and [Pb2+] are at equilibrium concentrations: 2+ 2+ 0 1 [Cu ] 1 [Cu ] pE = pE + log = 7.84 + log 2+ 2+ n [Pb ] 2 [Pb ] (4.33) 1 [Pb2+]1 pE = 0.00 = 7.84 -log = 7.84 -log K 2 [Cu2+]2 Note that the reaction products are placed over reactants in the log term, and a minus sign is placed in front to put the equilibrium constant in the correct form (a purely mathematical operation). The value of log K obtained from solving the above equation is 15.7. The equilibrium constant for a redox reaction involving n electrons is given in terms of pE simply by log K = n(pE0) (4.34) 4.7 THE RELATIONSHIP OF pE TO FREE ENERGY Aquatic systems and the organisms that inhabit them\u2014just like the steam engine or students hoping to pass physical chemistry\u2014must obey the laws of thermodynamics. Bacteria, fungi, and human beings derive their energy from acting as mediators (catalysts) of chemical reactions and extracting a certain percentage of useful energy from them. In predicting or explaining the behavior of an aquatic system, it is helpful to be able to predict the useful energy that can be extracted from chemical reactions in the system, such as microbially mediated oxidation of organic matter to CO2 and water, or the fermentation of organic matter to methane by anoxic bacteria in the absence of oxygen. Such information may be obtained by knowing the free-energy change, DG, for the redox reaction; DG, in turn, may be obtained from pE for the reaction. The free-energy change for a redox reaction involving n electrons at an absolute temperature of T is given by DG =-2.303nRT(pE) (4.35) where R is the gas constant. When all reaction participants are in their standard states (pure liquids, pure solids, solutes at an activity of 1.00, gas pressures at 1 atm), DG is the standard free-energy change, DG0, given by DG0 =-2.303nRT(pE0) (4.36) 4.8 REACTIONS IN TERMS OF ONE ELECTRON-MOLE For comparing free-energy changes between different redox reactions, it is most meaningful to consider the reactions in terms of the transfer of exactly 1 mol of electrons. This concept may be understood by considering two typical and important redox reactions that occur in aquatic systems\u2014nitrifi cation 4+ -+ 0 NH + 2O NO + 2H + HO, pE = 5.85 (4.37) 23 2 and oxidation of iron(II) to iron(III): 2++ 0 4Fe + O + 10H O 4Fe(OH) ( )s +8H, pE = 7.6 (4.38) 22 3 What do reactions written in this way really mean? If any thermodynamic calculations are to be made involving the reactions, Reaction 4.37 means that 1 mol of ammonium ion reacts with 2 mol of elemental oxygen to yield 1 mol of nitrate ion, 2 mol of hydrogen ion, and 1 mol of water. Reaction 4.38 is taken to mean that 4 mol of iron(II) ion react with 1 mol of oxygen and 10 mol of water to produce 4 mol of Fe(OH)3 and 8 mol of hydrogen ions. The free-energy changes calculated for these quantities of reaction participants do not enable meaningful comparisons of their free-energy changes. Such comparisons may be made, though, on the common basis of the transfer of 1 mol of electrons, writing each reaction in terms of one electron-mole. The advantage of this approach is illustrated by considering Reaction 4.37, which involves an eight-electron change, and Reaction 4.38, which involves a four-electron change. Rewriting Equation 4.37 for one electron-mole yields 1 + 11 -1 + 10 NH + O NO + H + HO, pE = 5.85 (4.39) 8442 834 82 whereas Reaction 4.38, when rewritten for one electron-mole rather than four, yields 2++ 0 Fe + 1O + 5HO Fe(OH)()s + 2H , pE = 7.6 (4.40) 4222 3 From Equation 4.36, the standard free-energy change for a reaction is DG0 =-2.303nRT(pE0) (4.36), which, for a one electron-mole reaction is simply DG0 =-2.303RT(pE0) (4.36). Therefore, for reactions written in terms of one electron-mole, a comparison of pE0 values provides a direct comparison of DG0 values.", "As shown in Equation 4.34 for a redox reaction involving n electrons, pE0 is related to the equilibrium constant by log K = n(pE0) (4.41) which for a one electron-mole reaction becomes simply log K = pE0 (4.42) Reaction 4.39, the nitrification reaction written in terms of one electron-mole, has a pE0 value of +5.85. The equilibrium-constant expression for this reaction is -1/8 + 1/4 [NO]3 [H] K = (4.43) + 1/8 1/4 [NH ]4 PO2 a computationally cumbersome form for which log K is given very simply as the following: log K = pE0 = 5.85 or K = 7.08 \u00a5 105 (4.44) Table 4.1 is a compilation of pE0 values for redox reactions that are especially important in aquatic systems. Most of these values are calculated from thermodynamic data rather than from direct potentiometric measurements in an electrochemical cell, as shown in Figure 4.2. Most electrode systems that might be devised do not give potential responses corresponding to the Nernst equation; that is, they do not behave reversibly. It is true that one may place a platinum electrode and a reference electrode in water and measure a potential. This potential, referred to the SHE, is the so-called EH value. Furthermore, the measured potential will be more positive (more oxidizing) in an oxidizing medium, such as the oxic surface layers of a lake, than in a reducing medium, such as the anaerobic bottom regions of a body of water. However, attaching any quantitative signifi cance to the EH value measured directly with an electrode is a very dubious practice. Acid mine waters containing relatively high levels of sulfuric acid and dissolved iron give reasonably accurate EH values by direct measurement, but most aquatic systems do not yield meaningful values of EH. The most accurate method of assessing the redox status of water is through calculation of oxidative capacity, a parameter analogous to buffer capacity for acids and bases and consisting of a single descriptive parameter derived from the sum of the species that can be oxidized or reduced.

Water may be either oxidized as 2H2O O2 + 4H++ 4e - (4.45) or reduced as 2H2O + 2e -H2 + 2OH- (4.46) These two reactions determine the limits of pE in water. On the oxidizing side (relatively more positive pE values), the pE value is limited by the oxidation of water, half-reaction 4.45. The evolution of hydrogen, Half-reaction 4.46, limits the pE value on the reducing side. The condition under which oxygen from the oxidation of water has a pressure of 1.00 atm can be regarded as the oxidizing limit of water, whereas a hydrogen pressure of 1.00 atm may be regarded as the reducing limit of water. These are boundary conditions that enable calculation of the stability boundaries of water. Writing the reverse of Reaction 4.45 for one electron and setting PO2 = 100 yield 1O + H++ e -1HO, pE0 = 20.75 (from Table 4.1) (4.47) 42 22 Thus, Equation 4.49 defines the pH-dependent oxidizing limit of water. At a specified pH, pE values more positive than the one given by Equation 4.49 cannot exist at equilibrium in water in contact with the atmosphere. 0 1/4 + pE = pE + log(PO2 [H ]) (4.48) pE = 20.75 -pH (4.49) The pE\u2013pH relationship for the reducing limit of water taken at P = 1 atm is given by the following H2 derivation: H++ e -21H2, pE0 = 0.00 (4.50) pE = pE0 + log[H+] (4.51) pE =-pH (4.52) For neutral water (pH = 7.00), substitution into Equations 4.52 and 4.49 yields -7.00 to 13.75 for the pE range of water. The pE\u2013pH boundaries of stability for water are shown by the dashed lines in Figure 4.4 of Section 4.11. The decomposition of water is very slow in the absence of a suitable catalyst. Therefore, water may have temporary nonequilibrium pE values more negative than the reducing limit or more positive than the oxidizing limit. A common example of the latter is a solution of chlorine in water. 4.10 pE VALUES IN NATURAL WATER SYSTEMS Although it is not generally possible to obtain accurate pE values by direct potentiometric measurements in natural aquatic systems, in principle, pE values may be calculated from the species present in water at equilibrium. An obviously signifi cant pE value is that of neutral water in thermodynamic equilibrium with the atmosphere. In water under these conditions, PO2 = 0.21 atm and [H+] = 1.00 \u00a5 10-7 M. Substitution into Equation 4.48 yields pE = 20.75 + log{(0.21)1/4 \u00a5 1.00 \u00a5 10-7} = 13.8 (4.53) According to this calculation, a pE value of around +13 is to be expected for water in equilibrium with the atmosphere, that is, an oxic water. At the other extreme, consider anoxic water in which 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 pH 1.00 \u00a5 10-5 M. methane and CO2 are being produced by microorganisms. Assume PCO = P and that pH = 7.00. 2 CH4 The relevant half-reaction is 1 +-11 8 CO2 + H + e 8 CH4 + 4 H2O (4.54) for which the Nernst equation is 1/8 + P [H ] CO2 + pE = 2.87 + log 1/8 = 2.87 + log[H ] = 2.87 -7.00 =-4.13 (4.55) PCH2 Note that the pE value of -4.13 does not exceed the reducing limit of water at pH 7.00, which from Equation 4.52 is -7.00. It is of interest to calculate the pressure of oxygen in neutral water at this low pE value of -4.13. Substitution into Equation 4.48 yields 1/4 -7 -4.13 = 20.75 + log(PO \u00a5 1.00 \u00a5 10 ) (4.56) 2 from which the pressure of oxygen is calculated to be 3.0 \u00a5 10-72 atm. This impossibly low fi gure for the pressure of oxygen means that equilibrium with respect to oxygen partial pressure is not achieved under these conditions. Certainly, under any condition approaching equilibrium between comparable levels of CO2 and CH4, the partial pressure of oxygen must be extremely low. 4.11 pE\u2013pH DIAGRAMS The examples cited so far have shown the close relationships between pE and pH in water. This relationship may be expressed graphically in the form of a pE\u2013pH diagram. Such diagrams show the regions of stability and the boundary lines for various species in water. Because of the numerous species that may be formed, such diagrams may become extremely complicated.", "For example, if a metal is being considered, several different oxidation states of the metal, hydroxy complexes, and different forms of the solid metal oxide or hydroxide may exist in different regions described by the pE\u2013pH diagram. Most waters contain carbonate, and many contain sulfates and sulfides, so that various metal carbonates, sulfates, and sulfides may predominate in different regions of the diagram. In order to illustrate the principles involved, however, a simplifi ed pE\u2013pH diagram is considered here. The reader is referred to more advanced works on geochemistry and aquatic chemistry for more complicated (and more realistic) pE\u2013pH diagrams.1,2 A pE-pH diagram for iron may be constructed assuming a maximum concentration of iron in solution, in this case 1.0 \u00a510-5 M. The following equilibria will be considered: 3+-2+ 0 Fe +e Fe , pE =+13.2 (4.57) + 2+ Fe(OH) ( )s +2H Fe +2H O (4.58) 22 [Fe2+] 12 K ==8.0 \u00a510 (4.59) sp +2 [H ] + 3+ Fe(OH) (s) +3H Fe +3H O (4.60) 32 [Fe3+]3 Ksp\u00a2= =9.1 \u00a510 (4.61) [H+]3 [The constants Ksp and Ksp\u00a2 are derived from the solubility products of Fe(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3, respectively, and are expressed in terms of [H+] to facilitate the calculations.] Note that the formation of species such as Fe(OH)2+, Fe(OH)2 +, and solid FeCO3 or FeS, all of which might be of signifi cance in a natural water system, is not considered. Rapid hydrolysis of iron(III) in solution yields solid ferrihydrite, a hydrated iron(III) hydroxide/oxide with a high surface area and strong affi nity to coprecipitate metals other than iron. In constructing the pE\u2013pH diagram, several boundaries must be considered. The first two of these are the oxidizing and reducing limits of water (see Section 4.9). At the high pE end, the stability limit of water is defined by Equation 4.49 derived previously: pE = 20.75 -pH (4.49) The low pE limit is defined by Equation 4.52: pE =-pH (4.52) The pE-pH diagram constructed for the iron system must fall between the boundaries defi ned by these two equations. Below pH 3, Fe3+ may exist in equilibrium with Fe2+. The boundary line that separates these two species, where [Fe3+] = [Fe2+], is given by the following calculation: [Fe3+] pE =13.2 +log 2+ (4.62) [Fe ] [Fe3+] = [Fe2+] (4.63) pE = 13.2 (independent of pH) (4.64) At pE exceeding 13.2, as the pH increases from very low values, Fe(OH)3 precipitates from a solution of Fe3+. The pH at which precipitation occurs depends, of course, upon the concentration of Fe3+. In this example, a maximum soluble iron concentration of 1.00 \u00a5 10-5 M has been chosen so that at the Fe3+/Fe(OH)3 boundary, [Fe3+] = 1.00 \u00a5 10-5 M. Substitution in Equation 4.61 yields 3+-5 + 3 [Fe ] 1.00 \u00a510 [H ] == (4.65) Ksp\u00a2 9.1\u00a5103 pH = 2.99 (4.66) In a similar manner, the boundary between Fe2+ and solid Fe(OH)2 may be defi ned, assuming [Fe2+] = 1.00 \u00a5 10-5 M (the maximum soluble iron concentration specified at the beginning of this exercise) at the boundary: 2+-5 + 2 [Fe ] 1.00 \u00a510 [H ] == 12 (4.67) Ksp 8.0 \u00a510 pH = 8.95 (4.68) Throughout a wide pE\u2013pH range, Fe2+ is the predominant soluble iron species in equilibrium with the solid hydrated iron(III) oxide, Fe(OH)3. The boundary between these two species depends upon both pE and pH. Substituting Equation 4.61 into Equation 4.62 yields Ksp\u00a2 [H+ ]3 pE = 13.2 + 2+ (4.69) [Fe ] pE = 13.2 + log 9.1 \u00a5 103 - log 1.00 \u00a5 10-5 + 3 \u00a5 log[H+] pE = 22.2 - 3 pH (4.70) The boundary between the solid phases Fe(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3 likewise depends upon both pE and pH, but it does not depend upon an assumed value for total soluble iron. The required relationship is derived from substituting both Equations 4.59 and 4.61 into Equation 4.62: K \u00a2 sp + 3 pE = 13.2 + log [H ]Ksp[H+ ]2 9.1\u00a5103 + pE = 13.2 + log 12 + log[H ] (4.71) 8.0 \u00a510 pE = 4.3 -pH (4.72) All of the equations needed to prepare the pE-pH diagram for iron in water have now been derived. To summarize, the equations are (Equation 4.49), O2 -H2O boundary; (Equation 4.52), H2 -H2O boundary; (Equation 4.64), Fe3+-Fe2+ boundary; (Equation 4.66), Fe3+-Fe(OH)3 boundary; (Equation 4.68), Fe2+-Fe(OH)2 boundary; (Equation 4.70), Fe2+-Fe(OH)3 boundary; and (Equation 4.72), Fe(OH)2 -Fe(OH)3 boundary. The pE-pH diagram for the iron system in water is shown in Figure 4.4.", "In this system, at a relatively high hydrogen-ion activity and high electron activity (an acidic reducing medium), iron(II) ion, Fe2+, is the predominant iron species; some groundwaters contain appreciable levels of iron(II) under these conditions. (In most natural water systems the solubility range of Fe2+ is relatively narrow because of the precipitation of FeS or FeCO3.) At a very high hydrogen-ion activity and low electron activity (an acidic oxidizing medium), Fe3+ ion predominates. In an oxidizing medium at lower acidity, solid Fe(OH)3 is the primary iron species present. Finally, in a basic reducing medium, with low hydrogen-ion activity and high electron activity, solid Fe(OH)2 can be stable. Note that within the pH regions normally encountered in a natural aquatic system (approximately pH 5-9) Fe(OH)3 or Fe2+ is the predominant stable iron species. In fact, it is observed that in waters containing dissolved oxygen at any appreciable level (a relatively high pE), hydrated iron(III) oxide Fe(OH)3 is essentially the only inorganic iron species found. Such waters contain a high level of suspended iron, but any truly soluble iron must be in the form of a complex (see Chapter 3). In highly anoxic, low-pE water, appreciable levels of Fe2+ may be present. When such water is exposed to atmospheric oxygen, the pE rises and Fe(OH)3 precipitates. The resulting deposits of hydrated iron(III) oxide can stain laundry and bathroom fixtures with a refractory red/brown stain. This phenomenon also explains why red iron oxide deposits are found near pumps and springs that bring deep, anaerobic water to the surface. In shallow wells, where the water may become oxic, solid Fe(OH)3 may precipitate on the well walls, clogging the aquifer outlet. This usually occurs through bacterially mediated reactions, which are discussed in Chapter 6. One species not yet considered is elemental iron. For the half-reaction 2+-0 Fe + 2e Fe, pE =-7.45 (4.73) the Nernst equation gives pE as a function of [Fe2+] pE =-7.45 + 1 log[Fe2+] (4.74) 2 For iron metal in equilibrium with 1.00 \u00a5 10-5 M Fe2+, the following pE value is obtained: pE =-7.45 + 1 log 1.00 \u00a5 10-5 =-9.95 (4.75) 2 Examination of Figure 4.4 shows that the pE values for elemental iron in contact with Fe2+ are below the reducing limit of water. This shows that iron metal in contact with water is thermodynamically unstable with respect to reducing water and going into solution as Fe2+, a factor that contributes to the tendency of iron to undergo corrosion. 4.12 HUMIC SUBSTANCES AS NATURAL REDUCTANTS Humic substances (see Section 3.17) are oxidation\u2013reduction-active species that may be signifi cant as reducing species in chemical and biochemical processes that occur in natural water and wastewater systems. The capability of humic substances to act as reductants is due primarily to the presence of the quinone/hydroquinone group that acts as an oxidation\u2013reduction couple as follows: There is some evidence suggesting that soluble humic substances can act as intermediates in the reduction of species in water by solid reductants, such as solid iron(II) species. It is believed that in addition to being reducing agents, humic substances act as electron shuttles to transfer electrons to iron(III) in the microorganism-mediated bioreduction of iron(III) to iron(II) in water.3 The process is faster in the presence of high carboxyl (-CO2H) group content in the humic substances presence indicative of the importance of complexation of iron ions by the humic substance. 4.13 PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESSES IN OXIDATION\u2013REDUCTION As discussed in Chapter 9, absorption of a light photon can introduce a high level of energy into chemical species that can become involved in oxidation\u2013reduction processes in water. An important oxidizing agent in water exposed to sunlight is believed to be superoxide ion, O2 \u2211-, produced by the action of photochemically excited natural organic matter (humic substance) upon dissolved O2. This superoxide species is a free radical (see Chapter 9) with an unpaired electron denoted by the dot in the formula O2 \u2211-. Superoxide ion is capable of oxidizing inorganically complexed metals such as iron. An important intermediate involved with photochemically induced oxidation processes in water is hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, generated when O2 \u2211- reacts with water. In the presence of iron(II) the Fenton reaction, Fe(II) + H2O2 \u00c6 Fe(III) + OH-+ HO\u2211 (4.77) generates hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211. Hydroxyl radical is a very reactive species that reacts with even refractory organic species, leading to their oxidation. As a consequence of reactions involving superoxide radical ion and hydroxyl radical, photochemical processes are important in promoting oxidation of oxidizable species in water.", "Aqueous suspensions of TiO2 are photochemically active. When photons of ultraviolet radiation of a wavelength <318 nm (hn) strike a TiO2 surface, TiO2 + hn\u00c6 e -cb + hvb + (4.78) conduction band electrons (e -cb) capable of initiating photoreduction and valence band holes (hvb + ) capable of initiating photooxidation are produced. This has led to interest in the use of suspensions of TiO2 exposed to sunlight to photoreduce and photooxidize pollutant and hazardous waste species. 4.14 CORROSION One of the most damaging redox phenomena is corrosion, defined as the destructive alteration of metal through interactions with its surroundings. In addition to its multibillion dollar annual costs due to destruction of equipment and structures, corrosion introduces metals into water systems and destroys pollution control equipment and waste disposal pipes; it is aggravated by water and air pollutants and some kinds of hazardous wastes (see corrosive wastes in Chapter 20, Section 20.6). Thermodynamically, all commonly used metals are unstable relative to their environments. Elemental metals tend to undergo chemical changes to produce the more stable forms of ions, salts, oxides, and hydroxides. Fortunately, the rates of corrosion are normally slow, so that metals exposed to air and water may endure for long periods of time. However, protective measures are necessary. Sometimes these measures fail; for example, witness the gaping holes in automobile bodies exposed to salt used to control road ice. Corrosion normally occurs when an electrochemical cell is set up on a metal surface. The area corroded is the anode, where the following oxidation reaction occurs, illustrated for the formation of a divalent metal ion from a metal, M: M \u00c6 M2++ 2e - (4.79) Several cathodic reactions are possible. One of the most common of these is the reduction of H+ ion: 2H++ 2e -\u00c6 H2 (4.80) Oxygen may also be involved in cathodic reactions, including reduction to hydroxide, reduction to water, and reduction to hydrogen peroxide: O2 + 2H2O + 4e -\u00c6 4OH- (4.81) O2 + 4H++ 4e -\u00c6 2H2O (4.82) O2 + 2H2O + 2e -\u00c6 2OH-+ H2O2 (4.83) Oxygen may either accelerate corrosion processes by participating in reactions, such as these, or retard them by forming protective oxide films. As discussed in Chapter 6, bacteria are often involved with corrosion. Corrosion is a very important consideration in domestic water distribution systems. Metals that may be corroded in such systems include iron, copper, lead, and red brass. Corrosion of these materials involves the redox potential of the water as determined by the solutes in it and the solid materials with which it is in contact. Important factors in corrosion include type and concentration of oxidant (usually from added Cl2), metal release rate, and corrosion scale properties of the corroding metals. LITERATURE CITED 1.

Choose the correct answer of the following, explain why it is true, and explain why the other choices are untrue: (A) high pE is associated with species such as CH4, NH4+, and Fe2+; (B) low pE is associated with species such as CO2, O2, and NO3 -; (C) values of pE in bodies of water range from about 1 \u00a5 10-7 to about 1 \u00a5 107; (D) pE is a number, but cannot be related to anything real, such as is the case with pH; (E) pE uses convenient numbers to express electron activity over many orders of magnitude. 19.

Instead, most significant chemical and biochemical phenomena in water involve interactions between species in water and another phase. Some of these important interactions are illustrated in Figure 5.1. Several examples of phase interactions in water illustrated by the figure are the following: production of solid biomass through the photosynthetic activity of algae occurs within a suspended algal cell and involves exchange of dissolved solids and gases between the surrounding water and the cell. Similar exchanges occur when bacteria degrade organic matter (often in the form of small particles) in water. Chemical reactions occur that produce solids or gases in water. Iron and many important trace-level elements are transported through aquatic systems as colloidal chemical compounds or are sorbed to solid particles. Pollutant hydrocarbons and some pesticides may be present on the water surface as an immiscible liquid film. Sediment can be washed physically into a body of water. This chapter discusses the importance of interactions among different phases in aquatic chemical processes. In a general sense, in addition to water, these phases may be divided between sediments (bulk solids) and suspended colloidal material. The ways in which sediments are formed and the significance of sediments as repositories and sources of aquatic solutes are discussed. Mentioned in earlier chapters, solubilities of solids and gases (Henry\u2019s law) are covered here in some detail. Much of this chapter deals with the behavior of colloidal material that consists of very fi ne particles of solids, gases, or immiscible liquids suspended in water. Colloidal material is involved with many signifi cant aquatic chemical phenomena. It is very reactive because of its high surfacearea-to-volume ratio. 5.2 IMPORTANCE AND FORMATION OF SEDIMENTS Sediments are the layers of relatively finely divided matter covering the bottoms of rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, bays, estuaries, and oceans. Sediments typically consist of mixtures of fine-, medium-, and coarse-grained minerals, including clay, silt, and sand, mixed with organic matter. They may vary in composition from pure mineral matter to predominantly organic matter. Sediments are reservoirs of a variety of biological, chemical, and pollutant detritus in bodies of water and are repositories of pollutants, such as heavy metals and toxic organic compounds. Of particular concern is the transfer of chemical species from sediments into aquatic food chains via organisms that spend significant parts of their life cycles in contact with or living in sediments. Among the sediment-dwelling organisms are various kinds of shellfish (shrimp, crayfish, crab, and clams) and a variety of worms, insects, amphipods, bivalves, and other smaller organisms that are of particular concern because they are located near the base of the food chain.", "Pollutant transfer from sediments to organisms may involve an intermediate stage in water solution as well as direct transfer from sediments to organisms.

The portion of substances held in sediments that is most available to organisms is that contained in pore water, obtained in microscopic pores within the sediment mass. Pore water is commonly extracted from sediments for measurements of toxicity to aquatic test organisms. 5.2.1 FORMATION OF SEDIMENTS Physical, chemical, and biological processes may all result in the deposition of sediments in the bottom regions of bodies of water. These sediments may eventually be covered and produce sedimentary minerals. Sedimentary material may be simply carried into a body of water by erosion or through sloughing (caving in) of the shore. Thus, clay, sand, organic matter, and other materials may be washed into a lake and settle out as layers of sediment. Sediments may be formed by simple precipitation reactions, several of which are discussed below. When a phosphate-rich wastewater enters a body of water containing a high concentration of calcium ions, the following reaction occurs to produce solid hydroxyapatite: 5Ca2++ H2O + 3HPO42-\u00c6 Ca5OH(PO4)3(s) + 4H+ (5.1) Calcium carbonate sediment may form when water rich in carbon dioxide and containing a high level of calcium as temporary hardness (see Section 3.5) loses carbon dioxide to the atmosphere: - Ca2++ 2HCO3 \u00c6 CaCO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O (5.2) or when the pH is raised by a photosynthetic reaction: - Ca2++ 2HCO3 + hn\u00c6 {CH2O} + CaCO3(s) + O2(g) (5.3) Oxidation of reduced forms of an element can result in its transformation to an insoluble species, such as occurs when iron(II) is oxidized to iron(III) to produce a precipitate of insoluble iron(III) hydroxide: 4Fe2++ 10H2O + O2 \u00c6 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 8H+ (5.4) A decrease in pH can result in the production of an insoluble humic acid sediment from base-soluble organic humic substances in solution (see Section 3.17). Biological activity is responsible for the formation of some aquatic sediments. Some bacterial species produce large quantities of iron(III) oxide (see Section 6.14) as part of their energy-extracting mediation of the oxidation of iron(II) to iron(III). In anoxic (oxygen-deficient) bottom regions of bodies of water, some bacteria use sulfate ion as an electron receptor: 2SO4 \u00c6 H2S (5.5) whereas other bacteria reduce iron(III) to iron(II): Fe(OH)3(s) \u00c6 Fe2+ (5.6) These two products can react to give a black layer of iron(II) sulfi de sediment: Fe2+ + H2S \u00c6 FeS(s) + 2H+ (5.7) This frequently occurs during the winter, alternating with the production of calcium carbonate by-product from photosynthesis (Reaction 5.3) during the summer. Under such conditions, a layered bottom sediment is produced composed of alternate layers of black FeS and white CaCO3 as shown in Figure 5.2. 5.2.2 ORGANIC AND CARBONACEOUS SEDIMENTARY MATERIALS Carbonaceous sediments from organic materials are particularly important because of their affi nity for poorly soluble organic water pollutants. (As noted in Section 1.9, in chemical fate and transport calculations involving the uptake of organic materials from water by sediments containing organic solids, the sediment\u2013water partition coefficient for the organic substance partitioning between water and soil may be expressed as a function of the fraction of organic matter in the sediment, foc, and the partition coeffi cient of the organic contaminant for the pure organic solid, Koc.) Sediment organic carbon comes from biological sources and from fossil fuels. Biological sources may consist of plant, animal, and microbial biomass including materials such as cellulose, lignin, collagen, and cuticle, and the degradation products thereof, especially humic substances. Fossil fuel sources include coal tar, petroleum residues (such as asphalt), soot, coke, charcoal, and coal. CaCO3 produced as a by-product ofphotosynthesis during the summer FeS produced by the bacterially mediatedreduction of Fe(III) and SO42\u2013 during the winter Black carbon is the name given to small particles of carbon left over from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass.", "Significant quantities of black carbon are produced by combustion processes and it is found in atmospheric particulate matter, in soil, and in sediments. Elemental carbon has an affinity for organic matter (see the discussion of activated carbon in Chapter 8) and is a signifi cant sink for hydrophobic organic compounds in sediments.1 Hydrophobic organic compounds are bound preferentially to sediment organic carbon in sediments. The two most prominent examples of such compounds are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). From 60% to 90% of these hydrophobic organic compounds are bound with sediment organic carbon even though typically the sediment organic carbon comprises only 5\u20137% of the sediments. Sediment organic carbon provides a reservoir for the storage of hydrophobic organic compounds that may persist for many years after the source of pollution is removed. However, compounds held by these solids are relatively less bioavailable and less readily biodegraded than compounds that are in solution or are bound to mineral sedimentary materials. 5.3 SOLUBILITIES The formation and stabilities of nonaqueous phases in water are strongly dependent upon solubilities. Calculations of the solubilities of solids and gases are addressed in this section. 5.3.1 SOLUBILITIES OF SOLIDS Generally, the solubility of a solid in water is of concern when the solid is slightly soluble, often having such a low solubility that it is called \u201cinsoluble.\u201d In Section 3.15 the solubility of lead carbonate was considered. This salt can introduce toxic lead ion into water by reactions such as 2+ 2 PbCO3( )s Pb + CO3 (3.79) A relatively straightforward calculation of the solubility of an ionic solid can be performed on barium sulfate, which dissolves according to the reaction 2+ 2 BaSO4( )s Ba + SO4 (5.8) for which the equilibrium constant is the following: Ksp = [Ba2+][SO42-] = 1.23 \u00a5 10-10 (5.9) An equilibrium constant in this form that expresses the solubility of a solid that forms ions in water is a solubility product and is designated Ksp. In the simplest cases, a solubility product can be used alone to calculate the solubility of a slightly soluble salt in water. The solubility (S, mol/L) of barium sulfate is calculated as follows: [Ba2+] = [SO42-] = S (5.10) [Ba2+][SO42-] = S \u00a5 S = Ksp = 1.23 \u00a5 10-10 (5.11) S = (Ksp)1/2 = (1.23 \u00a5 10-10)1/2 = 1.11 \u00a5 10-5 (5.12) Even such a simple calculation may be complicated by variations in activity coeffi cients resulting from differences in ionic strength. Intrinsic solubilities account for the fact that a significant portion of the solubility of an ionic solid is due to the dissolution of the neutral form of the salt and must be added to the solubility calculated from Ksp to obtain the total solubility, as illustrated below for the calculation of the solubility of calcium sulfate. When calcium sulfate dissolves in water that does not have any other sources of calcium or sulfate ions, the two major reactions are CaSO4 ( )s CaSO4(aq) (5.13) [CaSO4(aq)] = 5.0 \u00a5 10-3 M (25\u221eC) (5.14) (intrinsic solubility of CaSO4) 2+ 2 CaSO4( )s Ca + SO4 (5.15) [Ca2+][SO42-] = Ksp = 2.6 \u00a5 10-5 (25\u221eC) (5.16) and the total solubility of CaSO4 is calculated as follows: S = [Ca2+] + [CaSO4(aq)] Contribution to solubility Contribution to solubility from solubility product from intrinsic solubility 1/2 -5 1/2 -3 S = (Ksp ) + [CaSO4 (aq)] = (2.6 \u00a5 10 ) + 5.0 \u00a5 10 (5.18) -3 -3 -2 = 5.1 \u00a5 10 + 5.0 \u00a5 10 = 1.01 \u00a5 10 M It is seen that, in this case, the intrinsic solubility accounts for half of the solubility of the salt. In Section 3.15, it was seen that solubilities of ionic solids can be very much affected by reactions of cations and anions. It was shown that the solubility of PbCO3 is increased by the chelation of lead ion by NTA, 2+ 3- Pb + T PbT (3.72) increased by reaction of carbonate ion with H+, + 2- H + CO3 HCO3 (5.19) and decreased by the presence of carbonate ion from water alkalinity: 2--2+ CO (from dissociation of HCO ) + Pb PbCO ()s (5.20) 3 33 These examples illustrate that reactions of both cations and anions must often be considered in calculating the solubilities of ionic solids.", "5.3.2 SOLUBILITIES OF GASES The solubilities of gases in water are described by Henry\u2019s law, which states that at constant temperature the solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas in contact with the liquid. For a gas, \u201cX,\u201d this law applies to equilibria of the type X(g) X(aq) (5.21) and does not account for additional reactions of the gas species in water such as + + NH + HO NHOH- (5.22) 32 4 SO + HCO-(from water alkalinity) CO + HSO- (5.23) 23 23 TABLE 5.1 Henry\u2019s Law Constants for Some Gases in Water at 25\u221eC Gas K (mol/L/atm) O2 1.28 \u00a5 10-3 CO2 3.38 \u00a5 10-2 H2 7.90 \u00a5 10-4 CH4 1.34 \u00a5 10-3 N2 6.48 \u00a5 10-4 NO 2.0 \u00a5 10-4 which may result in much higher solubilities than predicted by Henry\u2019s law alone. Mathematically, Henry\u2019s law is expressed as [X(aq)] = KPX (5.24) where [X(aq)] is the aqueous concentration of the gas, PX is the partial pressure of the gas, and K is the Henry\u2019s law constant applicable to a particular gas at a specified temperature. For gas concentrations in units of moles per liter and gas pressures in atmospheres, the units of K are moles per liter per atmosphere. Some values of K for dissolved gases that are significant in water are given in Table 5.1. In calculating the solubility of a gas in water, a correction must be made for the partial pressure of water by subtracting it from the total pressure of the gas. At 25\u221eC, the partial pressure of water is 0.0313 atm; values at other temperatures are readily obtained from standard handbooks. The concentration of oxygen in water saturated with air at 1.00 atm and 25\u221eC may be calculated as an example of a simple gas solubility calculation. Considering that dry air is 20.95% by volume oxygen, factoring in the partial pressure of water gives the following: PO2 = (1.0000 atm -0.0313 atm) \u00a5 0.2095 = 0.2029 atm (5.25) -3 -4 [O2(aq)] = K \u00a5 P 2 =1.28 \u00a510 mol/L/atm \u00a5 0.2029 atm = 2.60 \u00a510 mol/L (5.26) O The molecular mass of oxygen is 32, so the concentration of dissolved O2 in water in equilibrium with air under the conditions given above is 8.32 mg/L or 8.32 parts per million (ppm). The solubilities of gases decrease with increasing temperature. Account is taken of this factor with the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation, C DH \u00c8 11 \u02d8 log 2 =- (5.27) \u00cd\u02d9 C 2.303RT T 1 \u00ce 12 \u02da where C1 and C2 denote the gas concentration in water at absolute temperatures of T1 and T2, respectively; DH is the heat of the solution; and R is the gas constant. The value of R is 1.987 cal/deg/mol, which gives DH in units of cal/mol. 5.4 COLLOIDAL PARTICLES IN WATER Many minerals, some organic pollutants, proteinaceous materials, some algae, and some bacteria are suspended in water as very small particles. Such particles, which have some characteristics of both species in solution and larger particles in suspension, which range in diameter from about 0.001 micrometer (mm) to about 1 mm, and which scatter white light as a light blue hue observed at right angles to the incident light, are classifi ed as colloidal particles. The characteristic light- scattering phenomenon of colloids results from their being the same order of size as the wavelength of light and is called the Tyndall effect. The unique properties and behavior of colloidal particles are strongly influenced by their physical\u2013chemical characteristics, including high specific area, high interfacial energy, and high surface/charge density ratio. Colloids play a very important role in determining the properties and behavior of natural waters and wastewaters. 5.4.1 CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT BY COLLOIDS IN WATER An important influence of colloids in aquatic chemistry is their ability to transport various kinds of organic and inorganic contaminants. Colloid-facilitated transport in which contaminants bound to the surface of colloidal particles can be an important means of moving substances that would otherwise be sorbed to sediments or, in the case of groundwater transport, to aquifer rocks. This mechanism is of concern with respect to circumvention of natural and artificial barriers in the long-term subsurface disposal of some kinds of wastes, such as high-level nuclear wastes including plutonium.2 5.4.2 OCCURRENCE OF COLLOIDS IN WATER Colloids composed of a variety of organic substances (including humic substances), inorganic materials (especially clays), and pollutants occur in natural water and wastewater.", "These substances have a number of effects, including those on organisms and pollutant transport. The characterization of colloidal materials in water is obviously very important, and a variety of means are used to isolate and characterize those materials. The two most widely used methods are filtration and centrifugation, although other techniques including voltammetry and fi eld-flow fractionation can be used. 5.4.3 KINDS OF COLLOIDAL PARTICLES Colloids may be classifi ed as hydrophilic colloids, hydrophobic colloids, or association colloids. These three classes are briefly summarized below. Hydrophilic colloids generally consist of macromolecules, such as proteins and synthetic polymers that are characterized by strong interaction with water resulting in spontaneous formation of colloids when they are placed in water. In a sense, hydrophilic colloids are solutions of very large molecules or ions. Suspensions of hydrophilic colloids are less affected by the addition of salts to water than are suspensions of hydrophobic colloids. Hydrophobic colloids interact to a lesser extent with water and are stable because of their positive or negative electrical charges as shown in Figure 5.3. The charged surface of the colloidal particle and the counterions that surround it compose an electrical double layer, which causes the particles to repel each other. Hydrophobic colloids are usually caused to settle from suspension by the addition of salts. Examples of hydrophobic colloids are clay particles, petroleum droplets, and very small gold particles. Association colloids consist of special aggregates of ions and molecules called micelles. To understand how this occurs, consider sodium stearate, a typical soap with the structural formula shown below: HHHHH H H HO H H H H H H HC H HH C C C C C C C CO-Na+C C C C C C C C C H HH H HH H H HHHH HH HHH Represented as - The stearate ion has both a hydrophilic -CO2 head and a long organophilic tail, CH3(CH2)16\u2013 . As a result, stearate anions in water tend to form clusters consisting of as many as 100 anions clustered + + + + + + + + + +++ ++ FIGURE 5.3 Representation of negatively charged hydrophobic colloidal particles surrounded in solution by positively charged counter-ions, forming an electrical double layer. (Colloidal particles suspended in water may have either a negative or positive charge.) together with their hydrocarbon \u201ctails\u201d on the inside of a spherical colloidal particle and their ionic \u201cheads\u201d on the surface in contact with water and with Na+ counter-ions. Such micelles (Figure 5.4) can be visualized as droplets of oil about 3\u20134 nanometers (nm) in diameter and covered with ions or polar groups. According to this model, micelles form when a certain concentration of surfactant species, typically around 1 \u00a5 10-3 M, is reached. The concentration at which this occurs is called the critical micelle concentration. 5.4.4 COLLOID STABILITY The stability of colloids is a prime consideration in determining their behavior. It is involved in important aquatic chemical phenomena including the formation of sediments, dispersion and agglomeration of bacterial cells, and dispersion and removal of pollutants (such as crude oil from an oil spill). As discussed above, the two main phenomena contributing to the stabilization of colloids are hydration and surface charge. The layer of water on the surface of hydrated colloidal particles prevents contact, which would result in the formation of larger units. A surface charge on colloidal particles may prevent aggregation, since like-charged particles repel each other. The surface charge is frequently pH dependent; at around pH 7, most colloidal particles in natural waters are negatively charged. Negatively charged aquatic colloids include algal cells, bacterial cells, proteins, and colloidal petroleum droplets. Natural organic matter in water tends to bind with colloidal particle surfaces and, because of the negatively charged functional groups characteristic of this matter, gives colloidal particles in water a predominantly negative charge. One of the three major ways in which a particle may acquire a surface charge is by chemical reaction at the particle surface. This phenomenon, which frequently involves hydrogen ion and is pH dependent, is typical of hydroxides and oxides and is illustrated for manganese dioxide, MnO2, in Figure 5.5. As an illustration of pH-dependent charge on colloidal particle surfaces, consider the effects of pH on the surface charge of hydrated manganese oxide, represented by the chemical formula MnO2(H2O)(s). In a relatively acidic medium, the reaction MnO2(H2O)(s) + H+\u00c6 MnO2(H3O)+(s) (5.28) may occur on the surface giving the particle a net positive charge.", "In a more basic medium, hydrogen ions may be lost from the hydrated oxide surface to yield negatively charged particles: MnO2(H2O)(s) \u00c6 MnO2(OH)-(s) + H+ (5.29) At some intermediate pH value, called the zero point of charge (ZPC), colloidal particles of a given hydroxide will have a net charge of zero, which favors aggregation of particles and precipitation of a bulk solid: Number of MnO2(H3O)+ sites = Number of MnO2(OH)- sites (5.30) Individual cells of microorganisms that behave as colloidal particles have a charge that is pH dependent. The charge is acquired through the loss and gain of H+ ions by carboxyl and amino groups on the cell surface: ++ - H N(+cell)CO H H N(neutral cell)CO H N(-cell)CO 323 222 low pH intermediate pH high pH Ion absorption is a second way in which colloidal particles become charged. This phenomenon involves attachment of ions onto the colloidal particle surface by means other than conventional covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding and London (van der Waal) interactions. Ion replacement is a third way in which a colloidal particle may gain a net charge; for example, replacement of some of the Si(IV) with Al(III) in the basic SiO2 chemical unit in the crystalline lattice of some clay minerals as shown in Equation 5.31, [SiO2] + Al(III) \u00c6 [AlO2 -] + Si(IV) (5.31) yields sites with a net negative charge. Similarly, replacement of Al(III) by a divalent metal ion such as Mg(II) in the clay crystalline lattice produces a net negative charge.

(I) Anhydrous MnO2 has two O atoms per Mn atom. (II) Suspended in water as a colloid, it binds to water molecules to form hydrated MnO2. (III) Loss of H+ from the bound H2O yields a negatively charged colloidal particle. (IV) Gain of H+ by surface O atoms yields a positively charged particle. The former process (loss of H+ ion) predominates for metal oxides. 5.5 COLLOIDAL PROPERTIES OF CLAYS Clays constitute the most important class of common minerals occurring as colloidal matter in water. The composition and properties of clays are discussed in some detail in Section 15.7 (as solid terrestrial minerals) and are briefly summarized here. Clays consist largely of hydrated aluminum and silicon oxides and are secondary minerals, which are formed by weathering and other processes acting on primary rocks (see Sections 15.2 and 15.8). The general formulas of some common clays are given below: \u2022 Kaolinite: Al2(OH)4Si2O5 \u2022 Montmorillonite: Al2(OH)2Si4O10 \u2022 Nontronite: Fe2(OH)2Si4O10 \u2022 Hydrous mica: KAl2(OH)2(AlSi3)O10 The most common clay minerals are illites, montmorillonites, chlorites, and kaolinites. These clay minerals are distinguished from each other by general chemical formula, structure, and chemical and physical properties. Iron and manganese are commonly associated with clay minerals. Clays are characterized by layered structures consisting of sheets of silicon oxide alternating with sheets of aluminum oxide. Units of two or three sheets make up unit layers. Some clays, particularly the montmorillonites, may absorb large quantities of water between unit layers, a process accompanied by swelling of the clay. As described in Section 5.4, clay minerals may attain a net negative charge by ion replacement, in which Si(IV) and Al(III) ions are replaced by metal ions of similar size but lesser charge. This negative charge must be compensated for by association of cations with the clay layer surfaces. Since these cations need not fi t specifi c sites in the crystalline lattice of the clay, they may be relatively large ions, such as K+, Na+, or NH4 +. These cations are called exchangeable cations and are exchangeable for other cations in water.", "The amount of exchangeable cations, expressed as milliequivalents (of monovalent cations) per 100 g of dry clay, is called the cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of the clay and is a very important characteristic of colloids and sediments that have cation-exchange capabilities. Because of their structure and high surface area per unit mass, clays have a strong tendency to sorb chemical species from water. Thus, clays play a role in the transport and reactions of biological wastes, organic chemicals, gases, and other pollutant species in water. However, clay minerals may also effectively immobilize dissolved chemicals in water and so exert a purifying action. Some microbial processes occur at clay particle surfaces and, in some cases, sorption of organics by clay inhibits biodegradation. Thus, clay may play a role in the microbial degradation or nondegradation of organic wastes. 5.6 AGGREGATION OF PARTICLES The processes by which particles aggregate and precipitate from colloidal suspension are quite important in the aquatic environment. For example, the settling of biomass during biological waste treatment depends upon the aggregation of bacterial cells. Other processes involving the aggregation of colloidal particles are the formation of bottom sediments and the clarification of turbid water for domestic or industrial use. Particle aggregation is complicated and may be divided into the two general classes of coagulation and fl occulation. These are discussed below. Colloidal particles are prevented from aggregating by the electrostatic repulsion of the electrical double layers (adsorbed-ion layer and counter-ion layer). Coagulation involves the reduction of this electrostatic repulsion such that colloidal particles of identical materials may aggregate. Flocculation uses bridging compounds, which form chemically bonded links between colloidal particles and enmesh the particles in relatively large masses called fl oc networks. Hydrophobic colloids are often readily coagulated by the addition of small quantities of salts that contribute ions to solution. Such colloids are stabilized by electrostatic repulsion. Therefore, the simple explanation of coagulation by ions in solution is that the ions reduce the electrostatic repulsion between particles to such an extent that the particles aggregate. Because of the double layer of electrical charge surrounding a charged particle, this aggregation mechanism is sometimes called double-layer compression. It is particularly noticeable in estuaries where sediment-laden fresh water flows into the sea, and is largely responsible for deltas formed where large rivers enter oceans. The binding of positive ions to the surface of an initially negatively charged colloid can result in precipitation followed by colloid restabilization as shown in Figure 5.6. This kind of behavior is explained by an initial neutralization of the negative surface charge on the particles by sorption of positive ions, allowing coagulation to occur. As more of the source of positive ions is added, their sorption results in the formation of positive colloidal particles. 5.6.1 FLOCCULATION OF COLLOIDS BY POLYELECTROLYTES Polyelectrolytes of both natural and synthetic origin may cause colloids to fl occulate. Polyelectrolytes are polymers with a high formula mass that normally contain ionizable functional groups. Typical examples of synthetic polyelectrolytes are shown in Table 5.2. It can be seen from Table 5.2 that anionic polyelectrolytes have negatively charged functional - groups such as -SO3 - and -CO2. Cationic polyelectrolytes have positively charged functional groups, normally H+ bonded to N. Nonionic polymers that serve as flocculants normally do not have charged functional groups. Somewhat paradoxically, anionic polyelectrolytes may fl occulate negatively charged colloidal particles, a process that is particularly important in biological systems, for example, in the cohesion of tissue cells, clumping of bacterial cells, and antibody\u2013antigen reactions. The mechanism by which this occurs involves bridging between the colloidal particles by way of the polyelectrolyte anions. It is facilitated by the presence of a low concentration of a metal ion capable of serving as a bridge between the negatively charged anionic polyelectrolytes and negatively charged functional groups on the colloidal particle surface. 5.6.2 FLOCCULATION OF BACTERIA BY POLYMERIC MATERIALS The aggregation and settling of microorganism cells is a very important process in aquatic systems and is essential to the function of biological waste treatment systems. In these processes, using bacteria to degrade organic wastes, a significant fraction of the carbon in the waste is removed as bacterial floc, consisting of aggregated bacterial cells that have settled from the water. The formation of this fl oc is obviously an important phenomenon in biological waste treatment. Polymeric substances, including polyelectrolytes, that are formed by the bacteria induce bacterial fl occulation. Within the pH range of normal natural waters (pH 5\u20139), bacterial cells are negatively charged.", "The ZPC of most bacteria is within the pH range 2\u20133. However, even at the ZPC, stable bacterial suspensions may exist. Therefore, surface charge is not necessarily required to maintain bacterial cells in suspension in water, and it is likely that bacterial cells remain in suspension because of the hydrophilic character of their surfaces. As a consequence, some sort of chemical interaction involving bridging species must be involved in bacterial fl occulation.

Surfaces in finely divided solids tend to have excess surface energy because of an imbalance of chemical forces among surface atoms, ions, and molecules. Surface energy level may be lowered by a reduction in surface area. Normally this reduction is accomplished by aggregation of particles or by sorption of solute species. Some kinds of surface interactions can be illustrated with metal oxide surfaces binding with metal ions in water. (Such a surface, its reaction with water, and its subsequent acquisition of a charge by loss or gain of H+ ion were shown in Figure 5.5 for MnO2.) Other inorganic solids, such as clays, probably behave much like solid metal oxides. Soluble metal ions, such as Cd2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, or Zn2+, may be bound with metal oxides such as MnO2 \u25ca xH2O by nonspecific ion-exchange adsorption, complexation with surface -OH groups, coprecipitation in solid solution with the metal oxide, or as a discrete oxide or hydroxide of the sorbed metal. Sorption of metal ions, Mtz+, by complexation to the surface is illustrated by the reaction z+ z-1 + MOH + Mt -+ H -M OMt (5.32) and chelation by the following process: M\u2014OH M\u2014O (5.33) + Mtz+ Mtz \u2013 2 + 2H+ M\u2014OH M\u2014O A metal ion complexed with a ligand, L, may bond by displacement of either H+ or OH-: z+ (1)z-+ + MOH-+ MtL M-OMtL H (5.34) z+ (1)z++ MOH-+ MtL M-(MtL) OH (5.35) Furthermore, in the presence of a ligand, dissociation of the complex and sorption of the metal complex and ligand must be considered as shown by the scheme below in which \u201c(sorbed)\u201d represents sorbed species and \u201c(aq)\u201d represents dissolved species: z+ z+ Mt (sorbed) Mt (aq) \u2260\u00d8 \u2260\u00d8 z+ z+ MtL (sorbed) MtL (aq) \u2260\u00d8 \u2260\u00d8 L(sorbed) L(aq) Some hydrated metal oxides, such as manganese(IV) oxide and iron(III) oxide, are especially effective in sorbing various species from aquatic solution. The sorption ability is especially pronounced for relatively fresh metal hydroxides or hydrated oxides such as colloidal MnO2. This oxide usually is produced in natural waters by the oxidation of Mn(II) present in natural waters placed there by the bacterially mediated reduction of manganese oxides in anoxic bottom sediments. Colloidal hydrated manganese(II) oxide can also be produced by the reduction of manganese(VII), which can be deliberately added to water as an oxidant in the form of permanganate salts to diminish taste and odor or to oxidize iron(II). Freshly precipitated MnO2 may have a surface area as large as several hundred square meters per gram. The hydrated oxide acquires a charge by loss and gain of H+ ion and has a ZPC in an acidic pH range between 2.8 and 4.5. Since the pH of most normal natural waters exceeds 4.5, hydrous MnO2 colloids are usually negatively charged. The sorption of anions by solid surfaces is harder to explain than the sorption of cations. Phosphates may be sorbed on hydroxylated surfaces by displacement of hydroxides (ion exchange): M\u2014OH M\u2014O OH 2\u2013 +HPO4 P + 2OH\u2013 (5.36) M\u2014OH M\u2014O O The degree of anion sorption varies. As with phosphate, sulfate may be sorbed by chemical bonding, usually at a pH < 7. Chloride and nitrate are sorbed by electrostatic attraction, such as occurs with positively charged colloidal particles in soil at a low pH. More specific bonding mechanisms may be involved in the sorption of fluoride, molybdate, selenate, selenite, arsenate, and arsenite anions. 5.8 SOLUTE EXCHANGE WITH BOTTOM SEDIMENTS Bottom sediments are important sources and sinks of inorganic and organic matter in streams, freshwater impoundments, estuaries, and oceans.", "It is incorrect to consider bottom sediments simply as wet soil. Normal soils are in contact with the atmosphere and are oxic, whereas the environment around bottom sediments is usually anoxic, so sediments are subjected to reducing conditions. Bottom sediments undergo continuous leaching, whereas soils do not. The level of organic matter in sediments is generally higher than that in soils. One of the most important characteristics of bottom sediments is their ability to exchange cations with the surrounding aquatic medium. CEC measures the capacity of a solid, such as a sediment, to sorb cations. It varies with pH and salt concentration. Another parameter, exchangeable cation status (ECS), refers to the amounts of specific ions bonded to a given amount of sediment. Generally, both CEC and ECS are expressed as milliequivalents per 100 g of solid. Because of the generally anoxic nature of bottom sediments, special care must be exercised in their collection and treatment. Particularly, contact with atmospheric oxygen rapidly oxidizes exchangeable Fe2+ and Mn2+ to nonexchangeable oxides containing the metals in higher oxidation states as Fe2O3 and MnO2. Therefore, sediment samples must be sealed and frozen as soon as possible after they are collected. A common method for the determination of CEC consists of (1) treating the sediment with a solution of an ammonium salt so that all exchangeable sites are occupied by NH4 + ion; (2) displacing the ammonium ion with a solution of NaCl; and (3) determining the quantity of displaced ammonium ion. The CEC values may then be expressed as the number of milliequivalents of ammonium ion exchanged per 100 g of dried sample. Note that the sample must be dried after exchange. The basic method for the determination of ECS consists of stripping all of the exchangeable metal cations from the sediment sample with ammonium acetate. Metal cations, including Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, are then determined in the leachate. Exchangeable hydrogen ion is very difficult to determine by direct methods. It is generally assumed that the total CEC minus the sum of all exchangeable cations except hydrogen ion is equal to the exchangeable hydrogen ion. Freshwater sediments typically have CEC values of 20\u201330 milliequivalents/100 g. The ECS values for individual cations typically range from <1 to 10\u201320 milliequivalents/100 g. Sediments are important repositories of metal ions that may be exchanged with surrounding waters. Furthermore, because of their capacity to sorb and release hydrogen ions, sediments have an important pH- buffering effect in some waters. 5.8.1 TRACE-LEVEL METALS IN SUSPENDED MATTER AND SEDIMENTS Sediments and suspended particles are important repositories for trace amounts of metals such as chromium, cadmium, copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, and manganese. These metals may be present as discrete compounds, ions held by cation-exchanging clays, bound to hydrated oxides of iron or manganese, or chelated by insoluble humic substances. The form of the metals depends upon pE. Examples of specific trace-metal-containing compounds that may be stable in natural waters under oxidizing and reducing conditions are given in Table 5.3. Solubilization of metals from sedimentary or suspended matter is often a function of the complexing agents present. These include amino acids, such as histidine, tyrosine, or cysteine; citrate ion; and, in the presence of seawater, chloride ion. Suspended particles containing trace elements may be in the submicrometer size range. Although less available than metals in true solution, metals held by very small particles are more accessible than those in sediments. Among the factors involved in metal availability are the identity of the metal, its chemical form (type of binding, oxidation state), the nature of the suspended material, the type of organism taking up the metal, and the physical and chemical conditions in the water. The pattern of trace-metal occurrence in suspended matter in relatively unpolluted water tends to correlate well with that of the parent minerals from which the suspended solids originated; anomalies appear in polluted waters where industrial sources add to the metal content of the stream. Two inorganic species are particularly important in the sequestration of heavy metals in sediments. One of these is hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly represented as Fe2O3 \u25cax(H2O), Fe(OH)3, or FeOOH, which coprecipitates heavy metals. This material forms when soluble iron(II) is exposed to oxidizing conditions. Under anoxic conditions the material is reduced to soluble iron(II) (Reaction 5.6), which releases bound heavy metals.", "The second important solid that binds heavy metals consists of acid-volatile sulfides, especially FeS. Most heavy metals have a stronger affinity for sulfide than does iron(II), so heavy metals tend to displace Fe(II) from this compound. The conditions conducive to reduction of hydrated iron(III) oxide leading to release of sequestered heavy metal ions are also conducive to formation of FeS, which may release sulfide to bind such ions in an insoluble form. The toxicities of heavy metals in sediments and their availability to organisms are very important in determining the environmental effects of heavy metals in aquatic systems. Many sediments are anoxic, so that microbial reduction of sulfate to sulfide leads to a preponderance of metal sulfides in sediments. The very low solubilities of sulfides tend to limit bioavailability of metals in anoxic sediments. However, exposure of such sediments to air, and subsequent oxidation of sulfide to sulfate, can release signifi cant amounts of heavy metals. Dredging operations can expose anoxic sediments to air, leading to oxidation of sulfides and release of metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, zinc, and copper. 5.8.2 PHOSPHORUS EXCHANGE WITH BOTTOM SEDIMENTS Phosphorus is one of the key elements in aquatic chemistry and is the limiting nutrient in the growth of algae under many conditions. Exchange with sediments plays a role in making phosphorus available for algae and contributes, therefore, to eutrophication. Sedimentary phosphorus may be classified into the following types: \u2022 Phosphate minerals, particularly hydroxyapatite, Ca5OH(PO4)3. \u2022 Nonoccluded phosphorus, such as orthophosphate ion bound to the surface of SiO2 or CaCO3. Such phosphorus is generally more soluble and more available than occluded phosphorus (below). \u2022 Occluded phosphorus consisting of orthophosphate ions contained within the matrix structures of amorphous hydrated oxides of iron and aluminum and amorphous aluminosilicates. Such phosphorus is not as readily available as nonoccluded phosphorus. \u2022 Organic phosphorus incorporated within aquatic biomass, usually of algal or bacterial origin. In some waters receiving heavy loads of domestic or industrial wastes, inorganic polyphosphates (e.g., from detergents) may be present in sediments. Runoff from fields where liquid polyphosphate fertilizers have been used can result in polyphosphates sorbed on sediments. The action of microorganisms on phosphate minerals, especially iron phosphates, can release phosphate to water.3 5.8.3 ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ON SEDIMENTS AND SUSPENDED MATTER Many organic compounds interact with suspended material and sediments in bodies of water. Colloids can play a significant role in the transport of organic pollutants in surface waters, through treatment processes, and even, to a limited extent, in groundwater. Settling of suspended material containing sorbed organic matter carries organic compounds into the sediment of a stream or lake. For example, this phenomenon is largely responsible for the presence of herbicides in sediments containing contaminated soil particles eroded from cropland. Some organics are carried into sediments by the remains of organisms or by fecal pellets from zooplankton that have accumulated organic contaminants. Suspended particulate matter affects the mobility of organic compounds sorbed to particles. Furthermore, sorbed organic matter undergoes chemical degradation and biodegradation at different rates and by different pathways compared to organic matter in solution. There is, of course, a vast variety of organic compounds that get into water and they react with sediments in different ways, the type and strength of binding varying with the type of compound. The most common types of sediments considered for their organic binding abilities are clays, organic (humic) substances, and complexes between clay and humic substances. Both clays and humic substances act as cation exchangers. Therefore, these materials sorb cationic organic compounds through ion exchange. This is a relatively strong sorption mechanism, greatly reducing the mobility and biological activity of the organic compound. When sorbed by clays, cationic organic compounds are generally held between the layers of the clay mineral structure where their biological activity is essentially zero. Since most sediments lack strong anion-exchange sites, negatively charged organics are not held strongly at all. Thus, these compounds are relatively mobile and biodegradable in water despite the presence of solids. The degree of sorption of organic compounds is generally inversely proportional to their water solubility. The more water-insoluble compounds tend to be taken up strongly by lipophilic (\u201cfatloving\u201d) solid materials, such as humic substances (see Section 3.17). Compounds having a relatively high vapor pressure can be lost from water or solids by evaporation. When this happens, photochemical processes (see Chapter 9) can play an important role in their degradation. The herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) has been studied extensively in regard to sorption reactions.", "Most of these studies have dealt with pure clay minerals, however, whereas soils and sediments are likely to have a strong clay\u2013fulvic acid complex component. The sorption of 2,4-D by such a complex can be described using an equation of the Freundlich isotherm type X = KCn (5.37) where X is the amount sorbed per unit weight of solid, C is the concentration of 2,4-D in water solution at equilibrium, and n and K are constants. These values are determined by plotting log X versus log C. If a Freundlich-type equation is obeyed, the plot will be linear with a slope of n and an intercept of log K. Sorption of comparatively nonvolatile hydrocarbons by sediments not only removes these materials from contact with aquatic organisms but also greatly retards their biodegradation. Aquatic plants produce some of the hydrocarbons that are found in sediments. Photosynthetic organisms, for example, produce quantities of n-heptadecane. The distribution of hydrocarbon types in sediments can be used to distinguish natural from pollutant sources. The sorption of neutral species like petroleum obviously cannot be explained by ion-exchange processes. It probably involves phenomena such as van der Waal\u2019s forces (a term sometimes invoked when the true nature of an attractive force is not understood, but generally regarded as consisting of induced dipole\u2013dipole interaction involving a neutral molecule), hydrogen bonding, charge-transfer complexation, and hydrophobic interactions. In some cases, pollutant compounds become covalently bounded as bound residues to humic substances in sediments and soil. Among the kinds of organic compounds for which there is evidence of bound residues in sediments are pesticides and their metabolites, plasticizers, halogenated aromatic compounds, and nitro compounds.4 It is very difficult to remove such residues from humic substances thermally, biochemically, or by exposure to acid or base (hydrolysis). Therefore, the formation of bound residues by persistent organic pollutants during humification of organic matter is an immobilization and detoxification process that is significant compared with biodegradation and mineralization in effectively removing such pollutants from the environment. The binding is thought to occur through the action of enzymes from some organisms. These enzymes are extracellular enzymes (those acting outside the cell) that act as oxidoreductases, which catalyze oxidation\u2013 reduction reactions. Microbial phenoloxidase enzymes act upon aromatic substrates from lignin decomposition, which are present in humic substances produced from lignin precursors, and also act upon aromatic xenobiotic aromatic compounds, such as anilines and phenols. This can result in the binding of xenobiotic aromatic compounds with humic substances as illustrated below for the coupling of the pollutant 2,4-dichlorophenol to an aryl ring on a humic substance molecule: Obviously, uptake of organic matter by suspended and sedimentary material in water is an important phenomenon. This phenomenon significantly reduces the overall toxicity of pesticides in water. Biodegradation is generally slowed down appreciably, however, by binding of a substance to a solid. In certain intensively farmed areas, there is a very high accumulation of pesticides in the sediments of streams, lakes, and reservoirs. The sorption of pesticides by solids and the resulting influence on their biodegradation is an important consideration in the licensing of new pesticides. The transfer of surface water to groundwater often results in sorption of some water contaminants by soil and mineral material. To take advantage of this purification effect, some municipal water supplies are drawn from beneath the surface of natural or artificial river banks as a fi rst step in water treatment. The movement of water from waste landfills to aquifers is also an important process (see Chapter 20) in which pollutants in the landfill leachate may be sorbed by the solid material through which the water passes. Surfactant alkylphenolpolyethoxylates and their biodegradation product alkylphenols (see Section 7.10), which have many industrial and domestic uses, are discharged in signifi cant quantities in wastewater treatment plant effluents. These compounds have the potential to disrupt the endocrine systems of aquatic organisms and even humans, tend to accumulate in sediments, and may be poorly biodegradable under anoxic conditions. Levels of these compounds up to as high as 14 mg/kg have been found in sediments in the United States and some fish from the United Kingdom have shown tissue levels approaching 1 \u03bcg/kg. 5.8.4 BIOAVAILABILITY OF SEDIMENT CONTAMINANTS An important consideration with respect to contaminants in sediments and soils is bioavailability, defined generally as the degree to which a substance can be absorbed into the system of an organism. Bioavailability is an especially important consideration in assessing the hazards posed to organisms by pollutants in sediments and soils.", "In some cases, it may be best to not attempt to Substance in organism Biochemical receptor Substance released remediate these media if the substances of concern have a low bioavailability. In other cases, very high bioavailability of toxic substances may make them particularly dangerous. Figure 5.7 shows the overall process by which a contaminant may get into a microorganism from a sediment. A substance bound in a sediment may be released into water, then passed across a biological membrane into an organism, or it may transfer directly across a membrane from sediment to an organism. Once inside the organism, a potentially toxic substance may migrate to a biochemical receptor in the organism (see the discussion of receptors in Chapter 23) to exert a toxic effect. These processes may actually occur within an organism when contaminated soil or sediment material is ingested and traverses the gut wall. 5.9 INTERSTITIAL WATER Interstitial water or pore water consists of water held by sediments. The solutes in interstitial water reflect the chemical and biochemical conditions in the sediments. These solutes include species capable of undergoing oxidation/reduction, reduced metal ions, nutrients such as NH4 +, and soluble organic compounds. These species include all of the products expected from the decomposition and mineralization of planktonic biomass, largely through the activity of anoxic bacteria in the sediments. Circulation is strongly curtailed in sediments so that there is a pronounced vertical gradient in the species present. At sediment surfaces that may contact water with some oxygen dissolved in it, some more oxidized species are encountered, whereas deeper in the sediments reduced species predominate. Interstitial water is an important reservoir for gases in natural water systems. Generally, the gas concentrations in interstitial waters are different from those in the overlying water. Typically, interstitial water at the surface of the sediment contains significant amounts of N2 and relatively little CH4, which requires anoxic conditions for its production and biodegrades in contact with oxygen. At depths of around 1 m in sediments, CH4 levels are high and N2 concentrations are low because nitrogen is stripped from the interstitial water by microbially produced methane and carbon dioxide, which are produced by the anoxic fermentation of organic matter: 2{CH2O} \u00c6 CH4(g) + CO2(g) (5.39) The concentrations of argon and nitrogen are much lower at a depth of 1 m than they are at the sediment surface. This finding may be explained by the stripping action of the fermentation- produced methane rising to the sediment surface. 5.10 PHASE INTERACTIONS IN CHEMICAL FATE AND TRANSPORT In Section 1.8, the topic of environmental chemical fate and transport was introduced. The hydrosphere is arguably the most important environmental sphere with respect to chemical fate and transport processes, many of which involve distribution of species between phases. It is appropriate at this point to consider chemical fate and transport in the hydrosphere. This is an environmentally important topic that increasingly utilizes sophisticated mathematical models and calculations that are beyond the scope of this book. For more details and example calculations, the reader is referred to a comprehensive reference work on the subject.5 5.10.1 RIVERS The physical movement of chemical species in a river is largely by advection (see Section 1.8) due to the gravitational movement of masses of water downstream. This results in relatively rapid mixing and dilution because of velocity shear in which parcels of water move at different rates in a river where water in contact with the banks and bottom moves more slowly than water in the middle of the stream. Also contributing to this mixing are turbulent mixing and diffusive transport of dissolved species and colloidal particles. The net result of these processes is that a pollutant introduced into the river in a relatively concentrated \u201cplug\u201d becomes spread out as it fl ows downstream. 5.10.2 LAKES AND RESERVOIRS Lakes and reservoirs are relatively quiet compared with rivers, but there is still movement within such bodies of water. Water enters by stream infl ow, inflow from underground springs and aquifers, and directly by rainfall. It exits by outflow, such as over a spillway in a reservoir, infiltration into ground, and evaporation. The balance between input and loss of water in a body of water means that the water has a hydraulic residence time. A major factor in mixing processes in lakes is the infl uence of wind. This occurs because windblown surface water moves at a rate that is 2\u20133% of the wind velocity, a phenomenon called wind drift.", "Water moved toward one side of a lake by wind drift must return some distance below the water surface as a return current. In a shallow, unstratified body of water, the return current flows along the bottom where it contacts and may agitate bottom sediments. In stratifi ed lakes (see Figure 3.6) the circulation of water occurs in the upper epilimnion layer as shown in Figure 5.8. 5.10.3 EXCHANGE WITH THE ATMOSPHERE Exchange of chemical species between water and overlying air is an important process. It is the means by which atmospheric oxygen enters water to provide oxygen needed by fish. Carbon dioxide required for algal growth may come from the air. Air pollutants such as acid gases may enter water from the Wind \ufb02ow Wind \ufb02ow atmosphere. Under circumstances of high algal photosynthetic activity, oxygen produced by algae is released to the air. Decay of organic matter can oversaturate water with carbon dioxide, requiring its release to the air. Anoxic microbial processes in sediments can produce hydrogen sulfide and methane that are released to air. Volatile organic water pollutants may move from water to the atmosphere. The air\u2013water interface is the boundary across which species move and is crucial in determining the rate of exchange of materials. Current models of these processes assume that there is a thin, stationary liquid film on the surface of the water in direct contact with a thin, stationary layer of air. Both of these layers are thin\u2014as little as a few micrometers\u2014and molecular diffusion is the only mechanism for movement of solute species in them. Immediately below the thin surface fi lm of water, turbulent diffusion mixes water solutes, and immediately above the thin air fi lm, turbulent diffusion mixes the species in air. 5.10.4 EXCHANGE WITH SEDIMENTS Sediments are very important in chemical fate and transport in the hydrosphere. This is because substances, including pollutants such as heavy metals or hydrophobic organics, bind with particles as they settle through the water column and are incorporated into sediments. The settling fl ux density, J, is equal to the mass of a substance transported across an area through which the settling occurs per unit time and is given by the product of the rate at which sedimentary materials settle and the concentration of the substance in question in the settling materials: J = (sediment deposition rate) \u00a5 (substance concentration in particles) (5.40) Incorporation of pollutants by settling from the water column into sediments is a particularly important mode of chemical fate and transport under quiescent conditions during which very small (colloidal) particles are aggregating together (flocculation). If undisturbed, the layers of sediments can provide a record of pollution. A hypothetical, though typical, such plot is shown for lead in Figure 5.9. Although sediments are normally repositories of pollutants and reduce their environmental harm, they can also provide sources of pollutants that can be mobilized by physical, chemical, or biochemical processes. For example, mercury precipitated in sediments can be mobilized as soluble methylmercury species by the action of anoxic bacteria in the oxygen-deficient sediments (see Section 7.3).

A majority of the important chemical reactions that take place in water, particularly those involving organic matter and oxidation\u2013reduction processes, occur through bacterial intermediaries. Algae are the primary producers of biological organic matter (biomass) in water. Microorganisms are responsible for the formation of many sediment and mineral deposits; they also play the dominant role in secondary waste treatment. Some of the effects of microorganisms on the chemistry of water in nature are illustrated in Figure 6.1.", "Pathogenic microorganisms must be eliminated from water purified for domestic use. In the past, major epidemics of typhoid, cholera, and other water-borne diseases resulted from pathogenic microorganisms in water supplies. Even today, constant vigilance is required to ensure that water for domestic use is free of pathogens. Most of this chapter is concerned with aquatic chemical transformations mediated by microorganisms. Although they are not involved in such transformations, special mention should be made of viruses in water. Viruses cannot grow by themselves, but reproduce in the cells of host organisms. They are only about 1/30\u20131/20 the size of bacterial cells, and they cause a number of diseases, such as polio, viral hepatitis, and perhaps cancer. It is thought that many of these diseases are waterborne. Because of their small size (0.025\u20130.100 \u03bcm) and biological characteristics, viruses are diffi cult to isolate and culture. They often survive municipal water treatment, including chlorination. Thus, although viruses have no effect on the overall environmental chemistry of water, they are an important consideration in the treatment and use of water. Microorganisms are divided into the two broad categories of prokaryotes and eukaryotes; the latter have well-defined cell nuclei enclosed by a nuclear membrane, whereas the former lack a nuclear membrane and the nuclear genetic material is more diffuse in the cell. Other differences between these two classes of organisms include location of cell respiration, means of photosynthesis, means of motility, and reproductive processes. All classes of microorganisms produce spores, metabolically inactive bodies that form and survive under adverse conditions in a \u201cresting\u201d state until conditions favorable for growth occur. Fungi, protozoa, and bacteria (with the exception of photosynthetic bacteria and protozoa) are classifi ed as reducers, which break down chemical compounds to more simple species and thereby extract the energy needed for their growth and metabolism. Algae are classifi ed as producers because they utilize light energy and store it as chemical energy. In the absence of sunlight, however, algae utilize chemical energy for their metabolic needs. In a sense, therefore, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi may be looked upon as environmental catalysts, whereas algae function as aquatic solar fuel cells. All microorganisms can be put into one of the four following classifications based on the sources of energy and carbon that they utilize: chemoheterotrophs, chemoautotrophs, photoheterotrophs, and photoautotrophs. These classifications are based on (1) the energy source and (2) the carbon source utilized by the organism. Chemotrophs use chemical energy derived from oxidation\u2013reduction reactions of simple inorganic chemical species for their energy needs. Phototrophs utilize light energy from photosynthesis. Heterotrophs obtain their carbon from other organisms; autotrophs use carbon dioxide and ionic carbonates for the C that they require. Figure 6.2 summarizes the classifi cations into which microorganisms may be placed with these defi nitions. 6.1.1 MICROORGANISMS AT INTERFACES Aquatic microorganisms tend to grow at interfaces. Many such microorganisms grow on solids that are suspended in water or are present in sediments. Large populations of aquatic bacteria typically reside on the surface of water at the air\u2013water interface. In addition to being in contact with air that aerobic microorganisms need for their metabolic processes, this interface also accumulates food in the form of lipids (oils, fats), polysaccharides, and proteins. Bacteria at this interface are generally Photoheterotrophs A few specialized bacteriathat use photoenergy, but aredependent on organic matterfor a carbon source Inorganic carbon(CO2, HCO3\u2013) Chemoautotrophs Use CO2 for biomass and oxidize substances such as H2 (Pseudomonas), NH+4 (Nitrosomonas),S (Thiobacillus) for energy Photoautotrophs Algae, and photosyntheticbacteria including cyanobacteria that use light energyto convert CO2 (HCO3\u2013) tobiomass by photosynthesis different from those in the body of water and may have a hydrophobic cell character. When surface bubbles burst, bacteria at the air\u2013water interface can be incorporated into aerosol water droplets and carried by wind. This is a matter of some concern with respect to sewage treatment plants as a possible vector for spreading disease-causing microorganisms. 6.2 ALGAE For the purposes of discussion here, algae may be considered as generally microscopic organisms that subsist on inorganic nutrients and produce organic matter from carbon dioxide by photosynthesis. In addition to single cells, algae grow as filaments, sheets, and colonies. Some algae, particularly the marine kelps, are huge multicellular organisms. The study of algae is called phycology. The four main classes of unicellular algae of importance in environmental chemistry are the following. \u2022 Chrysophyta, which contain pigments that give these organisms a yellow-green or golden-brown color. Chrysophyta are found in both freshwater and marine systems.", "They store food as carbohydrate or oil. The most well known of these algae are diatoms, characterized by silica-containing cell walls. \u2022 Chlorophyta, commonly known as green algae, are responsible for most of the primary productivity in freshwaters. \u2022 Pyrrophyta, commonly known as dinoflagellates, are motile with structures that enable them to move about in water, thus giving them characteristics of protozoa (Section 6.4). Pyrrophyta occur in both marine and freshwater environments. \u201cBlooms\u201d of Gymnodinium and Gonyaulax species release toxins that cause harmful \u201cred tides.\u201d \u2022 Euglenophyta likewise exhibit characteristics of both plants and animals. Although capable of photosynthesis, these algae are not exclusively photoautotrophic (see Figure 6.2), and they utilize biomass from other sources for at least part of their carbon needs. The general nutrient requirements of algae are carbon (obtained from CO2 or HCO3\u2212), nitrogen (generally as NO3\u2212), phosphorus (as some form of orthophosphate), sulfur (as SO42\u2212), and trace elements including sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, cobalt, and molybdenum. In a highly simplified form, the production of organic matter by algal photosynthesis is described by the reaction CO2 + H2O + hn \u00c6 {CH2O} + O2(g) (6.1) where {CH2O} represents a unit of carbohydrate and hn stands for the energy of a quantum of light. A reasonably accurate representation of the overall formula of the algae Chlorella is C5.7H9.8O2.3NP0.06. Using this formula for algal biomass exclusive of the phosphorus, the overall reaction for photosynthesis is 5.7CO2 + 3.4H2O + NH3 + hn \u00c6 C5.7H9.8O2.3N + 6.25O2(g) (6.2) In the absence of light, algae metabolize organic matter in the same manner as do nonphotosynthetic organisms. Thus, algae may satisfy their metabolic demands by utilizing chemical energy from the degradation of stored starches or oils, or from the consumption of algal protoplasm itself. In the absence of photosynthesis, the metabolic process consumes oxygen, so during the hours of darkness an aquatic system with a heavy growth of algae may become depleted in oxygen. Symbiotic relationships of algae with other organisms are common. There are even reports of unicellular green algae growing inside hairs on polar bears, which are hollow for purposes of insulation; the sight of a green polar bear is alleged to have driven more than one Arctic explorer to the brink of madness. The most common symbiotic relationship involving algae is that of lichen in which algae coexist with fungi; both kinds of organisms are woven into the same thallus (tubular vegetative unit). The fungus provides moisture and nutrients required by the algae, which generates food photosynthetically. Lichen are involved in weathering processes of rocks (see Section 15.2). The main role of algae in aquatic systems is the production of biomass. This occurs through photosynthesis, which fixes carbon dioxide and inorganic carbon from dissolved carbonate species as organic matter, thus providing the basis of the food chain for other organisms in the system. The production of moderate amounts of biomass is beneficial to other organisms in the aquatic system. Under some conditions, the growth of algae can produce metabolites that are responsible for odor and even toxicity in water. An interesting aspect of the growth of oceanic plankton including algae is their uptake of micro-nutrient metals resulting in extremely low concentrations of essential metals in surface seawater. In some cases the resultant low availability of nutrient metals limits photosynthetic rates in seawater. Some microorganisms in seawater increase bioavailability of nutrient metals and accelerate their cycling in water by releasing strong chelating agents and catalyzing oxidation/reduction reactions that put nutrient metals in a more soluble and available form. 6.3 FUNGI Fungi are nonphotosynthetic, often filamentous, organisms exhibiting a wide range of morphology (structure). The study of fungi is called mycology. Some fungi are as simple as the microscopic unicellular yeasts, whereas other fungi form large, intricate toadstools. The microscopic fi lamentous structures of fungi generally are much larger than bacteria, and usually are 5\u201310 \u03bcm in width. Fungi are aerobic or oxic (oxygen-requiring) organisms and generally can thrive in more acidic media than can bacteria. They are also more tolerant of higher concentrations of heavy metal ions than are most bacteria. Perhaps the most important function of fungi in the environment is the breakdown of cellulose in wood and other plant materials. To accomplish this, fungal cells secrete an extracellular enzyme (exoenzyme), cellulase, that hydrolyzes insoluble cellulose to soluble carbohydrates that can be absorbed by the fungal cell. Fungi do not grow well in water.", "However, they play an important role in determining the composition of natural waters and wastewaters because of the large amount of their decomposition products that enter water. An example of such a product is humic material, which interacts with hydrogen ions and metals (see Section 3.17). 6.4 PROTOZOA Protozoa are microscopic animals consisting of single eukaryotic cells. The numerous kinds of protozoa are classified on the bases of morphology (physical structure), means of locomotion (flagella, cilia, pseudopodia), presence or absence of chloroplasts, presence or absence of shells, ability to form cysts (consisting of a reduced-size cell encapsulated in a relatively thick skin that can be carried in the air or by animals in the absence of water), and ability to form spores. Protozoa occur in a wide variety of shapes and their movement in the field of a microscope is especially fascinating to watch. Some protozoa contain chloroplasts and are photosynthetic. Protozoa play a relatively small role in environmental biochemical processes, but are nevertheless significant in the aquatic and soil environment for the following reasons. \u2022 Several devastating human diseases, including malaria, sleeping sickness, and some kinds of dysentery, are caused by protozoa that are parasitic to the human body \u2022 Parasitic protozoa can cause debilitating, even fatal, diseases in livestock and wildlife \u2022 Vast limestone (CaCO3) deposits have been formed by the deposition of shells from the foramifera group of protozoa \u2022 Protozoa are active in the oxidation of degradable biomass, particularly in sewage treatment \u2022 Protozoa may affect bacteria active in degrading biodegradable substances by \u201cgrazing\u201d on bacterial cells Although they are single celled, protozoa have a fascinating variety of structures that enable them to function. The protozoal cell membrane is protected and supported by a relatively thick pellicle, or by a mineral shell that may act as an exoskeleton. Food is ingested through a structure called a cytosome from which it is concentrated in a cytopharynx or oral groove, and then digested by enzymatic action in a food vacuole. Residue from food digestion is expelled through a cytopyge and soluble metabolic products, such as urea or ammonia, are eliminated by a contractile vacuole, which also expels water from the cell interior. 6.5 BACTERIA Bacteria are single-celled prokaryotic microorganisms that may be shaped as rods (bacillus), spheres (coccus), or spirals (vibrios, spirilla, spirochetes). Bacteria cells may occur individually or grow as groups ranging from two to millions of individual cells. Most bacteria fall into the size range of 0.5\u20133.0 \u03bcm. However, considering all species, a size range of 0.3\u201350 \u03bcm is observed. Characteristics of most bacteria include a semirigid cell wall, motility with flagella for those capable of movement, unicellular nature (although clusters of cloned bacterial cells are common), and multiplication by binary fission in which each of two daughter cells is genetically identical to the parent cell. Like other microorganisms, bacteria produce spores. The metabolic activity of bacteria is greatly influenced by their small size. Their surface-to-volume ratio is extremely large, so that the inside of a bacterial cell is highly accessible to a chemical substance in the surrounding medium. Thus, for the same reason that a finely divided catalyst is more efficient than a more coarse one, bacteria may bring about very rapid chemical reactions compared to those mediated by larger organisms. Bacteria excrete exoenzymes that break down solid food material to soluble components which can penetrate bacterial cell walls, where the digestion process is completed. Although individual bacteria cells cannot be seen by the naked eye, bacterial colonies arising from individual cells are readily visible. A common method of counting individual bacterial cells in water consists of spreading a measured volume of an appropriately diluted water sample on a plate of agar gel containing bacterial nutrients. Wherever a viable bacterial cell adheres to the plate, a bacterial colony consisting of many cells will grow. These visible colonies are counted and related to the number of cells present initially. Because bacterial cells may already be present in groups, and because individual cells may not live to form colonies or even have the ability to form colonies on a plate, plate counts tend to underestimate the number of viable bacteria. 6.5.1 AUTOTROPHIC AND HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA Bacteria may be divided into two main categories, autotrophic and heterotrophic. Autotrophic bacteria are not dependent on organic matter for growth and thrive in a completely inorganic medium; they use carbon dioxide or other carbonate species as a carbon source.", "A number of sources of energy may be used, depending on the species of bacteria; however, a biologically mediated chemical reaction always supplies the energy. An example of autotrophic bacteria is Gallionella. In the presence of oxygen, these bacteria are grown in a medium consisting of NH4Cl, phosphates, mineral salts, CO2 (as a carbon source), and solid FeS (as an energy source). It is believed that the following is the energy-yielding reaction for this species: 4FeS(s) + 9O2 + 10H2O \u00c6 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 4SO42\u2212 + 8H+ (6.3) Starting with the simplest inorganic materials, autotrophic bacteria must synthesize all of the complicated proteins, enzymes, and other materials needed for their life processes. It follows, therefore, that the biochemistry of autotrophic bacteria is quite sophisticated. Because of their consumption and production of a wide range of minerals, autotrophic bacteria are involved in many geochemical transformations. Heterotrophic bacteria depend on organic compounds, both for energy and for carbon to build their biomass. They are much more common in occurrence than autotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophic bacteria are the microorganisms primarily responsible for the breakdown of pollutant organic matter in water, and of organic wastes in biological waste-treatment processes. Some bacteria are capable of photosynthesis to supply their energy and carbon. The most common such bacteria in water are the cyanobacteria. These organisms were once thought to be algae and were called blue-green algae. They can grow prolifically under some conditions and may impart such disagreeable tastes and odors to water that they may make it unfit for domestic consumption during cyanobacteria blooms. A type of cyanobacteria of unique importance consists of the marine cyanobacteria from the Prochlorococcus genus.1 Only discovered in 1988, these bacteria are the smallest photosynthetic organisms known, only about 0.5 \u03bcm in size. They are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in the oceans (therefore, on the entire planet), constituting 40\u201350% of phytoplankton biomass in ocean waters in the region between 40\u00b0 north and 40\u00b0 south. One of the two major strains of Prochlorococcus lives near the surface where light is abundant, whereas a second strain conducts photosynthesis to depths of 200 m reached by only a fraction of 1% of incident light. Despite their small cell size, Prochlorococcus produce a significant fraction of photosynthetically generated biomass and are very important in marine food chains. Because they fix vast quantities of carbon dioxide, they have a potentially significant role in the alleviation of greenhouse warming effects. They are noted for their rapid genetic adaptation abilities, which hopefully will enable them to continue functioning efficiently under altered conditions, such as reduced pH in ocean waters, caused by elevated carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. 6.5.2 OXIC AND ANOXIC BACTERIA Another classification system for bacteria depends on their requirement for molecular oxygen. Oxic (aerobic bacteria) require oxygen as an electron receptor: O2 + 4H+ + 4e\u2212 \u00c6 2H2O (6.4) Anaerobic bacteria, or anoxic bacteria, function only in the complete absence of molecular oxygen. Frequently, molecular oxygen is quite toxic to anoxic bacteria. Anoxic bacteria have gained increasing attention for their ability to degrade organic wastes. A third class of bacteria, facultative bacteria, utilize free oxygen when it is available and use other substances as electron receptors (oxidants) when molecular oxygen is not available. Common oxygen substitutes in water are nitrate ion (see Section 6.11) and sulfate ion (see Section 6.12). 6.5.3 MARINE BACTERIA Most of the attention that has been given to bacteria in water has been focused on bacteria found in freshwater. Recently, more attention has been given to marine bacteria including those in ocean sediments. An example of such bacteria is Salinospora, a type of actinomycete bacteria that thrive in ocean sediments under dark, cold, high pressure, saline conditions. Known freshwater and terrestrial actinomycetes have been the major source of antibiotics such as streptomycin and vancomycin and the possibility of finding new antibiotics and even anticancer drugs in marine actinomycetes has generated intense interest in these organisms. Cell membrane Mesosome Nuclear body Cytoplasm Cell wall Inclusion Capsule Ribosomes Pili 6.6 THE PROKARYOTIC BACTERIAL CELL Figure 6.3 illustrates a generic prokaryotic bacterial cell. Bacterial cells are enclosed in a cell wall, which holds the contents of the bacterial cell and determines the shape of the cell. The cell wall in many bacteria is frequently surrounded by a slime layer (capsule). This layer protects the bacteria and helps the bacterial cells to adhere to surfaces.", "The cell membrane or cytoplasmic membrane composed of protein and phospholipid occurs as a thin layer only about 7 nm in thickness on the inner surface of the cell wall enclosing the cellular cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic membrane is of crucial importance to cell function in that it controls the nature and quantity of materials transported into and out of the cell. It is also very susceptible to damage from some toxic substances. Folds in the cytoplasmic membrane called mesosomes serve several functions. One of these is to increase the surface area of the membrane to enhance transport of materials through it. Another function is to act as a site for division of the cell during reproduction. Bacterial DNA is separated at the mesosome during cell division. Hairlike pili on the surface of a bacterial cell enable the cell to stick to surfaces. Specialized sex pili enable nucleic acid transfer between bacterial cells during an exchange of genetic material. Somewhat similar to pili\u2014but larger, more complex, and fewer in number\u2014are fl agella, moveable appendages that cause bacterial cells to move by their whipping action. Bacteria with flagella are termed motile. Bacterial cells are filled with an aqueous solution and suspension containing proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, ions, and other materials. Collectively, these materials are referred to as cytoplasm, the medium in which the cell\u2019s metabolic processes are carried out. The major cell bodies suspended in cytoplasm are the following. \u2022 Nuclear body consisting of a single DNA macromolecule that controls metabolic processes and reproduction \u2022 Inclusions of reserve food material consisting of fats, carbohydrates, and even elemental sulfur \u2022 Ribosomes, which are sites of protein synthesis and which contain protein and RNA Time 6.7 KINETICS OF BACTERIAL GROWTH The population size of bacteria and unicellular algae as a function of time in a growth culture is illustrated by Figure 6.4, which shows a population curve for a bacterial culture. Such a culture is started by inoculating a rich nutrient medium with a small number of bacterial cells. The population curve consists of four regions. The first region is characterized by little bacterial reproduction and is called the lag phase. The lag phase occurs because the bacteria must become acclimated to the new medium. Following the lag phase comes a period of very rapid bacterial growth. This is the log phase, or exponential phase, during which the population doubles over a regular time interval called the generation time. This behavior can be described by a mathematical expression that applies when the growth rate is proportional to the number of individuals present and there are no limiting factors such as death or lack of food: dN = kN (6.5) dt \u00ca N \u02c6 kt ln = kt or N = N e (6.6) \u00c1\u02dc 0 \u00cb N0 \u00af where N is the population at time t and N0 is the population at time t = 0. Thus, another way of describing population growth during the log phase is to say that the logarithm of bacterial population increases linearly with time. The generation time, or doubling time, is (ln 2)/k, analogous to the half-life of radioactive decay. Fast growth during the log phase can cause very rapid microbial transformations of chemical species in water. The log phase terminates and the stationary phase begins when a limiting factor is encountered. Typical factors limiting growth are depletion of an essential nutrient, buildup of toxic material, and exhaustion of oxygen. During the stationary phase, the number of viable cells remains virtually constant. After the stationary phase, the bacteria begin to die faster than they reproduce, and the population enters the death phase. 6.8 BACTERIAL METABOLISM Bacteria obtain the energy and raw materials needed for their metabolic processes and reproduction by mediating chemical reactions. Nature provides a large number of such reactions, and bacterial species have evolved that utilize many of these. As a consequence of their participation in such reactions, bacteria are involved in many biogeochemical processes in water and soil. Bacteria are essential participants in many important elemental cycles in nature, including those of nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur. They are responsible for the formation of many mineral deposits, including some of iron and manganese. On a smaller scale, some of these deposits form through bacterial action in natural water systems and even in pipes used to transport water. Bacterial metabolism addresses the biochemical processes by which chemical species are modified in bacterial cells.", "It is basically a means of deriving energy and cellular material from nutrient substances. Figure 6.5 summarizes the essential features of bacterial metabolism. The two major divisions of bacterial metabolism are catabolism, energy-yielding degradative metabolism that breaks macromolecules down to their small monomeric constituents, and anabolism, synthetic metabolism in which small molecules are assembled into large ones. A key distinction among bacteria has to do with the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain involved in the process by which bacteria gain energy by oxidizing food materials. If the terminal electron acceptor is molecular O2, the process is oxic respiration. If it is another reducible species, commonly including SO42\u2212, NO3\u2212, HCO3\u2212, or iron(III), the process is called anoxic respiration. As examples, Desulfovibrio bacteria convert SO42\u2212 to H2S, Methanobacterium reduce HCO3\u2212 to CH4, and assorted bacteria reduce NO3\u2212 to NO2\u2212, N2O, N2, or NH4 +. 6.8.1 FACTORS AFFECTING BACTERIAL METABOLISM Bacterial metabolic reactions are mediated by enzymes, biochemical catalysts endogenous to living organisms that are discussed in detail in Chapter 22. Enzymatic processes in bacteria are essentially the same as those in other organisms. At this point, however, it is useful to review several factors that influence bacterial enzyme activity and, therefore, bacterial growth. Figure 6.6 illustrates the effect of substrate concentration on enzyme activity, where a substrate is a substance on which an enzyme acts. It is seen that enzyme activity increases in a linear fashion up to a value that represents saturation of the enzyme activity. Beyond this concentration, increasing substrate levels do not result in increased enzyme activity. This kind of behavior is reflected in bacterial activity, which increases with available nutrients up to a saturation value. Superimposed on this plot in a bacterial system is increased bacterial population which, in effect, increases the amount of available enzyme. Figure 6.7 shows the effect of temperature on enzyme activity and on bacterial growth and metabolism. Over a relatively short range of temperature in which the bacteria thrive, enzyme activity increases with temperature. The curve shows a maximum growth rate with an optimum temperature that is skewed toward the high-temperature end of the curve, and exhibits an abrupt drop-off beyond the temperature maximum. This occurs because enzymes are destroyed by being denatured at temperatures not far above the optimum. Bacteria show different temperature optima. Psychrophilic bacteria are bacteria having temperature optima below approximately 20\u00b0C. The temperature optima of mesophilic bacteria lie between 20\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C. Bacteria having temperature optima above 45\u00b0C are called thermophilic bacteria. The temperature range for optimum growth of different kinds of bacteria is remarkably wide, with some bacteria being able to grow at 0\u00b0C, and some thermophilic bacteria existing in boiling hot water. There has been much interest in the adaptation of thermophilic bacteria and their enzymes to industrial applications because, as shown by Figure 6.7, enzyme activity generally increases with increasing temperature.2 An example of such an application is the potential use of a heat-resistant catalase enzyme from a thermophilic bacterium isolated from a hot spring pool in Yellowstone National Park to catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide in industrial bleaching wastewaters. The application of hydrogen peroxide as a bleaching agent has increased greatly in recent years because it is generally regarded as more of a \u201cgreen chemical\u201d than chlorine and hypochlorite that it has been replacing. It is important to break down spent hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water before it is discharged, but catalase enzymes from conventional sources are inhibited or destroyed pH at the elevated temperatures and pH values typical of the bleaching solutions. However, the catalase enzyme from thermophilic bacteria can function well at 70\u00b0C and a pH up to 10. Figure 6.8 is a plot of pH versus bacterial enzyme activity. Although the optimum pH will vary somewhat, enzymes typically have a pH optimum around neutrality. Enzymes tend to become denatured at pH extremes. For some bacteria, such as those that generate sulfuric acid by the oxidation of sulfide or that produce organic acids by fermentation of organic matter, the pH optimum may be quite acidic. 6.8.2 MICROBIAL OXIDATION AND REDUCTION The metabolic processes by which bacteria obtain their energy involve mediation of oxidation\u2013 reduction reactions. The most environmentally important oxidation\u2013reduction reactions occurring in water and soil through the action of bacteria are summarized in Table 6.1. Much of the remainder of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of important redox reactions mediated by bacteria, particularly those summarized in Table 6.1.

For most microorganisms, the bulk of net energy-yielding or energy-consuming metabolic processes involve changes in the oxidation state of carbon. These chemical transformations of carbon have important environmental implications. For example, when algae and other plants fi x CO2 as carbohydrate, represented as {CH2O}, CO2 + H2O + hn \u00c6 {CH2O} + O2(g) (6.7) carbon changes from the +4 to the 0 oxidation state. Energy from sunlight is stored as chemical energy in organic compounds. However, when the algae die, bacterial decomposition occurs through oxic respiration in the reverse of the biochemical process represented by the above reaction for photo synthesis, energy is released, and oxygen is consumed.", "In the presence of oxygen, the principal energy-yielding reaction of bacteria is the oxidation of organic matter. Since it is generally more meaningful to compare reactions on the basis of the reaction of one electron-mole, the oxic degradation of organic matter is conveniently written as 1 111 {CHO}+ O(g) \u00c6 CO + HO (6.8) 4 2 42 4242 for which the free-energy change is \u221229.9 kcal (see oxic respiration, Table 6.1). From this general type of reaction, bacteria and other microorganisms extract the energy needed to carry out their metabolic processes, to synthesize new cell material, for reproduction, and for locomotion. Partial microbial decomposition of organic matter is a major step in the production of peat, lignite, coal, oil shale, and petroleum. Under reducing conditions, particularly below water, the oxygen content of the original plant material (approximate empirical formula, {CH2O}) is lowered, leaving materials with relatively higher carbon contents. 6.9.1 METHANE-FORMING BACTERIA The production of methane in anoxic (oxygenless) sediments is favored by high organic levels and low nitrate and sulfate levels. Methane production plays a key role in local and global carbon cycles as the final step in the anoxic decomposition of organic matter. This process is the source of about 80% of the methane entering the atmosphere. The carbon from microbially produced methane can come from either the reduction of CO2 or the fermentation of organic matter, particularly acetate. The anoxic production of methane can be represented in the following simplified manner. When carbon dioxide acts as an electron receptor in the absence of oxygen, methane gas is produced: 1 +-11 CO + H + e \u00c6 CH + H O (6.9) 82 8442 This reaction is mediated by methane-forming bacteria. When organic matter is degraded microbially, the half-reaction for one electron-mole of {CH2O} is 1 11 + {CH O} + HO \u00c6 CO + H + e (6.10) 4242 42 Adding half-reactions 6.9 and 6.10 yields the overall reaction for the anoxic degradation of organic matter by methane-forming bacteria, which involves a free-energy change of \u22125.55 kcal per electron-mole: 1 11 {CH O} \u00c6 CH + CO (6.11) 4 2 8482 This reaction, in reality a series of complicated processes, is a fermentation reaction, defi ned as a redox process in which both the oxidizing agent and reducing agent are organic substances. It may be seen that only about one-fifth as much free energy is obtained from one electron-mole of methane formation as from a one electron-mole reaction involving complete oxidation of the organic matter, Reaction 6.8. Methane formation is a valuable process responsible for the degradation of large quantities of organic wastes, both in biological waste-treatment processes (see Chapter 8) and in nature. Methane production is used in biological waste treatment plants to further degrade excess sludge from the activated sludge process. In the bottom regions of natural waters, methane-forming bacteria degrade organic matter in the absence of oxygen. This eliminates organic matter, which would otherwise require oxygen for its biodegradation. If this organic matter were transported to oxic water containing dissolved O2, it would exert a BOD. Methane production is a very efficient means for the removal of BOD. The reaction CH4 + 2O2 \u00c6 CO2 + 2H2O (6.12) shows that 1 mol of methane requires 2 mols of oxygen for its oxidation to CO2. Therefore, the production of 1 mol of methane and its subsequent evolution from water are equivalent to the removal of 2 mols of oxygen demand. In a sense, therefore, the removal of 16 g (1 mol) of methane is equivalent to the addition of 64 g (2 mols) of available oxygen to the water. In favorable cases, methane fuel can be produced cost-effectively as a renewable resource from anoxic digestion of organic wastes. Some installations use cattle feedlot wastes. Methane is routinely generated by the action of anoxic bacteria and is used for heat and engine fuel at sewage treatment plants (see Chapter 8). Methane produced underground in municipal landfills is being tapped by some municipalities; however, methane seeping into basements of buildings constructed on landfill containing garbage has caused serious explosions and fi res. 6.9.2 BACTERIAL UTILIZATION OF HYDROCARBONS Methane is oxidized under oxic conditions by a number of strains of bacteria. One of these, Methanomonas, is a highly specialized organism that cannot use any material other than methane as an energy source. Methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid are intermediates in the microbial oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide.", "As discussed in Section 6.10, several types of bacteria can degrade higher hydrocarbons and use them as energy and carbon sources. 6.9.3 MICROBIAL UTILIZATION OF CARBON MONOXIDE Carbon monoxide is removed from the atmosphere by contact with soil. Since neither sterilized soil nor green plants grown under sterile conditions show any capacity to remove carbon monoxide from air, this ability must be because of microorganisms in the soil. Fungi capable of CO metabolism include some commonly occurring strains of the ubiquitous Penicillium and Aspergillus. It is also possible that some bacteria are involved in CO removal. However some microorganisms metabolize CO, other aquatic and terrestrial organisms produce this gas. 6.10 BIODEGRADATION OF ORGANIC MATTER The biodegradation of organic matter in the aquatic and terrestrial environments is a crucial environmental process. Some organic pollutants are biocidal; for example, effective fungicides must be antimicrobial in action. Therefore, in addition to killing harmful fungi, fungicides frequently harm beneficial saprophytic fungi (fungi that decompose dead organic matter) and bacteria. Herbicides, which are designed for plant control, and insecticides, which are used to control insects, generally do not have any detrimental effect on microorganisms. The biodegradation of organic matter by microorganisms occurs by way of a number of stepwise, microbially catalyzed reactions. These reactions will be discussed individually with examples. 6.10.1 OXIDATION Oxidation occurs by the action of oxygenase enzymes (see Chapter 22 for a discussion of biochemical terms). Epoxidation is a major step in many oxidation mechanisms and consists of adding an oxygen atom between two C atoms in an unsaturated system as shown for benzene below: Epoxidation is a particularly important means of metabolic attack upon aromatic rings that abound in many xenobiotic compounds and is part of the process by which potentially carcinogenic PAH compounds such as benzo(a)pyrene are biodegraded.3 Epoxidation of an aromatic ring may be followed by ring cleavage, an important step in the biodegradation of aromatic compounds: CO2H (6.14) CO2H 6.10.1.1 Microbial Oxidation of Hydrocarbons The degradation of hydrocarbons by microbial oxidation is an important environmental process because it is the primary means by which petroleum wastes are eliminated from water and soil. Bacteria capable of degrading hydrocarbons include Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Nocardia. The most common initial step in the microbial oxidation of alkanes involves conversion of a terminal \u2013CH3 group to a \u2013CO2H group. After formation of a carboxylic acid from the alkane, further oxidation normally occurs by b-oxidation: CH3CH2CH2CH2CO2H + 3O2 \u00c6 CH3CH2CO2H + 2CO2 + 2H2O (6.15) A complicated cycle with a number of steps is involved in b-oxidation. The residue at the end of each cycle is an organic acid with two fewer carbon atoms than its precursor at the beginning of the cycle. Hydrocarbons vary significantly in their biodegradability, and microorganisms show a strong preference for straight-chain hydrocarbons. A major reason for this preference is that branching inhibits b-oxidation at the site of the branch. The presence of a quaternary carbon (below) particularly inhibits alkane degradation. CH3 C C CH3 CH3 The biodegradation of petroleum is essential for the elimination of oil spills (of the order of a million metric tons per year). This oil is degraded by both marine bacteria and fi lamentous fungi. In some cases, the rate of degradation is limited by available nitrate and phosphate and it has been observed that the microbial degradation of hydrocarbons from oil spills is enhanced by providing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrients. The physical form of crude oil makes a large difference in its degradability. Degradation in water occurs at the water\u2013oil interface and in layers of oil floating on top of water and exposed to the atmosphere. Therefore, thick layers of crude oil prevent contact with bacterial enzymes and O2. Hydroxylation often accompanies microbial oxidation. It is the attachment of \u2013OH groups to hydrocarbon chains or rings. In the biodegradation of foreign compounds, hydroxylation often follows epoxidation as shown by the following rearrangement reaction for benzene epoxide: Hydroxylation can consist of the addition of more than one hydroxide group. An example of epoxidation and hydroxylation is the metabolic production of carcinogenic 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide from benzo(a)pyrene discussed in Section 24.4. 6.10.2 OTHER BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSES IN BIODEGRADATION OF ORGANICS Hydrolysis, which involves the addition of H2O to a molecule accompanied by cleavage of the molecule into two products, is a major step in microbial degradation of many pollutant compounds, especially pesticidal esters, amides, and organophosphate esters.", "The types of enzymes that bring about hydrolysis are hydrolase enzymes; those that enable the hydrolysis of esters are called esterases, whereas those that hydrolyze amides are amidases. At least one species of Pseudomonas hydrolyzes malathion in a type of hydrolysis reaction typical of those by which pesticides are degraded: SHO S H2O (CH3O)2P S C C O C2H5 (CH3O)2P SH + HOH CC O C2H5 (6.16) HO CCOC2H5Malathion HO HC CO C2H5 HO Reductions are carried out by reductase enzymes; for example, nitroreductase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of the nitro group. Table 6.2 gives the major kinds of functional groups reduced by microorganisms. Dehalogenation reactions of organohalide compounds involve the bacterially mediated replacement of a covalently bound halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) with \u2013OH, and are discussed in more detail in Section 6.13. Many environmentally signifi cant organic compounds contain alkyl groups, such as the methyl (\u2013CH3) group, attached to atoms of O, N, and S. An important step in the microbial metabolism of many of these compounds is dealkylation, replacement of alkyl groups by H as shown in Figure 6.9. Examples of these kinds of reactions include O-dealkylation of methoxychlor insecticides, N-dealkylation of carbaryl insecticide, and S-dealkylation of dimethyl sulfi de. Alkyl groups removed by dealkylation usually are attached to oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen atoms; those attached to carbon are normally not removed directly by microbial processes.

This cycle describes the dynamic processes through which nitrogen is interchanged among the atmosphere, organic matter, and inorganic compounds. It is one of nature\u2019s most vital dynamic processes. Among the biochemical transformations in the nitrogen cycle are nitrogen fi xation, whereby molecular nitrogen is fi xed as organic nitrogen; nitrification, the process of oxidizing ammonia to nitrate; nitrate reduction, the process by which nitrogen in nitrate ion is reduced to form compounds having nitrogen in a lower oxidation state; and denitrification, the reduction of nitrate and nitrite to N2, with a resultant net loss of nitrogen gas to the atmosphere. Each of these important chemical processes will be discussed separately. H H N-dealkylationRN CH3 RN H O-dealkylation O RO CH3 ROH + HCH S-dealkylation RS CH3 RSH FIGURE 6.9 Metabolic dealkylation reactions shown for the removal of CH3 from N, O, and S atoms in organic compounds. 6.11.1 NITROGEN FIXATION The overall microbial process for nitrogen fixation, the binding of atmospheric nitrogen in a chemically combined form 3{CH2O} + 2N2 + 3H2O + 4H+ \u00c6 3CO2 + 4NH4 + (6.17) is actually quite a complicated process that is the subject of extensive investigation. Biological nitrogen fixation is a key biochemical process in the environment and is essential for plant growth in the absence of synthetic fertilizers. Only a few species of aquatic microorganisms have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Among the aquatic bacteria having this capability are photosynthetic bacteria, Azotobacter, several species of Clostridium, and cyanobacteria. In most natural freshwater systems, however, the fraction of nitrogen fixed by organisms in the water relative to that originating from the decay of organic material, fertilizer runoff, and other external sources is relatively low. The best-known and most important form of nitrogen-fixing bacteria is Rhizobium, which enjoys a symbiotic (mutually advantageous) relationship with leguminous plants such as clover or alfalfa. The Rhizobium bacteria are found in root nodules, special structures bound to the roots of legumes (see Figure 16.2) and connected directly to the vascular (circulatory) system of the plant, enabling the bacteria to derive photosynthetically produced energy directly from the plant. Thus, the plant provides the energy required to break the strong triple bonds in the dinitrogen molecule, converting the nitrogen to a reduced form which is directly assimilated by the plant. When the legumes die and decay, NH4 + ion is released and is converted by microorganisms to nitrate ion, which is assimilable by other plants.", "Some of the ammonium ion and nitrate released may be carried into natural water systems. Some nonlegume angiosperms fix nitrogen through the action of actinomycetes bacteria contained in root nodules. Shrubs and trees in the nitrogen-fixing category are abundant in fi elds, forests, and wetlands throughout the world. Their rate of nitrogen fixation is comparable to that of legumes. Free-living bacteria associated with some grasses are stimulated by the grasses to fi x nitrogen. One such bacterium is Spirillumlipoferum. In tropical surroundings, the amount of reduced nitrogen fixed by such bacteria can amount to the order of 100 kg per hectare per year. Because of the cost of energy required to fix nitrogen synthetically, efforts are underway to increase the efficiency of natural means of nitrogen fixation. One approach uses recombinant DNA methodologies in attempts to transfer the nitrogen-fixing capabilities of nitrogen-fi xing bacteria directly to plant cells. Although a fascinating possibility, this transfer has not yet been achieved on a practical basis. The other approach uses more conventional plant breeding and biological techniques in attempts to increase the range and effectiveness of the symbiotic relationship existing between some plants and nitrogen-fi xing bacteria. One matter of concern is that successful efforts to increase nitrogen fixation may upset the global nitrogen balance. Total annual global fixation of nitrogen is now more than 50% higher than the preindustrial level of 150 million metric tons estimated for 1850. Potential accumulation of excess fixed nitrogen is the subject of some concern because of aquatic nitrate pollution and microbial production of N2O gas. Some atmospheric scientists fear that excess N2O gas may be involved in depletion of the protective atmospheric ozone layer (see Chapter 14). 6.11.2 NITRIFICATION Nitrifi cation, the conversion of N(\u2212III) to N(V), is a very common and extremely important process in water and in soil. Aquatic nitrogen in thermodynamic equilibrium with air is in the +5 oxidation state as NO3\u2212, whereas in most biological compounds, nitrogen is present as N(\u2212III), such as \u2013NH2 in amino acids. The equilibrium constant of the overall nitrification reaction, written for one electron-mole 11 111 O + NH+\u00c6 NO-+ H++ H O (6.18) 4284 834 82 is 107.59 (Table 6.1), showing that the reaction is highly favored from a thermodynamic viewpoint. Nitrification is especially important in nature because nitrogen is absorbed by plants primarily as nitrate. When fertilizers are applied in the form of ammonium salts or anhydrous ammonia, a microbial transformation to nitrate enables maximum assimilation of nitrogen by the plants. In nature, nitrification is catalyzed by two groups of bacteria, Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter. Nitrosomonas bacteria bring about the transition of ammonia to nitrite 3 + NH + O \u00c6 H + NO + H O (6.19) 322 22 whereas Nitrobacter mediates the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate: NO-+ 1O \u00c6 NO-(6.20) 222 3 Both of these highly specialized types of bacteria are obligate aerobes; that is, they function only in the presence of molecular O2. These bacteria are also chemolithotrophic, meaning that they can utilize oxidizable inorganic materials as electron donors in oxidation reactions to yield needed energy for metabolic processes. For the oxic conversion of one electron-mole of ammoniacal nitrogen to nitrite ion at pH 7.00, 11 111 O + NH+\u00c6 NO-+ H++ H O (6.21) 4264 623 62 the free-energy change is \u221210.8 kcal. The free-energy change for the oxic oxidation of one electron-mole of nitrite ion to nitrate ion: 11 1 O + NO-\u00c6 NO-(6.22) 4222 23 is \u22129.0 kcal. Both steps of the nitrification process involve an appreciable yield of free energy. 6.11.3 NITRATE REDUCTION As a general term, nitrate reduction refers to microbial processes by which nitrogen in chemical compounds is reduced to lower oxidation states. In the absence of free oxygen, nitrate may be used by some bacteria as an alternate electron receptor. The most complete possible reduction of nitrogen in nitrate ion involves the acceptance of eight electrons by the nitrogen atom, with the consequent conversion of nitrate to ammonia (+V to \u2212III oxidation state). Nitrogen is an essential component of protein, and any organism that utilizes nitrogen from nitrate for the synthesis of protein must fi rst reduce the nitrogen to the \u2212III oxidation state (ammoniacal form). However, incorporation of nitrogen into protein generally is a relatively minor use of the nitrate undergoing microbially mediated reactions and is more properly termed nitrate assimilation. Nitrate ion functioning as an electron receptor usually produces NO2\u2212: 11 111 NO-+ {CH O} \u00c6 NO-+ H O + CO (6.23)", "2 34 2 2 24242 The free-energy yield per electron-mole is only about two-third of the yield when oxygen is the oxidant; however, nitrate ion is a good electron receptor in the absence of O2. One of the factors limiting the use of nitrate ion in this function is its generally low concentration in most waters. Furthermore, nitrite, NO2\u2212, is relatively toxic and tends to inhibit the growth of many bacteria after building up to a certain level. Sodium nitrate has been used as a \u201cfirst-aid\u201d treatment in sewage lagoons that have become oxygen deficient. It provides an emergency source of oxygen to reestablish normal bacterial growth. Nitrate ion can be an effective oxidizing agent for a number of species in water that are oxidized by the action of microorganisms. Therefore, nitrate salts are sometimes added as an alternate source of oxygen in the biological treatment of oxidizable wastes. 6.11.4 DENITRIFICATION An important special case of nitrate reduction is denitrifi cation, in which the reduced nitrogen product is a nitrogen-containing gas, usually N2. At pH 7.00, the free-energy change per electron-mole of reaction 1 \u2212 11 + 11 7 NO + {CH O}+ H \u00c6 N + CO + H O (6.24) 5 34 2 5 10 24 220 2 is \u22122.84 kcal. The free-energy yield per mole of nitrate reduced to N2 (five electron-moles) is lower than that for the reduction of the same quantity of nitrate to nitrite. More important, however, the reduction of a nitrate ion to N2 gas consumes five electrons, compared to only two electrons for the reduction of NO3\u2212 to NO2\u2212. Denitrification is an important process in nature. It is the mechanism by which fixed nitrogen is returned to the atmosphere. Denitrification is also used in advanced water treatment for the removal of nutrient nitrogen (see Chapter 8). Because nitrogen gas is a nontoxic volatile substance that does not inhibit microbial growth, and since nitrate ion is a very efficient electron acceptor, denitrifi cation allows the extensive growth of bacteria under anoxic conditions. Loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere may also occur through the formation of N2O and NO by bacterial action on nitrate and nitrite catalyzed by the action of several types of bacteria. Production of N2O relative to N2 is enhanced during denitrification in soils by increased concentrations of NO3\u2212, NO2\u2212, and O2. 6.11.5 COMPETITIVE OXIDATION OF ORGANIC MATTER BY NITRATE ION AND OTHER OXIDIZING AGENTS The successive oxidation of organic matter by dissolved O2, NO3\u2212, and SO42\u2212 brings about an interesting sequence of nitrate-ion levels in sediments and hypolimnion waters initially containing O2 but lacking a mechanism for reaeration. This is shown in Figure 6.11, where concentrations of dissolved O2, NO3\u2212, and SO42\u2212 are plotted as a function of total organic matter metabolized. This behavior can be explained by the following sequence of biochemical processes: FIGURE 6.11 Oxidation of organic matter by O2, NO3\u2212, and SO42\u2212. O2 + organic matter \u00c6 products (6.25) NO3\u2212 + organic matter \u00c6 products (6.26) SO42\u2212 + organic matter \u00c6 products (6.27) So long as some O2 is present, some nitrate may be produced from nitrogenous organic matter. After exhaustion of molecular oxygen, nitrate is the favored oxidizing agent, and its concentration falls from a maximum value (I) to zero (II). Sulfate, which is usually present in a large excess over the other two oxidants, then becomes the favored electron receptor, enabling biodegradation of organic matter to continue. 6.12 MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULFUR 6.12.1 PHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS Biodegradation of phosphorus compounds is important in the environment for two reasons. The fi rst of these is that it provides a source of algal nutrient orthophosphate from the hydrolysis of polyphosphates (see Section 3.16). Secondly, biodegradation deactivates toxic organophosphate compounds, such as the organophosphate insecticides. The organophosphorus compounds of greatest environmental concern tend to be sulfur-containing phosphorothionate and phosphordithioate ester insecticides. These are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, Section 7.11, and structural formulas of several representative examples are shown in Figure 7.8. The biodegradation of these compounds is an important environmental chemical process. Fortunately, unlike the organohalide insecticides that they largely displaced until less toxic classes of compounds came into general use, the organophosphates readily undergo biodegradation and do not bioaccumulate. Hydrolysis is an important step in the biodegradation of phosphorothionate, phosphorodithioate, and phosphate ester insecticides leading to their detoxification and loss of insecticidal activity.", "Hydrolysis of these insecticides is shown by the following general reactions where R is an alkyl group, Ar is a substituent group that is frequently aromatic, and X is either S or O: OH + HOAr (6.28) X X R O P O SAr H2O R O P O OH + HSAr (6.29) R R 6.12.2 SULFUR COMPOUNDS Sulfur compounds are very common in water. Sulfate ion, SO42\u2212, is found in varying concentrations in practically all natural waters. Organic sulfur compounds, both those of natural origin and pollutant species, are very common in natural aquatic systems, and the degradation of these compounds is an important microbial process. Sometimes the degradation products, such as odiferous and toxic H2S, cause serious problems with water quality. Sulfur in living material is present primarily in its most reduced state, for example, as the hydro-sulfide group, \u2212SH. When organic sulfur compounds are decomposed by bacteria, the initial sulfur product is generally the reduced form, H2S. Some bacteria produce and store elemental sulfur from sulfur compounds. In the presence of oxygen, some bacteria convert reduced forms of sulfur to the oxidized form in SO42\u2212 ion. 6.12.2.1 Oxidation of H2S and Reduction of Sulfate by Bacteria In the presence of oxygen some bacteria can oxidize sulfi de (H2S) to sulfate and in the absence of oxygen other bacteria can reduce sulfate to sulfi de.5 The bacteria Desulfovibrio can reduce inorganic sulfate ion to H2S. In so doing , they utilize sulfate as an electron acceptor in the oxidation of organic matter. The overall reaction for the microbially mediated oxidation of biomass with sulfate is SO42\u2212 + 2{CH2O} + 2H+ \u00c6 H2S + 2CO2 + 2H2O (6.30) and it requires other bacteria besides Desulfovibrio to oxidize organic matter completely to CO2. Because of the high concentration of sulfate ion in seawater, bacterially mediated formation of H2S causes pollution problems in some coastal areas and is a major source of atmospheric sulfur. In waters where sulfide formation occurs, the sediment is often black in color due to the formation of FeS. Some bacteria such as purple sulfur bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can oxidize sulfur in hydrogen sulfide to higher oxidation states. The oxic colorless sulfur bacteria may use molecular oxygen to oxidize H2S to elemental sulfur and can oxidize elemental S and thiosulfate (S2O32\u2212) to sulfate. Oxidation of sulfur in a low oxidation state to sulfate ion produces sulfuric acid, a strong acid. One of the colorless sulfur bacteria, Thiobacillus thiooxidans, is tolerant of one normal acid solutions; a remarkable acid tolerance. When elemental sulfur is added to excessively alkaline soils, the acidity is increased because of a microorganism-mediated reaction, which produces sulfuric acid. Elemental sulfur may be deposited as granules in the cells of purple sulfur bacteria and colorless sulfur bacteria. Such processes are important sources of elemental sulfur deposits. 6.12.3 MICROORGANISM-MEDIATED DEGRADATION OF ORGANIC SULFUR COMPOUNDS Sulfur occurs in many types of biological compounds. As a consequence, organic sulfur compounds of natural and pollutant origin are very common in water. The degradation of these compounds is an important microbial process having a strong effect upon water quality. Among some of the common sulfur-containing functional groups found in aquatic organic O compounds are hydrosulfide (\u2013SH), disulfide (\u2013SS\u2013), sulfide (\u2013S\u2013), sulfoxide (S ), sulfonic acid S (\u2013SO2OH), thioketone ( ), and thiazole (a heterocyclic sulfur group). Protein contains some C amino acids with sulfur functional groups\u2014cysteine, O H H \u2013O C C C SH H Cysteine NH+3 cystine, and methionine\u2014whose breakdown is important in natural waters. The amino acids are readily degraded by bacteria and fungi. The biodegradation of sulfur-containing amino acids can result in production of volatile organic sulfur compounds such as methane thiol, CH3SH, and dimethyl disulfi de, CH3SSCH3. These compounds have strong, unpleasant odors. Their formation, in addition to that of H2S, accounts for much of the odor associated with the biodegradation of sulfur-containing organic compounds. Hydrogen sulfide is formed from a large variety of organic compounds through the action of a number of different kinds of microorganisms. A typical sulfur-cleavage reaction producing H2S is the conversion of cysteine to pyruvic acid through the action of cysteine desulfhydrase enzyme in bacteria: HH OO \u2013 Bacteria HS C C +H2O H3CC COH+ + CO2 H2SNH3 (6.31) Cysteine desulfhydrase + H NH3 Because of the numerous forms in which organic sulfur may exist, a variety of sulfur products and biochemical reaction paths must be associated with the biodegradation of organic sulfur compounds.", "6.13 MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF HALOGENS AND ORGANOHALIDES Microbially mediated reactions are important in the environmental degradation of pollutant organohalide compounds.6 Dehalogenation reactions involving the replacement of a halogen atom, for example, represent a major pathway for the biodegradation of organohalide hydrocarbons. In some cases, organohalide compounds serve as sole carbon sources, sole energy sources, or electron acceptors for anoxic bacteria. Microorganisms need not utilize a particular organohalide compound as a sole carbon source in order to cause its degradation. This is due to the phenomenon of cometabolism, which results from a lack of specificity in the microbial degradation processes. Thus, bacterial degradation of small amounts of an organohalide compound may occur while the microorganism involved is metabolizing much larger quantities of another substance. Some anoxic bacteria can reductively dechlorinate chlorinated aliphatic and aromatic compounds using relatively highly chlorinated compounds as electron acceptors as illustrated by the reaction {CH2O} + H2O + 2Cl\u2212R \u00c6 CO2 + 2H+ + 2Cl\u2212 + 2H\u2212R (6.32) where Cl\u2013R represents a site of chlorine substitution on a chlorinated hydrocarbon molecule and H\u2013R represents a site of hydrogen substitution. The net result of this process called dehalorespiration is the replacement of Cl by H on chlorinated hydrocarbons. Microbially mediated dichloroelimination from 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane in the anoxic biodegradation of this compound can produce one of three possible isomers of dichloroethylene; the process followed by successive hydrogenolysis reactions can produce vinyl chloride and ethene (ethylene): Cl Cl H Cl Cl Cl H Cl\u2013 2Cl H C C H C C C C C C H Cl H H Cl H Cl Cl H Cl H H \u2013 Cl (6.33) C C C C H HH H Vinyl Ethene chloride (ethylene) Successive hydrogenolysis reactions of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane can produce ethane derivatives with 3, 2, 1, and 0 chlorine atoms Cl Cl Cl H H H H H (6.34) H H H Cl Bioconversion of DDT to replace Cl with H yields DDD: Cl H Cl C Cl Cl C Cl Cl C Cl Cl C Cl H H DDT DDD The latter compound is more toxic to some insects than DDT and has even been manufactured as a pesticide. 6.14 MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF METALS AND METALLOIDS Some bacteria, including Ferrobacillus, Gallionella, and some forms of Sphaerotilus, utilize iron compounds to obtain energy for their metabolic needs. These bacteria catalyze the oxidation of iron(II) to iron(III) by molecular oxygen: 4Fe(II) + 4H+ + O2 \u00c6 4Fe(III) + 2H2O (6.35) Individual strand of hydratediron(III) hydroxide Stalk of hydrated iron(III) hydroxide The carbon source for some of these bacteria is CO2. Since they do not require organic matter for carbon, and they derive energy from the oxidation of inorganic matter, these bacteria may thrive in environments where organic matter is absent. The microorganism-mediated oxidation of iron(II) is not a particularly efficient means of obtaining energy for metabolic processes. For the reaction FeCO (s)+ 1O + 3HO \u00c6 Fe(OH) (s)+ CO (6.36) 3 4222 3 2 the change in free energy is approximately 10 kcal/electron-mole. Approximately 220 g of iron(II) must be oxidized to produce 1.0 g of cell carbon. The calculation assumes CO2 as a carbon source and a biological efficiency of 5%. The production of only 1.0 g of cell carbon would produce approximately 430 g of solid Fe(OH)3. It follows that large deposits of hydrated iron(III) oxide form in areas where iron-oxidizing bacteria thrive. Some of the iron bacteria, notably Gallionella, secrete large quantities of hydrated iron(III) oxide in intricately branched structures. The bacterial cell grows at the end of a twisted stalk of the iron oxide. Individual cells of Gallionella, photographed through an electron microscope, have shown that the stalks consist of a number of strands of iron oxide secreted from one side of the cell (Figure 6.12). At nearly neutral pH values, bacteria deriving energy by mediating the air oxidation of iron(II) must compete with direct chemical oxidation of iron(II) by O2. The latter process is relatively rapid at pH 7. As a consequence, these bacteria tend to grow in a narrow layer in the region between the oxygen source and the source of iron(II). Therefore, iron bacteria are sometimes called gradient organisms, and they grow at intermediate pE values. Bacteria are strongly involved in the oceanic manganese cycle. Manganese nodules, a potentially important source of manganese, copper, nickel, and cobalt that occur on ocean floors, yield different species of bacteria which enzymatically mediate both the oxidation and reduction of manganese.", "6.14.1 ACID MINE WATERS One consequence of bacterial action on metal compounds is acid mine drainage, one of the most common and damaging problems in the aquatic environment. Many waters flowing from coal mines and draining from the \u201cgob piles\u201d left over from coal processing and washing are practically sterile due to high acidity. Acid mine water results from the presence of sulfuric acid produced by the oxidation of pyrite, FeS2. Microorganisms are closely involved in the overall process, which consists of several reactions and involves a number of microbial species that can exist under acidic conditions. The first of these reactions is the oxidation of pyrite, which is followed by the oxidation of iron(II) ion to iron(III) ion: 2FeS2(s) + 2H2O + 7O2 \u00c6 4H+ + 4SO42\u2212 + 2Fe2+ (6.37) 4Fe2+ + O2 + 4H+ \u00c6 4Fe3+ + 2H2O (6.38) a process that occurs very slowly at low pH values found in acid mine waters. Below pH 3.5, the iron oxidation is catalyzed by the iron bacterium Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, and in the pH range 3.5\u20134.5 it may be catalyzed by a variety of Metallogenium, a filamentous iron bacterium. Other bacteria that may be involved in acid mine water formation are Thiobacillus thiooxidans and Ferrobacillus ferrooxidans. The Fe3+ ion further dissolves pyrite FeS2(s) + 14Fe3+ + 8H2O \u00c6 15Fe2+ + 2SO42\u2212 + 16H+ (6.39) which in conjunction with Reaction 6.38 constitutes a cycle for the dissolution of pyrite. Fe(H2O)63+ is an acidic ion and at pH values much above 3, the iron(III) precipitates as the hydrated iron(III) oxide: Fe3+ + 3H2O \u00c6 Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ (6.40) The beds of streams afflicted with acid mine drainage often are covered with \u201cyellowboy,\u201d an unsightly deposit of amorphous, semigelatinous Fe(OH)3. The most damaging component of acid mine water, however, is sulfuric acid. It is directly toxic and has other undesirable effects such as excessive weathering of minerals that it contacts. Limestone, CaCO3, is commonly used to treat acid mine water. When acid mine water is treated with limestone, the following reaction occurs: CaCO3(s) + 2H+ + SO42\u2212 \u00c6 Ca2+ + SO42\u2212 + H2O + CO2(g) (6.41) Unfortunately, because iron(III) is generally present, Fe(OH)3 precipitates as the pH is raised (Reaction 6.40). The hydrated iron(III) oxide product covers the particles of carbonate rock with a relatively impermeable layer. This armoring effect prevents further neutralization of the acid. 6.14.2 MICROBIAL TRANSITIONS OF SELENIUM Directly below sulfur in the periodic table, selenium is subject to bacterial oxidation and reduction. These transitions are important because selenium is a crucial element in nutrition, particularly of livestock. Diseases related to either selenium excesses or deficiency have been reported in at least half of the states of the United States and in 20 other countries, including the major livestock producing countries. Livestock in New Zealand, in particular, suffer from selenium defi ciency. Microorganisms are closely involved with the selenium cycle, and microbial reduction of oxidized forms of selenium has been known for some time. Reductive processes under anoxic conditions can reduce both SeO32\u2212 and SeO42\u2212 ions to elemental selenium, which can accumulate as a sink for selenium in anoxic sediments. Some bacteria such as selected strains of Thiobacillus and Leptothrix can oxidize elemental selenium to selenite, SeO32\u2212, thus remobilizing this element from deposits of Se(0). The major volatile selenium species emitted to the atmosphere by microbial processes in water and soil is dimethylselenide, (CH3)2Se. (The single largest source of natural sulfur discharged to the atmosphere is the analogous sulfur compound, biogenic dimethyl sulfi de, (CH3)2S, from marine sources; see Section 11.4.) The major biological selenium compound that is the precursor to dimethylselenide formation is selenomethionine: HH HO H3C Se C C C C OH Selenomethionine HH NH2 6.14.3 MICROBIAL CORROSION Corrosion involving the deterioration of iron as well as other metals is a redox phenomenon and was discussed in Section 4.14. Much corrosion is bacterial in nature.7 Bacteria involved with corrosion set up their own electrochemical cells in which a portion of the surface of the metal being corroded forms the anode of the cell and is oxidized. Structures called tubercles form in which bacteria pit and corrode metals as shown in Figure 6.13. LITERATURE CITED 1. Vaulot, D., W. Eikrem, M. Viprey, and H.

Fecal pollution of drinking water has frequently caused waterborne diseases that have decimated the populations of whole cities.", "Unwholesome water polluted by sewage has caused great hardship for people forced to drink it or use it for irrigation. Although waterborne diseases are now well controlled in technologically advanced countries, the shortage of safe drinking water is still a major problem in regions afflicted by strife and poverty. An ongoing concern with water safety now is the potential presence of chemical pollutants. These may include organic chemicals, inorganics, and heavy metals from industrial, urban runoff, and agricultural sources. Water pollutants can be divided into some general categories, as summarized in Table 7.1. Most of these categories of pollutants, and several subcategories, are discussed in this chapter. 7.1.1 MARKERS OF WATER POLLUTION Markers of water pollution are substances that show the presence of pollution sources. These include herbicides indicative of agricultural runoff, fecal coliform bacteria that are characteristic of pollution from sewage, and pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical metabolites, and even caffeine that show contamination by domestic wastewater. Biomarkers of water pollution are organisms that live in or are closely associated with bodies of water and provide evidence of pollution either from accumulation of water pollutants or their metabolites or from effects on the organism due to pollutant exposure. Fish are the most common bio-indicators of water pollution, and fish lipid (fat) tissue is commonly analyzed for persistent organic water pollutants. An organism that has been described as \u201ca worldwide sentinel species to assess and monitor environmental pollution in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries\u201d1 is the osprey (Pandionhaliaetus), a large raptor bird with a wingspan that can exceed 1.5 m and a mass up to 2 kg. Found in all continents throughout the world except for Antarctica, the osprey feeds almost exclusively on fish. In addition to these characteristics, other aspects of the osprey that make it a good indicator species are that it is well adapted to human landscapes where pollution is most likely to occur, it is at the top of the aquatic food web through which persistent pollutants undergo bioaccumulation and biomagnification, it is sensitive to many pollutants, and it has a relatively long life span. This bird builds highly visible nests that are evenly dispersed over wide areas, usually remains with a single nest, and tolerates disturbance of nests for brief periods. The osprey is very sensitive to some pollutants, and although populations are now comfortably high, they were almost wiped out by the effects of DDT before that insecticide was banned. Chemical and biochemical analyses of osprey feathers, eggs, blood, and organs along with observations of behavior, nesting habits, and populations have been used to assess water pollution. 7.2 ELEMENTAL POLLUTANTS Table 7.2 lists the more important trace elements (those encountered at levels of a few ppm or less) found in natural waters. Typical of the behavior of many substances in the aquatic environment, TABLE 7.1 General Types of Water Pollutants Class of Pollutant Signif cance Trace elements Health, aquatic biota, toxicity Heavy metals Health, aquatic biota, toxicity Organically-bound metals Metal transport Radionuclides Toxicity Inorganic pollutants Toxicity, aquatic biota Asbestos Human health Algal nutrients Eutrophication Acidity, alkalinity, salinity (in excess) Water quality, aquatic life Trace organic pollutants Toxicity Polychlorinated biphenyls Possible biological effects Pesticides Toxicity, aquatic biota, wildlife Petroleum wastes Effect on wildlife, esthetics Sewage, human, and animal wastes Water quality, oxygen levels Biochemical oxygen demand Water quality, oxygen levels Pathogens Health effects Detergents Eutrophication, wildlife, esthetics Chemical carcinogens Incidence of cancer Sediments Water quality, aquatic biota, wildlife Taste, odor, and color Esthetics Arsenic Mining by-product, chemical waste Toxica, possibly carcinogenic Beryllium Coal, industrial wastes Toxic Boron Coal, detergents, wastes Toxic Chromium Metal plating Essential as Cr(III), toxic as Cr(VI) Copper Metal plating, mining, industrial waste Essential trace element, toxic to plants and algae at higher levels Fluorine (F-) Natural geological sources, wastes, water additive Prevents tooth decay at around 1 mg/L, toxic at higher levels Iodine (I-) Industrial wastes, natural brines, seawater intrusion Prevents goiter Iron Industrial wastes, corrosion, acid mine water, Essential nutrient, damages fi xtures by microbial action staining Lead Industrial waste, mining, fuels Toxic, harmful to wildlife Manganese Industrial wastes, acid mine water microbial action Toxic to plants, damages fixtures, by staining Mercury Industrial waste, mining, coal Toxic, mobilized as methyl mercury compounds by anaerobic bacteria Molybdenum Industrial wastes, natural sources Essential to plants, toxic to animals Selenium Natural sources, coal Essential at lower levels, toxic at higher levels Zinc Industrial waste, metal plating, plumbing Essential element, toxic to plants at higher levels a Toxicities of these elements are discussed in Chapter 23.", "some of these are essential plant and animal nutrients at low levels but toxic at higher levels. Several of them, such as lead or mercury, have such toxicological and environmental significance that they are discussed in detail in separate sections. A few of the heavy metals are among the most harmful of the elemental pollutants and are of particular concern because of their toxicities to humans. These elements are in general the transition metals, and some of the representative elements, such as lead and tin, are placed in the lower right-hand corner of the periodic table. Heavy metals include essential elements like iron as well as toxic metals like cadmium and mercury. Most of them have a tremendous affinity for sulfur and disrupt enzyme function by forming bonds with sulfur groups in enzymes. Protein carboxylic acid (\u2013CO2H) and amino (\u2013NH2) groups are also chemically bound by heavy metals. Cadmium, copper, lead, and mercury ions bind to cell membranes, hindering transport processes through the cell wall. Heavy metals may also precipitate phosphate biocompounds or catalyze their decomposition. The biochemical effects of metals are discussed in Chapter 24. Some of the metalloids, elements on the borderline between metals and nonmetals, are signifi cant water pollutants. Arsenic, selenium, and antimony are of particular interest. Inorganic chemicals\u2019 manufacture has the potential to contaminate water with trace elements. Among the industries regulated for potential trace element pollution of water are those producing chlor-alkali, hydrofluoric acid, sodium dichromate (sulfate process and chloride ilmenite process), aluminum fluoride, chrome pigments, copper sulfate, nickel sulfate, sodium bisulfate, sodium hydrosulfate, sodium bisulfite, titanium dioxide, and hydrogen cyanide. 7.3 HEAVY METALS 7.3.1 CADMIUM Pollutant cadmium in water may arise from mining wastes and industrial discharges, especially from metal plating. Chemically, cadmium is very similar to zinc, and these two metals frequently undergo geochemical processes together. Both metals are found in water in the +2 oxidation state. The effects of acute cadmium poisoning in humans include high blood pressure, kidney damage, damage to testicular tissue, and destruction of red blood cells. Much of the physiological action of cadmium is due to its chemical similarity to zinc. Cadmium may replace zinc in some enzymes, thereby altering the stereostructure of the enzyme and impairing its catalytic activity, causing disease symptoms. Cadmium and zinc are common water and sediment pollutants in harbors surrounded by industrial installations. Concentrations of more than 100 ppm dry weight sediment have been found in harbor sediments. Typically, during periods of calm in the summer when the water stagnates, the anaerobic bottom layer of harbor water has a low soluble Cd concentration because microbial reduction of sulfate by organic matter, {CH2O}, produces sulfide, which precipitates cadmium as insoluble cadmium sulfi de: 2{CH2O} + SO42-+ H+\u00c6 2CO2 + HS-+ 2H2O (7.1) CdCl+(chloro complex in seawater) + HS-\u00c6 CdS(s) + H++ Cl- (7.2) Mixing of bay water from outside the harbor and harbor water by high winds during the winter results in desorption of cadmium from harbor sediments by aerobic bay water. This dissolved cadmium is carried out into the bay where it is absorbed by suspended solid materials, which then becomes incorporated with the bay sediments. This is an example of the sort of complicated interaction of hydraulic, chemical solution\u2013solid, and microbiological factors involved in the transport and distribution of a pollutant in an aquatic system. 7.3.2 LEAD Inorganic lead arising from a number of industrial and mining sources and formerly from leaded gasoline occurs in water in the +2 oxidation state. In addition to pollutant sources, lead-bearing limestone and galena (PbS) contribute lead to natural waters in some locations. Evidence from hair samples and other sources indicates that body burdens of this toxic metal have decreased during recent decades, largely the result of less lead used in plumbing and other products that come in contact with food or drink. Acute lead poisoning in humans causes severe dysfunction in the kidneys, reproductive system, liver, and the brain and central nervous system and results in sickness or death. Lead poisoning from environmental exposure is thought to have caused mental retardation in many children. Mild lead poisoning causes anemia. The victim may have headaches and sore muscles, and may feel generally fatigued and irritable. Except in isolated cases, lead is probably not a major problem in drinking water, although the potential exists in cases where old lead pipes are still in use. Lead used to be a constituent of solder and some pipe-joint formulations, such that household water does have some contact with lead.", "Water that has stood in household plumbing for some time may have elevated levels of lead (along with zinc, cadmium, and copper) and should be drained for a while before use. 7.3.3 MERCURY Because of its toxicity, mobilization as methylated forms by anaerobic bacteria, and other pollution factors, mercury generates a great deal of concern as a heavy-metal pollutant. Mercury is found as a trace component of many minerals, with continental rocks containing an average of around 80 parts per billion, or slightly less, of this element. Fossil fuel coal and lignite contain mercury, often at levels of 100 parts per billion or even higher, and emissions from the combustion of these fuels are a major source of environmental mercury. Metallic mercury once was commonly used as an electrode in the electrolytic generation of chlorine gas, in laboratory vacuum apparatus, and in other applications, and significant quantities of inorganic mercury(I) and mercury(II) compounds were used annually. Organic mercury compounds used to be widely applied as pesticides, particularly fungicides. These mercury compounds included aryl mercurials such as phenyl mercuric dimethyldithiocarbamate, S CH3 HgS CN CH3 (formerly used in paper mills as a slimicide and as a mold retardant for paper) and alkyl-mercurials such as ethylmercuric chloride, C2H5HgCl, that was used as a seed fungicide. Because of concern over the health and environmental effects of mercury, these uses have been severely curtailed in recent years. As of 2008, approximately 3800 metric tons of mercury were traded worldwide each year. Globally, one of the greatest sources of mercury pollution has been mercury used to extract gold from gold-bearing ores. It is estimated that each year 15 million miners in approximately 40 developing countries use 650\u20131000 metric tons of mercury to extract gold. This use subjects many local areas to mercury contamination and contributes significantly to the global environmental burden of mercury as well as exposing the miners, many of whom are children, to toxic mercury. The problem has been made worse in recent years as industrialized countries have reduced mercury use with the result that surplus mercury has been made available on the world market for gold extraction. In recognition of this problem, in 2008 the European Union adopted a mercury export ban to take effect in 2011 and the United States adopted a similar ban to be effective in 2013. The toxicity of mercury was tragically illustrated in the Minamata Bay area of Japan during the period 1953\u20131960. A total of 111 cases of mercury poisoning and 43 deaths were reported among people who had consumed seafood from the bay that had been contaminated with mercury waste from a chemical plant that drained into Minamata Bay. Congenital defects were observed in 19 babies whose mothers had consumed seafood contaminated with mercury. The level of metal in the contaminated seafood was 5\u201320 ppm. Among the toxicological effects of mercury are neurological damage, including irritability, paralysis, blindness, or insanity; chromosome breakage; and birth defects. The milder symptoms of mercury poisoning such as depression and irritability have a psychopathological character. Because of the resemblance of these symptoms to common human behavioral problems, mild mercury poisoning may escape detection. Some forms of mercury are relatively nontoxic and were formerly used as medicines, for example, in the treatment of syphilis. Other forms of mercury, particularly organic compounds, are highly toxic. Because there are few major natural sources of mercury, and since most inorganic compounds of this element are relatively insoluble, it was assumed for some time that mercury was not a serious water pollutant. However, in 1970, alarming mercury levels were discovered in fish in Lake Saint Clair located between Michigan and Ontario, Canada. A subsequent survey by the U.S. Federal Water Quality Administration revealed a number of other waters contaminated with mercury. It was found that several chemical plants, particularly caustic chemical manufacturing operations, were each releasing up to 14 or more kilograms of mercury in wastewaters each day. The unexpectedly high concentrations of mercury found in water and in fi sh tissues result from the formation of soluble monomethylmercury ion, CH3Hg+, and volatile dimethylmercury, (CH3)2Hg, by anaerobic bacteria in sediments. Mercury from these compounds becomes concentrated in fi sh lipid (fat) tissue and the concentration factor from water to fish may exceed 103. The methylating agent by which inorganic mercury is converted to methylmercury compounds is methylcobalamin, a vitamin B12 analog: Methylcobalamin HgCl2 \u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00c6 CH3HgCl +Cl-(7.3) It is believed that the bacteria that synthesize methane produce methylcobalamin as an intermediate in the synthesis.", "Thus, waters and sediments in which anaerobic decay is occurring provide the conditions under which methylmercury production occurs. In neutral or alkaline waters, volatile dimethylmercury, (CH3)2Hg, may be formed. 7.4 METALLOIDS The most significant water pollutant metalloid element is arsenic, a toxic element that has been the chemical villain of more than a few murder plots. Acute arsenic poisoning can result from the ingestion of more than about 100 mg of the element. Chronic poisoning occurs with the ingestion of small amounts of arsenic over a long period of time. There is some evidence that this element is also carcinogenic. Arsenic occurs in the Earth\u2019s crust at an average level of 2\u20135 ppm. The combustion of fossil fuels, particularly coal, introduces large quantities of arsenic into the environment, much of it reaching natural waters. Arsenic occurs with phosphate minerals and enters into the environment along with some phosphorus compounds. Some formerly used pesticides, particularly those from before World War II, contain highly toxic arsenic compounds. The most common of these are lead arsenate, Pb3(AsO4)2; sodium arsenite, Na3AsO3; and Paris green, Cu3(AsO3)2. Another major source of arsenic is mine tailings. Arsenic produced as a by-product of copper, gold, and lead refi ning exceeds the commercial demand for arsenic, and it accumulates as waste material. Like mercury, arsenic may be converted to more mobile and toxic methyl derivatives by bacteria, first by reduction of H3AsO4 to H3AsO3 then by methylation to produce CH3AsO(OH)2 (methylarsinic acid), (CH3)2AsO(OH) (dimethyarsinic acid), and (CH3)2AsH (dimethylarsine). In what may have been the largest mass poisoning of a human population in history, between 35 million and 77 million people of the 125 million inhabitants of Bangladesh have been exposed to potentially toxic levels of arsenic in drinking water. This catastrophic public health problem has resulted from well-intentioned programs funded initially by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund to install shallow tube wells that provided a source of drinking water free from disease-causing pathogens. By 1987, numerous cases of arsenic-induced skin lesions characterized by pigmentation changes, predominantly on the upper chest, arms, and legs, and keratoses of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet were being observed. These effects were characteristic of arsenic poisoning, leading to the discovery that arsenic-contaminated drinking water from the tube wells was responsible for this. Since the initial discovery of arsenic poisoning, huge numbers of new cases have been revealed and it is possible that tens of thousands of people in Bangladesh will die prematurely because of exposure to arsenic in drinking water. Other countries with acute problems from arsenic in drinking water include Vietnam (where large numbers of tube wells were drilled more recently than those in Bangladesh), Argentina, Chile, China, Mexico, Taiwan, and Thailand. The geochemical conditions that result in arsenic contamination of water are often associated with the presence of iron, sulfur, and organic matter in (alluvial) deposits produced by water. Iron released from rocks eroded by river water forms iron oxide deposits on rock particle surfaces. The iron oxide accumulates arsenic and concentrates it from the river water. These particles then get buried along with degradable organic matter in sediments, and the insoluble iron(III) in the iron oxides is converted to soluble iron(II) by the anaerobic reducing conditions under which the organic matter biodegrades. This releases the bound arsenic that can get into well water. 7.5 ORGANICALLY BOUND METALS AND METALLOIDS An appreciation of the strong influence of complexation and chelation on heavy metals\u2019 behavior in natural waters and wastewaters may be gained by reading Sections 3.10 through 3.17, which deal with that subject. Methylmercury formation is discussed in Section 7.3. Both topics involve the combination of metals and organic entities in water. It must be stressed that the interaction of metals with organic compounds is of utmost importance in determining the role played by the metal in an aquatic system. There are two major types of metal\u2013organic interactions to be considered in an aquatic system. The first of these is complexation, usually chelation when organic ligands are involved. As discussed in Chapter 3, complexation and chelation involve reversible binding of a metal ion with a ligand species. Organometallic compounds, on the other hand, contain metals bound to organic entities by way of a carbon atom and do not dissociate reversibly at lower pH or greater dilution. Furthermore, the organic component, and sometimes the particular oxidation state of the metal involved, may not be stable apart from the organometallic compound.", "The major categories of organometallic compounds encountered in the environment are (1) those in which the organic group is an alkyl group such as ethyl in tetraethyl lead, Pb(C2H5)4; (2) carbonyls, some of which are quite volatile and toxic, having carbon monoxide bonded to metals; and (3) those in which the organic group is a \u03c0 electron donor, such as ethylene (C2H4) or benzene (C6H6). Combinations of the three general types of compounds outlined above exist, the most prominent of which are arene carbonyl species, in which a metal atom is bonded to both an aryl entity such as benzene and to several carbon monoxide molecules. A large number of compounds exist that have at least one bond between the metal and a C atom on an organic group, as well as other covalent or ionic bonds between the metal and atoms other than carbon. An example is monomethylmercury chloride, CH3HgCl, in which the organometallic CH3Hg+ ion is ionically bonded to the chloride anion. Another class of compounds with organometallic character are those that have organic groups bonded to a metal atom through atoms other than carbon. An example of such a compound is isopropyl titanate, Ti(i-OC3H7)4, in which the hydrocarbon groups are bonded to the metal by way of oxygen atoms. The interaction of trace metals with organic compounds in natural waters is too vast an area to cover in detail in this chapter; however, it may be noted that metal\u2013organic interactions may involve organic species of both pollutant (such as EDTA) and natural (such as fulvic acids) origin. These interactions are influenced by, and sometimes play a role in, redox equilibria, formation and dissolution of precipitates, colloid formation and stability, acid\u2013base reactions, and microorganism-mediated reactions in water. Metal\u2013organic interactions may increase or decrease the toxicity of metals in aquatic ecosystems, and they have a strong influence on the growth of algae in water. 7.5.1 ORGANOTIN COMPOUNDS Of all the metals, tin has had the greatest number of organometallic compounds in commercial use, with global production that reached 40,000 metric tons per year before uses were restricted because of concerns over water pollution. In addition to synthetic organotin compounds, methylated tin species can be produced biologically in the environment. Figure 7.1 gives some examples of the many known organotin compounds. Major industrial uses of organotin compounds in the past have included applications of tin compounds in fungicides, acaricides, disinfectants, antifouling paints, stabilizers to lessen the effects of heat and light in polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastics, catalysts, and precursors for the formation of films of SnO2 on glass. Tributyl tin (TBT) chloride and related TBT compounds have bactericidal, fungicidal, and insecticidal properties and formerly were of particular environmental signifi cance because of their use as industrial biocides. In addition to TBT chloride, other TBT compounds used as biocides include the hydroxide, the naphthenate, bis(tributyltin) oxide, and tris(tributylstannyl) phosphate. TBT was once widely used in boat and ship hull coatings to prevent the growth of fouling organisms. Other applications have included preservation of wood, leather, paper, and textiles. Antifungal TBT compounds have been used as slimicides in cooling tower water. Obviously the many applications of organotin compounds for a variety of uses have posed a significant potential for environmental pollution. Because of their applications near or in contact with bodies of water, organotin compounds are potentially significant water pollutants and have been linked to endocrine disruption in shellfish, oysters, and snails. Because of such concerns, several countries, including the United States, England, and France, prohibited TBT application on vessels smaller than 25 m in length during the 1980s. In response to concerns over water pollution, in 2001 the International Maritime Organization agreed to ban organotin antifouling paints on ships and yachts. Provisions of this agreement came into effect in September 2008. 7.6 INORGANIC SPECIES Some important inorganic water pollutants were mentioned in Sections 7.2 through 7.4 as part of the discussion of pollutant trace elements. Inorganic pollutants that contribute acidity, alkalinity, or salinity to water are considered separately in this chapter. Still another class is that of algal nutrients. This leaves unclassified, however, some important inorganic pollutant species, of which cyanide ion, CN-, is probably the most important. Others include ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrite, and sulfi te. R R HCH3 RSnOSnRR is CC R R HCH3 Bis[tri(2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl)tin] oxide (used as an acaricide) FIGURE 7.1 Examples of organotin compounds. 7.6.1 CYANIDE Cyanide, a deadly poisonous substance, exists in water as HCN, a weak acid, Ka of 6 \u00d7 10-10.", "The cyanide ion has a strong affinity for many metal ions, forming relatively less toxic ferrocyanide, Fe(CN)64\u2013, with iron(II), for example. Volatile HCN is very toxic and has been used in gas chamber executions in the United States. Cyanide is widely used in industry, especially for metal cleaning and electroplating. It is also one of the main gas and coke scrubber effluent pollutants from gas works and coke ovens. Cyanide is also used in certain mineral-processing operations. Numerous fish kills have resulted from the discharge of cyanide from mineral processing operations into waterways. 7.6.2 AMMONIA AND OTHER INORGANIC POLLUTANTS Excessive levels of ammoniacal nitrogen cause water-quality problems. Ammonia is the initial product of the decay of nitrogenous organic wastes, and its presence frequently indicates the presence of such wastes. It is a normal constituent of low-pE groundwaters and is sometimes added to drinking water as an aid to disinfection, where it reacts with chlorine to provide residual chlorine (see Section 8.11). Since the pKa of ammonium ion, NH4 +, is 9.26, most ammonia in water is present as NH4 + rather than as NH3. Hydrogen sulfide, H2S, is a product of the anaerobic decay of organic matter containing sulfur. It is also produced in the anaerobic reduction of sulfate by microorganisms (see Chapter 6) and is evolved as a gaseous pollutant from geothermal waters. Wastes from chemical plants, paper mills, textile mills, and tanneries may also contain H2S. Its presence is easily detected by its characteristic rotten-egg odor. In water, H2S is a weak diprotic acid with pKa1 of 6.99 and pKa2 of 12.92; S2-is not present in normal natural waters. The sulfide ion has tremendous affinity for many heavy metals, and precipitation of metallic sulfides often accompanies production of H2S. Free carbon dioxide, CO2, is frequently present in water at high levels due to decay of organic matter. It is also added to softened water during water treatment as part of a recarbonation process (see Chapter 8). Excessive carbon dioxide levels may make water more corrosive and may be harmful to aquatic life. Nitrite ion, NO2 -, occurs in water as an intermediate oxidation state of nitrogen over a relatively narrow pE range. Nitrite is added to some industrial process water as a corrosion inhibitor. However, it rarely occurs in drinking water at levels over 0.1 mg/L. Sulfi te ion, SO32-, is found in some industrial wastewaters. Sodium sulfite is commonly added to boiler feedwaters as an oxygen scavenger: 2SO32-+ O2 \u00c6 2SO42- (7.4) Since pKa1 of sulfurous acid is 1.76 and pKa2 is 7.20, sulfite exists as either HSO3 - or SO32-in natural waters, depending on the pH. It may be noted that hydrazine, N2H4, also functions as an oxygen scavenger: N2H4 + O2 \u00c6 2H2O + N2(g) (7.5) Perchlorate ion, ClO4 -, emerged as a water pollution problem in some areas in the 1990s when advances in ion chromatography enabled its detection in the low parts per billion range of concentrations. Ammonium perchlorate, NH4ClO4, has been widely manufactured as an oxidizer in solid rocket propellants and contamination from ammonium perchlorate manufacturing facilities has been regarded as the major source of contamination. Perchlorate in water is very unreactive and all common perchlorate salts other than KClO4 are soluble, so it is difficult to remove. Physiologically, it competes with iodide ion and diminishes essential iodide uptake by the thyroid. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recommended a drinking water standard for perchlorate of around 1 part per billion. 7.6.3 ASBESTOS IN WATER The toxicity of inhaled asbestos is well established. The fibers scar lung tissue and cancer eventually develops, often 20 or 30 years after exposure. It is not known for sure whether asbestos is toxic in drinking water. This has been a matter of considerable concern because of the dumping of taconite (iron ore tailings) containing asbestos-like fibers into Lake Superior. The fibers have been found in drinking waters of cities around the lake. After having dumped the tailings into Lake Superior since 1952, the Reserve Mining Company at Silver Bay on Lake Superior solved the problem in 1980 by constructing a 6-square-mile containment basin inland from the lake. This $370-million facility keeps the taconite tailings covered with a 3-m layer of water to prevent the escape of fi ber dust. 7.7 ALGAL NUTRIENTS AND EUTROPHICATION The term eutrophication, derived from the Greek word meaning \u201cwell-nourished,\u201d describes a condition of lakes or reservoirs involving excess algal growth.", "Although some algal productivity is necessary to support the food chain in an aquatic ecosystem, excess growth under eutrophic conditions may eventually lead to severe deterioration of the body of water. The first step in eutrophication of a body of water is an input of plant nutrients (Table 7.3) from watershed runoff or sewage. The nutrient-rich body of water then produces a great deal of plant biomass by photosynthesis, along with a smaller amount of animal biomass. Dead biomass accumulates in the bottom of the lake, where it partially decays, recycling nutrient carbon dioxide, phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium. If the lake is not too deep, bottom-rooted plants begin to grow, accelerating the accumulation of solid material in the basin. Eventually a marsh is formed, which fi nally fills in to produce a meadow or forest. Eutrophication is often a natural phenomenon; for instance, it is basically responsible for the formation of huge deposits of coal and peat. However, human activity can greatly accelerate the process. To understand why this is so, consider that most of the nutrients required for plant and algae growth shown in Table 7.3 are available in adequate amounts from natural sources. The nutrients most likely to be limiting are the \u201cfertilizer\u201d elements: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. All these are present in sewage and are, of course, found in runoff from heavily fertilized fi elds. They are also constituents of various kinds of industrial wastes. Each of these elements can also come TABLE 7.3 Essential Plant Nutrients: Sources and Functions Nutrient Source Function Macronutrients Carbon (CO2) Atmosphere, decay Biomass constituent Hydrogen Water Biomass constituent Oxygen Water Biomass constituent Nitrogen (NO3 -) Decay, pollutants, atmosphere Protein constituent (from nitrogen- fi xing organisms) Phosphorus Decay, minerals (phosphate) DNA/RNA constituent pollutants Potassium Minerals, pollutants Metabolic function Sulfur (sulfate) Minerals Proteins, enzymes Magnesium Minerals Metabolic function Calcium Minerals Metabolic function Micronutrients B, Cl, Co, Cu, Fe, Mo, Mn, Na, Si, V, Zn Minerals, pollutants Metabolic function and/or constituent of enzymes from natural sources\u2014phosphorus and potassium from mineral formations, and nitrogen fi xed by bacteria, cyanobacteria, or discharge of lightning in the atmosphere. In some cases, nitrogen or even carbon may be the limiting nutrients, the presence of which determines the rate of algal growth. This is particularly true of nitrogen in seawater. In seawater, micronutrients, particularly iron, may be limiting. In most cases in freshwaters, the single plant nutrient most likely to be limiting is phosphorus, and it is generally regarded as the culprit in excessive eutrophication. Household detergents were once a common source of phosphate in wastewater, and eutrophication control has concentrated on eliminating phosphates from detergents, removing phosphate at the sewage treatment plant, and preventing phosphate-laden sewage effluents from entering bodies of water enabling the excessive growth of algae that can cause eutrophication. 7.8 ACIDITY, ALKALINITY, AND SALINITY Aquatic biota are sensitive to extremes of pH. Largely because of osmotic effects, they cannot live in a medium having a salinity to which they are not adapted. Thus, a freshwater fish soon succumbs in the ocean, and sea fish normally cannot live in freshwater. Excess salinity soon kills plants not adapted to it. There are, of course, ranges in salinity and pH in which organisms live. As shown in Figure 7.2, these ranges frequently may be represented by a reasonably symmetrical curve, along the fringes of which an organism may live without really thriving. These curves do not generally exhibit a sharp cutoff at one end or the other, as does the high-temperature end of the curve representing the growth of bacteria as a function of temperature (Figure 6.7). The most common source of pollutant acid in water is acid mine drainage. The sulfuric acid in such drainage arises from the microbial oxidation of pyrite or other sulfide minerals as described in Chapter 6. The values of pH encountered in acid-polluted water may fall below 3, a condition deadly to most forms of aquatic life except the culprit bacteria mediating the pyrite and iron(II) oxidation, which thrive under very low pH conditions. Industrial wastes frequently have the potential to contribute strong acid to water. Sulfuric acid produced by the air oxidation of pollutant sulfur dioxide (see Chapter 11) enters natural waters as acidic rainfall. In cases where the water does not have contact with a basic mineral, such as limestone, the water pH may become dangerously low. This condition occurs in some Canadian lakes, for example.", "Excess alkalinity, and frequently accompanying high pH, generally are not introduced directly into water from anthropogenic sources. However, in many geographic areas, the soil and mineral strata are alkaline and impart a high alkalinity to water. Human activity can aggravate the situation, for example, by exposure of alkaline overburden from strip mining to surface water or groundwater. Excess alkalinity in water is manifested by a characteristic fringe of white salts at the edges of a body of water or on the banks of a stream. Maximum 0 FIGURE 7.2 A generalized plot of the growth of an aquatic organism as a function of pH. Water salinity may be increased by a number of human activities. Water passing through a municipal water system inevitably picks up salt from sources such as recharging water softeners with sodium chloride. Salts can leach from spoil piles. One of the major environmental constraints on the production of shale oil, for example, is the high percentage of leachable sodium sulfate in piles of spent shale. Careful control of these wastes is necessary to prevent further saline pollution of water in areas where salinity is already a problem. Irrigation adds a great deal of salt to water, a phenomenon responsible for the Salton Sea in California, and is a source of conflict between the United States and Mexico over saline contamination of the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers. Irrigation and intensive agricultural production have caused saline seeps in some of the Western states. These occur when water seeps into a slight depression in tilled, sometimes irrigated, fertilized land, carrying salts (particularly sodium, magnesium, and calcium sulfates) along with it. The water evaporates in the dry summer heat, leaving behind a salt-laden area that no longer supports much plant growth. With time, these areas spread, destroying the productivity of crop land. 7.9 OXYGEN, OXIDANTS, AND REDUCTANTS Oxygen is a vitally important species in water (see Chapter 2). In water, oxygen is consumed rapidly by the oxidation of organic matter, {CH2O}: Microorganisms {CHO} + O \u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00c6 CO + HO (7.6) 22 22 Unless the water is reaerated efficiently, as by turbulent flow in a shallow stream, it rapidly loses oxygen and will not support higher forms of aquatic life. In addition to the microorganism-mediated oxidation of organic matter, oxygen in water may be consumed by the biooxidation of nitrogenous material: NH4 + + 2O2 \u00c6 2H+ + NO3 -+ H2O (7.7) and by the chemical or biochemical oxidation of chemical reducing agents: 4Fe2+ + O2 + 10H2O \u00c6 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 8H+ (7.8) 22 2SO3 + O2 \u00c6 2SO4 (7.9) All these processes contribute to the deoxygenation of water. The degree of oxygen consumption by microbially mediated oxidation of contaminants in water is called the BOD (biochemical or biological oxygen demand). This parameter is commonly measured by determining the quantity of oxygen utilized by suitable aquatic microorganisms during a 5-day period. The addition of oxidizable pollutants to streams produces a typical oxygen sag curve as shown in Figure 7.3. Initially, a well-aerated, unpolluted stream is relatively free of oxidizable material; the oxygen level is high; and the bacterial population is relatively low. With the addition of oxidizable pollutants, the oxygen level drops because re-aeration cannot keep up with oxygen consumption. In the decomposition zone, the bacterial population rises. The septic zone is characterized by a high bacterial population and very low oxygen levels. The septic zone terminates when the oxidizable pollutant is exhausted, and then the recovery zone begins. In the recovery zone, the bacterial population decreases and the dissolved oxygen level increases until the water regains its original condition. Although BOD is a reasonably realistic measure of water quality insofar as oxygen is concerned, the test for determining it is time consuming and cumbersome to perform. Total organic carbon (TOC) is frequently measured by catalytically oxidizing carbon in the water and measuring the CO2 that is evolved. It has become popular because TOC is readily determined instrumentally. Clean Decomposition Septic Recovery Clean zone zone zone zone zone 7.10 ORGANIC POLLUTANTS 7.10.1 BIOACCUMULATION OF ORGANIC POLLUTANTS An important characteristic of organic water pollutants, especially those that have an affinity for lipid (fat) tissue and that resist biodegradation, is the bioconcentration factor (BCF), which is defi ned as the ratio of a substance\u2019s concentration in the tissue of an aquatic organism to the concentration of the substance in the water where the organism lives.", "It assumes that exposure is through water only and that the concentration in water is stable over a long period of time. A related parameter, the bio-accumulation factor (BAF) is defined in the same way, except that it assumes that both the organism and its food are exposed similarly to a pollutant over a long period of time. Although literally thousands of such factors involving hundreds of species and substances that are taken up by organisms from water have been measured or estimated, there is considerable uncertainty in these numbers; however, they remain indicative of the pollution potential of persistent organic compounds.2 7.10.2 SEWAGE As shown in Table 7.4, sewage from domestic, commercial, food-processing, and industrial sources contains a wide variety of pollutants, including organic pollutants. Some of these pollutants, TABLE 7.4 Some of the Primary Constituents of Sewage from a City Sewage System Constituent Potential Sources Effects in Water Oxygen-demanding Mostly organic materials, particularly Consume dissolved oxygen substances human feces and urine Refractory organics Industrial wastes, household products Toxic to aquatic life Viruses Human wastes Cause disease (possibly cancer); major deterrent to sewage recycle through water systems Detergents Household detergents Esthetics, prevent grease and oil removal, toxic to aquatic life Phosphates Detergents Algal nutrients Grease and oil Cooking, food processing, industrial wastes Esthetics, harmful to some aquatic life Salts Human wastes, water softeners, industrial Increase water salinity wastes Heavy metals Industrial wastes, chemical laboratories Toxicity Chelating agents Some detergents, industrial wastes Heavy metal ion solubilization and transport Solids All sources Esthetics, harmful to aquatic life particularly oxygen-demanding substances (see Section 7.9)\u2014oil, grease, and solids\u2014are removed by primary and secondary sewage-treatment processes. Others, such as salts, heavy metals, and refractory (degradation-resistant) organics, are not effi ciently removed. Disposal of inadequately treated sewage can cause severe problems. For example, offshore disposal of sewage, once commonly practiced by coastal cities, results in the formation of beds of sewage residues. Municipal sewage typically contains about 0.1% solids, even after treatment, and these settle out in the ocean in a typical pattern, illustrated in Figure 7.4. The warm sewage water rises in the cold hypolimnion and is carried in one direction or another by tides or currents. It does not rise above the thermocline (metalimnion); instead, it spreads out as a cloud from which the solids rain down on the ocean floor. Aggregation of sewage colloids is aided by dissolved salts in seawater (see Chapter 5), thus promoting the formation of sludge-containing sediments. Another major disposal problem with sewage is the sludge produced as a product of the sewage treatment process (see Chapter 8). This sludge contains organic material, which continues to degrade slowly; refractory organics; and heavy metals. The amounts of sludge produced are truly staggering. For example, the city of Chicago produces about 3 million tons of sludge each year. A major consideration in the safe disposal of such amounts of sludge is the presence of potentially dangerous components such as heavy metals. Careful control of sewage sources is needed to minimize sewage pollution problems. Particularly, heavy metals and refractory organic compounds need to be controlled at the source to enable use of sewage, or treated sewage effluents, for irrigation, recycling to the water system, or groundwater recharge. Soaps, detergents, and associated chemicals are potential sources of organic pollutants. These pollutants are discussed briefl y here. 7.10.3 SOAPS, DETERGENTS, AND DETERGENT BUILDERS 7.10.3.1 Soaps Soaps are salts of higher fatty acids, such as sodium stearate, C17H35COO-Na+. The cleaning action of soap results largely from its emulsifying power and its ability to lower the surface tension of water. This concept may be understood by considering the dual nature of the soap anion. An examination of its structure shows that the stearate ion consists of an ionic carboxyl \u201chead\u201d and a long hydrocarbon \u201ctail\u201d: O In the presence of oils, fats, and other water-insoluble organic materials, the tendency is for the \u201ctail\u201d of the anion to dissolve in the organic matter, whereas the \u201chead\u201d remains in aquatic solution. Thus, the soap emulsifies, or suspends, organic material in water. In the process, the anions form colloidal soap micelles, as shown in Figure 5.4. The primary disadvantage of soap as a cleaning agent comes from its reaction with divalent cations to form insoluble salts of fatty acids: 2C17H35COO-Na++ Ca2+\u00c6 Ca(C17H35CO2)2(s) + 2Na+ (7.10) These insoluble solids, usually salts of magnesium or calcium, are not at all effective as cleaning agents. In addition, the insoluble \u201ccurds\u201d form unsightly deposits on clothing and in washing machines.", "If sufficient soap is used, all of the divalent cations may be removed by their reaction with soap, and the water containing excess soap will have good cleaning qualities. This is the approach commonly used when soap is employed with unsoftened water in the bathtub or wash basin, where the insoluble calcium and magnesium salts can be tolerated. However, in applications such as washing clothing, the water must be softened by the removal of calcium and magnesium or their complexation by substances such as polyphosphates (see Section 3.16). Although the formation of insoluble calcium and magnesium salts has resulted in the essential elimination of soap as a cleaning agent for clothing, dishes, and most other materials, it has distinct advantages from the environmental standpoint. As soon as soap gets into sewage or an aquatic system, it generally precipitates as calcium and magnesium salts. Hence, any effects that soap might have in solution are eliminated. With eventual biodegradation, the soap is completely eliminated from the environment. Therefore, aside from the occasional formation of unsightly scum, soap does not cause any substantial pollution problems. 7.10.3.2 Detergents Synthetic detergents have good cleaning properties and do not form insoluble salts with \u201chardness ions\u201d such as calcium and magnesium. Such synthetic detergents have the additional advantage of being the salts of relatively strong acids and, therefore, they do not precipitate out of acidic waters as insoluble acids, an undesirable characteristic of soaps. The potential of detergents to contaminate water is high because of their heavy use throughout the consumer, institutional, and industrial markets. Over 1 billion pounds of detergent surfactants are consumed annually in the U.S. household market alone, with slightly more consumed in Europe. Most of this material, along with the other ingredients associated with detergent formulations, is discarded with wastewater. The key ingredient of detergents is the surfactant or surface-active agent, which acts in effect to make water \u201cwetter\u201d and a better cleaning agent. Surfactants concentrate at interfaces of water with gases (air), solids (dirt), and immiscible liquids (oil). They do so because of their amphiphilic structure, meaning that one part of the molecule is a polar or ionic group (head) with a strong affi nity for water, and the other part is a hydrocarbon group (tail) with an aversion to water. This kind of structure is illustrated below for the molecule of alkyl benzene sulfonate (ABS) surfactant: O HHHHHHHHH Na+\u2013OS CCCCCCCCCCH3 H H H H CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 O Until the early 1960s, ABS was the most common surfactant used in detergent formulations. However, it suffered the distinct disadvantage of being only very slowly biodegradable because of its branched-chain structure (see Section 6.10). An objectionable manifestation of the nonbiodegradable detergents was the \u201chead\u201d of foam that began to appear in glasses of drinking water in areas where sewage was recycled through the domestic water supply. Spectacular beds of foam appeared near sewage outflows and in sewage treatment plants and at least one fatality was reported when an individual fell in a bed of foam at a sewage treatment plant and was asphyxiated by the gases in the foam. Occasionally, the entire aeration tank of an activated sludge plant would be smothered by a blanket of foam. Among the other undesirable effects of persistent detergents upon waste-treatment processes were lowered surface tension of water, deflocculation of colloids, flotation of solids, emulsifi cation of grease and oil, and destruction of useful bacteria. Consequently, ABS was replaced by a biodegradable surfactant known as linear alkyl sulfonate (LAS). LAS, a-benzenesulfonate, has the general structural formula illustrated below where the benzene ring may be attached at any point on the alkyl chain except at the ends: LAS is more biodegradable than ABS because the alkyl portion of LAS is not branched and does not contain the tertiary carbon which is so detrimental to biodegradability. Since LAS has replaced ABS in detergents, the problems arising from the surface-active agent in the detergents (such as toxicity to fi sh fingerlings) have greatly diminished and the levels of surface-active agents found in water have decreased markedly. Some detergent surfactants are nonionic. One type that has proven troublesome consists of the alkyl phenol polyethoxylates: HH HHHHHHHHH HO CCCCCCCCCH HH CCO HHHHHHHHHn Nonylphenol polyethoxylate The alkyl phenol polyethoxylates are very useful as detergents, dispersing agents, emulsifi ers, solubilizers, and wetting agents, leading to annual use of millions of kilograms in the United States.", "These substances and their degradation products in which the polyethoxylate chains have been shortened by microbially mediated hydrolysis tend to survive biological sewage treatment and to be discharged with the sewage effluent. They also accumulate in sewage sludge, much of which is disposed on agricultural lands. These products are thought to be xenoestrogens (estrogen hormone mimickers) and their potential entry into the food chain from sludge-treated soil is of concern. Because of these concerns, the uses of these compounds have been severely restricted in some European countries. Detergent builders added to detergents to bind to hardness ions, making the detergent solution alkaline and greatly improving the action of the detergent surfactant, can cause environmental problems. A commercial solid detergent contains only 10\u201330% surfactant. Detergent formulations also contain complexing agents added to complex calcium and to function as builders. Other ingredients include ion exchangers, alkalies (sodium carbonate), anticorrosive sodium silicates, amide foam stabilizers, soil-suspending carboxymethylcellulose, bleaches, fabric softeners, enzymes, optical brighteners, fragrances, dyes, and diluent sodium sulfate. The polyphosphates formerly used in builders have caused the most concern as environmental pollutants, although these problems have largely been resolved as polyphosphates have been phased out. Increasing demands on the performance of detergents have led to the use of enzymes in detergent formulations destined for both domestic and commercial applications. To a degree, enzymes can take the place of chlorine and phosphates, both of which can have detrimental environmental consequences. Lipases and cellulases are the most useful enzymes for detergent applications. 7.10.4 NATURALLY OCCURRING CHLORINATED AND BROMINATED COMPOUNDS Although halogenated organic compounds in water, such as those discussed as pesticides in Section 7.11, are normally considered to be from anthropogenic sources, more than 2000 such compounds have been identified from natural sources.3 These are produced largely by marine species, especially some kinds of red algae, probably as chemical defense agents. Some marine microorganisms, worms, sponges, and tunicates are also known to produce organochlorine and organobromine compounds. Various ones of these compounds have been detected in samples in Arctic regions including air, fish, seabird eggs, marine mammals, and Eskimo women\u2019s milk. An example of such a compound commonly encountered in the marine environment is 1,2\u00a2-bi-1H-pyrrole,2,3,3\u00a2,4,4\u00a2,5,5\u00a2heptachloro-1\u00a2-methyl-(C9H3N2Cl7), and its analogous bromine compound: 1,2\u2032-Bi-1H-pyrrole,2,3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032,5,5\u2032heptachloro-1\u2032-methyl 7.10.5 MICROBIAL TOXINS Bacteria and protozoa in water can produce toxins that can cause illness or even death. Toxins produced in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs by cyanobacteria including Anabaena, Microcystis, and Nodularia have caused adverse health effects in Australia, Brazil, England, and elsewhere in the world. There are about 40 species of cyanobacteria that produce toxins from six chemical groups. Cylindrospermopsin toxin (below) produced by cyanobacteria has poisoned people who have drunk water contaminated by the toxin. O OH HHO S O O O H CylindrospermopsinH N NHN NH H3C O NH Most of the protozoans that produce toxins belong to the order dinofl agellata, which are predominantly marine species. The cells of these organisms are enclosed in cellulose envelopes, which often have beautiful patterns on them. Among the effects caused by toxins from these organisms are gastrointestinal, respiratory, and skin disorders in humans; mass kills of various marine animals; and paralytic conditions caused by eating infested shellfi sh. The marine growth of dinoflagellates is characterized by occasional incidents in which they multiply at such an explosive rate that they color the water yellow, olive-green, or red by their vast numbers. In 1946, some sections of the Florida coast became so afflicted by \u201cred tide\u201d that the water became viscous and for many miles the beaches were littered with the remains of dead fi sh, shellfish, turtles, and other marine organisms. The sea spray in these areas became so irritating that coastal schools and resorts were closed. The greatest danger to humans from dinoflagellata toxins comes from the ingestion of shellfi sh, such as mussels and clams, that have accumulated the protozoa from sea water. In this form, the toxic material is called paralytic shellfi sh poison. As little as 4 mg of this toxin, the amount found in several severely infested mussels or clams, can be fatal to a human. The toxin depresses respiration and affects the heart, resulting in complete cardiac arrest in extreme cases. 7.11 PESTICIDES IN WATER The introduction of DDT during World War II marked the beginning of a period of very rapid growth in pesticide use. Pesticides are employed for many different purposes.", "Chemicals used in the control of invertebrates include insecticides, molluscicides for the control of snails and slugs, and nematicides for the control of microscopic roundworms. Vertebrates are controlled by rodenticides that kill rodents, avicides are used to repel birds, and piscicides are used in fi sh control. Herbicides are used to kill plants, particularly weeds in agricultural crops. Plant growth regulators, defoliants, and plant desiccants are used for various purposes in the cultivation of plants. Fungicides are used against fungi, bactericides against bacteria, slimicides against slime-causing organisms in water, and algicides against algae. As of the mid-1990s, U.S. agriculture used about 365 million kg of pesticides per year, whereas about 900 million kg of insecticides were used in nonagricultural applications including forestry, landscaping, gardening, food distribution, and home pest control. Insecticide production has remained about level during the last three or four decades. However, insecticides and fungicides are the most important pesticides with respect to human exposure in food because they are applied shortly before or even after harvesting. Herbicide production has increased as chemicals have increasingly replaced cultivation of land in the control of weeds and now accounts for the majority of agricultural pesticides. The potential exists for large quantities of pesticides to enter water either directly, in applications such as mosquito control or indirectly, primarily from drainage of agricultural lands. Several classes of pesticides and other chemicals are of particular concern as water pollutants because of their potential effects. These are (1) highly biodegradation-resistant compounds, (2) known or probable carcinogens, (3) toxicants with adverse reproductive or developmental effects, (4) neurotoxins including cholinesterase inhibitors, (5) substances with high acute toxicities, and (6) known groundwater contaminants. Table 7.5 lists some of the most commonly used pesticides that may be of concern as water pollutants. Degradation (often hydrolysis) products of some pesticides are encountered in water at levels similar to, or even higher than, the parent pesticides. In some cases, the degradation products are more toxic than the parent pesticides. An example of a pesticide degradation product commonly found in water is aminomethyl phosphonic acid produced from herbicidal glyphosate (Figure 7.13) which, under the brand name of Roundup, is the most widely produced pesticide in the world. 7.11.1 NATURAL PRODUCT INSECTICIDES, PYRETHRINS, AND PYRETHROIDS Plants provide several significant classes of insecticides including nicotine from tobacco, rotenone from certain legume roots, and pyrethrins (see structural formulas in Figure 7.5). Because of the ways in which they are applied and their biodegradabilities, these substances are unlikely to be significant water pollutants. Pyrethrins and their synthetic analogs represent both the oldest and newest of insecticides. Extracts of dried chrysanthemum or pyrethrum flowers, which contain pyrethrin I and related compounds, have been known for their insecticidal properties for a long time, and may have even been used as botanical insecticides in China almost 2000 years ago. The most important commercial sources of insecticidal pyrethrins are chrysanthemum varieties grown in Kenya. Pyrethrins have several advantages as insecticides, including facile enzymatic degradation, which makes them relatively safe for mammals; ability to rapidly paralyze (\u201cknock down\u201d) flying insects; and good biodegradability characteristics. Synthetic analogs of the pyrethrins, pyrethroids, have been widely produced as insecticides during recent years. The first of these was allethrin, and another common example is fenvalerate TABLE 7.5 Pesticides That May Be Found as Water Pollutantsa Pesticide Alachlor Aldicarb Allethrin Atrazine Azadirachtin Azinphos-methyl Azoxystrobin Captan Carbaryl Carbofuran Chlorothalonil Chlorpyrifos Cypermethrin Deltamethrin Diazinon Diclofop-methyl Diuron EPTC Ethephon Fenvalerate Fluquinconazole Glyphosate Iprodione Kresoxim-methyl Linuron Malathion Mecoprop Metam-sodium Methiocarb Metolachlor Metribuzin Phosmet Pirimicarb Prometon Propachlor Propanil Propiconazole Simazine Spinosad Tebuconazole Tebuthiuron Terbacil Terbuthylazine Thifensulfuron-methyl Thiophanate-methyl Tri-allate Triclopyr Trifl oxystrobin Trifl uralin Use Herbicide Insecticide Insecticide Herbicide Insecticide, nematicide Insecticide Fungicide Fungicide Insecticide, plant growth regulator, nematicide Insecticide, nematicide Fungicide Insecticide, nematicide Insecticide Insecticide Insecticide Herbicide Herbicide Herbicide Plant growth regulator Insecticide Fungicide Herbicide Fungicide Fungicide Herbicide Insecticide Herbicide Fumigant, herbicide, microbiocide, algacide Insecticide, molluscicide Herbicide Herbicide Insecticide Insecticide Herbicide Herbicide Herbicide Fungicide Herbicide Insecticide Fungicide Herbicide Herbicide Algicide, herbicide, microbiocide Herbicide Fungicide Herbicide Herbicide Fungicide Herbicide Compound Type Chloroacetanilide Carbamate Pyrethroid Triazine Complex botanical compound Organophosphate Strobin Thiophthalimide Carbamate Carbamate Substituted benzene Organophosphate Pyrethroid Pyrethroid Organophosphorus Chlorophenoxy acid/ester Urea Thiocarbamate Organophosphate Pyrethroid Azole Phosphonoglycine Dicarboximide Strobin Urea Organophosphate Chlorphenoxy compound Dithiocarbamate Carbamate Chloroacetanilide Triazinone Organophosphate Carbamate Triazine Chloroacetanilide Anilide Azole Triazine Compound from bacteria Azole Urea Uracil Triazine Sulfonylurea Benzimidazole Thiocarbamate Chloropyridinyl Strobin 2,6-Dinitroaniline a For additional information see Pesticide Action Network: http://www.pesticideinfo.org/ HHHH H HCCCCC H O H3C O O C Pyrethrin", "I CH3 CC H3C H3C H CH3 H 3C CH3 H 3C C CH H CH3 H O C C H H3C C H C CH3 O C C Allethrin O H H N Cl FenvalerateN O C CH3Cl O H3CC O N O C Cl O C H3C CH3 Cypermethrin Br Br Deltamethrin O FIGURE 7.5 Common botanical insecticides and synthetic analogs of the pyrethrins. (see structural formulas in Figure 7.5). Other examples of insecticidal pyrethroids that have water pollution potential include cypermethrin and deltamethrin. 7.11.2 DDT AND ORGANOCHLORINE INSECTICIDES Chlorinated hydrocarbon or organochlorine insecticides are hydrocarbon compounds in which various numbers of hydrogen atoms have been replaced by Cl atoms (Figure 7.6). Of the organochlorine insecticides, the most notable has been DDT, which was used in massive quantities following World War II. It has a low acute toxicity to mammals, although there is some evidence that it might be C Cl DDE Cl Cl O Endosulfan carcinogenic. It is a very persistent insecticide and accumulates in food chains. It has been banned in the United States since 1972. Many organochlorine insecticides were widely used in past decades but are now banned because of their toxicities, and particularly their accumulation and persistence in food chains. Now largely of historical interest, these include methoxychlor (once a popular replacement for DDT), dieldrin, endrin, chlordane, aldrin, dieldrin/endrin, heptachlor, toxaphene, lindane, and endosulfan (one of the last to be phased out of general use). 7.11.3 ORGANOPHOSPHATE INSECTICIDES Organophosphate insecticides are insecticidal organic compounds that contain phosphorus, some of which are organic esters of orthophosphoric acid, such as paraoxon: OC2H5O P O NO2 C2H5O More commonly, insecticidal phosphorus compounds are phosphorothionate and phosphorodithioate compounds, such as those shown in Figure 7.7, which have an =S group rather than an =O group bonded to P. The toxicities of organophosphate insecticides vary a great deal. Their major toxic effect is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme essential for nerve function. For example, as little as 120 mg of parathion has been known to kill an adult human, and a dose of 2 mg has killed a child. Most accidental poisonings have occurred by absorption through the skin. Since its use began, several hundred people have been killed by parathion. In contrast, malathion shows how differences in structural formula can cause pronounced differences in the properties of organophosphate pesticides. Malathion has two carboxyester linkages, which are hydrolyzable by carboxylase enzymes to relatively nontoxic products as shown by the following reaction: HO HO H CCO C2H5 S HC COS H2O, carboxylase H3COP SCH H3CO P S C H + 2HOC2H5 (7.11) enzyme O COC2H5 O OHC CH3 CH3O O Malathion H3CO H3CO C2H5O C2H5O Chlorpyrifos (Dursban\u00ae) Phosmet FIGURE 7.7 Examples of phosphorothionate (methyl parathion and chlorpyrifos) and phosphorodithioate (azinphos-methylphosmet) insecticides. The enzymes that accomplish malathion hydrolysis are possessed by mammals, but not by insects, so mammals can detoxify malathion, whereas insects cannot. The result is that malathion has selective insecticidal activity. For example, although malathion is a very effective insecticide, its LD50 (dose required to kill 50% of test subjects) for adult male rats is about 100 times that of parathion, reflecting the much lower mammalian toxicity of malathion compared to some of the more toxic organophosphate insecticides, such as parathion. Unlike the organohalide compounds they largely displaced, the organophosphates readily undergo biodegradation and do not bioaccumulate. Because of their high biodegradability and restricted use, organophosphates are of comparatively little significance as water pollutants. 7.11.4 CARBAMATES Pesticidal organic derivatives of carbamic acid, for which the formula is shown in Figure 7.8, are known collectively as carbamates. Carbamate pesticides have been widely used because some are more biodegradable than the formerly popular organochlorine insecticides, and have lower dermal toxicities than most common organophosphate pesticides. Carbaryl has been widely used as an insecticide on lawns or gardens. It has a low toxicity to mammals. Carbofuran has a high water solubility and acts as a plant systemic insecticide. As a plant systemic insecticide, it is taken up by the roots and leaves of plants so that insects are poisoned by the plant material on which they feed. Pirimicarb has been widely used in agriculture as a systemic aphicide. Unlike many carbamates, it is rather persistent, with a strong tendency to bind to soil. Carbamates are toxic to animals because they inhibit acetylcholinesterase. Unlike some of the organophosphate insecticides, they do so without the need for undergoing a prior biotransformation and are therefore classified as direct inhibitors.", "Their inhibition of acetylcholinesterase is relatively reversible. Loss of acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity may result from hydrolysis of the carbamate ester, which can occur metabolically. 7.11.5 FUNGICIDES Fungicides are widely applied to cereal and food crops to prevent fungal infections of these crops. Because of this, fungicides have the potential to contaminate water. Structural formulas of three commonly used fungicides are shown in Figure 7.9. Of the ones shown, chlorothalonil has been used for more than 30 years with annual applications in the United States of more than 5 million kg. It is typically applied at a rate of 1 kg per hectare per application with 4\u20139 applications per year. The strobilurin fungicides exemplified by azoxystrobin and the triazole fungicides exemplifi ed by propiconazole came into use during the 1990s and have been effective, although some problems with resistance developed by target organisms have been encountered. Carbofuran Aldicarb FIGURE 7.8 Carbamic acid and three insecticidal carbamates.

Herbicides are commonly found in surface water and groundwater. Among those commonly encountered in surface water and groundwater are atrazine, simazine, and cyanazine widely used to control weeds on corn and soybeans in the \u201cCorn Belt\u201d states of Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri as well as agricultural regions throughout the world. Other herbicides found in water include prometon, metolachlor, metribuzin, tebuthiuron, trifl uran, alachlor, and the atrazine metabolites deisopropylatrazine and deethylatrazine. Although glyphosate is a very widely used herbicide to control weeds on crops genetically engineered to resist its effects, it is rarely found at levels of concern in water because of its very strong affinity for soil solids. 7.11.6.1 Bipyridilium Compounds As shown by the structures in Figure 7.10, a bipyridilium compound contains two pyridine rings per molecule. The two important pesticidal compounds of this type are the herbicides diquat and paraquat, the structural formulas of which are illustrated in Figure 7.11. Other members of this class of herbicides include chlormequat, morfamquat, and difenzoquat. Applied directly to the plant tissue, these compounds rapidly destroy plant cells and give the plant a frostbitten appearance. However, they bind tenaciously to soil, especially the clay mineral fraction, which results in rapid loss of herbicidal activity so that sprayed fi elds can be planted within a day or two of herbicide application. Paraquat, which was registered for use in 1965, has been one of the most used of the bipyridilium herbicides. Highly toxic, it is reputed to have \u201cbeen responsible for hundreds of human deaths.\u201d 4 Exposure to fatal or dangerous levels of paraquat can occur by all pathways, including inhalation of spray, skin contact, ingestion, and even suicidal hypodermic injections. Despite these possibilities and its widespread application, paraquat is used safely without ill effects when proper procedures are followed. Because of its widespread use as a herbicide, the possibility exists of substantial paraquat contamination of food. Drinking water contamination by paraquat has also been observed. H3C +N N+ CH3 N+ +N Diquat Paraquat FIGURE 7.10 The two major bipyridilium herbicides (cation forms). Cl Cl C2H5 C2H5 H Metribuzin (Sencor\u00ae) Terbuthylazine FIGURE 7.11 Triazine herbicides. These compounds are commonly encountered as water pollutants in agricultural areas where they are widely used. 7.11.6.2 Herbicidal Heterocyclic Nitrogen Compounds A number of important herbicides contain three heterocyclic nitrogen atoms in ring structures and are therefore called triazines (Figure 7.11). Triazine herbicides inhibit photosynthesis. Selectivity is gained by the inability of target plants to metabolize and detoxify the herbicide. The most long established and common example of this class is atrazine, commonly applied to kill weeds in corn, and a widespread water pollutant in corn-growing regions. Another member of this class is metribuzin, which is widely used on soybeans, sugarcane, and wheat. 7.11.6.3 Chlorophenoxy Herbicides The chlorophenoxy herbicides, including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) shown in Figure 7.12, were manufactured on a large scale for weed and brush control and as military defoliants. At one time the latter was of particular concern because of contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (see figures) present as a manufacturing by-product. 7.11.6.4 Miscellaneous Herbicides Many herbicides that are environmentally significant do not fall into the classifi cations described above.", "The most commonly used of these that are likely to be encountered as water pollutants are shown in Figure 7.13. Nitroaniline herbicides are characterized by the presence of NO2 and a substituted \u2013NH2 group on a benzene ring as shown for trifluralin. This class of herbicides is widely represented in agricultural OH OH HOCCO HOCCO ClH Cl H Cl 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxy-Cl acid (and esters), 2,4-D Cl acetic acid (and esters), 2,4,5-T 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic FIGURE 7.12 Chlorophenoxy herbicides. O CH3 Cl O H H H O Cl Linuron O H applications and includes benefi n (Balan\u201a), oryzalin (Surfl an\u201a), pendimethalin (Prowl\u201a), and fl uchoralin (Basalin\u201a). A wide variety of chemicals have been used as herbicides, and have been potential water pollutants. One such compound is R-mecoprop (Figure 7.13). Other types of herbicides include substituted ureas, carbamates, and thiocarbamates. Until about 1960, arsenic trioxide and other inorganic arsenic compounds (see Section 7.4) were employed to kill weeds. Because of the incredibly high rates of application of up to several hundred kilograms per acre, and because arsenic is nonbiodegradable, the potential still exists for arsenic pollution of surface water and groundwater from fields formerly dosed with inorganic arsenic. Organic arsenicals, such as cacodylic acid, have also been widely applied to kill weeds: O H3C As CH3 Hydroxydimethylarsine oxide, cacodylic acid OH 7.11.7 BY-PRODUCTS OF PESTICIDE MANUFACTURE A number of water pollution and health problems have been associated with the manufacture of organochlorine pesticides. The most notorious by-products of pesticide manufacture are polychlorinated 91 Cl Cl O O 8 2 3 7 O OCl Cl Dibenzo-p-dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin 64 FIGURE 7.14 Dibenzo-p-dioxin and TCDD, often called simply \u201cdioxin.\u201d In the structure of dibenzo-pdioxin, each number refers to a numbered carbon atom to which an H atom is bound, and the names of derivatives are based upon the carbon atoms where another group has been substituted for the H atoms, as is seen by the structure and name of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. dibenzodioxins. From 1 to 8 Cl atoms may be substituted for H atoms on dibenzo-p-dioxin (Figure 7.14), giving a total of 75 possible chlorinated derivatives. Commonly referred to as \u201cdioxins,\u201d these species have a high environmental and toxicological significance. Of the dioxins, the most notable pollutant and hazardous waste compound is TCDD, often referred to simply as \u201cdioxin.\u201d This compound was produced as a low-level contaminant in the manufacture of some aryl, oxygen-containing organohalide compounds such as chlorophenoxy herbicides (mentioned previously in this section) synthesized by processes used until the 1960s. TCDD has a very low vapor pressure, a high melting point of 305\u00b0C, and a water solubility of only 0.2 \u03bcg/L. It is chemically unreactive, stable thermally up to about 700\u00b0C, and is poorly biodegradable. It is very toxic to some animals, with an LD50 of only about 0.6 \u03bcg/kg body mass in male guinea pigs. (The type and degree of its toxicity to humans are largely unknown; it is known to cause a severe skin condition called chloracne.) Because of its properties, TCDD is a stable, persistent environmental pollutant and a hazardous waste constituent of considerable concern. It has been identified in some municipal incineration emissions, in which it is believed to form when chlorine from the combustion of organochlorine compounds reacts with carbon in the incinerator. TCDD contamination has resulted from improper waste disposal, the most notable case of which resulted from the spraying of waste oil mixed with TCDD on roads and horse arenas in Missouri in the early 1970s. Contamination of the soil in Times Beach, Missouri, resulted in the whole town being bought out and its topsoil dug up and incinerated at a cost exceeding $100 million. One of the greater environmental disasters ever to result from pesticide manufacture involved the production of Kepone, structural formula This pesticide has been used for the control of banana-root borer, tobacco wireworm, ants, and cockroaches. Kepone exhibits acute, delayed, and cumulative toxicity in birds, rodents, and humans, and it causes cancer in rodents. It was manufactured in Hopewell, Virginia, during the mid-1970s. During this time, workers were exposed to Kepone and are alleged to have suffered health problems as a result. As much as 53,000 kg of kepone may have been dumped through the sewage system of Hopewell and into the James River. The cost of dredging the river to remove this waste was estimated at a prohibitive cost of several billion dollars.", "7.12 POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS First discovered as environmental pollutants in 1966, PCB compounds have been found throughout the world in water, sediments, bird tissue, and fish tissue. These compounds constitute an important class of special wastes. They are made by substituting from 1 to 10 Cl atoms onto the biphenyl aryl structure as shown on the left in Figure 7.15. This substitution can produce 209 different compounds (congeners), of which one example is shown on the right in Figure 7.15. Polychlorinated biphenyls have very high chemical, thermal, and biological stability; low vapor pressure; and high dielectric constants. These properties have led to the use of PCBs as coolant-insulation fluids in transformers and capacitors; for the impregnation of cotton and asbestos; as plasticizers; and as additives to some epoxy paints. The same properties that made extraordinarily stable PCBs so useful also contributed to the widespread dispersion and accumulation of these substances in the environment. By regulations issued in the United States under the authority of the Toxic Substances Control Act passed in 1976, the manufacture of PCBs was discontinued in the United States, and their uses and disposal were strictly controlled. Some degree of biodegradation of PCBs in the environment does occur.5 Substitutes for PCBs for electrical applications have been developed. Disposal of PCBs from discarded electrical equipment and other sources have caused problems, particularly since PCBs can survive ordinary incineration by escaping as vapors through the smokestack. However, they can be destroyed by special incineration processes. PCBs are especially prominent pollutants in the sediments of the Hudson River as a result of waste discharges from two capacitor manufacturing plants that operated about 60 km upstream from the southernmost dam on the river from 1950 to 1976. The river sediments downstream from the plants exhibit PCB levels of about 10 ppm, 1\u20132 orders of magnitude higher than levels commonly encountered in river and estuary sediments. In 2002, General Electric Co. was ordered to dredge and decontaminate sections of the Hudson River polluted with PCBs at a cost exceeding $100 million. As of 2009, the actual cleanup was barely underway. 7.13 EMERGING WATER POLLUTANTS, PHARMACEUTICALS, AND HOUSEHOLD WASTES The continued development of new products used for various purposes has led to interest in emerging pollutants of various kinds which may be of concern in water. Prominent among these are nanomaterials consisting of very small entities in the 1\u2013100 nm size range. Nanomaterials of various kinds have unique properties of high thermal stability, low permeability, high strength, and high conductivity. These and other properties are leading to uses in electronics, automobiles, apparel, sunscreens, cosmetics, water purification, and other products. It is anticipated that the use of nanomaterials in drug delivery will increase rapidly in the future. The commercial uses of nanomaterials are in their infancy, but very rapid growth is underway. Little is known about the potential pollution effects and toxicities of nanomaterials, so their potential effects as water pollutants are of signifi cant concern. Another class of emerging pollutants consists of siloxanes (commonly called silicones) including octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane. Siloxanes are thermally and chemically very stable leading to their uses as coolants in transformers, protective encapsulating materials in semiconductors, lubricants, coatings, and sealants. Siloxanes are widely used in personal care products including deodorants, cosmetics, soaps, hair conditioners, and hair dyes and other products such as water repellent windshield coatings, detergent antifoaming agents, and even food additives. Siloxanes are resistant to biodegradation and as a result are encountered in water that has received wastewater. CH3 CH3 Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, a cyclic siloxane Disinfection by-products are of some concern as water pollutants. These are compounds containing halogens and nitrogen that result from reactions of water disinfectants including chlorine, hypochlorite, and chlorine dioxide. In addition to exposure in drinking water, humans may be exposed to these substances through skin contact in bathing or swimming and as vapors emitted from water during showers. Brominated and iodated compounds are formed in chlorinated water by reactions of bromide or iodide in the water, usually present in areas of seawater or saline groundwater intrusion. The most common disinfection by-products are the trihalomethanes\u2014chloroform (CHCl3), dibromochloromethane (CHClBr2), bromodichloromethane (CHCl2Br), and tribromomethane (CHBr3). These are all by-products of water chlorination and are Group B carcinogens (shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals). By far the most abundant of these in water systems is trichloromethane (chloroform). Dibromochloromethane is regarded as posing about 10 times the risk of cancer as chloroform, and tribromomethane is thought to pose just a slightly greater cancer risk than chloroform.", "As of 2009, the maximum allowable limit for total trihalomethanes in drinking water was 100 \u03bcg/L. Various substances associated with household wastes are found in water, especially in treated sewage discharges. These materials include steroids, surfactants, flame retardants, fragrances, plasticizers, and pharmaceuticals and their metabolites. It should be noted that, although signifi cant numbers of such compounds are found, they are generally at subpart-per-billion levels and are detectable only by the remarkable capability of modern analytical instrumentation. A study of \u201cexotic\u201d organics found in groundwater and water supplies6 detected a variety of substances including cholesterol, nicotine metabolite cotinine, b-sitosterol (a natural plant sterol), 1,7-dimethylxanthine (caffeine metabolite), bisphenol-A plasticizer, and fire retardant (2-chloroethyl) phosphate. Pharmaceutical compounds and their partial degradation products are discharged with sewage as wastes from human ingestion and from being discarded with wastewater.7 The quantities of these substances in sewage in developed countries can reach of the order of 100 metric tons per year. Levels of common pharmaceuticals of around 1 \u03bcg/L have been observed in river water. Although these are relatively low values, they are of some concern because of the biological activity inherent to pharmaceutical products, which are increasingly designed for higher potency, bioavailability, and resistance to degradation. Figure 7.16 shows some of the most common pharmaceuticals and their degradation products that have been observed in water. The most obvious effect of pharmaceuticals and their metabolic products in water has been the feminization of male fish observed downstream from treated sewage discharges resulting from estrogenic compounds in wastewater. First noted in England and later in the United States and Europe, these male fish have been observed to produce proteins associated with egg production by female fish and to produce early-stage eggs in their testes. These effects are largely attributed to residues of synthetic 17a-ethinylestradiol and the natural hormone 17b-estradiol, used in oral contraceptives. The glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of 17a-ethinylestradiol (see Chapter 23 for a discussion of conjugates formed metabolically) are excreted with urine and cleaved by bacteria in water to regenerate the original compound.

One of the most common of these is triclosan, Cl Triclosan (methyl triclosan has a \u2013CH3 group substituted for the H designated H*) widely used in antibacterial soaps as well as other consumer items such as shampoos, deodorants, lotions, toothpastes, sportswear, shoes, carpets, and even refuse containers. This compound and its methyl derivative have been found in natural waters in Switzerland.8 7.13.2 ESTROGENIC SUBSTANCES IN WASTEWATER EFFLUENTS A class of water pollutants of particular concern commonly found in sewage and even treated sewage effl uent are estrogenic substances that can disrupt the crucial endocrine gland activities that regulate the metabolism and reproductive functions of organisms (Section 22.8). Aquatic organisms including fish, frogs, and reptiles such as alligators exposed to such substances may exhibit reproductive dysfunction, alterations in secondary sex characteristics, and abnormal serum steroid levels. Such substances include exogenous estrogenic substances among which are 17a-ethynyl estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, mestranol, levonorgestrel, and norethindrone used in oral contraceptives, treatment of hormonal disorders, and cancer treatment. Some synthetic substances also act as estrogen disruptors. Of prime concern as water pollutants are nonionic surfactant polyethoxylates, mentioned in the discussion of detergents above, and their major degradation product, persistent nonylphenol. Although these substances are orders of magnitude less potent than hormonal substances, annual usage of millions of kilograms of nonionic surfactants make them a signifi cant factor as water pollutants. 7.13.3 BIOREFRACTORY ORGANIC POLLUTANTS Millions of tons of organic compounds are manufactured globally each year. Significant quantities of several thousand such compounds appear as water pollutants. Most of these compounds, particularly the less biodegradable ones, are substances to which living organisms have not been exposed until recent years. Often, their effects on organisms are not known, particularly for long-term exposures at very low levels. The potential exists for synthetic organics to cause genetic damage, cancer, or other ill effects. On the positive side, organic pesticides enable a level of agricultural productivity without which millions would starve. Synthetic organic chemicals are increasingly taking the place of natural products in short supply. Thus it is seen that organic chemicals are essential for the operation of a modern society.", "Because of their potential danger, however, acquisition of knowledge about their environmental chemistry must have a high priority. Biorefractory organics are the organic compounds of most concern in wastewater, particularly when they are found in sources of drinking water. These are poorly biodegradable substances and are sometimes referred to as persistent organic pollutants (POP), prominent among which are aryl or chlorinated hydrocarbons. Biorefractory compounds that may be found in water include benzene, chloroform, methyl chloride, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethane, and toluene. In addition to their potential toxicity, biorefractive compounds can cause taste and odor problems in water. They are not completely removed by biological treatment, and water contaminated with these compounds must be treated by physical and chemical means, including air stripping, solvent extraction, ozonation, and carbon adsorption. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), CH3 H3C OCCH3 CH3 was once used as a gasoline octane booster, but was phased out after it appeared as a low-level water pollutant in the United States. Levels of this chemical in recreational lakes and reservoirs were attributed largely to emissions of unburned fuel from recreational motorboats and personal watercraft having two-cycle engines that discharge their exhausts directly to the water. Perfl uorinated organic compounds constitute a unique class of POPs. They occur as completely fluorinated hydrocarbon derivatives, such as CF4, in the atmosphere, where they are regarded as atmospheric pollutants and potential greenhouse gases (see Section 12.7). Other perfl uorinated compounds that are organic acids or their salts have been encountered as water pollutants. Most commonly cited are salts of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid; others include salts of perfl uorinated carboxylic acids, such as perfl uorohexanoic acid: OFFFFFFFF OFFFFF HOSCCCCCCCCF HOCCCCCCF OFFFFFFFF FFFFF Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid Perfluorohexanoic acid Perfluorocarbons have been used commercially since the 1950s, primarily as coatings to resist soil and grease in paper products, fabrics, carpet material, and leather. Scotchgard fabric protector, once manufactured by 3M Corporation, contained perfluorooctane sulfonates, but this use has been discontinued. Perfluorocarbons have also been used as surfactants in oil drilling fluids and fi refi ghting foams. Other applications have included alkaline cleaners, floor polish formulations, etching baths, and even denture cleaners. Perfluorocarbons have been detected in water, fish blood and liver, and human blood. Brominated compounds have been recognized as significant environmental and water pollutants in recent years and have even been found in mothers\u2019 milk in some countries. These compounds have been manufactured as flame retardants, largely for use in polymers and textiles. The most common of the brominated compounds likely to be encountered as pollutants are polybrominated diphenyl ethers and tetrabromobisphenol: Br Br BrBr Br Br BrBr O Br Br Br BrBr Br 2,2\u2019,4,4\u2019 tetrabromodiphenyl ether Decabromodiphenyl ether OH Tetrabromobisphenol A Benzotriazole and tolyltriazoles (structural formulas below) are complexing agents for metals that are widely used as anticorrosive additives by forming a thin complexing film on metal surfaces, thereby protecting the metal from corrosion. These compounds are used in a variety of products including hydraulic fluids, cooling fluids, antifreeze formulations, and aircraft deicer fluids, and for silver protection in dishwasher detergents. Because of these uses, the triazoles are commonly encountered as \u201cdown-the-drain\u201d chemicals that get into wastewaters. Their widespread use, high water solubility, and poor biodegradability make them among the most widely encountered chemicals in waters receiving treated wastewater.9 N N N NNN N H Benzotriazole Tolyltriazoles Naphthenic acid is a complex and variable mixture of carboxylic acids of molar masses in the approximate range of 180\u2013350 and typically containing one \u2013CO2H group and one 5- or 6-membered ring per molecule that is a by-product of petroleum refining. Naphthenic acids recovered from petroleum refining are used for solvents, lubricants, corrosion inhibitors, metal naphthenate synthesis, fuel additives, deicing, dust control, wood preservation, and road stabilization. Water pollution from naphthenic acids is most severe in the tar sands processing area of Alberta, Canada, where caustic hot water is used to wash heavy hydrocarbon crude oil from sand, leaving huge quantities of tailings of clay, sand, and water contaminated with 80\u2013120 mg/L naphthenic acids. The acids are toxic to aquatic organisms and are endocrine disrupting substances. 4-Methyl-1-cyclohexane carboxylic acid, CO2H a typical low-molar-mass naphthenic acid 7.14 RADIONUCLIDES IN THE AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT The massive production of radionuclides (radioactive isotopes) by weapons and nuclear reactors since World War II has been accompanied by increasing concern about the effects of radioactivity on health and the environment. Radionuclides are produced as fission products of heavy nuclei of elements such as uranium or plutonium.", "They are also produced by the reaction of neutrons with stable nuclei. These + Stable nucleus Unstable nucleus FIGURE 7.17 A heavy nucleus, such as that of 235U, may absorb a neutron and break up (undergo fi ssion), yielding lighter radioactive nuclei. A stable nucleus may absorb a neutron to produce a radioactive nucleus. phenomena are illustrated in Figure 7.17 and specifi c examples are given in Table 7.6. Radionuclides are formed in large quantities as waste products in nuclear power generation. Their ultimate disposal is a problem that has caused much controversy regarding the widespread use of nuclear power. Artificially produced radionuclides are also widely used in industrial and medical applications, particularly as \u201ctracers.\u201d With so many possible sources of radionuclides, it is impossible to entirely TABLE 7.6 Radionuclides in Water Radionuclide Half-Life Nuclear Reaction, Description, Source Naturally Occurring and from Cosmic Reactions Carbon-14 5730 ya 14N(n,p)14C,b thermal neutrons from cosmic or nuclear-weapon sources reacting with N2 Silicon-32 ~300 y 40Ar(p,x)32Si, nuclear spallation (splitting of the nucleus) of atmospheric argon by cosmic-ray protons Potassium-40 ~1.4 \u00a5 109 y 0.0119% of natural potassium including potassium in the body Naturally Occurring from 238U Series Radium-226 1620 y Diffusion from sediments, atmosphere Lead-210 21 y 226Ra \u00c6 6 steps \u00c6 210Pb Thorium-230 75,200 y 238U \u00c6 3 steps \u00c6 230Th produced in situ Thorium-234 24 d 238U \u00c6 234Th produced in situ From Reactor and Weapons Fissionc Strontium-90 (28 y) Iodine-131 (8 d) Cesium-137 (30 y) Barium-140 (13 d) > Zirconium-95 (65 d) > Cerium-141 (33 d) > Strontium-89 (51 d) > Ruthenium-103 (40 d) > Krypton-85 (10.3 y) From Nonf ssion Sources Cobalt-60 5.25 y From nonfission neutron reactions in reactors Manganese-54 310 d From nonfission neutron reactions in reactors Iron-55 2.7 y 56Fe(n,2n)55Fe, from high-energy neutrons acting on iron in weapons hardware Plutonium-239 24,300 y 238U(n,g)239Pu, neutron capture by uranium a Abbreviations: y, years; d, days. b This notation shows the isotope nitrogen-14 reacting with a neutron, n, giving off a proton, p, and forming the carbon-14 isotope; other nuclear reactions can be deduced from this notation where x represents nuclear fragments from spallation. The first three fission-product radioisotopes listed below as products of reactor and weapons fission are of most signifi cance because of their high yields and biological activity. The other fission products are listed in generally decreasing order of yield. eliminate radioactive contamination of aquatic systems. Furthermore, radionuclides may enter aquatic systems from natural sources. Therefore, the transport, reactions and biological concentration of radionuclides in aquatic ecosystems are of great importance to the environmental chemist. Radionuclides differ from other nuclei in that they emit ionizing radiation\u2014alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. The most massive of these emissions is the alpha particle, a helium nucleus of atomic mass 4, consisting of two neutrons and two protons. The symbol for an alpha particle is 42 a . An example of alpha production is found in the radioactive decay of uranium-238: 238 234 4 U \u00c6 Th +a (7.12) 92 902 This transformation occurs when a uranium nucleus, atomic number 92 and atomic mass 238, loses an alpha particle, atomic number 2 and atomic mass 4, to yield a thorium nucleus, atomic number 90 and atomic mass 234. Beta radiation consists of either highly energetic, negative electrons, which are designated -01b, or positive electrons, called positrons, and designated 10b . A typical beta emitter, chlorine-38, may be produced by irradiating chlorine with neutrons. The chlorine-37 nucleus, natural abundance 24.5%, absorbs a neutron to produce chlorine-38 and gamma radiation: 37 1 38 (7.13) Cl + n \u00c6 Cl +g 17 017 The chlorine-38 nucleus is radioactive and loses a negative beta particle to become an argon-38 nucleus: 3838 0 Cl \u00c6 Ar +b (7.14) 17 18 -1 Since the negative beta particle has essentially no mass and a -1 charge, the stable product isotope, argon-38, has the same mass and a charge 1 greater than chlorine-38. Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation similar to x-rays, though more energetic. Since the energy of gamma radiation is often a well-defined property of the emitting nucleus, it may be used in some cases for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of radionuclides. The primary effect of alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays on materials is the production of ions; therefore, they are called ionizing radiation. Due to their large size, alpha particles do not penetrate matter deeply, but cause an enormous amount of ionization along their short path of penetration.", "Therefore, alpha particles present little hazard outside the body, but are very dangerous when ingested. Although beta particles are more penetrating than alpha particles, they produce much less ionization per unit path length. Gamma rays are much more penetrating than particulate radiation, but cause much less ionization. Their degree of penetration is proportional to their energy. The decay of a specific radionuclide follows first-order kinetics; that is, the number of nuclei disintegrating in a short time interval is directly proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei present. The rate of decay, -dN/dt, is given by the equation dN (7.15) Decay rate = =lN dt where N is the number of radioactive nuclei present and l is the rate constant, which has units of reciprocal time. Since the exact number of disintegrations per second is difficult to determine in the laboratory, radioactive decay is often described in terms of the measured activity, A, which is proportional to the absolute rate of decay. The first-order decay equation may be expressed in terms of A: A = A0e-lt (7.16) where A is the activity at time t, A0 is the activity when t is zero, and e is the natural logarithm base. The half-life, t1/2, is generally used instead of l to characterize a radionuclide: 0.693 (7.17) t = 1/2 l As the term implies, a half-life is the period of time during which half of a given number of atoms of a specific kind of radionuclide decay. Ten half-lives are required for the loss of 99.9% of the activity of a radionuclide. Radiation damages living organisms by initiating harmful chemical reactions in tissues. For example, bonds are broken in the macromolecules that carry out life processes. In cases of acute radiation poisoning, bone marrow, which produces red blood cells, is destroyed and the concentration of red blood cells is diminished. Radiation-induced genetic damage is of great concern. Such damage may not become apparent until many years after exposure. As humans have learned more about the effects of ionizing radiation, the dosage level considered to be safe has steadily diminished. For example, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has dropped the maximum permissible concentration of some radioisotopes to levels of less than one ten-thousandth of those considered safe in the early 1950s. Although it is possible that even the slightest exposure to ionizing radiation entails some damage, some radiation is unavoidably received from natural sources including the radioactive 40K found in all humans. For the majority of the population, exposure to natural radiation exceeds that from artifi cial sources. The study of the ecological and health effects of radionuclides involves consideration of many factors. Among these are the type and energy of radiation emitter and the half-life of the source. In addition, the degree to which the particular element is absorbed by living species and the chemical interactions and transport of the element in aquatic ecosystems are important factors. Radionuclides having very short half-lives may be hazardous when produced but decay too rapidly to affect the environment into which they are introduced. Radionuclides with very long half-lives may be quite persistent in the environment but of such low activity that little environmental damage is caused. Therefore, in general, radionuclides with intermediate half-lives are the most dangerous. They persist long enough to enter living systems while still retaining a high activity. Because they may be incorporated within living tissue, radionuclides of \u201clife elements\u201d are particularly dangerous. Much concern has been expressed over strontium-90, a common waste product of nuclear testing. This element is interchangeable with calcium in bone. Strontium-90 fallout drops onto pasture and cropland and is ingested by cattle. Eventually, it enters the bodies of infants and children by way of cow\u2019s milk. Some radionuclides found in water, primarily radium and potassium-40, originate from natural sources, particularly leaching from minerals. Others come from pollutant sources, primarily nuclear power plants and testing of nuclear weapons. The levels of radionuclides found in water typically are measured in units of pCi/L (picocuries per liter), where a curie is 3.7 \u00a5 1010 disintegrations per second, and a pCi is 1 \u00a5 10-12 that amount, or 3.7 \u00a5 10-2 disintegrations per second (2.2 disintegrations per minute). The radionuclide of most concern in drinking water is radium, Ra. Areas in the United States where significant radium contamination of water has been observed include the uranium-producing regions of the western United States, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Minnesota, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, and the New England states.", "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency specifies maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for total radium (226Ra + 228Ra) in drinking water in units of pCi/L. In the past, perhaps as many as several hundred municipal water supplies in the United States have exceeded permissible levels, which has required finding alternative sources or additional treatment to remove radium. Fortunately, conventional water softening processes, which are designed to take out excessive levels of calcium, are relatively efficient in removing radium from water. The possible contamination of water by fission-product radioisotopes from nuclear power production is of some concern. (If nations continue to refrain from testing nuclear weapons above ground, it is hoped that radioisotopes from this source will contribute only minor amounts of radioactivity to water.) Table 7.6 summarizes the major natural and artificial radionuclides likely to be encountered in water. Transuranic elements are also of concern in the oceanic environment. These alpha emitters are long-lived and highly toxic. Included among these elements are various isotopes of neptunium, plutonium, americium, and curium. Specific isotopes, with half-lives in years given in parentheses, are Np-237 (2.14 \u00a5 106), Pu-236 (2.85), Pu-238 (87.8), Pu-239 (2.44 \u00a5 104), Pu-240 (6.54 \u00a5 103), Pu-241 (15), Pu-242 (3.87 \u00d7 105), Am-241 (433), Am-243 (7.37 \u00a5 106), Cm-242 (0.22), and Cm-244 (17.9).

Water for domestic use must be thoroughly disinfected to eliminate disease-causing microorganisms, but may contain appreciable levels of dissolved calcium and magnesium (hardness). Water to be used in boilers may contain bacteria but must be quite soft to prevent scale formation. Wastewater being discharged into a large river may require less rigorous treatment than water to be reused in an arid region. As world demand for limited water resources grows, more sophisticated and extensive means will have to be employed to treat water. Most physical and chemical processes used to treat water involve similar phenomena, regardless of their application to the three main categories of water treatment listed above. Therefore, after introductions to water treatment for municipal use, industrial use, and disposal, each major kind of treatment process is discussed as it applies to all of these applications. 8.2 MUNICIPAL WATER TREATMENT The modern water treatment plant is often called upon to perform wonders with the water fed to it. The clear, safe, even tasteful water that comes from a faucet may have started as a murky liquid pumped from a polluted river laden with mud and swarming with bacteria.", "Or, its source may have been well water, much too hard for domestic use and containing high levels of stain-producing dissolved iron and manganese. The water treatment plant operator\u2019s job is to make sure that the water plant product presents no hazards to the consumer. A schematic diagram of a typical municipal water treatment plant is shown in Figure 8.1. This particular facility treats water containing excessive hardness and a high level of iron. The raw water taken from wells first goes to an aerator. Contact of the water with air removes volatile solutes such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, methane, and volatile odorous substances such as methane thiol (CH3SH) and bacterial metabolites. Contact with oxygen also aids iron removal by oxidizing soluble iron(II) to insoluble iron(III). The addition of lime as CaO or Ca(OH)2 after aeration raises the pH and results in the formation of precipitates containing the hardness ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. These precipitates settle from the water in a primary basin. Much of the solid material remains in suspension and requires the addition of coagulants [such as iron(III) and aluminum sulfates, which form gelatinous metal hydroxides] to settle the colloidal particles. Activated silica or synthetic polyelectrolytes may also be added to stimulate coagulation or flocculation. The settling occurs in a secondary basin after the addition of carbon dioxide to lower the pH. Sludge from both the primary and secondary basins is pumped to a sludge lagoon. The water is finally chlorinated, filtered, and pumped to the city water mains. 8.3 TREATMENT OF WATER FOR INDUSTRIAL USE Water is widely used in various process applications in industry. Other major industrial uses are boiler feedwater and cooling water. The kind and degree of treatment of water in these applications depends upon the end use. As examples, cooling water may require only minimal treatment, removal of corrosive substances and scale-forming solutes is essential for boiler feedwater, and water used in food processing must be free of pathogens and toxic substances. Improper treatment of water for industrial use can cause problems such as corrosion, scale formation, reduced heat transfer in heat exchangers, reduced water flow, and product contamination. These effects may cause reduced equipment performance or equipment failure, increased energy costs due to inefficient heat utilization or cooling, increased costs for pumping water, and product deterioration. Obviously, the effective treatment of water at minimum cost for industrial use is a very important area of water treatment. Numerous factors must be taken into consideration in designing and operating an industrial water treatment facility. These include the following: \u2022 Water requirement \u2022 Quantity and quality of available water sources \u2022 Sequential use of water (successive uses for applications requiring progressively lower water quality) \u2022 Water recycle \u2022 Discharge standards The various specific processes employed to treat water for industrial use are discussed in later sections of this chapter. External treatment, usually applied to the plant\u2019s entire water supply, uses processes such as aeration, filtration, and clarification to remove material that may cause problems from water. Such substances include suspended or dissolved solids, hardness, and dissolved gases. Following this basic treatment, the water may be divided into different streams, some to be used without further treatment, and the rest to be treated for specifi c applications. Internal treatment is designed to modify the properties of water for specifi c applications. Examples of internal treatment include the following: \u2022 Reaction of dissolved oxygen (DO) with hydrazine or sulfi te \u2022 Addition of chelating agents to react with dissolved Ca2+ and prevent formation of calcium deposits \u2022 Addition of precipitants, such as phosphate used for calcium removal \u2022 Treatment with dispersants to inhibit scale \u2022 Addition of inhibitors to prevent corrosion \u2022 Adjustment of pH \u2022 Disinfection for food processing uses or to prevent bacterial growth in cooling water An important aspect of industrial process water treatment is the use of antiscalants and dispersants. The former prevent scale from materials such as CaCO3 from building up and dispersants keep scale particles from adhering to surfaces by keeping them dispersed in water. One of the most effective agents for this purpose is polyacrylate polymer formed by the polymerization of acrylic acid and treatment with base. This polymer binds with scale-forming substances and keeps them dispersed in water by virtue of the negative charge of the polyacrylate. This same dispersant quality is useful in detergent formulations, some of which are about 5% polyacrylate. Polyacrylate is not biodegradable and accumulates with sludge residues from water treatment processes.", "HH CC HC Polyacrylate polymer O\u2013O n 8.4 SEWAGE TREATMENT Typical municipal sewage contains oxygen-demanding materials, sediments, grease, oil, scum, pathogenic bacteria, viruses, salts, algal nutrients, pesticides, refractory organic compounds, heavy metals, and an astonishing variety of flotsam ranging from children\u2019s socks to sponges. It is the job of the waste treatment plant to remove as much of this material as possible. Several characteristics are used to describe sewage. These include turbidity (international turbidity units), suspended solids (ppm), total dissolved solids (ppm), acidity (H+ ion concentration or pH), and DO (in ppm O2). BOD is used as a measure of oxygen-demanding substances. Current processes for the treatment of wastewater may be divided into three main categories of primary treatment, secondary treatment, and tertiary treatment, each of which is discussed separately. Also discussed are total wastewater treatment systems, based largely upon physical and chemical processes. Waste from a municipal water system is normally treated in a publicly owned treatment works, POTW. In the United States, these systems are allowed to discharge only effluents that have attained a certain level of treatment, as mandated by Federal law. 8.4.1 PRIMARY WASTE TREATMENT Primary treatment of wastewater consists of the removal of insoluble matter such as grit, grease, and scum from water. The first step in primary treatment normally is screening. Screening removes or reduces the size of trash and large solids that get into the sewage system. These solids are collected on screens and scraped off for subsequent disposal. Most screens are cleaned with power rakes. Comminuting devices shred and grind solids in the sewage. Particle size may be reduced to the extent that the particles can be returned to the sewage fl ow. Grit in wastewater consists of such materials as sand and coffee grounds which do not biodegrade well and generally have a high settling velocity. Grit removal is practiced to prevent its accumulation in other parts of the treatment system, to reduce clogging of pipes and other parts, and to protect moving parts from abrasion and wear. Grit is normally allowed to settle in a tank under conditions of low flow velocity, and it is then scraped mechanically from the bottom of the tank. Primary sedimentation removes both settleable and floatable solids. During primary sedimentation there is a tendency for flocculant particles to aggregate for better settling, a process that may be aided by the addition of chemicals. The material that floats in the primary settling basin is known collectively as grease. In addition to fatty substances, the grease consists of oils, waxes, free fatty acids, and insoluble soaps containing calcium and magnesium. Normally, some of the grease settles with the sludge and some floats to the surface, where it may be removed by a skimming device. 8.4.2 SECONDARY WASTE TREATMENT BY BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES The most obvious harmful effect of biodegradable organic matter in wastewater is BOD, consisting of a biochemical oxygen demand for dissolved oxygen by microorganism-mediated degradation of the organic matter. Secondary wastewater treatment is designed to remove BOD, usually by taking advantage of the same kind of biological processes that would otherwise consume oxygen in water receiving the wastewater. Secondary treatment by biological processes takes many forms but consists basically of the action of microorganisms provided with added oxygen degrading organic material in solution or in suspension until the BOD of the waste has been reduced to acceptable levels.1 The waste is oxidized biologically under conditions controlled for optimum bacterial growth, and at a site where this growth does not influence the environment. One of the simplest biological waste treatment processes is the trickling filter (Figure 8.2) in which wastewater is sprayed over rocks or other solid support material covered with microorganisms. The structure of the trickling fi lter is such that contact of the wastewater with air is allowed and degradation of organic matter occurs by the action of the microorganisms. Rotating biological reactors (contactors), another type of treatment system, consist of groups of large plastic discs mounted close together on a rotating shaft. The device is positioned such that at any particular instant half of each disc is immersed in wastewater and half exposed to air. The shaft rotates constantly, so that the submerged portion of the discs is always changing. The discs, usually made of high-density polyethylene or polystyrene, accumulate thin layers of attached biomass, which degrades organic matter in the sewage.", "Oxygen is absorbed by the biomass and by the layer of wastewater adhering to it during the time that the biomass is exposed to air. Both trickling filters and rotating biological reactors are examples of fi xed-film biological (FFB) or attached growth processes. The greatest advantage of these processes is their low energy consumption. The energy consumption is minimal because it is not necessary to pump air or oxygen into the water, as is the case with the popular activated sludge process described below. The trickling filter has long been a standard means of wastewater treatment, and a number of wastewater treatment plants use trickling filters at present. The activated sludge process, Figure 8.3, is probably the most versatile and effective of all wastewater treatment processes. Microorganisms in the aeration tank convert organic material in wastewater Anaerobic digester to microbial biomass and CO2. Organic nitrogen is converted to ammonium ion or nitrate. Organic phosphorus is converted to orthophosphate. The microbial cell matter formed as part of the waste degradation processes is normally kept in the aeration tank until the microorganisms are past the log phase of growth (Section 6.7), at which point the cells flocculate relatively well to form settleable solids. These solids settle out in a settler and a fraction of them is discarded. Part of the solids, the return sludge, is recycled to the head of the aeration tank and comes into contact with fresh sewage. The combination of a high concentration of \u201chungry\u201d cells in the return sludge and a rich food source in the influent sewage provides optimum conditions for the rapid degradation of organic matter. The degradation of organic matter that occurs in an activated sludge facility also occurs in streams and other aquatic environments. However, in general, when a degradable waste is put into a stream, it encounters only a relatively small population of microorganisms capable of carrying out the degradation process. Thus, several days may be required for the buildup of a sufficient population of organisms to degrade the waste. In the activated sludge process, continual recycling of active organisms provides the optimum conditions for waste degradation, and a waste may be degraded within the very few hours that it is present in the aeration tank. The activated sludge process provides two pathways for the removal of BOD, as illustrated schematically in Figure 8.4. BOD may be removed by (1) oxidation of organic matter to provide energy for the metabolic processes of the microorganisms and (2) synthesis, incorporation of the organic matter into cell mass. In the first pathway, carbon is removed in the gaseous form as CO2. The second pathway provides for removal of carbon as a solid in biomass. That portion of the carbon converted to CO2 is vented to the atmosphere and does not present a disposal problem. The disposal of waste sludge, however, is a problem, primarily because it is only about 1% solids and contains many undesirable components. Normally, partial water removal is accomplished by drying on sand fi lters, vacuum filtration, or centrifugation. The dewatered sludge may be incinerated or used as landfi ll. To a certain extent, sewage sludge may be digested in the absence of oxygen by methane-producing anaerobic bacteria to produce methane and carbon dioxide, a process that reduces both the volatile-matter content and the volume of the sludge by about 60%. A carefully designed plant may produce enough methane to provide for all of its power needs: 2{CH2O} \u00c6 CH4 + CO2 (8.1) One of the most desirable means of sludge disposal is to use it to fertilize and condition soil. However, care has to be taken that excessive levels of heavy metals are not applied to the soil as sludge contaminants. Problems with various kinds of sludges resulting from water treatment are discussed further in Section 8.10. Activated sludge wastewater treatment is the most common example of an aerobic suspended culture process. Many factors must be considered in the design and operation of an activated sludge wastewater treatment system. These include parameters involved with the process modeling and kinetics. The microbiology of the system must be considered. In addition to BOD removal, phosphorus and nitrogen removal must also be taken into account. Oxygen transfer and solids separation are important. Industrial wastes and the fates and effects of industrial chemicals (xenobiotics) must also be considered. Nitrification (the microbially mediated conversion of ammonium nitrogen to nitrate; see Section 6.11) is a signifi cant process that occurs during biological waste treatment.", "Ammonium ion is normally the first inorganic nitrogen species produced in the biodegradation of nitrogenous organic compounds. It is oxidized, under the appropriate conditions, first to nitrite by Nitrosomonas bacteria, then to nitrate by Nitrobacter: - 2NH4 ++ 3O2 \u00c6 4H+ + 2NO2 + 2H2O (8.2) 2NO2 + O2 \u00c6 2NO3 (8.3) These reactions occur in the aeration tank of the activated sludge plant and are favored in general by long retention times, low organic loadings, large amounts of suspended solids, and high temperatures. Nitrification can reduce sludge settling efficiency because the denitrifi cation reaction - 4NO3 + 5{CH2O} + 4H+\u00c6 2N2(g) + 5CO2(g) + 7H2O (8.4) occurring in the oxygen-deficient settler causes bubbles of N2 to form on the sludge fl oc (aggregated sludge particles), making it so buoyant that it floats to the top. This prevents settling of the sludge and increases the organic load in the receiving waters. Under the appropriate conditions, however, advantage can be taken of this phenomenon to remove nutrient nitrogen from water (see Section 8.9). 8.4.3 MEMBRANE BIOREACTOR A problem with the activated sludge process is the difficulty encountered in settling the suspended biomass. Incomplete separation of the suspended solids in the sludge settling unit can result in solids contamination of the effluent and a dilute sludge that lacks sufficient biomass of active organisms required for effective waste biodegradation. These problems can be overcome with a membrane bioreactor in which a suspension of active biomass is maintained in an aeration tank and treated water is withdrawn through a membrane filter (see Section 8.6). In some configurations the membrane is immersed in the aeration chamber and the treated effluent drawn through the membrane fi lter under vacuum whereas in others the treated effluent is pumped through the filter under pressure. 8.4.4 TERTIARY WASTE TREATMENT Unpleasant as the thought may be, many people drink used water\u2014water that has been discharged from a municipal sewage treatment plant or from some industrial process. This raises serious questions about the presence of pathogenic organisms or toxic substances in such water. Because of high population density and heavy industrial development, the problem is especially acute in Europe where some municipalities process 50% or more of their water from \u201cused\u201d sources. Obviously, there is a great need to treat wastewater in a manner that makes it amenable to reuse. This requires treatment beyond the secondary processes. Tertiary waste treatment (sometimes called advanced waste treatment) is a term used to describe a variety of processes performed on the effluent from secondary waste treatment.1 The contaminants removed by tertiary waste treatment fall into the general categories of (1) suspended solids, (2) dissolved inorganic materials, and (3) dissolved organic compounds, including the important class of algal nutrients. Low levels of substances and their metabolites, such as pharmaceuticals, synthetic and natural hormones, and personal care products that are discharged in sewage, pose challenges in advanced wastewater treatment. Suspended solids are primarily responsible for residual biological oxygen demand in secondary sewage effl uent waters. The dissolved organics are the most hazardous from the standpoint of potential toxicity. The major problem with dissolved inorganic materials is that presented by algal nutrients, primarily nitrates, and phosphates. In addition, potentially hazardous toxic metals may be found among the dissolved inorganics. In addition to these chemical contaminants, secondary sewage effluent often contains a number of disease-causing microorganisms, requiring disinfection in cases where humans may later come into contact with the water. Among the bacteria that may be found in secondary sewage effl uent are organisms causing tuberculosis, dysenteric bacteria (Bacillus dysenteriae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella paradysenteriae, Proteus vulgaris), cholera bacteria (Vibriocholerae), bacteria causing mud fever (Leptospiraicterohemorrhagiae), and bacteria causing typhoid fever (Salmonella typhosa, Salmonella paratyphi). In addition, viruses causing diarrhea, eye infections, infectious hepatitis, and polio may be encountered. Ingestion of sewage still causes disease, even in more developed nations. 8.4.5 PHYSICAL\u2212CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER Complete physical\u2212chemical wastewater treatment systems offer both advantages and disadvantages relative to biological treatment systems. The capital costs of physical\u2212chemical facilities can be less than those of biological treatment facilities, and they usually require less land. They are better able to cope with toxic materials and overloads. However, they require careful operator control and consume relatively large amounts of energy.", "Basically, a physical\u2212chemical treatment process involves: \u2022 Removal of scum and solid objects \u2022 Clarification, generally with addition of a coagulant, and frequently with the addition of other chemicals (such as lime for phosphorus removal) \u2022 Filtration to remove fi lterable solids \u2022 Activated carbon adsorption \u2022 Disinfection Wastewater in The basic steps of a complete physical\u2212chemical wastewater treatment facility are shown in Figure 8.5. During the early 1970s, it appeared likely that physical\u2212chemical treatment would largely replace biological treatment. However, higher chemical and energy costs since then have slowed the development of physical\u2212chemical facilities. 8.5 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT Before treatment, industrial wastewater should be characterized fully and the biodegradability of wastewater constituents determined. The options available for the treatment of wastewater are summarized briefly in this section and discussed in greater detail in later sections. One of two major ways of removing organic wastes is biological treatment by an activated sludge or related process (see Section 8.4 and Figure 8.3). It may be necessary to acclimate microorganisms to the degradation of constituents that are not normally biodegradable. Consideration needs to be given to possible hazards of biotreatment sludges, such as those containing excessive levels of heavy metal ions. The other major process for the removal of organics from wastewater is sorption by activated carbon (see Section 8.8), usually in columns of granular activated carbon. Activated carbon and biological treatment can be combined with the use of powdered activated carbon in the activated sludge process. The powdered activated carbon sorbs some constituents that may be toxic to microorganisms and is collected with the sludge. A major consideration with the use of activated carbon to treat wastewater is the hazard that spent activated carbon may present from the wastes it retains. These hazards may include those of toxicity or reactivity, such as those hazards posed by wastes from the manufacture of explosives sorbed to activated carbon. Regeneration of the carbon is expensive and can be hazardous in some cases. Wastewater can be treated by a variety of chemical processes, including acid/base neutralization, precipitation, and oxidation/reduction. Sometimes these steps must precede biological treatment; for example, acidic or alkaline wastewater must be neutralized in order for microorganisms to thrive in it. Cyanide in the wastewater may be oxidized with chlorine and organics with ozone, hydrogen peroxide promoted with ultraviolet radiation, or DO at high temperatures and pressures. Heavy metals may be precipitated with base, carbonate, or sulfi de. Wastewater can be treated by several physical processes. In some cases, simple density separation and sedimentation can be used to remove water-immiscible liquids and solids. Filtration is frequently required, and flotation by gas bubbles generated on particle surfaces may be useful. Wastewater solutes can be concentrated by evaporation, distillation, and membrane processes, including reverse osmosis, hyperfiltration, and ultrafiltration. Organic constituents can be removed by solvent extraction, air stripping, or steam stripping. Synthetic resins are useful for removing some pollutant solutes from wastewater. Organophilic resins have proven useful for the removal of alcohols; aldehydes; ketones; hydrocarbons; chlorinated alkanes, alkenes, and aryl compounds; esters, including phthalate esters; and pesticides. Cation exchange resins are effective for the removal of heavy metals. 8.6 REMOVAL OF SOLIDS Relatively large solid particles are removed from water by simple settling and fi ltration. The removal of colloidal solids from water usually requires coagulation.2 Salts of aluminum and iron are the coagulants most often used in water treatment. Of these, alum or filter alum is the most commonly used. This substance is a hydrated aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3 \u25ca 18H2O. When this salt is added to water, the aluminum ion hydrolyzes by reactions that consume alkalinity in the water, such as - Al(H2O)63++ 3HCO3 \u00c6 Al(OH)3 (s) + 3CO2 + 6H2O (8.5) The gelatinous hydroxide thus formed carries suspended material with it as it settles. Furthermore, it is likely that positively charged hydroxyl-bridged dimers such as H O (H2O)4 Al Al(H2O)44+ O H and higher polymers are formed which interact specifically with colloidal particles, bringing about coagulation. Sodium silicate partially neutralized by acid aids coagulation, particularly when used with alum. Metal ions in coagulants also react with virus proteins and destroy viruses in water. Anhydrous iron(III) sulfate added to water forms iron(III) hydroxide in a reaction analogous to Reaction 8.5. An advantage of iron(III) sulfate is that it works over a wide pH range of approximately 4\u201311. Hydrated iron(II) sulfate, or copperas, FeSO4 \u25ca 7H2O, is also commonly used as a coagulant.", "It forms a gelatinous precipitate of hydrated iron(III) oxide; in order to function, it must be oxidized to iron(III) by DO in the water at a pH higher than 8.5, or by chlorine, which can oxidize iron(II) at lower pH values. Natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes are used in flocculating particles. Among the natural compounds so used are starch and cellulose derivatives, proteinaceous materials, and gums composed of polysaccharides. More recently, selected synthetic polymers, including neutral polymers and both anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes, that are effective flocculants have come into use. Coagulation\u2212fi ltration is a much more effective procedure than filtration alone for the removal of suspended material from water. As the term implies, the process consists of the addition of coagulants that aggregate the particles into larger size particles, followed by filtration. Either alum or lime, often with added polyelectrolytes, is most commonly employed for coagulation. The filtration step of coagulation\u2212filtration is usually performed on a medium such as sand or anthracite coal. Often, to reduce clogging, several media with progressively smaller interstitial spaces are used. One example is the rapid sand filter, which consists of a layer of sand supported by layers of gravel particles, the particles becoming progressively larger with increasing depth. The substance that actually filters the water is coagulated material that collects in the sand. As more material is removed, the buildup of coagulated material eventually clogs the filter and must be removed by back-fl ushing. An important class of solids that must be removed from wastewater consists of suspended solids in secondary sewage effluent that arise primarily from sludge that was not removed in the settling process. These solids account for a large part of the BOD in the effluent and may interfere with other aspects of tertiary waste treatment, such as by clogging membranes in reverse osmosis water treatment processes. The quantity of material involved may be rather high. Processes designed to remove suspended solids often will remove 10\u201320 mg/L of organic material from secondary sewage effl uent. In addition, a small amount of the inorganic material is removed.

In addition, a small amount of the inorganic material is removed. 8.6.1 DISSOLVED AIR FLOTATION Many of the particles found in water have low densities close to or even less than that of water. Particles less dense than water have a tendency to rise to the surface from which they can be skimmed off, but this is often a slow and incomplete process. The removal of such particles can be aided by dissolved air fl otation in which small air bubbles are formed that attach to particles causing them to float. As shown in Figure 8.6, flotation of particles with air can be accompanied by coagulation of the particles as aided by a coagulant. Water supersaturated with air under pressure is released to the bottom of a tank where bubbles are formed in a layer of milky (white) water. Bubble formation accompanied by flocculation of the particles entrains bubbles in the floc, which fl oats to the surface where it is skimmed off. 8.6.2 MEMBRANE FILTRATION PROCESSES Filtration through membranes under pressure is an especially effective means of removing solids and impurities from water.3 The purifi ed water that goes through a membrane is the permeate and the smaller amount of material that does not go through the membrane is a retentate. Membranes particles normally operate by size exclusion. As membranes with smaller openings are used, smaller particles and even molecules and ions are excluded, but higher pressures are required and more energy is consumed. In order of decreasing pore size, the common membrane processes are microfi ltration> ultrafi ltration> nanofi ltration > and hyperfi ltration. Microfiltration membranes have pores of 0.1\u20132 \u03bcm in size, and the other processes use membranes with progressively smaller pores. The main types of membrane processes and their uses are summarized in Table 8.1 and reverse osmosis is discussed in Section 8.9.", "A problem common to all membrane processes is that posed by the retentate, which is concentrated in the substances that are removed from water. In some cases, this material may be discharged with wastewater, and retentate from the reverse osmosis desalination of seawater may be returned to the sea. Other options, depending upon the source of water treated, include evaporation of water and incineration of the residue, reclamation of materials from some industrial wastewaters, and disposal in deep saline water aquifers. 8.7 REMOVAL OF CALCIUM AND OTHER METALS Calcium and magnesium salts, which generally are present in water as bicarbonates or sulfates, cause water hardness. One of the most common manifestations of water hardness is the insoluble \u201ccurd\u201d formed by the reaction of soap with calcium or magnesium ions. The formation of these insoluble soap salts is discussed in Section 7.10. Although ions that cause water hardness do not form insoluble products with detergents, they do adversely affect detergent performance. Therefore, calcium and magnesium must be complexed or removed from water in order for detergents to function properly. TABLE 8.1 Major Membrane Processes Used for Water Treatment Process Pressure (atm) Contaminants Removed Microfiltration <5 Suspended solids, emulsified components, bacteria, protozoa Ultrafiltration 2\u20138 Macromolecules above 5000\u2013100,000 molecular mass (a function of pore size) Nanofiltration 5\u201315 Molecules above 200\u2013500 molecular mass (a function of pore size) Hyperfiltration 15\u2013100 Most solutes and ions; brackish water requires reverse osmosis pressures up to 15 bar; seawater desalination requires pressures up to 100 bar Another problem caused by hard water is the formation of mineral deposits. For example, when water containing calcium and bicarbonate ions is heated, insoluble calcium carbonate is formed: - Ca2++ 2HCO3 \u00c6 CaCO3 (s) + CO2 (g) + H2O (8.6) This product coats the surfaces of hot water systems, clogging pipes, and reducing heating effi ciency. Dissolved salts such as calcium and magnesium bicarbonates and sulfates can be especially damaging in boiler feedwater. Clearly, the removal of water hardness is essential for many uses of water. Several processes are used for softening water. On a large scale, such as in community water-softening operations, the lime-soda process is used. This process involves the treatment of water with lime, Ca(OH)2, and soda ash, Na2CO3. Calcium is precipitated as CaCO3 and magnesium as Mg(OH)2. When the calcium is present primarily as \u201cbicarbonate hardness,\u201d it can be removed by the addition of Ca(OH)2 alone: - Ca2++ 2HCO3 + Ca(OH)2 \u00c6 2CaCO3 (s) + 2H2O (8.7) When bicarbonate ion is not present at substantial levels, a source of CO32- must be provided at a high enough pH to prevent conversion of most of the CO32- to HCO3 -. These conditions are obtained by the addition of Na2CO3. For example, calcium present as the chloride can be removed from water by the addition of soda ash: Ca2++ 2Cl-+ 2Na++ CO32-\u00c6 CaCO3 (s) + 2Cl-+ 2Na+ (8.8) Note that the removal of bicarbonate hardness results in a net removal of soluble salts from solution, whereas removal of nonbicarbonate hardness involves the addition of at least as many equivalents of ionic material as are removed. The precipitation of magnesium as the hydroxide requires a higher pH than the precipitation of calcium as the carbonate: Mg2++ 2OH-\u00c6 Mg(OH)2 (s) (8.9) The high pH required may be provided by the basic carbonate ion from soda ash: CO32-+ H2O \u00c6 HCO3 -+ OH- (8.10) Some large-scale lime-soda softening plants make use of the precipitated calcium carbonate product as a source of additional lime. The calcium carbonate is first heated to at least 825\u00b0C to produce quicklime, CaO: CaCO3 + heat \u00c6 CaO + CO2 (g) (8.11) The quicklime is then slaked with water to produce calcium hydroxide: CaO + H2O \u00c6 Ca(OH)2 (8.12) The water softened by lime-soda softening plants usually suffers from two defects. First, because of supersaturation effects, some CaCO3 and Mg(OH)2 usually remain in solution. If not removed, these compounds will precipitate at a later time and cause harmful deposits or undesirable cloudiness in water. The second problem results from the use of highly basic sodium carbonate, which gives the product water an excessively high pH, up to pH 11. To overcome these problems, the water is recarbonated by bubbling CO2 into it. The carbon dioxide converts the slightly soluble calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide to their soluble bicarbonate forms: - CaCO3(s) +CO2 + H2O \u00c6 Ca2++ 2HCO3 (8.13) - Mg(OH)2 (s) +2CO2 \u00c6 Mg2++ 2HCO3 (8.14) The CO2 also neutralizes excess hydroxide ion: - OH-+ CO2 \u00c6 HCO3 (8.15)", "The pH generally is brought within the range 7.5\u20138.5 by recarbonation. The source of CO2 used in the recarbonation process may be from the combustion of carbonaceous fuel. Scrubbed stack gas from a power plant frequently is utilized. Water adjusted to a pH, alkalinity, and Ca2+ concentration very close to CaCO3 saturation is labeled chemically stabilized. It neither precipitates CaCO3 in water mains, which can clog the pipes, nor dissolves protective CaCO3 coatings from the pipe surfaces. Water with Ca2+ concentration much below CaCO3 saturation is called aggressive water. Calcium may be removed from water very efficiently by the addition of orthophosphate: 5Ca2++ 3PO43-+ OH-\u00c6 Ca5OH(PO4)3 (s) (8.16) It should be pointed out that the chemical formation of a slightly soluble product for the removal of undesired solutes such as hardness ions, phosphate, iron, and manganese must be followed by sedimentation in a suitable apparatus. Frequently, coagulants must be added, and filtration employed for complete removal of these sediments. Water may be purified by ion exchange, the reversible transfer of ions between aquatic solution and a solid material capable of bonding ions. The removal of NaCl from solution by two ion exchange reactions is a good illustration of this process. First the water is passed over a solid cation exchanger in the hydrogen form, represented by H+-{Cat (s)}: H+-{Cat (s)} + Na++ Cl-\u00c6 Na+-{Cat (s)} + H++ Cl- (8.17) Next, the water is passed over an anion exchanger in the hydroxide ion form, represented by OH-+{An (s)}: OH-+{An (s)} + H++ Cl-\u00c6 Cl-+{An (s)} + H2O (8.18) Thus, the cations in solution are replaced by hydrogen ion and the anions by hydroxide ion, yielding water as the product. The softening of water by ion exchange does not require the removal of all ionic solutes, just those cations responsible for water hardness. Generally, therefore, only a cation exchanger is necessary. Furthermore, the sodium rather than the hydrogen form of the cation exchanger is used, and the divalent cations are replaced by sodium ion. Sodium ion at low concentrations is harmless in water to be used for most purposes, and sodium chloride is a cheap and convenient substance with which to recharge the cation exchangers. A number of materials have ion-exchanging properties. Among the minerals especially noted for their ion exchange properties are the aluminum silicate minerals, or zeolites. An example of a zeolite which has been used commercially in water softening is glauconite, K2(MgFe)2Al6(Si4O10)3(OH)12. Synthetic zeolites have been prepared by drying and crushing the white gel produced by mixing solutions of sodium silicate and sodium aluminate. \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013 SO3 Na+ SO3 Na+ SO3\u00bd Ca2+ SO3\u00bd Ca2+ + 3Na+ FIGURE 8.7 Strongly acidic cation exchanger. Sodium exchange for calcium in water is shown. The discovery in the mid-1930s of synthetic ion exchange resins composed of organic polymers with attached functional groups marked the beginning of modern ion exchange technology. Structural formulas of typical synthetic ion exchangers are shown in Figures 8.7 and 8.8. The cation exchanger shown in Figure 8.7 is called a strongly acidic cation exchanger because the parent - \u2013SO3 -H+ group is a strong acid. When the functional group binding the cation is the \u2013CO2 group, the exchange resin is called a weakly acidic cation exchanger, because the \u2013CO2H group is a weak acid. Figure 8.8 shows a strongly basic anion exchanger in which the functional group is a quaternary ammonium group, \u2013N+(CH3)3. In the hydroxide form, \u2013N+(CH3)3OH-, the hydroxide ion is readily released, so the exchanger is classifi ed as strongly basic. The water-softening capability of a cation exchanger is shown in Figure 8.7, where sodium ion on the exchanger is exchanged for calcium ion in solution. The same reaction occurs with magnesium ion. Water softening by cation exchange is a widely used, effective, and economical process. In many areas having a low water flow, however, widespread home water softening by ion exchange causes deterioration of water quality arising from the contamination of wastewater by sodium chloride. Such contamination results from the periodic need to regenerate a water softener with sodium chloride in order to displace calcium and magnesium ions from the resin and replace these hardness ions with sodium ions: Ca2+-{Cat (s)}2 + 2Na++ 2Cl-\u00c6 2Na+-{Cat (s)} + Ca2++ 2Cl- (8.19) During the regeneration process, a large excess of sodium chloride must be used\u2014several pounds for a home water softener. Appreciable amounts of dissolved sodium chloride can be introduced into sewage by this route. Strongly acidic cation exchangers are used for the removal of water hardness.", "Weakly acidic cation exchangers having the \u2013CO2H group as a functional group are useful for removing alkalinity. Alkalinity generally is manifested by bicarbonate ion, a species that is a sufficiently strong base to neutralize the acid of a weak acid cation exchanger: - 2R-CO2H + Ca2++ 2HCO3 \u00c6 [R-CO2 -]2Ca2++ 2H2O + 2CO2. (8.20) N+ (CH3)3OH\u2013 N+ (CH3)3Cl\u2013 + Cl\u2013 + OH\u2013 CH2 CH CH2 CH2 CH CH2 FIGURE 8.8 Strongly basic anion exchanger. Chloride exchange for hydroxide ion is shown. However, weak bases such as sulfate ion or chloride ion are not strong enough to remove hydrogen ion from the carboxylic acid exchanger. An additional advantage of these exchangers is that they may be regenerated almost stoichiometrically with dilute strong acids, thus avoiding the potential pollution problem caused by the use of excess sodium chloride to regenerate strongly acidic cation changers. Chelation or, as it is sometimes known, sequestration, is an effective method of softening water without actually having to remove calcium and magnesium from solution. A complexing agent is added which greatly reduces the concentrations of free hydrated cations, as shown by some of the example calculations in Chapter 3. For example, chelating calcium ion with excess EDTA anion (Y4-), Ca2++ Y4-\u00c6 CaY2- (8.21) reduces the concentration of hydrated calcium ion, preventing the precipitation of calcium carbonate: Ca2++ CO32-\u00c6 CaCO3 (s) (8.22) Polyphosphate salts, EDTA, and NTA (see Chapter 3) are chelating agents commonly used for water softening. Polysilicates are used to complex iron. 8.7.1 REMOVAL OF IRON AND MANGANESE Soluble iron and manganese are found in many groundwaters because of reducing conditions which favor the soluble +2 oxidation state of these metals (see Chapter 4). Iron is the more commonly encountered of the two metals. In groundwater, the level of iron seldom exceeds 10 mg/L, and that of manganese is rarely higher than 2 mg/L. The basic method for removing both of these metals depends upon oxidation to higher insoluble oxidation states. The oxidation is generally accomplished by aeration. The rate of oxidation is pH-dependent in both cases, with a high pH favoring more rapid oxidation. The oxidation of soluble Mn(II) to insoluble MnO2 is a complicated process. It appears to be catalyzed by solid MnO2, which is known to adsorb Mn(II). This adsorbed Mn(II) is slowly oxidized on the MnO2 surface. Chlorine and potassium permanganate are sometimes employed as oxidizing agents for iron and manganese. There is some evidence that organic chelating agents with reducing properties hold iron(II) in a soluble form in water. In such cases, chlorine is effective because it destroys the organic compounds and enables the oxidation of iron(II). In water with a high level of carbonate, FeCO3 and MnCO3 may be precipitated directly by raising the pH above 8.5 by the addition of sodium carbonate or lime. This approach is less popular than oxidation, however. Relatively high levels of insoluble iron(III) and manganese(IV) frequently are found in water as colloidal material which is difficult to remove. These metals may be associated with humic colloids or \u201cpeptizing\u201d organic material that binds to colloidal metal oxides, stabilizing the colloid. Heavy metals such as copper, cadmium, mercury, and lead are found in wastewaters from a number of industrial processes. Because of the toxicity of many heavy metals, their concentrations must be reduced to very low levels prior to release of the wastewater. A number of approaches are used in heavy metals removal. Lime treatment, discussed earlier in this section for calcium removal, precipitates heavy metals as insoluble hydroxides, basic salts, or coprecipitated with calcium carbonate or iron(III) hydroxide. This process does not completely remove mercury, cadmium, or lead, so their removal is aided by addition of sulfide (most heavy metals are sulfi de-seekers): Cd2++ S2-\u00c6 CdS (s) (8.23) Heavy chlorination is frequently necessary to break down metal-solubilizing ligands (see Chapter 3). Lime precipitation does not normally permit recovery of metals and is sometimes undesirable from the economic viewpoint. Electrodeposition (reduction of metal ions to metal by electrons at an electrode), reverse osmosis (see Section 8.9), and ion exchange are frequently employed for metal removal. Solvent extraction using organic-soluble chelating substances is also effective in removing many metals. Cementation, a process by which a metal deposits by reaction of its ion with a more readily oxidized metal, may be employed: Cu2++ Fe (iron scrap) \u00c6 Fe2++ Cu (8.24) Activated carbon adsorption effectively removes some metals from water at the part per million level. Sometimes a chelating agent is sorbed to the charcoal to increase metal removal.", "Even when not specifically designed for the removal of heavy metals, most waste treatment processes remove appreciable quantities of the more troublesome heavy metals encountered in wastewater. Biological waste treatment effectively removes metals from water. These metals accumulate in the sludge from biological treatment, so sludge disposal must be given careful consideration. Various physical\u2212chemical treatment processes effectively remove heavy metals from waste-waters. One such treatment is lime precipitation followed by activated-carbon fi ltration. Activated-carbon filtration may also be preceded by treatment with iron(III) chloride to form an iron(III) hydroxide fl oc, which is an effective heavy metals scavenger. Similarly, alum, which forms aluminum hydroxide, may be added prior to activated-carbon fi ltration. The form of the heavy metal has a strong effect upon the efficiency of metal removal. For instance, chromium(VI) is normally more difficult to remove than chromium(III). Chelation may prevent metal removal by solubilizing metals (see Chapter 3). In the past, removal of heavy metals has been largely a fringe benefit of wastewater treatment processes. Currently, however, more consideration is being given to design and operating parameters that specifically enhance heavy-metals removal as part of wastewater treatment. 8.8 REMOVAL OF DISSOLVED ORGANICS Very low levels of exotic organic compounds in drinking water are suspected of contributing to cancer and other maladies. Water disinfection processes, which by their nature involve chemically rather severe conditions, particularly of oxidation, have a tendency to produce disinfection by-products. Some of these are chlorinated organic compounds produced by chlorination of organics in water, especially humic substances. Removal of organics to very low levels prior to chlorination has been found to be effective in preventing THM formation. Another major class of disinfection by-products consists of organooxygen compounds such as aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and oxoacids. A variety of organic compounds survive, or are produced by, secondary wastewater treatment and should be considered as factors in discharge or reuse of the treated water. Almost half of these are humic substances (see Section 3.17) with a molecular-mass range of 1000\u20135000. Among the remainder are found ether-extractable materials, carbohydrates, proteins, detergents, tannins, and lignins. Because of their high molecular mass and anionic character, the humic compounds infl uence some of the physical and chemical aspects of waste treatment. The ether extractables contain many of the compounds that are resistant to biodegradation and are of particular concern regarding potential toxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity. In the ether extract are found many fatty acids, hydrocarbons of the n-alkane class, naphthalene, diphenylmethane, diphenyl, methylnaphthalene, isopropylbenzene, dodecylbenzene, phenol, phthalates, and triethylphosphate. The standard method for the removal of dissolved organic material is adsorption on activated carbon, a product that is produced from a variety of carbonaceous materials including wood, pulp-mill char, peat, and lignite. The carbon is produced by charring the raw material anaerobically below 600\u00b0C, followed by an activation step consisting of partial oxidation. Carbon dioxide may be employed as an oxidizing agent at 600\u2013700\u00b0C. CO2 + C \u00c6 2CO (8.25) or the carbon may be oxidized by steam at 800\u2013900\u00b0C: H2O + C \u00c6 H2 + CO (8.26) These processes develop porosity, increase the surface area, and leave the C atoms in arrangements that have affinities for organic compounds. Activated carbon comes in two general types: granulated activated carbon, consisting of particles 0.1\u20131 mm in diameter, and powdered activated carbon, in which most of the particles are 50\u2013100 \u03bcm in diameter. The exact mechanism by which activated carbon holds organic materials is not known. However, one reason for the effectiveness of this material as an adsorbent is its tremendous surface area. A solid cubic foot of carbon particles may have a combined pore and surface area of approximately 10 square miles! Although interest is increasing in the use of powdered activated carbon for water treatment, currently granular carbon is more widely used. It may be employed in a fixed bed, through which water flows downward. Accumulation of particulate matter requires periodic backwashing. An expanded bed in which particles are kept slightly separated by water flowing upward may be used with less chance of clogging. Economics require regeneration of the carbon, which is accomplished by heating it to 950\u00b0C in a steam\u2212air atmosphere. This process oxidizes adsorbed organics and regenerates the carbon surface, with an approximately 10% loss of carbon. Removal of organics may also be accomplished by adsorbent synthetic polymers. Such polymers as Amberlite XAD-4 have hydrophobic surfaces and strongly attract relatively insoluble organic compounds, such as chlorinated pesticides.", "The porosity of these polymers is up to 50% by volume, and the surface area may be as high as 850 m2/g. They are readily regenerated by solvents such as isopropanol and acetone. Under appropriate operating conditions, these polymers remove virtually all nonionic organic solutes; for example, phenol at 250 mg/L is reduced to less than 0.1 mg/L by appropriate treatment with Amberlite XAD-4. Oxidation of dissolved organics holds some promise for their removal. Ozone, hydrogen peroxide, molecular oxygen (with or without catalysts), chlorine and its derivatives, permanganate, or ferrate [iron(VI)] can be used. Electrochemical oxidation may be possible in some cases. High-energy electron beams produced by high-voltage electron accelerators also have the potential to destroy organic compounds. 8.8.1 REMOVAL OF HERBICIDES Because of their widespread application and persistence, herbicides have proven to be particularly troublesome in drinking water sources. Their levels vary with season related to times that they are applied to control weeds. The more soluble ones are most likely to enter drinking water sources. One of the most troublesome is atrazine, which is often manifested by its metabolite desethylatrazine. Activated carbon treatment is the best means of removing herbicides and their metabolites from drinking water sources. A problem with activated carbon is that of preloading, in which natural organic matter in the water loads up the carbon and hinders uptake of pollutant organics such as herbicides. Pretreatment to remove such organic matter, such as flocculation and precipitation of humic substances, can significantly increase the efficacy of activated carbon for the removal of herbicides and other organics. 8.9 REMOVAL OF DISSOLVED INORGANICS In order for complete water recycling to be feasible, inorganic-solute removal is essential. The effl uent from secondary waste treatment generally contains 300\u2013400 mg/L more dissolved inorganic material than does the municipal water supply. It is obvious, therefore, that 100% water recycling without removal of inorganics would cause the accumulation of an intolerable level of dissolved material. Even when water is not destined for immediate reuse, the removal of the inorganic nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen is highly desirable to reduce eutrophication downstream. In some cases the removal of toxic trace metals is needed. One of the most obvious methods for removing inorganics from water is distillation. However, the energy required for distillation is generally quite high, so that distillation is not generally economically feasible. Furthermore, volatile materials such as ammonia and odorous compounds are carried over to a large extent in the distillation process unless special preventative measures are taken. Freezing produces a very pure water, but is considered uneconomical with present technology. Ion exchange and membrane processes are the most cost-effective means of removing inorganic materials from water. These processes are discussed below. 8.9.1 ION EXCHANGE The ion exchange method for softening water is described in detail in Section 8.7. The ion exchange process used for removal of inorganics consists of passing the water successively over a solid cation exchanger and a solid anion exchanger, which replace cations and anions by hydrogen ion and hydroxide ion, respectively, so that each equivalent of salt is replaced by a mole of water. For the - hypothetical ionic salt MX, the reactions are the following where {Cat (s)} represents the solid cation exchanger and +{An (s)} represents the solid anion exchanger: H+-{Cat (s)} + M++ X-\u00c6 M+-{Cat (s)} + H++ X- (8.27) OH-+{An (s)} + H++ X-\u00c6 X-+{An (s)} + H2O (8.28) The cation exchanger is regenerated with strong acid and the anion exchanger with strong base. Demineralization by ion exchange generally produces water of a very high quality. Unfortunately, some organic compounds in wastewater foul ion exchangers, and microbial growth on the exchangers can diminish their efficiency. In addition, regeneration of the resins is expensive, and the concentrated wastes from regeneration require disposal in a manner that will not damage the environment. 8.9.2 ELECTRODIALYSIS Electrodialysis consists of applying a direct current across a body of water separated into layers by membranes alternately permeable to cations and anions. Cations migrate toward the cathode and anions toward the anode. Cations and anions both enter one layer of water, and both leave the adjacent layer. Thus, layers of water enriched in salts alternate with those from which salts have been removed. The water in the brine-enriched layers is recirculated to a certain extent to prevent excessive accumulation of brine. The principles involved in electrodialysis treatment are shown in Figure 8.9. Fouling caused by various materials can cause problems with reverse osmosis treatment of water.", "Although the relatively small ions constituting the salts dissolved in wastewater readily pass through the membranes, large organic ions (proteins, for example) and charged colloids migrate to the membrane surfaces, often fouling or plugging the membranes and reducing efficiency. In addition, growth of microorganisms on the membranes can cause fouling. Water solution concentrated in salts Experience with pilot plants indicates that electrodialysis has the potential to be a practical and economical method to remove up to 50% of the dissolved inorganics from secondary sewage effl uent after pretreatment to eliminate fouling substances. Such a level of effi ciency would permit repeated recycling of water without dissolved inorganic materials reaching unacceptably high levels. 8.9.3 REVERSE OSMOSIS Reverse osmosis is one of several pressure-driven membrane processes for water purifi cation which also include nonfi ltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration (Section 8.6). Reverse osmosis is a very useful and well-developed technique for the purification and desalination of water. As illustrated in Figure 8.10, it consists of forcing pure water through a semipermeable membrane that allows the passage of water but not of other material. This process, which is not simply sieve separation or ultra-filtration, depends on the preferential sorption of water on the surface of a porous cellulose acetate or polyamide membrane. Pure water from the sorbed layer is forced through pores in the membrane under pressure. If the thickness of the sorbed water layer is d, the pore diameter for optimum separation M+ H2O X\u2013 M+ H2O X\u2013M+ H2O X\u2013 M+ H2OX\u2013 Water contamH2O M+ X\u2013 H2O M+ X\u2013 H2O M+ X\u2013 H2O M+ X inated with ions Adsorbed water H2O H2OH2O H2O H2OH2O H2O layer, thickness d H2O H2O Purified Purified water water FIGURE 8.10 Solute removal from water by reverse osmosis. should be 2d. The optimum pore diameter depends upon the thickness of the sorbed pure water layer and may be several times the diameters of the solute and solvent molecules. In an example of recycling that is in keeping with the practice of green chemistry, spent reverse osmosis membranes have been treated with potassium permanganate, which removes substances that clog the membranes, but also removes the salt-rejecting surface layer, drastically reducing their salt rejection properties. The treated membranes are then used for filtration to remove as much as 94% of suspended solids from water. Nanofiltration is a pressurized membrane filtration process that does not remove singly charged salt ions that are removed by osmosis, but may be effective in removing hardness (Ca2+). Nanofi ltration operates at lower pressures than reverse osmosis, thus requiring less energy and less expense. Recently it has gained popularity as a drinking water treatment process. 8.9.4 PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL Advanced waste treatment normally requires removal of phosphorus to reduce algal growth. Algae may grow at PO43- levels as low as 0.05 mg/L. Growth inhibition requires levels well below 0.5 mg/L. Since municipal wastes typically contain approximately 25 mg/L of phosphate (as orthophosphates, polyphosphates, and insoluble phosphates), the efficiency of phosphate removal must be quite high to prevent algal growth. This removal may occur in the sewage treatment process (1) in the primary settler, (2) in the aeration chamber of the activated sludge unit, or (3) after secondary waste treatment. Activated sludge treatment removes about 20% of the phosphorus from sewage. Thus, an appreciable fraction of largely biological phosphorus is removed with the sludge. Detergents and other sources contribute significant amounts of phosphorus to domestic sewage and considerable phosphate ion remains in the effluent. However, some wastes, such as carbohydrate wastes from sugar refineries, are so deficient in phosphorus that supplementation of the waste with inorganic phosphorus is required for proper growth of the microorganisms degrading the wastes. Under some sewage plant operating conditions, much greater than normal phosphorus removal has been observed. In such plants, characterized by high DO and high pH levels in the aeration tank, removal of 60\u201390% of the phosphorus has been attained, yielding two or three times the normal level of phosphorus in the sludge. In a conventionally operated aeration tank of an activated sludge plant, the CO2 level is relatively high because of the release of the gas by the degradation of organic material. A high CO2 level results in a relatively low pH, because of the weakly acidic nature of dissolved CO2 in water. The aeration rate is generally not maintained at a very high level because oxygen is transferred relatively more efficiently from air when the DO levels in water are relatively low.", "Therefore, the aeration rate normally is not high enough to sweep out sufficient dissolved carbon dioxide to bring its concentration down to low levels. Thus, the pH generally is low enough that phosphate is maintained primarily in the form of the H2PO4 - ion. However, at a higher rate of aeration in a relatively hard water, the CO2 is swept out, the pH rises, and reactions such as the following occur: 5Ca2++ 3HPO42-+ H2O \u00c6 Ca5OH(PO4)3 (s) + 4H+ (8.29) The precipitated hydroxyapatite or other form of calcium phosphate is incorporated in the sludge floc. Reaction 8.29 is strongly hydrogen ion-dependent, and an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration drives the equilibrium back to the left. Thus, under anaerobic conditions when the sludge medium becomes more acidic due to higher CO2 levels, the phosphate returns to solution. Chemically, phosphate is most commonly removed by precipitation. Some common precipitants and their products are shown in Table 8.2. Precipitation processes are capable of at least 90\u201395% phosphorus removal at reasonable cost. Lime has the advantages of low cost and ease of regeneration. The efficiency with which phosphorus is removed by lime is not as high as would be predicted by the low solubility of hydroxyapatite, Ca5OH(PO4)3. Some of the possible reasons for this are slow precipitation of Ca5OH(PO4)3, formation of nonsettling colloids; precipitation of calcium as CaCO3 in certain pH ranges, and the fact that phosphate may be present as condensed phosphates (polyphosphates) which form soluble complexes with calcium ion. TABLE 8.2 Chemical Precipitants for Phosphate and Their Products Precipitant(s) Product Ca(OH)2 Ca5OH(PO4)3 (hydroxyapatite) Ca(OH)2 + NaF Ca5F(PO4)3 (fl uorapatite) Al2(SO4)3 AlPO4 FeCl3 FePO4 MgSO4 MgNH4PO4 Lime, Ca(OH)2, is the chemical most commonly used for phosphorus removal: 5Ca(OH)2 + 3HPO42-\u00c6 Ca5OH(PO4)3(s) + 3H2O + 6OH- (8.30) Phosphate can be removed from solution by adsorption on some solids, particularly activated alumina, Al2O3. Removals of up to 99.9% of orthophosphate have been achieved with this method. 8.9.5 NITROGEN REMOVAL Next to phosphorus, nitrogen is the algal nutrient most commonly removed as part of advanced wastewater treatment. Numerous chemical, biological, ion exchange, and membrane techniques can be used to remove nitrogen from water. Mineralization of organic nitrogen in wastewater treatment first produces ammonium ion, NH4+. The most common chemical process for nitrogen removal from wastewater is reaction of nitrogen in the form of ammonium ion with hypochlorite (from chlorine) to produce elemental nitrogen that is evolved as a gas: NH4 ++ HOCl \u00c6 NH2Cl + H2O + H+ (8.31) 2NH2Cl + HOCl \u00c6 N2(g) + 3H++ 3Cl-H2O (8.32) Nitrification followed by denitrification is the most common biological means of removing inorganic nitrogen from wastewater and arguably the most effective technique. The first step is an essentially complete conversion of ammonia and organic nitrogen to nitrate under strongly aerobic conditions, achieved by more extensive than normal aeration of the sewage: - NH4 ++ 2O2 (nitrifying bacteria) \u00c6 NO3 + 2H++ H2O (8.33) The second step is the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas. This reaction is also bacterially catalyzed and requires a carbon source and a reducing agent such as methanol, CH3OH. - 6NO3 + 5CH3OH + 6H+ (denitrifying bacteria) \u00c6 3N2(g) + 5CO2 + 13H2O (8.34) The denitrification process may be carried out either in a tank or on a carbon column. In pilot plant operation, conversions of 95% of the ammonia to nitrate and 86% of the nitrate to nitrogen have been achieved. 8.10 SLUDGE Perhaps the most pressing water treatment problem at this time has to do with sludge collected or produced during water treatment. Finding a safe place to put the sludge or a use for it has proven troublesome, and the problem is aggravated by the large number of water treatment systems. Some sludge is present in wastewater prior to treatment and may be collected from it. Such sludge includes human wastes, garbage grindings, organic wastes, and inorganic silt and grit from storm water runoff, and organic and inorganic wastes from commercial and industrial sources. There are two major kinds of sludge generated in a waste treatment plant. The first of these is organic sludge from activated sludge, trickling fi lter, or rotating biological reactors. The second is inorganic sludge from the addition of chemicals, such as in phosphorus removal (see Section 8.9). Most commonly, sewage sludge is subjected to anaerobic digestion in a digester designed to allow bacterial action to occur in the absence of air.", "This reduces the mass and volume of sludge and ideally results in the formation of a stabilized humus material. Disease agents are also destroyed in the process. Following digestion, sludge is generally conditioned and thickened to concentrate and stabilize it and make it more amenable to removal of water. Relatively inexpensive processes, such as gravity thickening, may be employed to get the moisture content down to about 95%. Sludge may be further conditioned chemically by the addition of iron or aluminum salts, lime, or polymers. Sludge dewatering is employed to convert the sludge from an essentially liquid material to a damp solid containing not more than about 85% water. This may be accomplished on sludge drying beds consisting of layers of sand and gravel. Mechanical devices may also be employed, including vacuum filtration, centrifugation, and filter presses. Heat may be used to aid the drying process. Ultimately, disposal of the sludge is required. Until banned by the U.S. Congress in the late 1980s, ocean disposal of sewage sludge was commonly practiced. Currently, the two main alternatives for sludge disposal are land spreading and incineration. Rich in nutrients, waste sewage sludge contains around 5% N, 3% P, and 0.5% K on a dry-mass basis and can be used to fertilize and condition soil. The humic material in the sludge improves the physical properties and CEC of the soil. Possible accumulation of heavy metals is of some concern insofar as the use of sludge on cropland is concerned. Sewage sludge is an efficient heavy metals scavenger and may contain elevated levels of zinc, copper, nickel, and cadmium. These and other metals tend to remain immobilized in soil by chelation with organic matter, adsorption on clay minerals, and precipitation as insoluble compounds such as oxides or carbonates. However, increased application of sludge on cropland has caused distinctly elevated levels of zinc and cadmium in both leaves and grain of corn. Therefore, caution has been advised in heavy or prolonged application of sewage sludge to soil. Prior control of heavy metal contamination from industrial sources has greatly reduced the heavy metal content of sludge and enabled it to be used more extensively on soil. A significant problem in sewage treatment can arise from sludge sidestreams. These consist of water removed from sludge by various treatment processes. Sewage treatment processes can be divided into mainstream treatment processes (primary clarification, trickling filter, activated sludge, and rotating biological reactor) and sidestream processes. During sidestream treatment, sludge is dewatered, degraded, and disinfected by a variety of processes, including gravity thickening, dissolved air flotation, anaerobic (anoxic) digestion, oxic digestion, vacuum fi ltration, centrifugation, belt-fi lter press filtration, sand-drying-bed treatment, sludge-lagoon settling, wet air oxidation, and pressure fi ltration. Each of these produces a liquid by-product sidestream which is circulated back to the mainstream. These add to the BOD and suspended solids of the mainstream. A variety of chemical sludges are produced by various water treatment and industrial processes. Among the most abundant of such sludges is alum sludge produced by the hydrolysis of Al(III) salts used in the treatment of water, which creates gelatinous aluminum hydroxide: Al3++ 3OH-(aq) \u00c6 Al(OH)3 (s) (8.35) Alum sludges containing aluminum hydroxide normally are 98% or more water and are very diffi cult to dewater. Both iron(II) and iron(III) compounds are used for the removal of impurities from wastewater by precipitation of Fe(OH)3. The sludge contains Fe(OH)3 in the form of soft, fluffy precipitates that are difficult to dewater beyond 10% or 12% solids. The addition of either lime, Ca(OH)2, or quicklime, CaO, to water is used to raise the pH to about 11.5 and cause the precipitation of CaCO3, along with metal hydroxides and phosphates. Calcium carbonate is readily recovered from lime sludges and can be recalcined to produce CaO, which can be recycled through the system. Metal hydroxide sludges are produced in the removal of metals such as lead, chromium, nickel, and zinc from wastewater by raising the pH to such a level that the corresponding hydroxides or hydrated metal oxides are precipitated. The disposal of these sludges is a substantial problem because of their toxic heavy metal content. Reclamation of the metals is an attractive alternative for these sludges. Pathogenic (disease-causing) microorganisms may persist in the sludge left from the treatment of sewage. These include bacteria such as Enterobacter and Shigella, viruses including hepatitis and enteroviruses, protozoa such as Entamoeba and Giardia, and helminth worms such as Ascaris and Toxocara.", "Many of these organisms present potential health hazards, and there is risk of public exposure when the sludge is applied to soil. Therefore, it is necessary both to be aware of pathogenic microorganisms in municipal wastewater treatment sludge and to find a means of reducing the hazards caused by their presence. The most significant organisms in municipal sewage sludge include (1) indicators of fecal pollution, including fecal and total coliform, (2) pathogenic bacteria, including Salmonellae and Shigellae, (3) enteric (intestinal) viruses, including enterovirus and poliovirus, and (4) parasites, such as Entamoeba histolytica and Ascaris lumbricoides. Several ways are recommended to significantly reduce levels of pathogens in sewage sludge. Aerobic digestion involves aerobic agitation of the sludge for periods of 40\u221260 days (longer times are employed with low sludge temperatures). Air drying involves draining and/or drying of the liquid sludge for at least 3 months in a layer 20\u201325 cm thick. This operation may be performed on underdrained sand beds or in basins. Anaerobic digestion involves maintenance of the sludge in an anaerobic state for periods of time ranging from 60 days at 20\u00b0C to 15 days at temperatures exceeding 35\u00b0C. Composting involves mixing dewatered sludge cake with bulking agents subject to decay, such as wood chips or shredded municipal refuse, and allowing the action of bacteria to promote decay at temperatures ranging up to 45\u201365\u00b0C. The higher temperatures tend to kill pathogenic bacteria. Finally, pathogenic organisms may be destroyed by lime stabilization in which suffi cient lime is added to raise the pH of the sludge to 12 or higher. 8.11 WATER DISINFECTION Chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant employed for killing bacteria in water. When chlorine is added to water, it rapidly hydrolyzes according to the reaction Cl2 + H2O \u00c6 H++ Cl-+ HOCl (8.36) which has the following equilibrium constant: [H+ ][Cl-][HOCl] -4 K == 4.5 \u00a5 10 . (8.37) [Cl2 ] Hypochlorous acid, HOCl, is a weak acid that dissociates according to the reaction, HOCl H++ OCl-(8.38) with an ionization constant of 2.7 \u00d7 10-8. From the above it can be calculated that the concentration of elemental Cl2 is negligible at equilibrium above pH 3 when chlorine is added to water at levels below 1.0 g/L. Sometimes, hypochlorite salts are substituted for chlorine gas as a disinfectant. Calcium hypochlorite, Ca(OCl)2, is commonly used. The hypochlorites are safer to handle than gaseous chlorine. The two chemical species formed by chlorine in water, HOCl and OCl-, are known as free available chlorine. Free available chlorine is very effective in killing bacteria. In the presence of ammonia, monochloramine, dichloramine, and trichloramine are formed: NH4 ++ HOCl \u00c6 NH2Cl (monochloramine) + H2O + H+ (8.39) NH2Cl + HOCl \u00c6 NHCl2 (dichloramine) + H2O (8.40) NHCl2 + HOCl \u00c6 NCl3 (trichloramine) + H2O (8.41) The chloramines are called combined available chlorine. Chlorination practice frequently provides for formation of combined available chlorine which, although a weaker disinfectant than free available chlorine, is more readily retained as a disinfectant throughout the water distribution system. Too much ammonia in water is considered undesirable because it exerts excess demand for chlorine. At sufficiently high Cl:N ratios in water containing ammonia, some HOCl and OCl- remain unreacted, and a small quantity of NCl3 is formed. The ratio at which this occurs is called the breakpoint. Chlorination beyond the breakpoint ensures disinfection. It has the additional advantage of destroying the more common materials that cause odor and taste in water. At moderate levels of NH3-N (approximately 20 mg/L), when the pH is between 5.0 and 8.0, chlorination with a minimum 8:1 mass ratio of Cl to NH3-nitrogen produces effi cient denitrifi cation: NH4 ++ HOCl \u00c6 NH2Cl + H2O + H+ (8.39) 2NH2Cl + HOCl \u00c6 N2 (g) + 3H+ + 3Cl-+ H2O (8.42) This reaction is used to remove pollutant ammonia from wastewater. However, problems can arise from chlorination of organic wastes. Typical of such by-products is chloroform, produced by the chlorination of humic substances in water. Chlorine is used to treat water other than drinking water. It is employed to disinfect effl uent from sewage treatment plants, as an additive to the water in electric power plant cooling towers, and to control microorganisms in food processing. 8.11.1 CHLORINE DIOXIDE Chlorine dioxide, ClO2, is an effective water disinfectant that is of particular interest because, in the absence of impurity Cl2, it does not produce impurity THMs in water treatment.", "In acidic and neutral water, respectively, the two half-reactions for ClO2 acting as an oxidant are the following: ClO2 + 4H++ 5e -Cl-+ 2H2O (8.43) ClO2 + e -ClO2 -(8.44) In the neutral pH range, chlorine dioxide in water remains largely as molecular ClO2 until it contacts a reducing agent with which to react. Chlorine dioxide is a gas that is violently reactive with organic matter and explosive when exposed to light. For these reasons, it is not shipped, but is generated on-site by processes such as the reaction of chlorine gas with solid sodium hypochlorite: 2NaClO ( )s + Cl (g) 2ClO (g) + 2NaCl ( )s (8.45) 22 2 A high content of elemental chlorine in the product may require its purification to prevent unwanted side reactions from Cl2. As a water disinfectant, chlorine dioxide does not chlorinate or oxidize ammonia or other nitrogen-containing compounds. Some concern has been raised over possible health effects of its main degradation by-products, ClO2 and ClO3. 8.11.2 OZONE AND OTHER OXIDANTS Ozone is sometimes used as a disinfectant in place of chlorine, particularly in Europe. Figure 8.11 shows the main components of an ozone water treatment system. Basically, air is fi ltered, cooled, dried, and pressurized, then subjected to an electrical discharge of approximately 20,000 V. The ozone produced is then pumped into a contact chamber where water contacts the ozone for 10\u201315 min. Concern over possible production of toxic organochlorine compounds by water chlorination processes has increased interest in ozonation. Furthermore, ozone is more destructive to viruses than is chlorine. Unfortunately, the solubility of ozone in water is relatively low, which limits its disinfective power. Ozone oxidizes water contaminants directly through the reaction of O3 and indirectly by generating hydroxyl radical, HO\u2022, a reactive strong oxidant. A major consideration with ozone is the rate at which it decomposes spontaneously in water, according to the overall reaction, 2O3 \u00c6 3O2 (g) (8.46) Air Water Air Puri\ufb01ed water Because of the decomposition of ozone in water, some chlorine must be added to maintain disinfectant throughout the water distribution system. Iron(VI) in the form of ferrate ion, FeO42-, is a strong oxidizing agent with excellent disinfectant properties. It has the additional advantage of removing heavy metals, viruses, and phosphate. It may well find increased application for disinfection in the future.4 Another oxidant that is becoming widely used as a cleaning and bleaching agent in detergents and that, because of its oxidizing ability, probably has disinfecting abilities as well, is sodium percarbonate. This solid, commonly called percarbonate, is produced by mixing hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, with sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, along with MgSO4 and Na2SiO3 stabilizers to produce a stable solid with an approximate empirical formula of Na2CO3\u00b73H2O2 in which the H2O2 may be stabilized by hydrogen bonding to CO32- ion. In water, this material releases oxygen and acts as a bleaching agent, detergent booster, and probably bactericide as well. 8.11.3 DISINFECTION WITH ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION Ultraviolet radiation, commonly represented as hn, is an effective disinfection agent that acts by direct breakage of chemical bonds in the biomolecules of pathogenic organisms and by generating reactive ions and radicals that destroy microorganisms. Ultraviolet radiation may be generated by high-powered mercury vapor lamps and solar radiation can be used as a source of ultraviolet radiation. Because it is reagent-free, ultraviolet radiation is a particularly green means of water disinfection. It works well in combination with other disinfection agents, such as chlorine or ozone, and reduces the quantities of such agents required. Studies are underway on the use for water disinfection of titanium dioxide, TiO2, a photocatalytic material that can destroy pathogens when activated by ultraviolet radiation. 8.12 NATURAL WATER PURIFICATION PROCESSES Virtually all of the materials that waste treatment processes are designed to eliminate may be absorbed by soil or degraded in soil.5 In fact, most of these materials are essential for soil fertility. Wastewater may provide the water that is essential to plant growth, in addition to the nutrients\u2014 phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium\u2014usually provided by fertilizers. Wastewater also contains essential trace elements and vitamins. Stretching the point a bit, the degradation of organic wastes provides the CO2 essential for photosynthetic production of plant biomass. Soil may be viewed as a natural filter for wastes. Most organic matter is readily degraded in soil and, in principle, soil constitutes an excellent primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment system for water. Soil has physical, chemical, and biological characteristics that can enable wastewater detoxification, biodegradation, chemical decomposition, and physical and chemical fi xation.", "A number of soil characteristics are important in determining its use for land treatment of wastes. These characteristics include physical form, ability to retain water, aeration, organic content, acid\u2013 base characteristics, and oxidation\u2013reduction behavior. Soil is a natural medium for a number of living organisms that may have an effect upon biodegradation of wastewaters, including those that contain industrial wastes. Of these, the most important are bacteria, including those from the genera Agrobacterium, Arthrobacteri, Bacillus, Flavobacterium, and Pseudomonas. Actinomycetes and fungi are important in decay of vegetable matter and may be involved in biodegradation of wastes. Other unicellular organisms that may be present in or on soil are protozoa and algae. Soil animals, such as earthworms, affect soil parameters such as soil texture. The growth of plants in soil may have an influence on its waste treatment potential in such aspects as uptake of soluble wastes and erosion control. Early civilizations, such as the Chinese, used human organic wastes to increase soil fertility, and the practice continues today. The ability of soil to purify water was noted well over a century ago. In 1850 and 1852, J. Thomas Way, a consulting chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society in England, presented two papers to the Society entitled \u201cPower of Soils to Absorb Manure.\u201d Way\u2019s experiments showed that soil is an ion exchanger. Much practical and theoretical information on the ion exchange process resulted from his work. If soil treatment systems are not properly designed and operated, odor can become an overpowering problem. The author of this book is reminded of driving into a small town, recalled from some years before as a very pleasant place, and being assaulted with a virtually intolerable odor. The disgruntled residents pointed to a large spray irrigation system on a field in the distance\u2014unfortunately upwind\u2014spraying liquified pig manure as part of an experimental feedlot waste treatment operation. The experiment was not deemed a success and was discontinued by the investigators, presumably before they met with violence from the local residents. 8.12.1 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT BY SOIL Wastes that are amenable to land treatment are biodegradable organic substances, particularly those contained in municipal sewage and in wastewater from some industrial operations, such as food processing. However, through acclimation over a long period of time, soil bacterial cultures may develop that are effective in degrading normally recalcitrant compounds that occur in industrial wastewater. Acclimated microorganisms are found particularly at contaminated sites, such as those where soil has been exposed to crude oil for many years. Soil used for land treatment must meet a number of criteria. It should be at least a meter thick because wastes that reach underlying rock strata tend to degrade poorly. The soil slope should be moderate to reduce runoff. The water table should lie at a sufficient depth to avoid leaching into groundwater. Treatment sites should be located at appropriate distances from dwellings or other anthrospheric constructs that could be adversely affected by exposure to wastes. Shallow cultivation of soil to which wastes have been applied promotes degradation by exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Land treatment is most used for petroleum refi ning wastes and is applicable to the treatment of fuels and wastes from leaking underground storage tanks. It can also be applied to biodegradable organic chemical wastes, including some organohalide compounds. Land treatment is not suitable for the treatment of wastes containing acids, bases, toxic inorganic compounds, salts, heavy metals, and organic compounds that are excessively soluble, volatile, or fl ammable. 8.13 GREEN WATER Much of the world including parts of the United States suffers from chronic shortages of water. Throughout history, water used by humans has come from freshwater groundwater and surface sources, relying on nature\u2019s hydrologic cycle for purification to remove dissolved salt. Largely untapped is the more than 97% of earth\u2019s water that is too saline to use, most of which is present in the oceans, but including significant amounts in underground saline aquifers. Assuming suffi cient availability of affordable energy, these waters can be subjected to desalination to provide freshwater suitable for human consumption and irrigation. The two main means of water desalination are distillation and reverse osmosis. Distillation normally is carried out in several stages in which brine feedstock is heated to progressively higher temperatures as it is used to condense steam from each stage, the highest of which is heated by an external source.", "At each step, the heated brine is subjected to a lower pressure enabling more water to evaporate or \u201cflash\u201d to produce steam that condenses in a heat exchanger cooled by incoming brine feed. This approach enables maximum efficiency of energy use. Because of the energy intensity of this multistage distillation, it is usually combined with a power plant using otherwise waste heat from the power plant steam turbine outlet. An interesting possibility for small-scale water desalination is the use of solar power to heat the desalination units. The world\u2019s largest seawater distillation plant is the multistage fl ash distillation unit in Shoaibi, Saudi Arabia, a nation that gets about 70% of its municipal water supplies from water desalination. This operation is combined with an oil-fi red steam power plant, which uses the desalination plant for cooling and provides the heat needed for desalination. In addition to distillation, the other significant alternative for providing freshwater is reverse osmosis discussed in Section 8.9. Some communities in arid lands close to a seacoast get their freshwater from this source. Both distillation and reverse osmosis produce concentrated brine by-products (retentate) that requires disposal. This material can be pumped back into the ocean or, in some cases, to deep underground saltwater aquifers. Some of it can also be evaporated, in some cases using solar energy, to yield a salt product with commercial value. Some inland areas have large resources of saline groundwater (brackish water) that can be desalinated. An advantage of this source is that the salt level is often less than that of seawater, which makes the energy requirements relatively lower. Residue from purification of saline groundwater can be pumped back into the aquifer at a depth or location that does not contaminate the source. Utilization of saline groundwater could vastly increase the availability of water in many waterdefi cient areas. 8.13.1 REUSE AND RECYCLING OF WASTEWATER The most readily available water source is wastewater discharged by municipalities, industrial concerns, and even irrigation. Wastewater from municipal and industrial use usually requires treatment prior to discharge and it is relatively straightforward and inexpensive to remove inorganic and organic solutes from the water to make it suitable for use. It has an advantage over saline seawater or groundwater in that its dissolved salt content is usually much less, lowering the cost of desalination. Water reuse and recycling are becoming much more common as demands for water exceed supply. Unplanned reuse occurs as the result of waste effluents entering receiving waters or groundwater and subsequently being taken into a water distribution system. A typical example of unplanned water reuse occurs in London, which withdraws water from the Thames River that may have been through other water systems at least once, and which uses groundwater sources unintentionally recharged with sewage effluents from a number of municipalities. Planned reuse utilizes wastewater treatment systems deliberately designed to bring water up to standards required for subsequent applications. The term direct reuse refers to water that has retained its identity from a previous application; reuse of water that has lost its identity is termed indirect reuse. The distinction also needs to be made between recycling and reuse. Recycling occurs internally before water is ever discharged. An example is condensation of steam in a steam power plant followed by return of the steam to boilers. Reuse occurs, for example, when water discharged by one user is taken as a water source by another user. Reuse of water continues to grow because of two major factors. The first of these is lack of supply of water. The second is that widespread deployment of modern water treatment processes signifi cantly enhances the quality of water available for reuse. These two factors come into play in semiarid regions in countries with advanced technological bases. For example, Israel, which is dependent upon irrigation for essentially all its agriculture, reuses about two-third of the country\u2019s sewage effluent for irrigation, whereas the United States, where water is relatively more available, uses only about 2\u20133% of its water for this purpose. Since drinking water and water used for food processing require the highest quality of all large applications, intentional reuse for potable water is relatively less desirable, though widely practiced unintentionally or out of necessity. This leaves three applications with the greatest potential for reuse: \u2022 Irrigation for cropland, golf courses, and other applications requiring water for plant and grass growth.", "This is the largest potential application for reused water and one that can take advantage of plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, in water. \u2022 Cooling and process water in industrial applications. For some industrial applications, relatively low quality water can be used and secondary sewage effluent is a suitable source. \u2022 Groundwater recharge. Groundwater can be recharged with reused water either by direct injection into an aquifer or by applying the water to land, followed by percolation into the aquifer. The latter, especially, takes advantage of biodegradation and chemical sorption processes to further purify the water. The major concern with recycled water is the potential presence of harmful pollutants. Water is readily disinfected to eliminate disease-causing bacteria. Viruses are more persistent, but can also be eliminated. Organic contaminants at very low levels may cause harm and can be very diffi cult to eliminate. As discussed in Section 7.13, these contaminants can include pharmaceuticals and their metabolic products such as synthetic 17a-ethinylestradiol and the natural hormone 17b-estradiol, used in oral contraceptives; other endocrine disrupting species may be present as well. It is inevitable that water recycling and reuse will continue to grow. This trend will increase the demand for water treatment, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, it will require more careful consideration of the original uses of water to minimize water deterioration and enhance its suitability for reuse. Figure 8.12 shows a system for reuse of water. Most of the water treatment processes discussed in this chapter may be utilized in purifying water for reuse and employed in an operation such as the one shown (see especially the physical/chemical wastewater purification system shown in Figure 8.5). The system shown in Figure 8.12 shows some of the main operations employed in a system for total water recycle and the applications of the purified water product. It takes secondary wastewater effluent from which most of the BOD has been removed by the activated sludge process and discharges it into wetlands where plants and algae grow profusely in the nutrient-rich water. This biomass has the potential to be harvested and utilized as a fuel or raw material using thermo-chemical gasification or related measures. Depending upon geological conditions, signifi cant amounts of water in the wetlands may infiltrate into groundwater, where it is purified further by natural processes underground. Water exiting the wetlands may be run over a bed of activated Plants and algae harvestedfrom wetlands for Secondary wastewater energy productiontreatment e\ufb04uent Retentate with impuritiesnot passed through membraneto disposal, treatment carbon to remove organics. The water can also be subjected to highly effi cient membrane fi ltration processes including even reverse osmosis for removal of all salts. The solute-enriched retentate from treatment of water by membrane processes can be pumped into deep underground saline aquifers in some areas, discarded to the ocean in coastal regions (often with mixing with wastewater or cooling water to dilute the impurities in the retentate), or evaporated to produce a solid or sludge residue that can be disposed. The world\u2019s largest water plant devoted to bringing sewage effluent up to a standard permitting potable uses began operation in the Orange County Water District in southern California in late 2007. Known as the Groundwater Replenishment System this $481 million project is fed with sewage treated by secondary wastewater treatment processes and pumps its clean water product into underground aquifers to serve as future municipal water sources and to prevent saltwater intrusion from the nearby ocean. Around 275 million liters per day of sewage effluent is first forced through microfilters to remove solids, then treated by reverse osmosis to remove dissolved salts, and fi nally subjected to intense ultraviolet radiation to break down organic contaminants, especially pharmaceuticals and their metabolites before being discharged to underground aquifers. It is expected to serve as a model for similar installations around the world. In coastal areas and on islands, a major advantage of upgrading wastewater to a standard that it can be injected into underground aquifers is the prevention of seawater intrusion into the aquifers (Figure 8.13). As aquifers are pumped down, the lowered water level in the aquifer can enable infiltration of saline water, thus ruining the groundwater quality. Injection of treated wastewater into the aquifer can raise the water table in the aquifer to a level that prevents seawater intrusion. 8.14 WATER CONSERVATION Water conservation, simply using less water, is one of the most effective, and clearly the fastest, means to ensure water supply.", "Water conservation falls into several major categories: 1. Indoor and household water conservation practices 2. Water-conserving devices and appliances 3. Outdoor and landscaping water conservation 4. Efficient irrigation practices 5. Conservation in agricultural operations other than irrigation 6. Water-effi cient manufacturing Each of these categories is summarized briefl y below. Indoor and household water conservation practices are generally those simple measures that water consumers may implement to reduce use of water. Examples include sequential uses of water such as saving water from rinsing dishes to use for household cleaning, ensuring that there are no leaking faucets or toilet appliances, taking showers by first lathering one\u2019s wet body without water flowing followed by rinsing with water for the minimum length of time, minimizing the number and water volume of toilet flushes, minimizing use of kitchen sink disposal devices for food waste disposal, operating clothes washers and dishwashers only with full loads, and other common sense measures to reduce water use. Implementation of these measures is largely a matter of education and good environmental citizenship. In cases of real water shortage, force may be applied through the painful mechanism of sharply higher water utility rates. A number of water-saving devices and appliances are available. These can be quite simple and cheap, such as aerators with fl ow constrictors on faucets or showerheads, or they may be large and expensive such as low-water-consumption clothes washers that function well with cold water. Toilets that use minimal water per flush are now mandated by law, although the less effective of these may actually increase water consumption when multiple flushes are required. In public facilities, automatically flushing toilets and urinals are now commonplace, although some have the counterproductive tendency of performing multiple automatic flushes for each instance of use. Instant in-line water heaters installed near faucet outlets can reduce water use by making it unnecessary to run the hot water faucet for some time to obtain hot water. Water used for lawns and landscaping often is one of the greatest consumers of water. In some areas, such as public parks, purified wastewater is used for this purpose. In principle, water used in some household applications can be recycled to water yard plants or grass. Some of the greater savings can be achieved in this area by growing ground cover and plants that require minimal water. This may mean planting native grass species that can withstand drought without much watering. In extreme cases, yards have been converted to gravel cover. Mulching with materials such as tree bark or grass clippings can reduce water use signifi cantly. Irrigation of agricultural crops is one of the largest consumers of water and one that is amenable to conservation. Spray irrigation devices lose large quantities of water to evaporation and should be replaced by systems that do not spray the water into the air. The ultimate in irrigation effi ciency is drip irrigation that applies minimum quantities of water directly to the plant roots. Application of excess water in irrigation should be minimized. However, particularly in areas that rarely receive enough rain to flush the soil, application of minimal amounts of irrigation water can result in harmful accumulation of salts in the soil. Livestock production and processing agricultural products use large amounts of water. The production of l kg of beef requires around 20,000 L of water, including the water required to grow the grain that the animal eats. About 6000 L of water are required to produce 1 kg of chicken meat. Significantly less water is needed to produce an equivalent amount of vegetable protein. The production of fuel ethanol from the fermentation of sugar from corn requires relatively large amounts of water. Choices made in the kinds of agricultural products produced for market have important implications for water conservation. Manufacturing can be very water-intensive. The manufacture of a single automobile requires around 150,000 L of water. Refining crude oil to petroleum requires approximately 44 times the volume of water as the gasoline produced. The conservation of water in manufacturing and commercial activities is an important aspect of industrial ecology (see Chapter 17). 8.15 PROTECTING WATER SUPPLIES FROM ATTACK The fact that drinking water is distributed centrally to large numbers of people makes water systems a concern to terrorist threats. History abounds with examples of large populations devastated by contaminated water supplies that caused diseases such as cholera and typhoid.", "In modern times, contaminated water in developing countries causes outbreaks of debilitating and often fatal dysentery, a leading cause of mortality in infants and children in some areas. Even in industrialized countries in modern times, drinking water contamination can cause illness and even fatalities. For example, in 1993 contamination of the Milwaukee water system by the protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum caused illness in over 400,000 people, more than 50 of whom died as a result. Deliberate chemical contamination of an entire water system is an unlikely, but not impossible, event. Incidents have been recorded in which terrorist groups attempted to obtain cyanide salts, presumably with the objective of poisoning water supplies. Toxins from microorganisms are likely weapons of groups wishing to poison water. The most toxic of these is the botulinus toxin, an astoundingly poisonous substance produced by Botulinus bacteria. Direct contamination by bacteria is possible. The most likely candidates are Bacillus anthracis, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibriocholerae, and Yersiniapestis. Waterborne strains of Escherichia coli bacteria that produce the shiga toxin (the toxin produced by Shigelladysenteriae) continue to cause fatal infections in the United States from time to time. Shiga-producing E. coli in the municipal water supply of Walkerton, Ontario, Canada, caused approximately 3000 people to become ill and seven to die in May 2000. In an incident suggestive of the potential for terrorist attack, 12 staff of a laboratory of a large medical center developed acute diarrheal illness requiring hospitalization of four of the victims due to infection by Shigelladysenteriae. Cultures taken from the victims were found to be identical to those found on doughnuts or muffins that they had eaten in the facility break room and to a culture of Shigelladysenteriae maintained in the laboratory, a portion of which was missing. This led to the conclusion that the contamination was deliberate.6 Fortunately, water supplies are not particularly vulnerable to attack. It would be rather diffi cult to infiltrate a water treatment system, and injecting a toxic substance into the water distribution system beyond the treatment plant is unlikely. Vulnerability to infectious microbial agents is greatly reduced by maintaining a disinfectant chlorine residual in the system. Some of the likely chemical agents hydrolyze in water or are destroyed by the action of chlorine, and their effects are reduced by the great dilution provided by water systems that distribute huge quantities of water. Even in the event of contamination of a water supply, provision of relatively small quantities of bottled water for drinking would reduce the hazard to very low levels. Prudence dictates that water supply, treatment, and distribution systems be maintained in a secure state and monitored for likely agents of attack, but water systems need not be the subject of undue concern.

Exclusive of water, atmospheric air is 78.1% (by volume) nitrogen, 21.0% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.04% carbon dioxide. Normally, air contains 1\u20133% water vapor by volume. In addition, air contains a large variety of trace level gases below 0.002%, including neon, helium, methane, krypton, nitrous oxide, hydrogen, xenon, sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, and carbon monoxide. The atmosphere behaves as it does as a consequence of the gases in it from both natural and anthropogenic sources and the physical forces acting on it. The atmosphere is divided into several layers on the basis of temperature. Of these, the most significant are the troposphere extending in altitude from the Earth\u2019s surface to approximately 11 km, and the stratosphere from about 11 km to approximately 50 km. Atmospheric stratifi cation is discussed in more detail in Section 9.3. 9.1.1 PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND SOME IMPORTANT TERMS Various aspects of the environmental chemistry of the atmosphere are discussed in Chapters 9 through 14. Important aspects of atmospheric chemistry include effects of solar radiation leading to photolysis of trace gases and photooxidation of oxidizable trace gases in the troposphere. The most significant feature of atmospheric chemistry is the occurrence of photochemical reactions resulting from the absorption by molecules of photons of electromagnetic radiation from the sun, mostly in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum.1 Photochemical reactions and photochemistry are discussed in more detail in Section 9.8. However, it is important to define several key aspects of photochemistry at this point to enable understanding of the rest of the material in this chapter. \u2022", "The meaning of hn: The energy, E, of a photon of visible or ultraviolet light is given by the equation, E = hn, where h is Planck\u2019s constant and n is the frequency of electromagnetic inversely proportional to its wavelength, l. The involvement of a photon in a photochemical reaction is shown by the following reaction with ozone, O3: O3 + hn (l< 420 nm) \u00c6 O* + O2 (9.1) Ultraviolet radiation has a higher frequency than visible light and is, therefore, more ener getic and more likely to break chemical bonds in molecules that absorb it. \u2022 Excited state, *: The product of a photochemical reaction may be electronically energized in an excited state commonly denoted with an asterisk, *, as shown for the excited oxygen atom, O*, above. This excess electronic energy may make the excited species chemically more reactive. \u2022 Free radicals containing an unpaired electron denoted with a dot, \u2211: Reaction of an excited oxygen atom with a molecule of water vapor, O* + H2O \u00c6 HO\u2211+ HO\u2211 (9.2) produces two hydroxyl radicals, HO\u2211. Because of the strong pairing tendency of electrons, free radicals are normally highly reactive and cause most of the important chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere. \u2022 Third body, M: An important reaction in the stratosphere is that between an oxygen atom and an O2 molecule O + O2 + M \u00c6 O3 + M (9.3) to produce stratospheric ozone. In this reaction, M is a third body, almost always a molecule of O2 or N2, that absorbs the energy released in the reaction, which otherwise would cause the product molecule to fall apart. 9.1.2 ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION Dry air up to several kilometers altitude consists of two major components \u2022 Nitrogen 78.08% (by volume) \u2022 Oxygen 20.95% and two minor components \u2022 Argon 0.934% \u2022 Carbon dioxide 0.039% in addition to argon, four more noble gases, \u2022 Neon 1.818 \u00a5 10-3% \u2022 Krypton 1.14 \u00a5 10-4% \u2022 Helium 5.24 \u00a5 10-4% \u2022 Xenon 8.7 \u00a5 10-6% and trace gases as given in Table 9.1. Atmospheric air may contain 0.1\u20135% water by volume, with a normal range of 1\u20133%. 9.1.3 GASEOUS OXIDES IN THE ATMOSPHERE Oxides of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen are important constituents of the atmosphere and are pollutants at higher levels. Of these, carbon dioxide, CO2, is the most abundant. It is a natural atmospheric constituent, and it is required for plant growth. However, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, now at about 390 ppm by volume, is increasing by about 2 ppm per year. As discussed in Chapter 14, this increase in atmospheric CO2 may well cause general atmospheric warming\u2014the \u201cgreenhouse effect,\u201d with potentially very serious consequences for the global atmosphere and for life on Earth. Although not a global threat, carbon monoxide, CO, can be a serious health threat because it prevents blood from transporting oxygen to body tissues. The two most serious nitrogen oxide air pollutants are nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2, collectively denoted as \u201cNOx.\u201d These tend to enter the atmosphere as NO, and photochemical processes in the atmosphere can convert NO to NO2. Further reactions can result in the formation of corrosive nitrate salts or nitric acid, HNO3. Nitrogen dioxide is particularly significant in atmospheric chemistry because of its photochemical dissociation by light with a wavelength <430 nm to produce highly reactive O atoms. This is the first step in the formation of photochemical smog (see below). Sulfur dioxide, SO2, is a reaction product of the combustion of sulfur-containing fuels such TABLE 9.1 Atmospheric Trace Gases in Dry Air Near Ground Level Process for Removal Gas or Species Volume Percenta Major Sources from the Atmosphere CH4 1.8 \u00a5 10-4 Biogenicb Photochemicalc CO ~1.2 \u00a5 10-5 Photochemical, anthropogenicd Photochemical N2O 3 \u00a5 10-5 Biogenic Photochemical NOxe 10-10-10-6 Photochemical, lightning, anthropogenic Photochemical HNO3 10-9\u201310-7 Photochemical Washed out by precipitation NH3 10-8\u201310-7 Biogenic Photochemical, washed out by precipitation H2 5 \u00a5 10-5 Biogenic, photochemical Photochemical H2O2 10-8\u201310-6 Photochemical Washed out by precipitation HO\u2211f 10-13\u201310-10 Photochemical Photochemical \u2211fHO2 10-11\u201310-9 Photochemical Photochemical H2CO 10-8\u201310-7 Photochemical Photochemical CS2 10-9\u201310-8 Anthropogenic, biogenic Photochemical OCS 10-8 Anthropogenic, biogenic, photochemical Photochemical SO2 ~2 \u00a5 10-8 Anthropogenic, photochemical, volcanic Photochemical I2 0-trace \u2014 \u2014 gCCl2F2 2.8 \u00a5 10-5 Anthropogenic Photochemical hH3CCCl3 ~1 \u00a5 10-8 Anthropogenic Photochemical a Levels in the absence of gross pollution. b From biological sources.

Part of this sulfur dioxide is converted in the atmosphere to sulfuric acid, H2SO4, normally the predominant contributor to acid precipitation. 9.1.4 ATMOSPHERIC METHANE The most abundant hydrocarbon in the atmosphere is methane, CH4, released from underground sources as natural gas and produced by the fermentation of organic matter. Methane is one of the least reactive atmospheric hydrocarbons and is produced by diffuse sources, so that its role in producing intense regionalized incidents of air pollution is limited. However, because of its presence throughout the atmosphere and despite its relatively low reactivity, it is a major factor in atmospheric chemical processes. Information gathered from ice cores has shown that during the last 250 years levels of atmospheric methane have more than doubled as the result of fossil fuel utilization, agricultural practices (particularly cultivation of rice in which methane is evolved from anoxic bacteria growing in waterlogged soil), and waste fermentation. Per molecule, methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas than is carbon dioxide. Methane affects both tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, particularly by influencing levels of hydroxyl radical, ozone, and stratospheric water vapor. 9.1.5 HYDROCARBONS AND PHOTOCHEMICAL SMOG The most significant atmospheric pollutant hydrocarbons are the reactive ones produced as automobile exhaust emissions. In the presence of NO, under conditions of temperature inversion (see Chapter 11), low humidity, and sunlight, these hydrocarbons produce undesirable photochemical smog manifested by the presence of visibility-obscuring particulate matter, oxidants such as ozone, and noxious organic species such as aldehydes. 9.1.6 PARTICULATE MATTER Particles ranging from aggregates of a few molecules to pieces of dust readily visible to the naked eye are commonly found in the atmosphere and are discussed in detail in Chapter 10. Some atmospheric particles, such as sea salt formed by the evaporation of water from droplets of sea spray, are natural and even beneficial atmospheric constituents. Very small particles called condensation nuclei serve as bodies for atmospheric water vapor to condense upon and are essential for the formation of rain drops. Colloidal-sized particles in the atmosphere are called aerosols. Those formed by grinding up bulk matter are known as dispersion aerosols, whereas particles formed from chemical reactions of gases are condensation aerosols; the latter tend to be smaller. Smaller particles are in general the most harmful because they have a greater tendency to scatter light and are the most respirable(tendency to be inhaled into the lungs). Much of the mineral particulate matter in a polluted atmosphere is in the form of oxides and other compounds produced during the combustion of high-ash fossil fuel. Smaller particles of fl y ash enter furnace flues and are efficiently collected in a properly equipped stack system. However, some fl y ash escapes through the stack and enters the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the fly ash thus released tends to consist of smaller particles that do the most damage to human health, plants, and visibility. 9.1.7 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY POLLUTANTS Primary pollutants in the atmosphere are those that are emitted directly. An example of a primary pollutant is sulfur dioxide, SO2, which directly harms vegetation and is a lung irritant. Of greater importance in most cases are secondary pollutants that are formed by atmospheric chemical processes acting upon primary pollutants and even nonpollutant species in the atmosphere. Secondary pollutants are generally produced by the natural tendency of the atmosphere to oxidize trace gases in it. Secondary pollutant sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is generated by the oxidation of primary pollutant SO2 and secondary pollutant NO2 is produced when the primary pollutant NO is oxidized. One of the most important secondary pollutants in the troposphere is ozone, O3, for which the primary raw material is atmospheric oxygen, O2. Pollutant levels of ozone are produced in the troposphere by photochemical processes in the presence of hydrocarbons and NOx (NO + NO2) as discussed in Chapter 13. Another important kind of secondary pollutant consists of particulate matter generated by atmospheric chemical reactions operating on gaseous primary pollutants. 9.2 IMPORTANCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE The atmosphere is a protective blanket that nurtures life on Earth and protects it from the hostile environment of outer space.", "The atmosphere is the source of carbon dioxide for plant photosynthesis and of oxygen for respiration. It provides the nitrogen that nitrogen-fixing bacteria and ammonia-manufacturing plants use to produce chemically bound nitrogen, an essential component of life molecules. As a basic part of the hydrologic cycle (Figure 3.1) the atmosphere transports water from the oceans to land, thus acting as the condenser in a vast solar-powered still. Unfortunately, the atmosphere also has been used as a dumping ground for many pollutant materials\u2014ranging from sulfur dioxide to refrigerant Freon\u2014a practice that causes damage to vegetation and materials, shortens human life, and alters the characteristics of the atmosphere itself. In its essential role as a protective shield, the atmosphere absorbs most of the cosmic rays from outer space and protects organisms from their effects. It also absorbs most of the electromagnetic radiation from the sun, allowing transmission of significant amounts of radiation only in the regions of 300\u20132500 nm (near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared radiation) and 0.01\u201340 m (radio waves). By absorbing electromagnetic radiation below 300 nm, the atmosphere filters out damaging ultraviolet radiation that would otherwise be very harmful to living organisms. Furthermore, because it reabsorbs much of the infrared radiation by which absorbed solar energy is re-emitted to space, the atmosphere stabilizes the Earth\u2019s temperature, preventing the tremendous temperature extremes that occur on planets and moons lacking substantial atmospheres. 9.3 PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ATMOSPHERE Atmospheric science deals with the movement of air masses in the atmosphere, atmospheric heat balance, and atmospheric chemical composition and reactions. In order to understand atmospheric chemistry and air pollution, it is important to have an overall appreciation of the atmosphere, its composition, and physical characteristics as discussed in the first parts of this chapter. 9.3.1 VARIATION OF PRESSURE AND DENSITY WITH ALTITUDE As anyone who has exercised at high altitudes well knows, the density of the atmosphere decreases sharply with increasing altitude as a consequence of the gas laws and gravity. More than 99% of the total mass of the atmosphere is found within approximately 30 km (about 20 mile) of the Earth\u2019s surface. Such an altitude is miniscule compared to the Earth\u2019s diameter, so it is not an exaggeration to characterize the atmosphere as a \u201ctissue-thin\u201d protective layer. In fact, if Earth were a globe the size of one typically seen in a geography classroom, the greater part of the atmosphere upon which humankind is absolutely dependent for its existence would be of a thickness only about that of the coat of varnish on the globe! Although the total mass of the global atmosphere is huge, approximately 5.14 \u00a51015 metric tons, it is still only about one-millionth of the Earth\u2019s total mass. The fact that atmospheric pressure decreases as an approximately exponential function of altitude largely determines the characteristics of the atmosphere. Ideally, in the absence of mixing and at a constant absolute temperature, T, the pressure at any given height, Ph, is given in the exponential form Mgh / RT Ph =P0e - (9.4) where P0 is the pressure at zero altitude (sea level), M is the average molar mass of air (28.97 g/mol in the troposphere), g is the acceleration of gravity (981 cm/s2 at sea level), h is the altitude in cm, and R is the gas constant (8.314 \u00a5107 erg/deg/mol). These units are given in the cgs (centimetergram-second) system for consistency; altitude can be converted to meter or kilometer as appropriate. The factor RT/Mg is defined as the scale height, which represents the increase in altitude by which the pressure drops by e -1. At an average sea-level temperature of 288 K, the scale height is 8 \u00a5105 cm or 8 km; at an altitude of 8 km, the pressure is only about 39% of that at sea level. Conversion of Equation 9.4 to the logarithmic (base 10) form and expression of h in km yields Mgh \u00a5105 logP =log P - (9.5) h 0 2.303RT and taking the pressure at sea level to be exactly 1 atm gives the following expression: Mgh \u00a5105 logP =- (9.6) h 2.303RT Temperature, \u00b0C \u2013100 \u201380 \u201360 \u201340 \u201320 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 Altitude, km FIGURE 9.1 Variation of pressure (solid line) and temperature (dashed line) with altitude. Plots of Ph and temperature versus altitude are shown in Figure 9.1.", "The plot of Ph is nonlinear because of variations arising from nonlinear variations in temperature with altitude that are discussed later in this section and from the mixing of air masses. The characteristics of the atmosphere vary widely with altitude, time (season), location (latitude), and even solar activity. Extremes of pressure and temperature are illustrated in Figure 9.1. At very high altitudes, normally reactive species such as atomic oxygen, O, persist for long periods of time. That occurs because the pressure is very low at these altitudes such that the distance traveled by a reactive species before it collides with a potential reactant\u2014its mean free path\u2014is quite high. A particle with a mean free path of 1 \u00a5 10-6 cm at sea level has a mean free path greater than 1 \u00a5 106 cm at an altitude of 500 km, where the pressure is lower by many orders of magnitude. 9.3.2 STRATIFICATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE As shown in Figure 9.2, the atmosphere is stratified on the basis of the temperature/density relationships resulting from interactions between physical and photochemical processes in air. The lowest layer of the atmosphere extending from sea level to an altitude of 10\u201316 km is the troposphere, characterized by a generally homogeneous composition of major gases other than water and decreasing temperature with increasing altitude. To understand why the temperature decreases with increasing altitude in the troposphere, consider a hypothetical mass of air at the surface rising to higher altitudes in the troposphere. As the air rises, it expands, doing work on its surroundings so that its temperature must fall. The extent of the temperature decrease for dry air with increasing altitude is known as the adiabatic lapse rate, which has a value of 9.8 K/km. However, air contains water vapor that condenses as the air mass rises, releasing heat of vaporization and lowering the lapse rate to an average of about 6.5 km-1. The upper limit of the troposphere, which has a temperature minimum of about -56\u221eC, varies in altitude by a kilometer or more with atmospheric temperature, underlying terrestrial surface, latitude, and time. The homogeneous composition of the troposphere results from constant mixing by convection currents in air masses, driven by the unstable situation with colder air above warmer air (the name of the troposphere is based on the Greek tropos for mixing). However, the water vapor content of the troposphere is extremely variable because of cloud formation, precipitation, and evaporation of water from terrestrial water bodies. The very cold tropopause layer at the top of the troposphere serves as a barrier that causes water vapor to condense to ice so that it cannot reach altitudes at which it would photodissociate through the action of intense high-energy ultraviolet radiation. If this happened, the hydrogen produced would escape the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and be lost. (Much of the hydrogen and helium gases originally present in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere were lost by this process.) The atmospheric layer directly above the troposphere is the stratosphere, in which the temperature rises to a maximum of about -2\u221eC with increasing altitude. The increasing temperature with higher altitude in this region results in very little vertical mixing (the name stratosphere is based on the Greek stratus for mixing). This phenomenon is due to the presence of ozone, O3, which may reach a level of around 10 ppm by volume in the mid-range of the stratosphere. The heating effect is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation energy by ozone, a phenomenon discussed later in this chapter. The absence of high levels of radiation-absorbing species in the mesosphere immediately above the stratosphere results in a further temperature decrease to about -92\u221eC at an altitude around 85 km. The upper regions of the mesosphere and higher define a region called the exosphere from which molecules and ions can completely escape the atmosphere. Extending to the far outer reaches of the atmosphere is the thermosphere, in which the highly rarified gas reaches temperatures as high as 1200\u221eC by the absorption of very energetic radiation of wavelengths less than approximately 200 nm by gas species in this region. 9.4 ENERGY TRANSFER IN THE ATMOSPHERE The physical and chemical characteristics of the atmosphere and the critical heat balance of Earth are determined by energy and mass transfer processes in the atmosphere. Energy transfer phenomena are addressed in this section and mass transfer in Section 9.4. Incoming solar energy is largely in the visible region of the spectrum.", "The shorter wavelength blue solar light is scattered relatively more strongly by molecules and particles in the upper atmosphere, which is why the sky appears blue as it is viewed by scattered light and appears red by transmitted light, particularly around sunset and sunrise and when the atmosphere contains a high level of particles. The solar energy flux reaching the atmosphere is huge, amounting to 1.34 \u00a5 103 W/m2 (19.2 kcal/min/m2) perpendicular to the line of solar flux at the top of the atmosphere, as illustrated in Figure 9.3. This value is the solar constant, and may be termed insolation, which stands for \u201cincoming solar radiation.\u201d This energy must be radiated back into space, and a delicate energy balance is involved in maintaining the Earth\u2019s temperature within very narrow limits that enable conditions of climate that support present levels of life on Earth. The great climate changes that resulted in past ice ages lasting thousands of years alternating with long periods of tropical conditions were caused by variations of only a few degrees in average temperature. Marked climate changes within recorded history have been marked by much smaller average temperature changes. The mechanisms by which the Earth\u2019s average temperature is retained within its present narrow range are complex and still the topic of intensive study, but the main features are explained here.2 About half of the solar radiation entering the atmosphere reaches the Earth\u2019s surface either directly or after scattering by clouds, atmospheric gases, or particles. The remaining half of the radiation is either reflected directly back or absorbed in the atmosphere, and its energy radiated back into space at a later time as infrared radiation. Most of the solar energy reaching the surface is absorbed and is returned to space to maintain heat balance. In addition, a very small amount of energy (<1% of that received from the sun) reaches the Earth\u2019s surface by convection and conduction processes from the Earth\u2019s hot mantle, and this, too, must be lost. Energy transport, which is crucial to eventual reradiation of energy from Earth, is accomplished by three major mechanisms. These are conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction of energy occurs through the interaction of adjacent atoms or molecules without the bulk movement of matter and is a relatively slow means of transferring energy in the atmosphere. Convection involves the movement of whole masses of air, which may be either relatively warm or cold. It is the mechanism by which abrupt temperature variations occur when large masses of air move across an area. Besides carrying sensible heat due to the kinetic energy of molecules, convection carries latent heat in the form of water vapor, which releases heat as it condenses. An appreciable fraction of the Earth\u2019s surface heat is transported to clouds in the atmosphere by conduction and convection before being lost ultimately by radiation. Radiation of energy in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere occurs through electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is the only way in which energy is transmitted through a vacuum; therefore, it is the means by which all of the energy that must be lost from the planet to maintain its heat balance is ultimately returned to space. The maximum intensity of incoming radiation is at 0.5 mm (500 nm) in the visible region, with essentially none outside the range of 0.2\u20133 mm. This range encompasses the whole visible region and small parts of the ultraviolet and infrared adjacent to it. Outgoing radiation is in the infrared region, with maximum intensity at about 10 mm, primarily between 2 and 40 \u03bcm. Thus Earth loses energy by electromagnetic radiation of a much longer wavelength (lower energy per photon) than the radiation by which it receives energy, a crucial factor in maintaining the Earth\u2019s heat balance, and one susceptible to upset by human activities. 9.4.1 THE EARTH\u2019S RADIATION BUDGET The Earth\u2019s radiation budget is illustrated in Figure 9.4. The average surface temperature is maintained at a relatively comfortable 15\u221eC because of an atmospheric \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d in which water vapor and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide reabsorb much of the outgoing radiation and reradiate about half of it back to the surface. Were this not the case, the surface temperature would average around -18\u221eC. Most of the absorption of infrared radiation is done by water molecules in the atmosphere. Absorption is weak in the regions 7\u20138.5 and 11\u201314 \u03bcm, and nonexistent between 8.5 and 11 \u03bcm, leaving a \u201chole\u201d in the infrared absorption spectrum through which radiation may escape.", "Carbon dioxide, though present at a much lower concentration than water vapor, absorbs strongly between 12 and 16.3 \u03bcm, and plays a key role in maintaining the heat balance. There is concern that an increase in the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere could prevent suffi cient energy loss to cause a perceptible and damaging increase in the Earth\u2019s temperature. This phenomenon, discussed in more detail in Section 9.7 and Chapter 14, is popularly known as the greenhouse effect and may occur from elevated CO2 levels caused by increased use of fossil fuels and the destruction of photosynthesizing trees in forests. An important aspect of solar radiation that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface is the percentage refl ected from the surface, described as albedo. Albedo is important in determining the Earth\u2019s heat balance in that absorbed radiation heats the surface and reflected radiation does not. Albedo varies spectacularly with the surface. At the two extremes, freshly fallen snow has an albedo of 90% because it refl ects 9/10th of incoming radiation, whereas freshly plowed black topsoil has an albedo of only about 2.5%. 9.5 ATMOSPHERIC MASS TRANSFER, METEOROLOGY, AND WEATHER Meteorology is the science of atmospheric phenomena, encompassing the study of the movement of air masses as well as physical forces in the atmosphere\u2014heat, wind, and transitions of water, primarily liquid to vapor or vice versa.3 Meteorological phenomena affect, and in turn are affected by, the chemical properties of the atmosphere. Meteorological phenomena determine whether or not 1340 W/m2 reach the upper limits of the atmosphere 248 W of latent heat and 636 W of solar 1293 W infrared 1534 W of infrared147 W of sensible heat radiation absorbed at radiation absorbed at the radiation emitted fromtransferred from Earth\u2019s Earth\u2019s surface Earth\u2019s surface Earth\u2019s surfaceatmosphere by evaporationand convection FIGURE 9.4 The Earth\u2019s radiation budget expressed on the basis of portions of the 1340 W/m2 composing the solar fl ux. pollutants emitted from a point source such as a power plant stack rise in the atmosphere and are dispersed or settle near the source where they may do maximum harm. Los Angeles largely owes its susceptibility to smog to the meteorology of the Los Angeles basin, which holds hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides long enough to cook up an unpleasant brew of photochemical smog (Chapter 13). Short-term variations in the state of the atmosphere constitute weather defined in terms of seven closely interrelated major factors: temperature, clouds, winds, humidity, horizontal visibility (as affected by fog, etc.), type and quantity of precipitation, and atmospheric pressure. Longer-term variations and trends within a particular geographical region in those factors that compose weather are described as climate, a term defined and discussed in Section 9.6. 9.5.1 ATMOSPHERIC WATER IN ENERGY AND MASS TRANSFER The driving force behind weather and climate is the distribution and ultimate reradiation to space of solar energy. A large fraction of solar energy is converted to latent heat by evaporation of water into the atmosphere. As water condenses from atmospheric air, large quantities of heat are released. This is a particularly significant means for transferring energy from the ocean to land. Solar energy falling on the ocean is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water, then the water vapor moves inland where it condenses. The latent heat released when the water condenses warms the surrounding land mass. Atmospheric water can be present as vapor, liquid, or ice. The water vapor content of air can be expressed as humidity. Relative humidity, expressed as a percentage, describes the amount of water vapor in the air as a ratio of the maximum amount that the air can hold at that temperature. Air with a given relative humidity can undergo any of several processes to reach the saturation point at which water vapor condenses in the form of rain or snow. For this condensation to happen, air must be cooled below a temperature called the dew point, and condensation nuclei must be present. These nuclei are hygroscopic substances such as salts, sulfuric acid droplets, and some organic materials, including bacterial cells. Air pollution in some forms is an important source of condensation nuclei. The liquid water in the atmosphere is present largely in clouds. Clouds normally form when rising, adiabatically cooling air can no longer hold water in the vapor form and the water forms very small aerosol droplets. Clouds may be classified into three major forms. Cirrus clouds occur at great altitudes and have a thin feathery appearance.", "Cumulus clouds are detached masses with a fl at base and frequently a \u201cbumpy\u201d upper structure. Stratus clouds occur in large sheets and may cover all of the sky visible from a given point as overcast. Clouds are important absorbers and refl ectors of radiation (heat). Their formation is affected by the products of human activities, especially particulate matter pollution and emission of deliquescent gases such as SO2 and HCl. Some atmospheric chemical processes occur in solution in cloud droplets and crystalline ice particles in stratospheric clouds act as reservoirs for ozone-destroying chlorine species (see Section 14.5). The formation of precipitation from the very small droplets of water that compose clouds is a complicated and important process. Cloud droplets normally take somewhat longer than a minute to form by condensation. They average about 0.04 mm across and do not exceed 0.2 mm in diameter. Raindrops range from 0.5 to 4 mm in diameter. Condensation processes do not form particles large enough to fall as precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or hail). The small condensation droplets must collide and coalesce to form precipitation-size particles. When droplets reach a threshold diameter of about 0.04 mm, they grow more rapidly by coalescence with other particles than by condensation of water vapor. 9.5.2 AIR MASSES Distinct air masses are a major feature of the troposphere. These air masses are uniform and horizontally homogeneous. Their temperature and water vapor content are particularly uniform. These characteristics are determined by the nature of the surface over which a large air mass forms. Polar continental air masses form over cold land regions; polar maritime air masses form over polar oceans. Air masses originating in the tropics may be similarly classified as tropical continental air masses or tropical maritime air masses. The movement of air masses and the conditions in them may have important effects on pollutant reactions, effects, and dispersal. Solar energy received by Earth is largely redistributed by the movement of huge masses of air with different pressures, temperatures, and moisture contents separated by boundaries called fronts. Horizontally moving air is called wind, whereas vertically moving air is referred to as an air current. Atmospheric air moves constantly, with behavior and effects that reflect the laws governing the behavior of gases. First of all, gases will move horizontally and/or vertically from regions of high atmospheric pressure to those of low atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, expansion of gases causes cooling, whereas compression causes warming. A mass of warm air tends to move from the Earth\u2019s surface to higher altitudes where the pressure is lower; in so doing, it expands adiabatically (i.e., without exchanging energy with its surroundings) and becomes cooler. If there is no condensation of moisture from the air, the cooling effect is about 10\u221eC/1000 m of altitude, a fi gure known as the dry adiabatic lapse rate. A cold mass of air at a higher altitude does the opposite; it sinks and becomes warmer at about 10\u221eC/1000 m. Often, however, when there is sufficient moisture in rising air, water condenses from it, releasing latent heat. This partially counteracts the cooling effect of the expanding air, giving a moist adiabatic lapse rate of about 6\u221eC/1000 m. Parcels of air do not rise and fall, or even move horizontally in a completely uniform way, but exhibit eddies, currents, and various degrees of turbulence. As noted above, wind is air moving horizontally, whereas air currents are created by air moving up or down. Wind occurs because of differences in air pressure from high-pressure regions to low-pressure areas. Air currents are largely convection currents formed by differential heating of air masses. Air that is over a solar heated land mass is warmed, becomes less dense, and therefore rises and is replaced by cooler and more dense air. Wind and air currents are strongly involved with air pollution phenomena. Wind carries and disperses air pollutants. In some cases the absence of wind can enable pollutants to collect in a region and undergo processes that lead to even more (secondary) pollutants. Prevailing wind direction is an important factor in determining the areas most affected by an air pollution source. Wind is an important renewable energy resource (see Chapter 18). Furthermore, wind plays an important role in the propagation of life by dispersing spores, seeds, and organisms, such as spiders. 9.5.3 TOPOGRAPHICAL EFFECTS Topography, the surface configuration and relief features of the Earth\u2019s surface may strongly affect winds and air currents.", "Differential heating and cooling of land surfaces and bodies of water can result in local convective winds, including land breezes and sea breezes at different times of the day along the seashore, as well as breezes associated with large bodies of water inland. Mountain topography causes complex and variable localized winds. The masses of air in mountain valleys heat up during the day causing upslope winds, and cool off at night causing downslope winds. Upslope winds flow over ridge tops in mountainous regions. The blocking of wind and of masses of air by mountain formations some distance inland from seashores can trap bodies of air, particularly when temperature inversion conditions occur (see Section 9.6). 9.5.4 MOVEMENT OF AIR MASSES Basically, weather is the result of the interactive effects of (1) redistribution of solar energy, (2) horizontal and vertical movement of air masses with varying moisture contents, and (3) evaporation and condensation of water, accompanied by uptake and release of heat. To see how these factors determine weather\u2014and ultimately climate\u2014on a global scale, first consider the cycle illustrated in Figure 9.5. This figure shows solar energy being absorbed by a body of water and causing some water to evaporate. The warm, moist mass of air thus produced moves from a region of high pressure to one of low pressure, and cools by expansion as it rises in what is called a convection column. As the air cools, water condenses from it and energy is released; this is a major pathway by which energy is transferred from the Earth\u2019s surface to high in the atmosphere. As a result of condensation Energy released bycondensation of water FIGURE 9.5 Circulation patterns involved with movement of air masses and water; uptake and release of solar energy as latent heat in water vapor. of water and loss of energy, the air is converted from warm, moist air to cool, dry air. Furthermore, the movement of the parcel of air to high altitudes results in a degree of \u201ccrowding\u201d of air molecules and creates a zone of relatively high pressure high in the troposphere at the top of the convection column. This air mass, in turn, moves from the upper-level region of high pressure to one of low pressure; in so doing, it subsides, thus creating an upper-level low-pressure zone, and becomes warm, dry air in the process. The pileup of this air at the surface creates a surface high-pressure zone where the cycle described above began. The warm, dry air in this surface high-pressure zone again picks up moisture, and the cycle begins again. 9.5.5 GLOBAL WEATHER The factors discussed above that determine and describe the movement of air masses are involved in the massive movement of air, moisture, and energy that occurs globally. The central feature of global weather is the redistribution of solar energy that falls unequally on Earth at different latitudes (relative distances from the equator and poles). Consider Figure 9.6. Sunlight, and the energy fl ux from it, is most intense at the equator because, averaged over the seasons, solar radiation comes in perpendicular to the Earth\u2019s surface at the equator. With increasing distance from the equator (higher latitudes) the angle is increasingly oblique and more of the energy-absorbing atmosphere must be traversed, so that progressively less energy is received per unit area of the Earth\u2019s surface. The net result is that equatorial regions receive a much greater share of solar radiation, progressively less is Ascending Descending received farther from the equator, and the poles receive a comparatively miniscule amount. The excess heat energy in the equatorial regions causes the air to rise. The air ceases to rise when it reaches the stratosphere because in the stratosphere the air becomes warmer with higher elevation. As the hot equatorial air rises in the troposphere, it cools by expansion and loss of water, and then sinks again. The air circulation patterns in which this occurs are called Hadley cells. As shown in Figure 9.6, there are three major groupings of these cells, which result in very distinct climatic regions on the Earth\u2019s surface. The air in the Hadley cells does not move straight north and south, but is deflected by the Earth\u2019s rotation and by contact with the rotating Earth; this is the Coriolis effect, which results in spiral-shaped air circulation patterns called cyclonic or anticyclonic, depending on the direction of rotation. These give rise to different directions of prevailing winds, depending on latitude.", "The boundaries between the massive bodies of circulating air shift markedly over time and season, resulting in significant weather instability. The movement of air in Hadley cells combined with other atmospheric phenomena results in the development of massive jet streams that are, in a sense, shifting rivers of air that may be several kilometers deep and several tens of kilometers wide. Jet streams move through discontinuities in the tropopause (see Section 9.3), generally from west to east at velocities around 200 km/h (well over 100 mph); in so doing, they redistribute huge amounts of air and have a strong influence on weather patterns. The air and wind circulation patterns described above shift massive amounts of energy over long distances on Earth. If it were not for this effect, the equatorial regions would be unbearably hot, and the regions closer to the poles intolerably cold. About half of the heat that is redistributed is carried as sensible heat by air circulation, almost one-third is carried by water vapor as latent heat, and the remaining approximately 20% by ocean currents. 9.5.6 WEATHER FRONTS AND STORMS As noted earlier, the interface between two masses of air that differ in temperature, density, and water content is called a front. A mass of cold air moving such that it displaces one of warm air is a cold front, and a mass of warm air displacing one of cold air is a warm front. Since cold air is more dense than warm air, the air in a cold mass of air along a cold front pushes under warmer air. This causes the warm, moist air to rise such that water condenses from it. The condensation of water releases energy, so the air rises further. The net effect can be the formation of massive cloud formations (thunderheads) that may reach stratospheric levels. These spectacular thunderheads may produce heavy rainfall and even hail, and sometimes violent storms with strong winds, including tornadoes. Warm fronts cause somewhat similar effects such as warm, moist air pushes over colder air. However, the front is usually much broader, and the weather effects milder, typically resulting in widespread drizzle rather than intense rainstorms. Swirling cyclonic storms, such as typhoons, hurricanes, and tornadoes, are created in low-pressure areas by rising masses of warm, moist air. As such air cools, water vapor condenses, and the latent heat released warms the air more, sustaining and intensifying its movement upward in the atmosphere. Air rising from surface level creates a low-pressure zone into which surrounding air moves. The movement of the incoming air assumes a spiral pattern, thus causing a cyclonic storm. 9.6 INVERSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION The complicated movement of air across the Earth\u2019s surface is a crucial factor in the creation and dispersal of air pollution phenomena. When air movement ceases, stagnation can occur with a resultant buildup of atmospheric pollutants in localized regions. Although the temperature of air relatively near the Earth\u2019s surface normally decreases with increasing altitude, certain atmospheric conditions can result in the opposite condition\u2014increasing temperature with increasing altitude. Such conditions are characterized by high atmospheric stability and are known as temperature inversions. Because they limit the vertical circulation of air, temperature inversions result in air stagnation and the trapping of air pollutants in localized areas. Inversions can occur in several ways. An inversion can form when a warm air mass overrides a cold air mass. Radiation inversions are likely to form in still air at night when Earth is no longer receiving solar radiation. The air closest to Earth cools faster than the air higher in the atmosphere, which remains warm, thus less dense. Furthermore, cooler surface air tends to fl ow into valleys at night, where it is overlain by warmer, less dense air. Subsidence inversions, often widespread and accompanied by radiation inversions, can form in the vicinity of a surface high-pressure area when high-level air subsides to take the place of surface air blowing out of the high-pressure zone. The subsiding air is warmed as it compresses and can remain as a warm layer several hundred meters above ground level. A marine inversion is produced during the summer months when cool air laden with moisture from the ocean blows onshore and under warm, dry inland air. As noted above, inversions contribute significantly to the effects of air pollution because, as shown in Figure 9.7, they prevent mixing of air pollutants, thus keeping the pollutants in one area.", "This not only prevents the pollutants from escaping, but also acts like a container in which additional pollutants accumulate. Furthermore, in the case of secondary pollutants formed by atmospheric chemical processes, such as photochemical smog (see Chapter 13), the pollutants may be kept together such that they react with each other and with sunlight to produce even more noxious products. 9.7 GLOBAL CLIMATE AND MICROCLIMATE Perhaps the single most important influence on the Earth\u2019s environment is climate, consisting of long-term weather patterns over large geographical areas. As a general rule, climatic conditions are characteristic of a particular region. This does not mean that climate remains the same throughout the year, of course, because it varies with season. One important example of such variation is the monsoon, seasonal variations in wind patterns between oceans and continents accompanied by alternate periods of high and low rainfall. The climates of Africa and the Indian subcontinent are particularly influenced by monsoons. Summer monsoon rains are responsible for tropical rain Confining topography Warmer forests in Central Africa. The interface between this region and the Sahara Desert varies over time. When the boundary is relatively far north, rain falls on the Sahel desert region at the interface, crops grow, and the people do relatively well. When the boundary is more to the south, a condition that may last for several years, devastating droughts and even starvation may occur. It is known that there are fluctuations, cycles, and cycles imposed on cycles in climate. The causes of these variations are not completely understood, but they are known to be substantial, and even devastating to civilization. The last ice age, which ended only about 10,000 years ago and which was preceded by several similar ice ages, produced conditions under which much of the present land mass of the northern hemisphere was buried under thick layers of ice and were uninhabitable. A \u201cmini-ice age\u201d occurred during the 1300s, causing crop failures and severe hardship in northern Europe. In modern times the El-Ni\u00f1o-Southern oscillation occurs with a period of several years when a large, semipermanent tropical low-pressure area shifts into the Central Pacifi c region from its more common location in the vicinity of Indonesia. This shift modifies prevailing winds, changes the pattern of ocean currents, and affects upwelling of ocean nutrients with profound effects on weather, rainfall, and fish and bird life over a vast area of the Pacific from Australia to the west coasts of South and North America. 9.7.1 ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE AND HUMAN MODIFICATIONS OF CLIMATE Although the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is huge and has an enormous ability to resist and correct for detrimental change, it is likely that human activities are reaching a point at which they are signifi cantly affecting climate. One such way is by emission of large quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, with the potential to cause global warming and substantial climatic change. It is known that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increasing by about 2 ppm volume per year and are on track to more than double from preindustrial levels during the current century. Furthermore, global temperatures during recent decades have increased measurably, consistent with models of global warming from atmospheric greenhouse gases. The infl uence of atmospheric carbon dioxide on global temperatures and possible impacts on climate are discussed in more detail in Section 14.2. 9.7.2 MICROCLIMATE The preceding section described climate on a large scale, ranging up to global dimensions. The climate that organisms and objects on the surface are exposed to close to the ground, under rocks, and surrounded by vegetation is often quite different from the surrounding macroclimate. Such highly localized climatic conditions are termed the microclimate. Microclimate effects are largely determined by the uptake and loss of solar energy very close to the Earth\u2019s surface, and by the fact that air circulation due to wind is much lower at the surface. During the day, solar energy absorbed by relatively bare soil heats the surface, but is lost only slowly because of very limited air circulation at the surface. This provides a warm blanket of surface air several centimeters thick, and an even thinner layer of warm soil. At night, radiative loss of heat from the surface of soil and vegetation can result in surface temperatures several degrees colder than the air about 2 m above ground level. These lower temperatures result in condensation of dew on vegetation and the soil surface, thus providing a relatively more moist microclimate near ground level.", "Heat absorbed during early morning evaporation of the dew tends to prolong the period of cold experienced right at the surface. Vegetation substantially affects microclimate. In relatively dense growths, circulation may be virtually zero at the surface because vegetation severely limits convection and diffusion. The crown surface of the vegetation intercepts most of the solar energy, so that maximum solar heating may be a significant distance up from the Earth\u2019s surface. The region below the crown surface of vegetation thus becomes one of relatively stable temperature. In addition, in a dense growth of vegetation, most of the moisture loss is not from evaporation from the soil surface, but rather from transpiration from plant leaves. The net result is the creation of temperature and humidity conditions that provide a favorable living environment for a number of organisms, such as insects and rodents. Another factor influencing microclimate is the degree to which the slope of land faces north or south. South-facing slopes of land in the northern hemisphere receive greater solar energy. Advantage has been taken of this phenomenon in restoring land strip-mined for brown coal in Germany by terracing the land such that the terraces have broad south slopes and very narrow north slopes. On the south-sloping portions of the terrace, the net effect has been to extend the short summer growing season by several days, thereby significantly increasing crop productivity. In areas where the growing season is longer, better growing conditions may exist on a north slope because it is less subject to temperature extremes and to loss of water by evaporation and transpiration. 9.7.3 EFFECTS OF URBANIZATION ON MICROCLIMATE A particularly marked effect on microclimate is that induced by urbanization. In a rural setting, vegetation and bodies of water have a moderating effect, absorbing modest amounts of solar energy and releasing it slowly. The stone, concrete, and asphalt pavement of cities have an opposite effect, strongly absorbing solar energy, and reradiating heat back to the urban microclimate. Rainfall is not allowed to accumulate in ponds, but is drained away as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Human activities generate significant amounts of heat, and produce large quantities of CO2 and other greenhouse gases that retain heat. The net result of these effects is that a city is capped by a heat dome in which the temperature is as much as 5\u221eC warmer than in the surrounding rural areas, such that large cities have been described as \u201cheat islands.\u201d The rising warmer air over a city brings in a breeze from the surrounding area and causes a local greenhouse effect that probably is largely counter balanced by reflection of incoming solar energy by particulate matter above cities. Overall, compared to climatic conditions in nearby rural surroundings, the city microclimate is warmer, foggier, and overlain with more cloud cover a greater percentage of the time, and is subject to more precipitation, though generally less humid. 9.8 CHEMICAL AND PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTIONS IN THE ATMOSPHERE Figure 9.8 represents some of the major atmospheric chemical processes, which are discussed under the topic of atmospheric chemistry. Several key concepts of atmospheric chemistry that are important for this discussion were defined at the beginning of the chapter. These include the energy of a photon, hn, the excited state, often designated with an asterisk, *, free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211, and energy absorbing third bodies denoted M. The atmosphere is a huge, variable \u201claboratory\u201d in which the study of chemical processes is very challenging. One of the primary obstacles encountered in studying atmospheric chemistry is that the chemist generally must deal with incredibly low concentrations, so that the detection and analysis of reaction products is quite difficult (see Chapter 26). Simulating high-altitude conditions in the laboratory can be extremely hard because of interferences, such as those from species given off from container walls under conditions of very low pressure. Many chemical reactions that require a third body to absorb excess energy occur very slowly in the upper atmosphere where there is a sparse concentration of third bodies, but occur readily in a container whose walls effectively absorb energy. Container walls may serve as catalysts for some important reactions, or they may absorb important species and react chemically with the more reactive ones. Atmospheric chemistry involves the unpolluted atmosphere, highly polluted atmospheres, and a wide range of gradations in between. The same general phenomena govern all and produce one huge atmospheric cycle in which there are numerous subcycles.", "Gaseous atmospheric chemical species fall into the following somewhat arbitrary and overlapping classifi cations: inorganic oxides (CO, CO2, NO2, SO2), oxidants (O3, H2O2, HO\u2211 radical, HO2 \u2211 radical, ROO\u2211 radicals, NO3), reductants (CO, SO2, H2S), organics (also reductants; in the unpolluted atmosphere, CH4 is the predominant organic species, whereas alkanes, alkenes, and aryl compounds are common around sources of organic pollution), oxidized organic species (carbonyls, organic nitrates), photochemically active species (NO2, formaldehyde), acids (H2SO4), bases (NH3), salts (NH4HSO4), and unstable reactive species (electronically excited NO*,2 HO\u2211 radical). In addition, both solid and liquid particles in atmospheric aerosols and clouds play a strong role in atmospheric chemistry as sources and sinks for gas-phase species, as sites for surface reactions (solid particles) and as bodies for aqueous-phase reactions (liquid droplets). Two constituents of utmost importance in atmospheric chemistry are radiant energy from the sun, predominantly in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and the hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211. The former provides a way to pump a high level of energy into a single gas molecule to start a series of atmospheric chemical reactions, and the latter is the most important reactive intermediate and \u201ccurrency\u201d of daytime atmospheric chemical phenomena; NO3 radicals are important intermediates in nightime atmospheric chemistry. These are addressed in more detail in this chapter and Chapters 10 through 14. Of particular importance in atmospheric chemistry is the discipline of chemical kinetics, which deals with rates of reactions. A detailed discussion of the kinetics of atmospheric chemical processes is beyond the scope of this book and the reader is referred to other sources, such as those listed in the supplementary references at the end of this chapter. The rate constants, which describe chemical reaction rates, vary widely and are important tools for the atmospheric chemist to describe and explain atmospheric chemical processes. Uncertainties still exist regarding the values of particular rate constants. 9.8.1 PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESSES The absorption by chemical species of light, broadly defined here to include ultraviolet radiation from the sun, can bring about reactions, called photochemical reactions, which do not otherwise occur under the conditions (particularly the temperature) of the medium in the absence of light. Thus, photochemical reactions, even in the absence of a chemical catalyst, occur at temperatures much lower than those which otherwise would be required. Photochemical reactions, which are induced by intense solar radiation, play a very important role in determining the nature and ultimate fate of a chemical species in the atmosphere. Nitrogen dioxide, NO2, is one of the most photochemically active species found in a polluted atmosphere and is an essential participant in the smog-formation process. A species such as NO2 may absorb light of energy hn, producing an electronically excited molecule, NO2 + hn\u00c6 NO*2 (9.7) designated in the reaction above by an asterisk, *. The photochemistry of nitrogen dioxide is discussed in greater detail in Chapters 11 and 13. Electronically excited molecules compose one of the three kinds of relatively reactive and unstable species that are encountered in the atmosphere and are strongly involved with atmospheric chemical processes. The other two species are atoms or molecular fragments with unshared electrons, called free radicals, and ions consisting of electrically charged atoms or molecular fragments. Electronically excited molecules are produced when stable molecules absorb energetic electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet or visible regions of the spectrum. A molecule may possess several possible excited states, but generally ultraviolet or visible radiation is energetic enough to excite molecules only to several of the lowest energy levels. The nature of the excited state may be understood by considering the disposition of electrons in a molecule. Most molecules have an even number of electrons. The electrons occupy orbitals, with a maximum of two electrons with opposite spin occupying the same orbital. The absorption of light may promote one of these electrons to a vacant orbital of higher energy. In some cases the electron thus promoted retains a spin opposite to that of its former partner, giving rise to an excited singlet state. In other cases the spin of the promoted electron is reversed, such that it has the same spin as its former partner; this gives rise to an excited triplet state. Ground Singlet Triplet state state state The chemical species in excited states are relatively energized compared to the ground state and are chemically reactive species. Their participation in atmospheric chemical reactions, such as those involved in smog formation, will be discussed later in detail.", "In order for a photochemical reaction to occur, light must be absorbed by the reacting species. If the absorbed light is in the visible region of the sun\u2019s spectrum, the absorbing species is colored. Colored NO2 is a common example of such a species in the atmosphere. Normally, the first step in a photochemical process is the activation of the molecule by the absorption of a single unit of photochemical energy characteristic of the frequency of the light called a quantum of light. The energy of one quantum is equal to the product hn, where h is Planck\u2019s constant, 6.63 \u00a5 10-34 Js (6.63 \u00a5 10-27 ergs), and n is the frequency of the absorbed light in s -1 (inversely proportional to its wavelength, l). The reactions that occur following absorption of a photon of light to produce an electronically excited species are largely determined by the way in which the excited species loses its excess energy. This may occur by one of the following processes. \u2022 Loss of energy to another molecule or atom (M) by physical quenching, followed by dissipation of the energy as heat O*2 + M \u00c6 O2 + M (higher translational energy) (9.8) \u2022 Dissociation of the excited molecule (the process responsible for the predominance of atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere) O*2 \u00c6 O + O (9.9) \u2022 Direct reaction with another species O*2 + O3 \u00c6 2O2 + O (9.10) \u2022 Luminescence consisting of loss of energy by the emission of electromagnetic radiation NO*2 \u00c6 NO2 + hn (9.11) If the re-emission of light is almost instantaneous, luminescence is called fl uorescence, and if it is significantly delayed, the phenomenon is phosphorescence. Chemiluminescence is said to occur when the excited species (such as NO*2 below) is formed by a chemical process: O3 + NO \u00c6 NO*2 + O2 (higher energy) (9.12) \u2022 Intermolecular energy transfer in which an excited species transfers energy to another species which then becomes excited O*2 + Na \u00c6 O2 + Na* (9.13) A subsequent reaction by the second species is called a photosensitized reaction. \u2022 Intramolecular transfer in which energy is transferred within a molecule \u2022 Photoionization through loss of an electron XY* \u00c6 XY\u2020 (\u2020 denotes another excited state of the same molecule) (9.14) N*2 \u00c6 N2 ++ e - (9.15) Electromagnetic radiation absorbed in the infrared region lacks the energy to break chemical bonds, but does cause the receptor molecules to gain vibrational and rotational energy. The energy absorbed as infrared radiation ultimately is dissipated as heat and raises the temperature of the whole atmosphere. As noted in Section 9.3, the absorption of infrared radiation is very important in the Earth\u2019s acquiring heat from the sun and in the retention of energy radiated from the Earth\u2019s surface. 9.8.2 IONS AND RADICALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE One of the characteristics of the upper atmosphere which is difficult to duplicate under laboratory conditions is the presence of significant levels of electrons and positive ions. Because of the rarefi ed conditions, these ions may exist in the upper atmosphere for long periods before recombining to form neutral species. At altitudes of approximately 50 km and up, ions are so prevalent that the region is called the ionosphere. The presence of the ionosphere has been known since about 1901, when it was discovered that radio waves could be transmitted over long distances where the curvature of Earth makes line-of-sight transmission impossible. These radio waves bounce off the ionosphere. Ultraviolet light is the primary producer of ions in the ionosphere. In darkness, the positive ions slowly recombine with free electrons. The process is more rapid in the lower regions of the ionosphere where the concentration of species is relatively high. Thus, the lower limit of the ionosphere lifts at night and makes possible the transmission of radio waves over much greater distances. The Earth\u2019s magnetic field has a strong influence on the ions in the upper atmosphere. Probably the best-known manifestation of this phenomenon is found in the Van Allen belts, discovered in 1958 consisting of two belts of ionized particles encircling the Earth. They can be visualized as two doughnuts with the axis of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field extending through the holes in the doughnuts. The inner belt consists of protons and the outer belt consists of electrons. A schematic diagram of the Van Allen belts is shown in Figure 9.9.", "Although ions are produced in the upper atmosphere primarily by the action of energetic electromagnetic radiation, they may also be produced in the troposphere by the shearing of water droplets Outer belt Inner belt Earth Axis of magnetic field during precipitation. The shearing may be caused by the compression of descending masses of cold air or by strong winds over hot, dry land masses. The last phenomenon is known as the foehn, sharav (in the Near East), or Santa Ana (in southern California). These hot, dry winds cause severe discomfort. The ions they produce consist of electrons and positively charged molecular species. 9.8.2.1 Free Radicals In addition to forming ions by photoionization, energetic electromagnetic radiation in the atmosphere may produce atoms or groups of atoms with unpaired electrons called free radicals: OO H3CCH+ H3C+ (9.16) hn \u2022\u2022CH Free radicals are involved with most significant atmospheric chemical phenomena and are of utmost importance in the atmosphere. Because of their unpaired electrons and the strong pairing tendencies of electrons under most circumstances, free radicals are highly reactive. The upper atmosphere is so rarefied, however, that at very high altitudes radicals may have half-lives of several minutes, or even longer. Radicals can take part in chain reactions in which one of the products of each reaction is a radical. Eventually, through processes such as reaction with another radical, one of the radicals in a chain is destroyed and the chain ends: H3C\u2211+ H3C\u2211\u00c6 C2H6 (9.17) This process is a chain-terminating reaction. Reactions involving free radicals are responsible for smog formation, discussed in Chapter 13. Free radicals are quite reactive; therefore, they generally have short lifetimes. It is important to distinguish between high reactivity and instability. A totally isolated free radical or atom would be quite stable. Therefore, free radicals and single atoms from diatomic gases tend to persist under the rarefied conditions of very high altitudes because they can travel long distances before colliding with another reactive species. However, electronically excited species have a fi nite, generally very short lifetime because they can lose energy through radiation without having to react with another species. 9.8.3 HYDROXYL AND HYDROPEROXYL RADICALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE As illustrated in Figure 9.10, the hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211, is the single most important reactive intermediate species in atmospheric chemical processes. It is formed by several mechanisms. At higher altitudes it is produced by photolysis of water: H2O + hn\u00c6 HO\u2211+ H (9.18) In the presence of organic matter, hydroxyl radical is produced in abundant quantities as an intermediate in the formation of photochemical smog (see Chapter 13). To a certain extent in the atmosphere, and for laboratory experimentation, HO\u2211 is made by the photolysis of nitrous acid vapor: HONO + hn\u00c6 HO\u2211+ NO (9.19) Hydroxyl radical is also generated by photodissociation of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, the most important oxidant in solution in atmospheric particles of fog, cloud, or rain: H2O2 + hn\u00c6 HO\u2211+ HO\u2211 (9.20) Several steps Several steps FIGURE 9.10 Control of trace gas concentrations by HO\u2211 radical in the troposphere. Processes below the dashed line are those largely involved in controlling the concentrations of HO\u2211 in the troposphere; those above the line control the concentrations of the associated reactants and products. Reservoirs of atmospheric species are shown in circles, reactions denoting conversion of one species to another are shown by arrows, and the reactants or photons needed to bring about a particular conversion are shown along the arrows. Hydrogen halides are denoted by HX and hydrocarbons by HxYy. (Reprinted from D.D. Davis and W.L. Chameides, Chemistry in the troposphere, Chemical and Engineering News, October 4, 1982, pp. 39\u201352. With permission.) In the relatively unpolluted troposphere, hydroxyl radical is produced as a result of photolysis of ozone: O3 + hn(l<315 nm) \u00c6 O* + O2 (9.21) followed by the reaction of a fraction of the excited oxygen atoms with water molecules: O* + H2O \u00c6 2HO\u2211 (9.22) Involvement of the hydroxyl radical in chemical transformations of a number of trace species in the atmosphere is summarized in Figure 9.10, and some of the pathways illustrated are discussed in later chapters. Among the important atmospheric trace species that react with hydroxyl radical are carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and nitric oxide. Hydroxyl radical is most frequently removed from the troposphere by reaction with methane or carbon monoxide: CH4 +HO\u2211\u00c6H3C\u2211+H2O (9.23) CO +HO\u2211\u00c6CO2 +H (9.24)", "The highly reactive methyl radical, H3C\u2211, reacts with O2, H3C\u2211+O2 \u00c6H3COO\u2211 (9.25) to form methylperoxyl radical, H3COO\u2211. (Further reactions of this species are discussed in Chapter 13.) The hydrogen atom produced in Reaction 9.24 reacts with O2 to produce hydroperoxyl radical: H +O2 \u00c6 HOO\u2211 (9.26) The hydroperoxyl radical can undergo chain termination reactions, such as HOO\u2211+HO\u2211\u00c6H2O +O2 (9.27) HOO\u2211+ HOO\u2211\u00c6H2O2 +O2 (9.28) or reactions that regenerate hydroxyl radical: HOO\u2211+NO \u00c6NO2 +HO\u2211 (9.29) HOO\u2211+O3 \u00c62O2 +HO\u2211 (9.30) The global concentration of hydroxyl radical, averaged diurnally and seasonally, is estimated to range from 2 \u00a5105 to 1 \u00a5106 radicals per cm3 in the troposphere. Because of the higher humidity and higher incident sunlight which result in elevated O* levels, the concentration of HO\u2211 is higher in tropical regions. The southern hemisphere probably has about a 20% higher level of HO\u2211 than does the northern hemisphere because of greater production of anthropogenic, HO\u2211-consuming CO in the northern hemisphere. The hydroperoxyl radical, HOO\u2211, is an intermediate in some important chemical reactions. In addition to its production by the reactions discussed above, in polluted atmospheres, hydroperoxyl radical is made by the following two reactions, starting with photolytic dissociation of formaldehyde to produce a reactive formyl radical: \u2211 HCHO +nh \u00c6H +HCO (9.31) \u2211 HCO +O2 \u00c6HOO\u2211+CO (9.32) The hydroperoxyl radical reacts more slowly with other species than does the hydroxyl radical. The kinetics and mechanisms of hydroperoxyl radical reactions are difficult to study because it is hard to retain these radicals free of hydroxyl radicals. 9.8.4 CHEMICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSES IN EVOLUTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE It is now widely believed that the Earth\u2019s atmosphere originally was very different from its present state and that the changes were brought about by biological activity and accompanying chemical changes. Approximately 3.5 billion years ago, when the first primitive life molecules were formed, the atmosphere was probably free of oxygen and consisted of a variety of gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and perhaps even methane, ammonia, and hydrogen. The atmosphere was bombarded by intense, bond-breaking ultraviolet light which, along with lightning and radiation from radionuclides, provided the energy to bring about chemical reactions that resulted in the production of relatively complicated molecules, including even amino acids and sugars. From the rich chemical mixture in the sea, life molecules evolved. Initially, these very primitive life forms derived their energy from fermentation of organic matter formed by chemical and photochemical processes, but eventually they gained the capability to produce organic matter, \u201c{CH2O},\u201d by photosynthesis: CO2 + H2O + hn\u00c6 {CH2O} + O2(g) (9.33) Photosynthesis released oxygen, thereby setting the stage for the massive biochemical transformation that resulted in the production of almost all the atmosphere\u2019s O2. The oxygen initially produced by photosynthesis was probably quite toxic to primitive life forms. However, much of this oxygen was converted to iron oxides by reaction with soluble iron(II): 4Fe2++ O2 + 4H2O \u00c6 2Fe2O3 + 8H+ (9.34) This resulted in the formation of enormous deposits of iron oxides, the existence of which provides major evidence for the liberation of free oxygen in the primitive atmosphere. Eventually, enzyme systems developed that enabled organisms to mediate the reaction of waste-product oxygen with oxidizable organic matter in the sea. Later, this mode of waste-product disposal was utilized by organisms to produce energy by respiration, which is now the mechanism by which nonphotosynthetic organisms obtain energy. In time, O2 accumulated in the atmosphere, providing an abundant source of oxygen for respiration. It had an additional benefit in that it enabled the formation of an ozone shield (see Section 9.9). The ozone shield absorbs bond-rupturing ultraviolet light. With the ozone shield protecting tissue from destruction by high-energy ultraviolet radiation, Earth became a much more hospitable environment for life, and life forms were enabled to move from the sea to land. 9.9 ACID\u2013BASE REACTIONS IN THE ATMOSPHERE Acid\u2013base reactions occur between acidic and basic species in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is normally at least slightly acidic because of the presence of a low level of carbon dioxide, which dissolves in atmospheric water droplets and dissociates slightly: Water CO2(g) \u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00c6CO2(aq) (9.35) - CO2(aq) + H2O \u00c6 H++ HCO3 (9.36) Atmospheric sulfur dioxide forms a somewhat stronger acid than carbon dioxide when it dissolves in water: - SO2(g) + H2O \u00c6 H++ HSO3 (9.37)", "In terms of pollution, however, strongly acidic HNO3 and H2SO4 formed by the atmospheric oxidation of N oxides, SO2, and H2S are much more important because they lead to the formation of damaging acid rain (see Chapter 14). As reflected by the generally acidic pH of rainwater, basic species are relatively less common in the atmosphere. Particulate calcium oxide, hydroxide, and carbonate can get into the atmosphere from ash and ground rock, and can react with acids such as in the following reaction: Ca(OH)2(s) + H2SO4(aq) \u00c6 CaSO4(s) + 2H2O (9.38) The most important basic species in the atmosphere is gas-phase ammonia, NH3. The major source of atmospheric ammonia is from biodegradation of nitrogen-containing biological matter and from bacterial reduction of nitrate: - NO3(aq) + 2{CH2O}(biomass) + H+\u00c6 NH3(g) + 2CO2 + H2O (9.39) Ammonia is particularly important as a base in the air because it is the only water-soluble base present at significant levels in the atmosphere. Dissolved in atmospheric water droplets, it plays a strong role in neutralizing atmospheric acids: NH3(aq) + HNO3(aq) \u00c6 NH4NO3(aq) (9.40) NH3(aq) + H2SO4(aq) \u00c6 NH4HSO4(aq) (9.41) These reactions have three effects: (1) they result in the presence of NH4 + ion in the atmosphere as dissolved or solid salts, (2) they serve in part to neutralize acidic constituents of the atmosphere, and (3) they produce relatively corrosive ammonium salts. 9.10 REACTIONS OF ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN Some of the primary features of the exchange of oxygen among the atmosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and anthrosphere are summarized in Figure 9.11. The oxygen cycle is critically important in atmospheric chemistry, geochemical transformations, and life processes. Oxygen in the troposphere plays a strong role in processes that occur on the Earth\u2019s surface. Atmospheric oxygen takes part in energy-producing reactions, such as the burning of fossil fuels: CH4 (in natural gas) + 2O2 \u00c6 CO2 + 2H2O (9.42) Atmospheric oxygen is utilized by aerobic organisms in the degradation of organic material. Some oxidative weathering processes of minerals (see Section 15.2) consume oxygen, such as 4FeO + O2 \u00c6 2Fe2O3 (9.43) Oxygen is returned to the atmosphere through plant photosynthesis: CO2 + H2O + hn \u00c6 {CH2O} + O2 (9.44) All molecular oxygen now in the atmosphere is thought to have originated through the action of photosynthetic organisms, which shows the importance of photosynthesis in the oxygen balance of the atmosphere. It can be shown that most of the carbon fixed by these photosynthetic processes is dispersed in mineral formations as humic material (Section 3.17); only a very small fraction is deposited in fossil fuel beds. Therefore, although combustion of fossil fuels consumes large amounts of O2, there is no danger of running out of atmospheric oxygen.

The nitrogen cycle and nitrogen fixation by microorganisms were discussed in Chapter 6. A small amount of nitrogen is fixed in the atmosphere by lightning, and some is also fixed by combustion processes, particularly in internal combustion and turbine engines. Unlike oxygen, which is almost completely dissociated to the monatomic form in higher regions of the thermosphere, molecular nitrogen is not readily dissociated by ultraviolet radiation. However, at altitudes exceeding approximately 100 km, atomic nitrogen is produced by photochemical reactions: N2 + hn\u00c6 N + N (9.45) Several reactions of ionic species in the ionosphere may generate N atoms as well. The N2 + ion is generated by photoionization in the atmosphere: N2 + hn\u00c6 N2 ++ e -(9.46) and may react to form other ions. The NO+ ion is one of the predominant ionic species in the so-called E region of the ionosphere. Pollutant oxides of nitrogen, particularly NO2, are key species involved in air pollution and the formation of photochemical smog.", "For example, NO2 is readily dissociated photochemically to NO and reactive atomic oxygen: NO2 + hn\u00c6 NO + O (9.47) This reaction is the most important primary photochemical process involved in smog formation. The roles played by nitrogen oxides in smog formation and other forms of air pollution are discussed in Chapters 11 through 14. 9.12 ATMOSPHERIC WATER The water vapor content of the troposphere is normally within a range of 1\u20133% by volume with a global average of about 1%. However, air can contain as little as 0.1% or as much as 5% water. The percentage of water in the atmosphere decreases rapidly with increasing altitude. Water circulates through the atmosphere in the hydrologic cycle as shown in Figure 3.1. Water vapor absorbs infrared radiation even more strongly than does carbon dioxide, thus greatly influencing the Earth\u2019s heat balance. Clouds formed from water vapor reflect light from the sun and have a temperature-lowering effect. On the other hand, water vapor in the atmosphere acts as a kind of \u201cblanket\u201d at night, retaining heat from the Earth\u2019s surface by absorption of infrared radiation. As discussed in Section 9.5, water vapor and the heat released and absorbed by transitions of water between the vapor state and liquid or solid are strongly involved in atmospheric energy transfer. Condensed water vapor in the form of very small droplets is of considerable concern in atmospheric chemistry. The harmful effects of some air pollutants\u2014for instance, the corrosion of metals by acid-forming gases\u2014requires the presence of water which may come from the atmosphere. Atmospheric water vapor has an important influence on pollution-induced fog formation under some circumstances. Water vapor interacting with pollutant particulate matter in the atmosphere may reduce visibility to undesirable levels through the formation of very small atmospheric aerosol particles. As noted in Section 9.2, the cold tropopause serves as a barrier to the movement of water into the stratosphere. Thus, little water is transferred from the troposphere to the stratosphere, and the main source of water in the stratosphere is the photochemical oxidation of methane: CH + 2O + hn \u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00c6 CO + 2H O (9.48) 4 2 several steps 2 2 The water produced by this reaction serves as a source of stratospheric hydroxyl radical as shown by the following reaction: H2O + hn\u00c6 HO\u2211+ H (9.49) 9.13 INFLUENCE OF THE ANTHROSPHERE Human activities have had an enormous influence on the atmosphere and atmospheric chemistry. Agricultural, industrial, and transportation activities have substantially altered the composition of trace gases in the atmosphere. These effects are particularly pronounced in the area of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane in particular) that may lead to global warming and in alteration of levels of ozone in both the troposphere and stratosphere. Emissions of NO from industrial and transportation sources, and perhaps most importantly from biomass burning, have led to significant increases in tropospheric ozone in mid- and low latitudes, where it is an undesirable air pollutant. Emissions of CFCs (freons) have caused decreases of ozone in the stratosphere, particularly in the Antarctic, where it serves a vital protective function against ultraviolet radiation. Although the atmosphere has a substantial ability to cleanse itself of harmful pollutants by oxidizing them, this ability is being overtaxed in important respects. Of particular concern for the future are growing emissions from sources in developing countries. 9.14 CHEMICAL FATE AND TRANSPORT IN THE ATMOSPHERE The atmosphere is very much involved in fate and transport processes of environmental chemicals. To understand these processes, it is necessary to consider sources, transport, dispersal, and fluxes of airborne contaminants. Interactions at the atmosphere/surface boundary are important, including fl ow and dispersal of material in the atmosphere over complex terrain, and around surface obstacles, such as trees and buildings. Interactions and interchange with surface media including rock and soil, water, and vegetation must be considered. Transport and dispersal by advection due to movement of masses of air and diffusive and Fickian transport (Section 1.8) are important considerations as are dispersion, and degradation half-life.1,2 Pollutants in the atmosphere may be viewed on local, long-range, and global scales. Local-scale chemical fate and transport may be viewed with respect to a smokestack point source. As Figure 9.12 illustrates, gases and particles are emitted from a stack and carried and dispersed by wind and air currents while undergoing mixing and dilution. Because stack gases are carried upward by a rising current warmer than the surrounding atmosphere, the effective height of a stack is always greater than its actual height.", "The farther from the stack source before pollutants reach ground level, the more dilute they are. The dispersion of pollutants is strongly infl uenced by atmospheric conditions such as wind, air turbulence, and the occurrence of temperature inversions (Figure 9.7). High stacks reduce the immediate impact of air pollutants and illustrate the once-prevailing philosophy that \u201cThe solution to pollution is dilution.\u201d Long-range transport of species in the atmosphere is an important aspect of air pollution. One illustration of long-range transport of air pollutants was the contamination of much of Europe including northern reaches of Scandinavia by radionuclides emitted in the Chernobyl nuclear reactor meltdown and fi re. New England and southeastern Canada are affected by acid rainfall originating from sulfur dioxide emitted by power plants in the U.S. Ohio River Valley hundreds of kilometers distant. Modeling long-range environmental fate and transport is an important exercise in determining sources of pollutants and mitigating their effects. Such models using sophisticated computer programs and high computing capacity must consider advective transport and mixing phenomena. Very large areas must be considered and averages taken over long time intervals. Weather conditions are important factors. Some important atmospheric pollutants must be considered on a global scale. Such pollutants have very long lifetimes so that they persist long enough to mix with and spread throughout the global atmosphere and they are produced from a variety of widely dispersed sources. An example of such a substance is greenhouse gas carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere by billions of heating and cooking stoves, millions of automobiles, and thousands of power plants throughout the globe. The Earth\u2019s atmosphere cannot be considered as a single large mixing bowl for contaminants on a global scale. Prevailing winds cause relatively rapid mixing within the northern and southern hemisphere, whereas transport of atmospheric constituents across the equator is relatively slow. This phenomenon is illustrated by the discussion in Section 14.2 of atmospheric greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. In the northern hemisphere, which has an abundance of photosynthesizing plants, there is a pronounced annual fluctuation of several ppm in the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the annual seasonal cycle of photosynthesis, whereas the fluctuation is much less pronounced in the southern hemisphere, which has much less photosynthetic activity. Mixing between the two hemispheres over a year\u2019s period of time is insufficient to dampen the fl uctuation, whereas the average concentration of carbon dioxide is essentially the same in both hemispheres refl ecting mixing over several years\u2019 periods of time. An interesting aspect of fate and transport involving the atmosphere is provided by the accumulation of semivolatile POP in polar regions. This phenomenon occurs by a distillation effect in which such pollutants are evaporated in warmer latitudes, carried by air currents toward the poles, and condensed in colder polar regions. As a result, surprisingly high levels of some semivolatile POP (e.g., PCBs in Arctic polar bear fat) have been found in samples from polar regions. Environmental fate and transport involving the atmosphere are obviously important in environmental chemistry and a detailed discussion of this area is beyond the scope of this book.

Atmospheric particles are made up of an amazing variety of materials and discrete objects that may consist of either solids or liquid droplets. A number of terms are commonly used to describe atmospheric particles; the more important of these are summarized in Table 10.1. Particulates is a term that has come to stand for particles in the atmosphere, although particulate matter or simply particles is preferred usage. Particulate matter makes up the most visible and obvious form of air pollution. Atmospheric aerosols are solid or liquid particles smaller than 100 mm in diameter. Pollutant particles in the 0.001\u201310 mm range are commonly suspended in the air near sources of pollution such as the urban atmosphere, industrial plants, highways, and power plants. Very small, solid particles include carbon black, silver iodide, combustion nuclei, and sea-salt nuclei (Figure 10.1). Larger particles include cement dust, wind-blown soil dust, foundry dust, and pulverized coal. Liquid particulate matter, mist, includes raindrops, fog, and sulfuric acid mist. Particulate matter may be organic or inorganic; both types are very important atmospheric contaminants. There are several major sources of particulate matter in the industrialized urban atmosphere.", "These include particles from coal combustion, secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate associated with upwind and local sources of NOx and NH3, secondary organic aerosols produced by chemical processes operating on organic pollutants from a number of sources, and direct emissions from motor vehicle traffic, such as particles from diesel engine exhausts. Some particles are of biological origin, such as viruses, bacteria, bacterial spores, fungal spores, and pollen. In addition to organic materials, organisms may contribute to sulfate particulate matter in the atmosphere. Marine biological sources may contribute significantly to atmospheric aerosols. Biogenic materials reacting in and on the surface of sea-salt aerosols produce some signifi cant atmospheric chemical species, such as halogen radicals, and in so doing influence cycles involving atmospheric sulfur, nitrogen, and oxidants. As discussed later in this chapter, particulate matter originates from a wide variety of sources and processes, ranging from simple grinding of bulk matter to complicated chemical or biochemical syntheses. The effects of particulate matter are also widely varied. Possible effects on climate are discussed in Chapter 14. Either by itself or in combination with gaseous pollutants, particulate matter may be detrimental to human health. Atmospheric particles may damage materials, reduce visibility, and cause undesirable esthetic effects. It is now recognized that very small particles have a particularly high potential for harm, including adverse health effects, and specifi c regulations now apply to particles with a diameter of 2.5 mm or less. For the most part, aerosols consist of carbonaceous material, metal oxides and glasses, dissolved ionic species (electrolytes), and ionic solids. The predominant constituents are carbonaceous material, water, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium nitrogen, and silicon. The composition of aerosol particles varies significantly with size. The very small particles tend to be acidic and often originate from gases, such as from the conversion of SO2 to H2SO4. Larger particles tend to consist of materials generated mechanically, such as by the grinding of limestone, and have a greater tendency to be basic. TABLE 10.1 Important Terms Describing Atmospheric Particles Term Meaning Aerosol Colloidal-sized atmospheric particle Condensation aerosol Formed by condensation of vapors or reactions of gases Dispersion aerosol Formed by grinding of solids, atomization of liquids, or dispersion of dusts Fog Term denoting high level of water droplets Haze Denotes decreased visibility due to the presence of particles Mists Liquid particles Smoke Particles formed by incomplete combustion of fuel 10.2 PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES IN THE ATMOSPHERE As shown in Figure 10.2, atmospheric particles undergo a number of processes in the atmosphere. Small colloidal particles are subject to diffusion processes. Smaller particles coagulate together to form larger particles. Sedimentation or dry deposition of particles, which have often reached sufficient size to settle by coagulation, is one of two major mechanisms for particle removal from the atmosphere. In many areas, dry deposition on vegetation is a significant mechanism for particle removal.1 In addition to sedimentation, the other major pathway for particle removal from the atmosphere is scavenging by raindrops and other forms of precipitation. Particles also react with atmospheric gases. Particle size usually expresses the diameter of a particle, though sometimes it is used to denote the radius. The sizes of atmospheric particles cover several orders of magnitude from <0.01 mm to around 100 mm. Volume and mass of particles are a function of d3, where d is the particle diameter. As a consequence, in general, the total mass of atmospheric particles is concentrated in the larger size range, whereas the total number and surface area of atmospheric particles are in the smaller fraction. The rate at which a particle settles is a function of particle diameter and density. The settling rate is important in determining the effect of the particle on the atmosphere. For spherical particles greater than approximately 1 mm in diameter, Stokes\u2019 law applies, gd 2(r-r) v = 1 2 (10.1) 18h where v is the settling velocity in cm/s, g is the acceleration of gravity in cm/s2, r1 is the density of the particle in g/cm3, r2 is the density of air in g/cm3, and h is the viscosity of air in poise. Stokes\u2019 law can also be used to express the effective diameter of an irregular nonspherical particle. These are called Stokes diameters (aerodynamic diameters) and are normally the ones given when particle diameters are expressed. Furthermore, since the density of a particle is often not known, an arbitrary density of 1 g/cm3 is conventionally assigned to r1; when this is done, the diameter calculated from Equation 10.1 is called the reduced sedimentation diameter.", "10.2.1 SIZE AND SETTLING OF ATMOSPHERIC PARTICLES Most kinds of aerosol particles have unknown diameters and densities and occur over a range of sizes. For such particles, the term mass median diameter (MMD) may be used to describe aerodynamically equivalent spheres having an assigned density of 1 g/cm3 at a 50% mass collection efficiency, as determined in sampling devices calibrated with spherical aerosol particles having a known, uniform size. (Polystyrene latex is commonly used as a material for the preparation of such standard aerosols.) The determination of MMD is accomplished by plotting the log of particle size as a function of the percentage of particles smaller than the given size on a probability scale. Two such plots are shown in Figure 10.3. It is seen from the plot that particles of aerosol X have a MMD of 2.0 mm (ordinate corresponding to 50% on the abscissa). In the case of aerosol Y, linear extrapolation to sizes below the lower measurable size limit of about 0.7 mm gives an estimated value of 0.5 mm for the MMD. The settling characteristics of particles smaller than about 1 mm in diameter deviate from Stokes\u2019 law because the settling particles \u201cslip between\u201d air molecules. Extremely small particles are subject to Brownian motion resulting from random movement due to collisions with air molecules and do not obey Stokes\u2019 law. Deviations are also observed for particles above 10 mm in diameter because they settle rapidly and generate turbulence as they fall. 10.3 PHYSICAL PROCESSES FOR PARTICLE FORMATION Dispersion aerosols, such as dusts, formed from the disintegration of larger particles are usually above 1 mm in size. Typical processes for forming dispersion aerosols include evolution of dust from coal grinding, formation of spray in cooling towers, and blowing of dirt from dry soil. Particle diameter (mm) 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.5 0.1 Percentage of mass less than speci\ufb01ed diameter FIGURE 10.3 Particle size distribution for particles of X (MMD = 2.0 mm) and Y (MMD = 0.5 mm). Many dispersion aerosols originate from natural sources such as sea spray, windblown dust, and volcanic dust. However, a vast variety of human activities break up material and disperse it to the atmosphere. \u201cAll terrain\u201d vehicles churn across desert lands, coating fragile desert plants with layers of dispersed dust. Quarries and rock crushers spew out plumes of ground rock. Cultivation of land has made it much more susceptible to dust-producing wind erosion. Areas of North America are now sometimes afflicted by plumes of particles stirred up by windstorms in Asia that disturb soil converted to desert by global warming, improper cultivation, and overgrazing. However, since much more energy is required to break material down into small particles than is required for or released by the synthesis of particles through chemical synthesis or the adhesion of smaller particles, most dispersion aerosols are relatively large. Larger particles tend to have fewer harmful effects than smaller ones. As examples, larger particles are less respirable in that they do not penetrate so far into the lungs as smaller ones, and larger particles are relatively easier to remove from air pollution effl uent sources. Huge volcanic eruptions can cause highly elevated levels of particles in the atmosphere. These can be from the physical process of simply blowing as much as several cubic kilometers of volcanic ash as high as the stratosphere. As noted below, volcanic gases can produce secondary particles by chemical processes. 10.4 CHEMICAL PROCESSES FOR PARTICLE FORMATION Chemical processes in the atmosphere convert large quantities of atmospheric gases to particulate matter.2 Among the chemical species most responsible for this conversion are the organic pollutants and nitrogen oxides that cause formation of ozone and photochemical smog (see Chapter 13) in the troposphere. Smaller particles formed by chemical processes tend to have higher contents of organic matter than do coarser particles. To an extent, therefore, control of hydrocarbon and NOx emissions to reduce smog also curtails atmospheric particulate matter pollution. A major fraction of ambient particulate matter arises from atmospheric gas-to-particle conversion. Attempts to reduce particulate matter levels require control of the same organic and nitrogen oxide (NOx ) emissions that are precursors to urban and regional ozone formation. Most chemical processes that produce particles are combustion processes, including fossil-fuel-fired power plants; incinerators; home furnaces, fireplaces, and stoves; cement kilns; internal combustion engines; forest, brush, and grass fires; and active volcanoes. Particles from combustion sources tend to occur in a size range below 1 mm.", "Such very small particles are particularly important because they are most readily carried into the alveoli of lungs (see pulmonary route of exposure to toxicants in Chapter 22) and they are likely to be enriched in more hazardous constituents, such as toxic heavy metals and arsenic. The pattern of occurrence of such trace elements can enable the use of small particle analysis for tracking sources of particulate pollutants. 10.4.1 INORGANIC PARTICLES Metal oxides constitute a major class of inorganic particles in the atmosphere. These are formed whenever fuels containing metals are burned. For example, particulate iron oxide is formed during the combustion of pyrite-containing coal: 3FeS2 + 8O2 \u00c6 Fe3O4 + 6SO2 (10.2) Organic vanadium in residual fuel oil is converted to particulate vanadium oxide. Part of the calcium carbonate in the ash fraction of coal is converted to calcium oxide and is emitted into the atmosphere through the stack: CaCO3 + heat \u00c6 CaO + CO2 (10.3) A common process for the formation of aerosol mists involves the oxidation of atmospheric sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid, a hygroscopic substance that accumulates atmospheric water to form small liquid droplets: 2SO2 + O2 + 2H2O \u00c6 2H2SO4 (10.4) In the presence of basic air pollutants, such as ammonia or calcium oxide, the sulfuric acid reacts to form salts: H2SO4(droplet) + 2NH3 (g) \u00c6 (NH4)2SO4(droplet) (10.5) H2SO4(droplet) + CaO (s) \u00c6 CaSO4(droplet) + H2O (10.6) Under low-humidity conditions, water is lost from these droplets and a solid aerosol is formed. Volcanic SO2 and H2S gases can be precursors to large quantities of atmospheric particulate sulfuric acid and sulfates. A study of the 1982 eruption of El Chich\u00f3n volcano in Mexico showed that volcanic glass, sodium chloride, and sulfate from the volcano were deposited in snow in Greenland. The June 15, 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines caused perceptible perturbations in the earth\u2019s atmospheric solar and infrared radiation transmission. Nitrogen in ammonium and nitrate salts is a common constituent of inorganic particulate matter. Particulate ammonium nitrate and ammonium chloride are produced by the following reversible reactions: NH (g) + HNO (g) NHNO(s, particulate) (10.7) 33 43 NH3(g) + HCl(g) NH4Cl(s, particulate) (10.8) Ammonium nitrate, chloride, and sulfate salts in the atmosphere are corrosive to metals such as the metal contacts in electrical relays. Biogenic sources provide the ingredients for the production of significant amounts of particulate ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate salts. Ammonia is evolved from the decay of organic matter. Gaseous sulfur enters the atmosphere as H2S gas from the decay of sulfur-containing organic matter and from anoxic microbial processes using sulfate as an electron receptor (oxidant). Marine organisms evolve large quantities of dimethyl sulfi de, (CH3)2S, from oceans. Hydrogen sulfi de and dimethyl sulfide are oxidized to sulfate in the atmosphere by atmospheric chemical processes. Microorganisms evolve significant quantities of gaseous N2O, which becomes oxidized in the atmosphere to nitrate. Some atmospheric ammonia is also oxidized to nitrate. The preceding examples show several ways in which solid or liquid inorganic aerosols are formed by chemical reactions. Such reactions constitute an important general process for the formation of aerosols, particularly the smaller particles. 10.4.2 ORGANIC PARTICLES A significant portion of organic particulate matter is produced by internal combustion engines in complicated processes that involve pyrolysis and pyrosynthesis processes. These products may include nitrogen-containing compounds and oxidized hydrocarbon polymers. Engine lubricating oil and its additives may also contribute to organic particulate matter. 10.4.3 POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBON SYNTHESIS The organic particles of greatest concern are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), which consist of condensed ring aromatic (aryl) molecules. The most often cited example of a PAH compound is benzo(a)pyrene, a compound that the body can metabolize to a carcinogenic form: Benzo(a)pyrene PAHs and derivatives from them are formed during incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Although natural combustion processes, such as forest and grass fi res, produce PAHs, most of the especially troublesome pollutant PAHs come from anthrospheric processes.3 PAHs may be synthesized from saturated hydrocarbons under oxygen-deficient conditions. Hydrocarbons with very low molecular masses, including even methane, may act as precursors for the polycyclic aromatic compounds. Low-molar-mass hydrocarbons form PAHs by pyrosynthesis. This happens at temperatures exceeding approximately 500\u00b0C at which carbon\u2013hydrogen and carbon\u2013carbon bonds are broken to form free radicals. These radicals undergo dehydrogenation and combine chemically to form aryl ring structures, which are resistant to thermal degradation.", "The basic process for the formation of such rings from pyrosynthesis starting with ethane is, H H Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which results in the formation of stable PAH structures. The tendency of hydrocarbons to form PAHs by pyrosynthesis varies in the order aromatics > cycloolefins > olefins > paraffin\u2019s. The existing ring structure of cyclic compounds is conducive to PAH formation. Unsaturated compounds are especially susceptible to the addition reactions involved in PAH formation. Polycyclic aromatic compounds may be formed from higher alkanes present in fuels and plant materials by the process of pyrolysis, the \u201ccracking\u201d of organic compounds to form smaller and less stable molecules and radicals. 10.5 THE COMPOSITION OF INORGANIC PARTICLES Figure 10.4 illustrates the basic factors responsible for the composition of inorganic particulate matter. In general, the proportions of elements in atmospheric particulate matter refl ect relative abundances of elements in the parent material. The source of particulate matter is reflected in its elemental composition, taking into consideration chemical reactions that may change the composition. For example, particulate matter largely from an ocean spray origin in a coastal area receiving sulfur dioxide pollution may show anomalously high sulfate and corresponding low chloride content. The sulfate comes from atmospheric oxidation of sulfur dioxide to form nonvolatile ionic sulfate, whereas some chloride originally from the NaCl in the seawater may be lost from the solid aerosol as volatile HCl: 2SO2 + O2 + 2H2O \u00c6 2H2SO4 (10.9) H2SO4 + 2NaCl (particulate) \u00c6 Na2SO4 (particulate) + 2HCl (10.10) Acids other than sulfuric acid can also be involved in the modification of sea-salt particles. The most common such acid is nitric acid formed by reactions of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere. Traces of nitrate salts may be found among sea-salt particles. Among the constituents of inorganic particulate matter found in polluted atmospheres are salts, oxides, nitrogen compounds, sulfur compounds, various metals, and radionuclides. In coastal areas, sodium and chlorine get into atmospheric particles as sodium chloride from sea spray. The major trace elements that typically occur at levels above 1 mg/m3 in particulate matter are aluminum, calcium, carbon, iron, potassium, sodium, and silicon; note that most of these tend to originate from Surrounding atmosphere H2O NH3 HBr NO2 HCl SO2 terrestrial sources. Lesser quantities of copper, lead, titanium, and zinc and even lower levels of antimony, beryllium, bismuth, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, cesium, lithium, manganese, nickel, rubidium, selenium, strontium, and vanadium are commonly observed. The likely sources of some of these elements are given below: \u2022 Al, Fe, Ca, Si: Soil erosion, rock dust, coal combustion \u2022 C: Incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels \u2022 Na, Cl: Marine aerosols, chloride from incineration of organohalide polymer wastes \u2022 Sb, Se: Very volatile elements, possibly from the combustion of oil, coal, or refuse \u2022 V: Combustion of residual petroleum (present at very high levels in residues from Venezuelan crude oil) \u2022 Zn: Tends to occur in small particles, probably from combustion \u2022 Pb: Combustion of fuels and wastes containing lead Particulate carbon as soot, carbon black, coke, and graphite originates from auto and truck exhausts, heating furnaces, incinerators, power plants, and steel and foundry operations, and composes one of the more visible and troublesome particulate air pollutants. Because of its good adsorbent properties, carbon can be a carrier of gaseous and other particulate pollutants. Both nitrogen and sulfur compounds in exhaust gases are adsorbed onto particulate carbon that is emitted by poorly controlled diesel engines. Particulate carbon surfaces may catalyze some heterogeneous atmospheric reactions, including the important conversion of SO2 into sulfate. 10.5.1 FLY ASH Much of the mineral particulate matter in a polluted atmosphere is in the form of oxides and other compounds produced during the combustion of high-ash fossil fuel. Some of the mineral matter in fossil fuels such as coal or lignite is converted during combustion into a fused, glassy bottom ash that presents no air pollution problems. Smaller particles of fl y ash enter furnace flues and are effi ciently collected in a properly equipped stack system. However, some fly ash escapes through the stack and enters the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the fly ash thus released tends to consist of smaller particles that do the most damage to human health, plants, and visibility. The composition of fly ash varies widely, depending upon the fuel. The predominant constituents are oxides of aluminum, calcium, iron, and silicon. Other elements that occur in fly ash are magnesium, sulfur, titanium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium.", "Elemental carbon (soot and carbon black) is a signifi cant fly ash constituent. The size of fly ash particles is a very important factor in determining their removal from stack gas and their ability to enter the body through the respiratory tract. Fly ash from coal-fi red utility boilers has shown a bimodal (two peak) distribution of size, with a peak at about 0.1 mm as illustrated in Figure 10.5. Although only about 1\u20132% of the total fly ash mass is in the smaller size fraction, it includes the vast majority of the total number of particles and particle surface area. Submicrometer particles probably result from a volatilization\u2013condensation process during combustion, as refl ected in a higher concentration of more volatile elements such as As, Sb, Hg, and Zn. In addition to their being relatively much more respirable and potentially toxic, the very small particles are the most difficult to remove by electrostatic precipitators and bag houses (see Section 10.12). 10.5.2 ASBESTOS Asbestos is the name given to a group of fibrous silicate minerals, typically those of the serpentine group, approximate formula Mg3P(Si2O5)(OH)4. The tensile strength, flexibility, and nonfl ammability of asbestos have led to many uses of this material. In 1973, annual U.S. consumption of asbestos 3000 2000 1000 0 Particle diameter, d (\u03bcm) FIGURE 10.5 General appearance of particle-size distribution in coal-fired power plant ash. The data are given on differential mass coordinates, where M is the mass, so that the area under the curve in a given size range is the mass of the particles in that size range. peaked at 652,000 metric tons for applications including brake linings and pads, roofi ng products, structural materials, cement/asbestos pipe, gaskets, heat-resistant packing, and specialty papers. By 1988, because of findings regarding the adverse health effects of inhaled asbestos, annual consumption had dropped to 85,000 metric tons. In 1989, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced regulations that phased out most uses of asbestos by 1996, and now virtually no asbestos is used in the United States. Asbestos is of concern as an air pollutant because when inhaled it may cause asbestosis (a pneumonia condition), mesothelioma (tumor of the mesothelial tissue lining the chest cavity adjacent to the lungs), and bronchogenic carcinoma (cancer originating with the air passages in the lungs). Therefore, uses of asbestos have been severely curtailed and widespread programs have been undertaken to remove the material from buildings. 10.6 TOXIC METALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE Some of the metals found predominantly as particulate matter in polluted atmospheres are known to be hazardous to human health.4 All of these except beryllium are so-called \u201cheavy metals.\u201d Lead is the toxic metal of greatest concern in the urban atmosphere because it comes closest to being present at a toxic level; mercury ranks second. Others include beryllium, cadmium, chromium, vanadium, nickel, and arsenic (a metalloid). 10.6.1 ATMOSPHERIC MERCURY Atmospheric mercury is of concern because of its toxicity, volatility, and mobility. Some atmospheric mercury is associated with particulate matter. Much of the mercury entering the atmosphere does so as volatile elemental mercury from coal combustion and volcanoes. Volatile organomercury compounds such as dimethylmercury, (CH3)2Hg, and monomethylmercury salts, such as CH3HgBr, are also encountered in the atmosphere. 10.6.2 ATMOSPHERIC LEAD Lead is one of six priority pollutants regulated by the U.S. EPA (see Section 10.9). With the reduction of leaded fuels, atmospheric lead is of less concern than it used to be. However, during the decades Di\ufb00erential mass, dM (mg/m3) d log D when leaded gasoline containing tetraethyllead (Pb(C2H5)4) was the predominant automotive fuel, particulate lead halides were emitted in large quantities. This occurred through the action of dichloroethane and dibromoethane added as halogenated scavengers to prevent the accumulation of lead oxides inside engines. The lead halides formed by the chemical process represented by Equation 10.11 are volatile enough to exit through the exhaust system but condense in the air to form particles. During the period of peak usage of leaded gasoline in the early 1970s, about 200,000 tons of lead were entering the atmosphere each year by this route in the United States. Pb(C2H5)4 + O2 + halogenated scavengers \u00c6 CO2 + H2O + PbCl2 + PbClBr + PbBr2 (unbalanced) (10.11) 10.6.3 ATMOSPHERIC BERYLLIUM Only about 200 metric tons of beryllium are consumed each year in the United States for the formulation of specialty alloys used in electrical equipment, electronic instrumentation, space gear, and nuclear reactor components.", "Therefore, distribution of beryllium is quite limited compared to other toxic substances produced in larger quantities, such as lead. During the 1940s and 1950s, the toxicity of beryllium and beryllium compounds became widely recognized; it has the lowest allowable limit in the atmosphere of all the elements. One of the main results of the recognition of beryllium toxicity hazards was the elimination of this element from phosphors (coatings that produce visible light from ultraviolet light) in fl uorescent lamps. 10.7 RADIOACTIVE PARTICLES Some of the radioactivity detected in atmospheric particles is of natural origin. This activity includes that produced when cosmic rays act on nuclei in the atmosphere to produce radionuclides, including 7Be, 10Be, 14C, 39Cl, 3H, 22Na, 32P, and 33P. A significant natural source of radionuclides in the atmosphere is radon, a noble gas product of radium decay. Radon may enter the atmosphere as either of two isotopes, 222Rn (half-life: 3.8 days) and 220Rn (half-life: 54.5 s). Both are alpha emitters in decay chains that terminate with stable isotopes of lead. The initial decay products, 218Po and 216Po, are nongaseous and adhere readily to atmospheric particulate matter. The catastrophic 1986 meltdown and fi re at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in the former Soviet Union spread large quantities of radioactive materials over a wide area of Europe. Much of this radioactivity was in the form of particles. One of the more serious problems in connection with radon is that of radioactivity originating from uranium mine tailings that have been used in some areas as backfill, soil conditioner, and a base for building foundations. Radon produced by the decay of radium exudes from foundations and walls constructed on tailings. Higher than normal levels of radioactivity have been found in some structures in the city of Grand Junction, Colorado, where uranium mill tailings have been used extensively in construction. Some medical authorities have suggested that the rates of birth defects and infant cancer in areas where uranium mill tailings have been used in residential construction are significantly higher than normal. The combustion of fossil fuels introduces radioactivity into the atmosphere in the form of radionuclides contained in fly ash. Large coal-fired power plants lacking ash-control equipment may introduce up to several hundred millicuries of radionuclides into the atmosphere each year, far more than either an equivalent nuclear or oil-fired power plant. The radioactive noble gas 85Kr (half-life: 10.3 years) is emitted into the atmosphere by the operation of nuclear reactors and the processing of spent reactor fuels. In general, other radionuclides produced by reactor operation are either chemically reactive and can be removed from the reactor effluent, or have such short half-lives that a short time delay prior to emission prevents their leaving the reactor. Although 85Kr is largely contained in spent reactor fuel during reactor operation, nuclear fuel reprocessing releases most of this gas from the fuel elements. Fortunately, biota cannot concentrate this chemically unreactive element. The above-ground detonation of nuclear weapons can add large amounts of radioactive particulate matter to the atmosphere. Among the radioisotopes that have been detected in rainfall collected after atmospheric nuclear weapon detonation are 91Y, 141Ce, 144Ce, 147Nd, 147Pm, 149Pm, 151Sm, 153Sm, 155Eu, 156Eu, 89Sr, 90Sr, 115mCd, 129mTe, 131I, 132Te, and 140Ba. (Note that \u201cm\u201d denotes a metastable state that decays by gamma-ray emission to an isotope of the same element.) The rate of travel of radioactive particles through the atmosphere is a function of particle size. Appreciable fractionation of nuclear debris is observed because of differences in the rates at which the various debris constituents move through the atmosphere. 10.8 THE COMPOSITION OF ORGANIC PARTICLES The composition of organic particulate matter reflects its origins. Much organic particulate matter, such as the organic particles characteristic of photochemical smog (see Chapter 13), is formed as secondary material that results from photochemical processes operating on volatile and semivolatile organic compounds emitted to the atmosphere. The compounds emitted to the atmosphere are predominantly hydrocarbon in nature and the incorporation of oxygen and/or nitrogen through atmospheric chemical processes gives less volatile material in the form of organic particles. Organic atmospheric particles occur in a wide variety of compounds. For analysis, such particles can be collected onto a filter; extracted with organic solvents; fractionated into neutral, acid, and basic groups; and analyzed for specific constituents by chromatography and mass spectrometry. The neutral group contains predominantly hydrocarbons, including aliphatic, aromatic, and oxygenated fractions.", "The aliphatic fraction of the neutral group contains a high percentage of long-chain hydrocarbons, predominantly those with 16\u201328 carbon atoms. These relatively unreactive compounds are not particularly toxic and do not participate strongly in atmospheric chemical reactions. The aromatic fraction, however, contains carcinogenic PAHs, which are discussed below. Aldehydes, ketones, epoxides, peroxides, esters, quinones, and lactones are found among the oxygenated neutral components, some of which may be mutagenic or carcinogenic. The acidic group contains long-chain fatty acids and nonvolatile phenols. Among the acids recovered from air-pollutant particulate matter are lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, behenic, oleic, and linoleic acids. The basic group consists largely of alkaline N-heterocyclic hydrocarbons such as acridine: 10.8.1 PAHS PAHs in atmospheric particles have received a great deal of attention because of the known carcinogenic effects of some of these compounds, which are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 23. Prominent among these compounds are benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(e) pyrene, benz(e)acephenanthrylene, benzo(j)fluoranthene, and indenol. Some representative structures of PAH compounds are given below: Elevated levels of PAH compounds of up to about 20 mg/m3 are found in the atmosphere. Elevated levels of PAHs are most likely to be encountered in polluted urban atmospheres, and in the vicinity of natural fires such as forest and prairie fires. Coal furnace stack gas may contain over 1000 mg/m3 of PAH compounds, and cigarette smoke may contain almost 100 mg/m3. Atmospheric PAHs are found almost exclusively in the solid phase, largely sorbed to soot particles. Soot itself is a highly condensed product of PAHs. Soot contains 1\u20133% hydrogen and 5\u201310% oxygen, the latter due to partial surface oxidation. Benzo(a)pyrene adsorbed on soot disappears very rapidly in the presence of light, yielding oxygenated products; the large surface area of the particle contributes to the high rate of reaction. Oxidation products of benzo(a)pyrene include epoxides, quinones, phenols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids as illustrated by the composite structures shown below: 10.8.2 CARBONACEOUS PARTICLES FROM DIESEL ENGINES Diesel engines emit significant levels of carbonaceous particles. Although an appreciable fraction of these particles have aerodynamic diameters <1 mm, they may exist as aggregates of several thousand smaller particles in clusters up to 30 mm in diameter. This particulate matter is composed largely of elemental carbon, although as much as 40% of the particle mass consists of organic-extractable hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives including organosulfur and organonitrogen compounds. As noted in Section 10.12, modern diesel engines employ filters to remove exhaust particles, which are periodically burned off of the fi lter surfaces. 10.9 EFFECTS OF PARTICLES Atmospheric particles have numerous effects. Because of their pollutant effects, particles are one of six so-called criteria pollutants for which the U.S. EPA is required to issue standards. (The other five priority pollutants are sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and lead.) Standards for atmospheric particulate matter were first issued by EPA in 1971 with revisions in 1987, 1997, and 2006, most recently with special attention given to particles of a size of 2.5 mm and smaller (PM2.5). The most obvious effect of atmospheric particles is reduction and distortion of visibility. They provide active surfaces upon which heterogeneous atmospheric chemical reactions can occur thereby strongly influencing air pollution phenomena. The ability of particles to act as nucleation bodies for the condensation of atmospheric water vapor can influence precipitation and weather.5 The most visible effects of aerosol particles upon air quality result from their optical effects. Particles smaller than about 0.1 mm in diameter scatter light much like molecules, that is, Rayleigh scattering. Generally, such particles have an insignificant effect upon visibility in the atmosphere. The light-scattering and intercepting properties of particles larger than 1 mm are approximately proportional to the particles\u2019 cross-sectional areas. Particles of 0.1\u20131 mm cause interference phenomena because they are about the same dimensions as the wavelengths of visible light, so their light-scattering effects are especially pronounced. Atmospheric particles inhaled through the respiratory tract may damage health, and exposure to particles in the atmosphere has been linked to a number of health effects including aggravated asthma and premature death from heart and lung diseases. Relatively large particles are likely to be retained in the nasal cavity and in the pharynx, whereas very small particles below 2.5 mm in size are respirable particles that are likely to reach the lungs and be retained by them. The respiratory system possesses mechanisms for the expulsion of inhaled particles.", "In the ciliated region of the respiratory system, particles are carried as far as the entrance to the gastrointestinal tract by a fl ow of mucus. Macrophages in the nonciliated pulmonary regions carry particles to the ciliated region. The respiratory system may be damaged directly by particulate matter. In addition, the particulate material or soluble components of it may enter the blood system or lymph system through the lungs to be transported to organs some distance from the lungs and have a detrimental effect on these organs. Particles cleared from the respiratory tract are to a large extent swallowed into the gastrointestinal tract. A strong correlation has been found between increases in the daily mortality rate and acute episodes of air pollution including particulate pollution. In such cases, high levels of particulate matter are accompanied by elevated concentrations of SO2 and other pollutants that may have adverse health effects in combination with particles. A classic case of adverse health effects associated with high levels of atmospheric particles occurred in London during an incident in a 5-day period in 1952 in which a temperature inversion stabilized a mass of air laden with fog, coal smoke, and other particles. Epidemiological data from this period showed approximately 4000 excess deaths. Ultrafi ne particles <0.1 mm in size and acid-forming constituents have been suspected of contributing to the deaths. Lung and respiratory tract samples archived from victims of this event and subjected to electron microscopic examination 50 years later showed carbonaceous soot predominant in the retained particles in the respiratory tract. Particles bearing metals including lead, zinc, and tin were also found. 10.9.1 PARTITIONING OF SEMIVOLATILE ORGANIC SUBSTANCES BETWEEN AIR AND PARTICLES An effect of atmospheric particles is the partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds such as PCBs between air and particles. As shown in Figure 10.6, these particles can act as carriers to deposit such compounds from the atmosphere onto surfaces in the other environmental spheres. Binding with particles can influence the reactivity of organic compounds, particularly with respect to oxidation. 10.10 WATER AS PARTICULATE MATTER Droplets of water are very widespread in the atmosphere. Although a natural phenomenon, such droplets can have significant and sometimes harmful effects. The most important such consequence is reduction of visibility, with accompanying detrimental effects on driving, flying, and boat navigation. Water droplets in fog act as carriers of pollutants. The most important of these are solutions of corrosive salts, particularly ammonium nitrates and sulfates, and solutions of strong acids. As discussed in Chapter 14, Section 14.4, the pH of water in acidic mist droplets collected during a Los Angeles acidic fog has been as low as 1.7, far below that of acidic precipitation. Such acidic mist can be especially damaging to the respiratory tract because it is very penetrating. Arguably the most significant effect of water droplets in the atmosphere is as aquatic media in which important atmospheric chemical processes occur. The single most significant such process may well be the oxidation of S(IV) species to sulfuric acid and sulfate salts, a process that may be facilitated by the presence of iron. The S(IV) species so oxidized include SO2 (aq), HSO3 -, and SO32\u2212. Another important oxidation that takes place in atmospheric water droplets is the oxidation of aldehydes to organic carboxylic acids. The hydroxyl radical, HO\u2022, is very important in initiating atmospheric oxidation reactions such as those noted above. Hydroxyl radical as HO\u2022 can enter water droplets from the gas-phase atmosphere, it can be produced in water droplets photochemically, or it can be generated from H2O2 and \u2022O2 - radical ion, which dissolve in water from the gas phase and then produce HO\u2022 by solution chemical reaction: - H2O2 + \u2022O2 \u00c6 HO\u2022 + O2 + OH- (10.12) Several solutes can react photochemically in aqueous solution (as opposed to the gas phase) to produce hydroxyl radical. One of these is hydrogen peroxide: H2O2(aq) + hn\u00c6 2HO \u2022 (aq) (10.13) - Nitrite as NO2 or HNO2, nitrate (NO3 -), and iron(III) as Fe(OH)2+ (aq) can also react photochemically in aqueous solution to produce HO\u2022. It has been observed that ultraviolet radiation at 313 nm and simulated sunlight can react to produce HO\u2022 radical in authentic samples of water collected from cloud and fog sources.6 Based on the results of this study and related investigations, it may be concluded that the aqueous-phase formation of hydroxyl radical is an important, and in some cases dominant, means by which this key atmospheric oxidant is introduced into atmospheric water droplets.", "10.11 ATMOSPHERIC CHEMICAL REACTIONS INVOLVING PARTICLES In recent years there has been an increasing recognition of the importance in atmospheric chemistry of chemical processes that occur on particle surfaces and in solution in liquid particles (Figure 10.7). Challenging as it is, gas-phase atmospheric chemistry is relatively straightforward compared to the heterogeneous chemistry that involves particles. Particles may serve as sources Hydrocarbon Photochemical processes on Evolution of particle surface XY Catalytic surface on which X + Y Condensation of vaporH2O FIGURE 10.7 Particles provide sites for many important atmospheric chemical processes. and sinks of atmospheric chemical reaction participant species. Solid particle surfaces may adsorb reactants and products, serve a catalytic function, exchange electrical charge, and absorb photons of electromagnetic radiation, thus acting as photocatalytic surfaces. Liquid water droplets may act as media for solution reactions including photochemical reactions that occur in solution. Reactions on particle surfaces are very difficult to study because of factors such as variability in atmospheric particulate matter, the virtual impossibility of duplicating conditions that occur with suspended particles in the atmosphere, and the effects of water vapor and water condensed on particle surfaces. Prominent among solid particles that serve as reaction sites are soot and elemental carbon, oxides, carbonates, silica, and mineral dust. Particles may be liquid aerosols, dry solids, or solids with deliquescent surfaces. They exhibit wide variations in diameter, surface area, and chemical composition. Some of the atmospheric chemical processes that likely occur on particle surfaces are N2O5 hydrolysis, surface aging of soot particles by surface oxidation, generation of HONO (a precursor to HO\u2022) by reaction of nitrogen oxides and water vapor on soot and silica particle surfaces, reactions of HO\u2022 with nonvolatile chemical species sorbed to particle surfaces, uptake and reactions of carbonyl compounds such as acetone on particulate oxides and mineral dusts, and processes involving particles that influence residence times of atmospheric chemicals. An interesting example of chemical processes on particle surfaces is the accumulation of sulfate on the surfaces of sodium chloride particles produced by evaporation of water from seawater spray droplets. This phenomenon has been attributed in part to a process that begins with the reaction of deliquesced (moist) sodium chloride with hydroxyl radical7: 2NaCl + 2HO\u2022 \u00c6 2NaOH + Cl2 (10.14) Part of the Cl2 on the surface reacts with NaOH, Cl2 + 2NaOH \u00c6 NaOCl + NaCl + H2O (10.15) to produce sodium hypochlorite, which has been observed on the particle surfaces. The NaOH on the surface reacts with atmospheric sulfuric acid, 2NaOH + H2SO4 \u00c6 Na2SO4 + H2O (10.16) to produce sodium sulfate. The basic sodium hydroxide on the surface also facilitates oxidation of atmospheric SO2: SO2 + 2NaOH + 1 \u00c6 Na2SO4 + H2O (10.17) 2 O2 The net result is that the oxidation of atmospheric sulfur dioxide is promoted and particulate sodium chloride contains significant amounts of sodium sulfate. 10.12 CONTROL OF PARTICULATE EMISSIONS The removal of particulate matter from gas streams is the most widely practiced means of air pollution control. A number of devices have been developed for this purpose that differ widely in effectiveness, complexity, and cost. The selection of a particle removal system for a gaseous waste stream depends upon the particle loading, nature of particles (size distribution), and type of gas-scrubbing system used. 10.12.1 PARTICLE REMOVAL BY SEDIMENTATION AND INERTIA The simplest means of particulate matter removal is sedimentation, a phenomenon that occurs continuously in nature. Gravitational settling chambers may be employed for the removal of particles from gas streams by simply settling under the influence of gravity. These chambers take up large amounts of space and have low collection efficiencies, particularly for small particles. Gravitational settling of particles is enhanced by increased particle size, which occurs spontaneously by coagulation. Thus, over time, the sizes of particles increase and the number of particles decreases in a mass of air that contains particles. Brownian motion of particles less than about 0.1 mm in size is primarily responsible for their contact, enabling coagulation to occur. Particles greater than about 0.3 mm in radius do not diffuse appreciably and serve primarily as receptors of smaller particles. Inertial mechanisms are effective for particle removal. These depend upon the fact that the radius of the path of a particle in a rapidly moving, curving air stream is larger than the path of the stream as a whole.", "Therefore, when a gas stream is spun by vanes, a fan, or a tangential gas inlet, the particulate matter may be collected on a separator wall because the particles are forced outward by centrifugal force. Devices utilizing this mode of operation are called dry centrifugal collectors (cyclones). 10.12.2 PARTICLE FILTRATION Fabric filters, as their name implies, consist of fabrics that allow the passage of gas but retain particulate matter. These are used to collect dust in bags contained in structures called baghouses. Periodically, the fabric composing the filter is shaken to remove the particles and to reduce back-pressure to acceptable levels. Typically, the bag is in a tubular configuration as shown in Figure 10.8. Numerous other confi gurations are possible. Collected particulate matter is removed from bags by mechanical agitation, blowing air on the fabric, or rapid expansion and contraction of the bags. Although simple, baghouses are generally effective in removing particles from exhaust gas. Particles as small as 0.01 mm in diameter are removed, and removal efficiency is relatively high for particles down to 0.5 mm in diameter. Aided by the development of mechanically strong, heat-resistant fabrics from which the bags are fabricated, baghouse installations have increased significantly in the effort to control particulate emissions. Exhaust gascontaining particles Fabric bag Cleansed gas Periodic shaking Collected particulate Diesel engines, especially those in heavy-duty trucks and buses, are major sources of particulate matter in urban areas and along highways. Although exhaust particulate filters were developed for use on diesel-powered highway vehicles in the latter 1970s, because of advances in engine design and control these devices were deemed unnecessary for a number of years. Later fi ndings regarding suspected health effects of diesel particulate matter subsequently led to an increase in interest in diesel particulate filters. Devices for controlling diesel emissions, such as those that trap carbonaceous particles on ceramic filters followed by cycles in which the accumulated material is burned off the filter, have now reached a high level of sophistication and effectiveness. Given the attractiveness of the diesel engine for its high fuel economy, diesel particulate filters are becoming common equipment on diesel-powered vehicles. 10.12.3 SCRUBBERS A venturi scrubber passes gas through a device that leads the gas stream through a converging section, throat, and diverging section as shown in Figure 10.9. Injection of the scrubbing liquid at right angles to incoming gas breaks the liquid into very small droplets, which are ideal for scavenging Gas to be cleaned FIGURE 10.9 Venturi scrubber. Positive (grounded)surface Chargedparticles Negative(discharge)electrode Top view Gas contains particles FIGURE 10.10 Schematic diagram of an electrostatic precipitator. particles from the gas stream. In the reduced-pressure (expanding and, therefore, cooling) region of the venturi, some condensation can occur of vapor from liquid initially evaporated in the generally hot waste gas, adding to the scrubbing efficiency. In addition to removing particles, venturis may serve as quenchers to cool exhaust gas, and as scrubbers for pollutant gases. Ionizing wet scrubbers place an electrical charge on particles upstream from a wet scrubber. Larger particles and some gaseous contaminants are removed by scrubbing action. Smaller particles tend to induce opposite charges in water droplets in the scrubber and in its packing material and are removed by attraction of the opposite charges. 10.12.4 ELECTROSTATIC REMOVAL Aerosol particles may acquire electrical charges. In an electric field, such particles are subjected to a force, F, given by F = Eq (10.18) where E is the electrical potential gradient between the oppositely charged electrodes in the space in which the particle is suspended and q is the electrostatic charge on the particle. This phenomenon has been widely used in highly effi cient electrostatic precipitators, as shown in Figure 10.10. The particles acquire a charge when the gas stream is passed through a high-voltage, direct current corona. Because of the charge, the particles are attracted to a grounded surface from which they may be later removed. Ozone may be produced by the corona discharge. LITERATURE CITED 1. Petroff, A., A.

(These quantities are relatively small compared to the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. The possible environmental effects of increased atmospheric CO2 levels are discussed in Chapter 14.) Other inorganic pollutant gases include NH3, N2O, N2O5, H2S, Cl2, HCl, and HF. Substantial quantities of some of these gases are added to the atmosphere each year by human activities. Globally, atmospheric emissions of carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides are of the order of one to several hundred million tons per year. 11.2 PRODUCTION AND CONTROL OF CARBON MONOXIDE Carbon monoxide, CO, is a natural constituent of the atmosphere and a pollutant when it is present above normal background concentrations. It causes problems in cases of locally high concentrations because of its toxicity (see Chapter 24). The overall atmospheric concentration of carbon monoxide is about 0.1 ppm, corresponding to a burden in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere of approximately 500 million metric tons of CO with an average residence time ranging from 36 to 110 days. Much of this CO is present as an intermediate in the oxidation of methane by hydroxyl radical. From Table 9.1 it may be seen that the methane content of the atmosphere is about 1.6 ppm, more than 10 times the concentration of CO. Therefore, any oxidation process for methane that produces carbon monoxide as an intermediate is certain to contribute substantially to the overall carbon monoxide burden, probably around two-thirds of the total CO. Degradation of chlorophyll during the autumn months releases CO, amounting to perhaps as much as 20% of the total annual release. Anthropogenic sources account for about 6% of CO emissions. The remainder of atmospheric CO comes from largely unknown sources. These include some plants and marine organisms known as siphonophores, an order of Hydrozoa.", "Carbon monoxide is also produced by decay of plant matter other than chlorophyll. Because of carbon monoxide emissions from internal combustion engines, the highest levels of this toxic gas tend to occur in congested urban areas at times when the maximum number of people are exposed, such as during rush hours. At such times, carbon monoxide levels in the atmosphere have become as high as 50\u2013100 ppm, definitely hazardous to human health. Atmospheric levels of carbon monoxide in urban areas show a positive correlation with the density of vehicular traffic and a negative correlation with wind speed. Urban atmospheres may show average carbon monoxide levels of the order of several parts per million (ppm), much higher than those in remote areas. 11.2.1 CONTROL OF CARBON MONOXIDE EMISSIONS Since the internal combustion engine is the primary source of localized pollutant carbon monoxide emissions, control measures have been concentrated on the automobile. Carbon monoxide emissions may be lowered by employing a leaner air\u2013fuel mixture, that is, one in which the mass ratio of air to fuel is relatively high. At air\u2013fuel (mass:mass) ratios exceeding approximately 16:1, an internal combustion engine emits very little carbon monoxide. Modern automobiles use computerized control of engines with catalytic exhaust reactors to cut down on carbon monoxide emissions. Excess air is pumped into the exhaust gas, and the mixture is passed through a catalytic converter in the exhaust system, resulting in the oxidation of CO to CO2. 11.3 FATE OF ATMOSPHERIC CO It is generally agreed that carbon monoxide is removed from the atmosphere by reaction with hydroxyl radical, HO\u2022: CO + HO\u2211\u00c6 CO2 + H (11.1) The reaction produces hydroperoxyl radical as a product: O2 + H + M \u00c6 HOO\u2211+ M (11.2) HO\u2211 is regenerated from HOO\u2211 by the following reactions: HOO\u2211+ NO \u00c6 HO\u2211+ NO2 (11.3) HOO\u2211+ HOO\u2211\u00c6 H2O2 + O2 (11.4) The latter reaction is followed by photochemical dissociation of H2O2 to regenerate HO\u2211: H2O2 + hn\u00c6 2HO\u2211 (11.5) Methane is also involved through the atmospheric CO/HO\u2211/CH4 cycle. Soil microorganisms act to remove CO from the atmosphere. Therefore, soil is a sink for carbon monoxide. 11.4 SULFUR DIOXIDE SOURCES AND THE SULFUR CYCLE Figure 11.1 shows the main aspects of the global sulfur cycle. This cycle involves primarily H2S, (CH3)2S, SO2, SO3, and sulfates. There are many uncertainties regarding the sources, reactions, and fates of these atmospheric sulfur species. On a global basis, sulfur compounds enter the atmosphere to a very large extent through human activities. Approximately 100 million metric tons of sulfur per year enter the global atmosphere through anthropogenic activities, primarily as SO2 from the combustion of coal and residual fuel oil. In the United States, anthropogenic emissions of sulfur dioxide peaked at 28.8 Tg (teragrams, millions of metric tons) in 1990 and have been reduced by more than 40% since then. As the result of air pollution control measures, sulfur dioxide emissions in the area of Europe covered by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation Program fell from 59 Tg in 1980 to 27 Tg in 1997 and emissions in the United Kingdom dropped from 6.4 Tg in 1970 to 1.2 Tg in 1999. Emissions of sulfur dioxide as measured directly and inferred by analysis of atmospheric sulfate have continued to drop in Europe.2 The greatest uncertainties in the sulfur cycle have to do with nonanthropogenic sulfur, which enters the atmosphere largely as SO2 and H2S from volcanoes, and as (CH3)2S and H2S from the biological decay of organic matter and the reduction of sulfate. The single largest source of natural sulfur discharged to the atmosphere is now believed to be biogenic dimethyl sulfi de, (CH3)2S, from marine sources. Any H2S that does get into the atmosphere is converted rapidly to SO2 by the following overall process: HS + 3O \u00c6 SO + H O (11.6) 222 22 H2S, SO2 sulfates Bases NH3 Rainfall and 10 XSO2 Rainfall, dry ? dry deposition deposition, and over land absorption over Biogenic SO2 and sulfates Volcanoes Sulfates (CH3)2S oceans ? ? SO2 and Fossil sulfates 100 fuels wind and wave action Biogenic H2S, (CH3)2S Sea salt from 15 SO2 and sulfates taken up by plants Some sulfur appliedto soil Some sulfur transported byrivers to oceans FIGURE 11.1 Global atmospheric sulfur cycle. Fluxes of sulfur represented by the arrows are in millions of metric tons per year. Those marked with a question mark are uncertain, but large, probably of the order of 100 million metric tons per year.", "The initial reaction is hydrogen ion abstraction by a hydroxyl radical, H2S + HO\u2211\u00c6 HS\u2211+ H2O (11.7) followed by the following two reactions to give SO2: HS\u2211+ O2 \u00c6 HO\u2211+ SO (11.8) SO + O2 \u00c6 SO2 + O (11.9) The primary source of anthropogenic sulfur dioxide is coal, from which sulfur must be removed at considerable expense to keep sulfur dioxide emissions at acceptable levels. Approximately half of the sulfur in coal is in some form of pyrite, FeS2, and the other half is organic sulfur. The production of sulfur dioxide by the combustion of pyrite is given by the following reaction: 4FeS2 + 11O2 \u00c6 2Fe2O3 + 8SO2 (11.10) Essentially all of the sulfur is converted to SO2 and only 1% or 2% to SO3. 11.5 SULFUR DIOXIDE REACTIONS IN THE ATMOSPHERE Many factors, including temperature, humidity, light intensity, atmospheric transport, and surface characteristics of particulate matter, may influence the atmospheric chemical reactions of sulfur dioxide. Like many other gaseous pollutants, sulfur dioxide reacts to form particulate matter, which then settles or is scavenged from the atmosphere by rainfall or other processes. It is known that high levels of air pollution normally are accompanied by a marked increase in aerosol particles and a consequent reduction in visibility. Reaction products of sulfur dioxide are thought to be responsible for some aerosol formation. Whatever the processes involved, much of the sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is ultimately oxidized to sulfuric acid and sulfate salts, particularly ammonium sulfate and ammonium hydrogen sulfate. In fact, it is likely that these sulfates account for the turbid haze that covers much of the eastern part of the United States under all atmospheric conditions except those characterized by massive intrusions of Arctic air masses during the winter months. The potential of sulfates to induce climatic change is high and must be taken into account when considering control of sulfur dioxide. Some of the possible ways in which sulfur dioxide may react in the atmosphere are (1) photochemical reactions; (2) photochemical and chemical reactions in the presence of nitrogen oxides and/or hydrocarbons, particularly alkenes; (3) chemical processes in water droplets, particularly those containing metal salts and ammonia; and (4) reactions on solid particles in the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere is a highly dynamic system with great variations in temperature, composition, humidity, and intensity of sunlight, different processes may predominate under various atmospheric conditions. Photochemical reactions are probably involved in some of the processes resulting in the atmospheric oxidation of SO2. Light with wavelengths above 218 nm is not sufficiently energetic to bring about the photodissociation of SO2, so direct photochemical reactions in the troposphere are of no significance. The oxidation of sulfur dioxide at the parts-per-million level in an otherwise unpolluted atmosphere is a slow process. Therefore, other pollutant species must be involved in the process in atmospheres polluted with SO2. The presence of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides greatly increases the oxidation rate of atmospheric SO2. As discussed in Chapter 13, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and ultraviolet light are the ingredients necessary for the formation of photochemical smog. This disagreeable condition is characterized by high levels of various oxidizing species (photochemical oxidants) capable of oxidizing SO2. In the smog-prone Los Angeles area, the oxidation of SO2 ranges up to 5\u201310% per hour. Among the oxidizing species present that could bring about this fast reaction are HO\u2211, HOO\u2211, O, O3, NO3, N2O5, ROO\u2211, and RO\u2211. As discussed in Chapters 12 and 13, the latter two species are reactive organic free radicals containing oxygen. Although ozone, O3, is an important product of photochemical smog, it is believed that the oxidation of SO2 by ozone in the gas phase is too slow to be appreciable, but oxidation by ozone and hydrogen peroxide is probably significant in water droplets.3 The most important gas-phase reaction leading to the oxidation of SO2 is the addition of an HO\u2211 radical, HO\u2211+ SO2 \u00c6 HOSO\u2211 2 (11.11) forming a reactive free radical that is eventually converted to a form of sulfate. In all but relatively dry atmospheres, it is probable that sulfur dioxide is oxidized by reactions occurring inside water aerosol droplets. The overall process of sulfur dioxide oxidation in the aqueous phase is rather complicated.", "It involves the transport of gaseous SO2 and oxidant to the aqueous phase, diffusion of species in the aqueous droplet, hydrolysis and ionization of SO2, and oxidation of SO2 by the following overall process, where {O} represents an oxidizing agent such as H2O2, HO\u2211, or O3 and S(IV) is SO2(aq), HSO3 -(aq), and SO32-(aq): {O}(aq) + S(IV)(aq) \u00c6 2H++ SO42-(unbalanced) (11.12) In the absence of catalytic species, the reaction with dissolved molecular O2, 1O(aq) + SO (aq) + HO \u00c6 H SO (aq) 22 2 2 24 (11.13) is too slow to be significant. Hydrogen peroxide is an important oxidizing agent in the atmosphere. It reacts with dissolved sulfur dioxide through the overall reaction SO2(aq) + H2O2(aq) \u00c6 H2SO4(aq) (11.14) - to produce sulfuric acid. The major reaction is thought to be between hydrogen peroxide and HSO3 ion with peroxymonosulfurous acid, HOOSO2 -, as an intermediate. Ozone, O3, oxidizes sulfur dioxide in water. The fastest reaction is with sulfi te ion: SO32-(aq) + O3(aq) \u00c6 SO42-(aq) + O2 (11.15) Reactions are slower with HSO3 -(aq) and SO2(aq) and the rate of oxidation of aqueous SO2 species by ozone increases with increasing pH. The oxidation of sulfur dioxide in water droplets is faster in the presence of ammonia, which reacts with sulfur dioxide to produce bisulfite ion and sulfi te ion in solution: - NH3 + SO2 + H2O \u00c6 NH4 ++ HSO3 (11.16) Some solutes dissolved in water catalyze the oxidation of aqueous SO2. Both iron(III) and Mn(II) have this effect. The reactions catalyzed by these two ions are faster with increasing pH. Dissolved nitrogen species, NO2 and HNO2, oxidize aqueous sulfur dioxide in the laboratory. As noted in Section 10.10, nitrite dissolved in water droplets may react photochemically to produce an HO\u2211 radical, and this species in turn could act to oxidize dissolved sulfi te. Heterogeneous reactions on solid particles may also play a role in the removal of sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere. In atmospheric photochemical reactions, such particles may function as nucleation centers. Thus, they act as catalysts and grow in size by accumulating reaction products. The final result would be the production of an aerosol with a composition unlike that of the original particle. Soot particles, which consist of elemental carbon contaminated with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (see Chapter 10, Section 10.4) produced in the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels, can catalyze the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfate as indicated by the presence of sulfate on the soot particles. Soot particles are very common in polluted atmospheres, so it is very likely that they are strongly involved in catalyzing the oxidation of sulfur dioxide. Oxides of metals such as aluminum, calcium, chromium, iron, lead, and vanadium may also be catalysts for the heterogenous oxidation of sulfur dioxide. These oxides may also adsorb sulfur dioxide. However, the total surface area of oxide particulate matter in the atmosphere is very low, so that the fraction of sulfur dioxide oxidized on metal oxide surfaces is relatively small. 11.5.1 EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC SULFUR DIOXIDE Though not terribly toxic to most people, low levels of sulfur dioxide in air do have some health effects. Its primary effect is upon the respiratory tract, producing irritation and increasing airway resistance, especially to people with respiratory weaknesses and sensitized asthmatics. Therefore, exposure to the gas may increase the effort required to breathe. Mucus secretion is also stimulated by exposure to air contaminated by sulfur dioxide. Although SO2 causes death in humans at 500 ppm, it has not been found to harm laboratory animals at 5 ppm. Sulfur dioxide has been at least partially implicated in several acute incidents of air pollution. In December 1930, a thermal inversion trapped waste products from a number of industrial sources in the narrow Meuse River Valley of Belgium. Sulfur dioxide levels reached 38 ppm. Approximately 60 people died in the episode, and some cattle were killed. In October 1948, a similar incident caused illness in over 40% of the population of Donora, Pennsylvania, and 20 people died. Sulfur dioxide concentrations of 2 ppm were recorded. During a 5-day period marked by a temperature inversion and fog in London in December 1952, approximately 3500\u20134000 deaths in excess of normal occurred. Levels of SO2 reached 1.3 ppm. Autopsies revealed irritation of the respiratory tract, and high levels of sulfur dioxide in combination with inhaled particles were suspected of contributing to excess mortality. Atmospheric sulfur dioxide is harmful to plants, some species of which are affected more than others.", "Acute exposure to high levels of the gas kills leaf tissue, a condition called leaf necrosis. The edges of the leaves and the areas between the leaf veins show characteristic damage. Chronic exposure of plants to sulfur dioxide causes chlorosis, a bleaching or yellowing of the normally green portions of the leaf. Plant injury increases with increasing relative humidity. Plants incur most injury from sulfur dioxide when their stomata (small openings in plant surface tissue that allow interchange of gases with the atmosphere) are open. For most plants, the stomata are open during the daylight hours, and most damage from sulfur dioxide occurs then. Long-term, low-level exposure to sulfur dioxide can reduce the yields of grain crops such as wheat or barley. In areas with high levels of sulfur dioxide pollution, plants may be damaged by sulfuric acid aerosols formed by oxidation of SO2. Such damage appears as small spots where sulfuric acid droplets have impinged on leaves. One of the more costly effects of sulfur dioxide pollution is deterioration of building materials. Limestone, marble, and dolomite are calcium and/or magnesium carbonate minerals that are attacked by atmospheric sulfur dioxide to form products that are either water-soluble or composed of poorly adherent solid crusts on the rock\u2019s surface, adversely affecting the appearance, structural integrity, and life of the building. Although both SO2 and NOx attack such stone, chemical analysis of the crusts shows predominantly sulfate salts. Dolomite, a calcium/magnesium carbonate mineral, reacts with atmospheric sulfur dioxide as follows: CaCO3\u00b7 MgCO3 + 2SO2 + O2 + 9H2O \u00c6 CaSO4\u00b7 2H2O + MgSO4\u00b7 7H2O + 2CO2 (11.17) 11.5.2 SULFUR DIOXIDE REMOVAL Several kinds of processes are being used to remove sulfur and sulfur oxides from fuel before combustion and from stack gas after combustion. Most of these efforts concentrate on coal, since it is the major source of sulfur oxides pollution. Physical separation techniques may be used to remove discrete particles of pyritic sulfur from coal. Chemical methods may also be employed for removing sulfur from coal. Fluidized bed combustion of coal can largely eliminate SO2 emissions at the point of combustion. The process consists of burning granular coal in a bed of finely divided limestone or dolomite maintained in a fluid-like condition by air injection. Heat calcines the limestone, CaCO3 \u00c6 CaO + CO2 (11.18) and the lime produced absorbs SO2: CaO + SO2 \u00c6 CaSO3 (which may be oxidized to CaSO4) (11.19) Many processes have been proposed or studied for the removal of sulfur dioxide from stack gas. These vary by the nature of the adsorbent, the means of contacting flue gas with the adsorbent, and whether or not the final product is dry. Sorbents include CaCO3 (limestone), CaCO3 \u00b7 MgCO3 (dolomite), Ca(OH)2 (lime), alkaline fly ash from coal combustion, sodium sulfi te solution, sodium carbonate and soda ash, soda liquor waste from production of trona (a sodium carbonate mineral), and magnesium oxide. Flue gas may be contacted with adsorbents by spray processes, spray dry processes in which the water in the absorbent solution is evaporated and dry solid residue collected, venturi systems, packed beds, bubbling reactors, and trays. Wet processes are the most TABLE 11.1 Major Stack Gas Scrubbing Systems Signif cant Advantages or Process Reaction Disadvantages Lime slurry scrubbinga Ca(OH)2 + SO2 \u00c6 CaSO3 + H2O Up to 200 kg of lime are needed per metric ton of coal, producing large amounts of wastes Limestone slurry scrubbinga CaCO3 + SO2 \u00c6 CaSO3 + CO2(g) Less basic than lime slurry, not so effi cient Magnesium oxide scrubbing Mg(OH)2(slurry) + SO2 \u00c6 MgSO3 + H2O The sorbent can be regenerated, which can be done off site Sodium-base scrubbing Na2SO3 + H2O + SO2 \u00c6 2NaHSO3 No major technological limitations 2NaHSO3 + heat \u00c6 Na2SO3 + H2O + SO2 Relatively high annual costs (regeneration) Double alkalia 2NaOH + SO2 \u00c6 Na2SO3 + H2O Allows for regeneration of expensive Ca(OH)2 + Na2SO3 \u00c6 CaSO3(s) + 2NaOH sodium alkali solution with less (regeneration of NaOH) costly lime Source: Lunt, Richard R. and John D. Cunic, Profiles in Flue Gas Desulfurization, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, New York, 2000. a These processes have also been adapted to produce a gypsum product by oxidation of CaSO3 in the spent scrubber medium: CaSO3 + 12 O2 + 2H2O \u00c6 CaSO4\u20222H2O(s). Gypsum has some commercial value, such as in the manufacture of plasterboard, and makes a relatively settleable waste product. commonly used. Table 11.1 summarizes some stack gas scrubbing systems including throwaway and recovery systems.", "The wet systems commonly employed to remove sulfur dioxide from flue gas provide a number of challenges including scaling, corrosion, general messiness of slurries, and cooling of the gas that requires subsequent heating of the gas so that it will rise in the stack. Therefore, dry systems would be more desirable, but they have not proven to be particularly effective. A dry throwaway system used with only limited success involves the injection of dry limestone or dolomite into the boiler followed by recovery of dry lime, sulfites, and sulfates. The overall reaction, shown here for dolomite, is the following: CaCO \u00b7MgCO + SO + 1O \u00c6 CaSO + MgO +2CO (11.20) 3 3222 4 2 The solid sulfate and oxide products are removed by electrostatic precipitators or cyclone separators. The process has an efficiency of 50% or less for the removal of sulfur oxides. As seen from the reactions shown in Table 11.1, all wet sulfur dioxide removal processes, except for catalytic oxidation, depend upon the absorption of SO2 by reaction with a base. Most scrubbing processes produce a solution of calcium sulfi te, CaSO3, and solid calcium sulfi te hemihydrate, CaSO \u00b7 1HO()s may form as well. Gypsum is formed in the scrubbing process by the oxidation 32 2 of sulfi te, 2-2 SO + 1O \u00c6 SO 322 4 (11.21) followed by a reaction of sulfate ion with a calcium ion: 2+ 2 Ca + SO + 2HO CaSO \u00b72H O()s 42 42 (11.22) Gypsum is the desired final product and is commonly used to produce wallboard as a commercial product (mentioned as an example of the practice of industrial ecology in Section 17.15). Some systems blow air into the calcium sulfite product to oxidize it to calcium sulfate in a forced oxidation system. Recovery systems in which sulfur dioxide or elemental sulfur are removed from the spent sorbing material, which is recycled, are much more desirable from an environmental viewpoint than are throwaway systems. Many kinds of recovery processes have been investigated, including those that involve scrubbing with magnesium oxide slurry, sodium hydroxide solution, sodium sulfi te solution, ammonia solution, or sodium citrate solution. Sulfur dioxide recovered from a stack-gas-scrubbing process can be converted to hydrogen sulfide by reaction with synthesis gas (H2, CO, CH4) SO2 + (H2, CO, CH4) \u00c6 H2S + CO2(H2O) (11.23) The Claus reaction is then employed to produce elemental sulfur: 2H2S + SO2 \u00c6 2H2O + 3S (11.24) The elemental sulfur product is a commercially valuable material used to make sulfuric acid. The recovery of sulfur by this means is a good example of a green chemical process. 11.6 NITROGEN OXIDES IN THE ATMOSPHERE The three oxides of nitrogen normally encountered in the atmosphere are nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In addition, nitrate radical, NO3, is an important species involved in the nightime chemistry of photochemical smog (see Section 13.5; this species is not important in daytime chemistry because it undergoes photodissociation very rapidly in sunlight). The chemistry of nitrogen oxides and other reactive inorganic nitrogen species is very important in the atmosphere in areas such as formation of photochemical smog, production of acid rain, and depletion of stratospheric ozone. Nitrous oxide, a commonly used anesthetic known as \u201claughing gas,\u201d is produced by microbiological processes and is a component of the unpolluted atmosphere at a level of approximately 0.3 ppm (see Table 9.1). This gas is relatively unreactive and probably does not signifi cantly infl uence important chemical reactions in the lower atmosphere. Its concentration decreases rapidly with altitude in the stratosphere due to the photochemical reaction N2O + hn\u00c6 N2 + O (11.25) and some reaction with singlet atomic oxygen: N2O + O \u00c6 N2 + O2 (11.26) N2O + O \u00c6 2NO (11.27) These reactions are significant in terms of depletion of the ozone layer. Increased global fi xation of nitrogen, accompanied by increased microbial production of N2O, could contribute to ozone layer depletion. Colorless, odorless nitric oxide (NO) and pungent red-brown nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are very important in polluted air. Collectively designated NOx, these gases enter the atmosphere from natural sources, such as lightning and biological processes, and from pollutant sources. The latter are much more significant because of regionally high NO2 concentrations which can cause severe air quality deterioration. Estimates of the quantities of NOx entering the atmosphere vary widely, but generally range from a few tens of millions of metric tons per year to somewhat more than 100 million.", "The biggest share of anthropogenic NOx amounting to around 20 million metric tons per year enters the atmosphere from combustion of fossil fuels in both stationary and mobile sources. A similar amount of NOx is emitted from soil, much of it from the action of microorganisms on nitrogen fertilizer. Other natural sources are biomass burning, lightning, and, to a lesser extent, atmospheric oxidation of NH3. There is a relatively small flux of NOx from the stratosphere to the troposphere. The contribution of automobiles to nitric oxide production in the United States has become somewhat lower in the last decade as newer automobiles have replaced older models. Most NOx entering the atmosphere from pollution sources does so as NO generated from internal combustion engines. At very high temperatures, the following overall reaction occurs with intermediate steps: N2 + O2 \u00c6 2NO (11.28) The speed with which this reaction takes place increases steeply with temperature. The equilibrium concentration of NO in a mixture of 3% O2 and 75% N2, typical of that which occurs in the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine, is shown as a function of temperature in Figure 11.2. At room temperature (27\u00b0C) the equilibrium concentration of NO is only 1.1 \u00a5 10-10 ppm, whereas at high temperatures it is much higher. Therefore, high temperatures favor both a high equilibrium concentration and a rapid rate of formation of NO. Rapid cooling of the exhaust gas from combustion \u201cfreezes\u201d NO at a relatively high concentration because equilibrium is not maintained. Thus, by its very nature, the combustion process both in the internal combustion engine and in furnaces produces high levels of NO in the combustion products. The mechanism for the formation of nitrogen oxides from N2 and O2 during combustion is a complicated process. Both oxygen and nitrogen atoms are formed at the very high combustion temperatures by the reactions O2 + M \u00c6 O + O + M (11.29) N2 + M \u00c6 N\u2211+ N\u2211+ M (11.30) where M is a third body highly energized by heat that imparts enough energy to the molecular N2 and O2 to break their chemical bonds. The energies required for these reactions are quite high because breakage of the oxygen bond requires 118 kcal/mol and breakage of the nitrogen bond requires 225 kcal/mol. Because of its relatively weaker bond, dissociation of O2 predominates over 4 3 2 1 0 \u20131 500 T (\u02daC) Log NO conc. (ppm) FIGURE 11.2 Log of equilibrium NO concentration as a function of temperature in a mixture containing 75% N2 and 3% O2. that of N2. Once formed, O and N atoms participate in the following chain reaction for the formation of nitric oxide from nitrogen and oxygen: N2 + O \u00c6 NO + N (11.31) N + O2 \u00c6 NO + O (11.32) Leading to the net reaction: N2 + O2 \u00c6 2NO (11.33) There are, of course, many other species present in the combustion mixture besides those shown. The oxygen atoms are especially reactive toward hydrocarbon fragments by reactions such as the following: RH + O \u00c6 R\u2211+ HO\u2211 (11.34) where R\u2211 represents a hydrocarbon fragment of a molecule from which a hydrogen atom has been extracted. These fragments compete with N2 for oxygen atoms. It is partly for this reason that the formation of NO is appreciably higher at air/fuel ratios exceeding the stoichiometric ratio (lean mixture), as shown in Figure 13.3. The hydroxyl radical itself can participate in the formation of NO. The reaction is N + HO\u2211\u00c6 NO + H\u2211 (11.35) Nitric oxide, NO, is a product of the combustion of coal and petroleum containing chemically bound nitrogen. Production of NO by this route occurs at much lower temperatures than those required for \u201cthermal\u201d NO, discussed previously. 11.6.1 ATMOSPHERIC REACTIONS OF NO x Atmospheric chemical reactions convert NOx to nitric acid, inorganic nitrate salts, organic nitrates, and peroxyacetyl nitrate (see Chapter 13). The principal reactive nitrogen oxide species in the troposphere are NO, NO2, and HNO3. These species cycle among each other, as shown in Figure 11.3. Although NO is the primary form in which NOx is released to the atmosphere, the conversion of NO to NO2 is relatively rapid in the troposphere. Nitrogen oxide sources, such as com Nitrogen dioxide is a very reactive and significant species in the atmosphere. It absorbs light throughout the ultraviolet and visible spectrum penetrating the troposphere. At wavelengths below 398 nm, photodissociation occurs, NO2 + hn\u00c6", "NO + O (11.36) to produce ground state oxygen atoms. Above 430 nm, only excited molecules of NO2 are formed, NO2 + hn\u00c6 NO*2 (11.37) whereas at wavelengths between 398 and 430 nm, either process may occur. Photodissociation at these wavelengths requires input of rotational energy from rotation of the NO2 molecule. The tendency of NO2 to photodissociate is shown clearly by the fact that in direct sunlight the half-life of NO2 is much shorter than that of any other common molecular atmospheric species. (The steady-state level of NO2 may remain relatively high because it rapidly forms again from NO through the action of oxidant-free radical species.) The photodissociation of nitrogen dioxide can give rise to the following signifi cant inorganic reactions in addition to a host of atmospheric reactions involving organic species: O + O2 + M (third body) \u00c6 O3 + M (11.38) NO + O3 \u00c6 NO2 + O2 (11.39) This reaction results in rapid conversion of NO to NO2 and during the daytime NO2 is rapidly converted back to NO by Reaction 11.36. In the absence of photodissociation at night, NO2 predominates over NO. NO2 + O3 \u00c6 NO3 + O2 (11.40) The NO3 product undergoes rapid photodissociation in daytime, but builds up at night. As discussed in Chapter 13, NO3 plays a role in atmospheric chemical processes at night, including those involved in photochemical smog formation. O + NO2 \u00c6 NO + O2 (11.41) O + NO2 + M \u00c6 NO3 + M (11.42) NO2 + NO3 \u00c6 N2O5 (11.43) NO + NO3 \u00c6 2NO2 (11.44) O + NO + M \u00c6 NO2 + M (11.45) Nitrogen dioxide ultimately is removed from the atmosphere as nitric acid, nitrates, or (in atmospheres where photochemical smog is formed) as organic nitrogen. Dinitrogen pentoxide formed in Reaction 11.43 is the anhydride of nitric acid, which it forms by reacting with water: N2O5 + H2O \u00c6 2HNO3 (11.46) In the stratosphere, nitrogen dioxide reacts with hydroxyl radicals to produce nitric acid: HO\u2211+ NO2 \u00c6 HNO3 (11.47) In this region, the nitric acid can also be destroyed by hydroxyl radicals, HO\u2211+ HNO3 \u00c6 H2O + NO3 (11.48) or by a photochemical reaction, HNO3 + hn\u00c6 HO\u2211+ NO2 (11.49) so that HNO3 serves as a temporary sink for NO2 in the stratosphere. Nitric acid produced from NO2 is removed as precipitation, or reacts with bases (ammonia, particulate lime) to produce particulate nitrates. Reactions of both nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide in power plant plumes are important in the environmental fate and transport of NOx and SO2. The presence of water vapor and droplets as well as particles may facilitate reactions of NOx and SO2 in plumes. 11.6.2 HARMFUL EFFECTS OF NITROGEN OXIDES Nitric oxide, NO, is less toxic than NO2. Like carbon monoxide and nitrite, NO attaches to hemoglobin and reduces oxygen transport effi ciency. However, in a polluted atmosphere, the concentration of nitric oxide normally is much lower than that of carbon monoxide so that the effect on hemoglobin is much less. Acute exposure to NO2 can be quite harmful to human health. For exposures ranging from several minutes to one hour, a level of 50\u2013100 ppm of NO2 causes inflammation of lung tissue for a period of 6\u20138 weeks, after which time the subject normally recovers. Exposure of the subject to 150\u2013200 ppm of NO2 causes bronchiolitis fibrosa obliterans, a condition fatal within 3\u20135 weeks after exposure. Death generally results within 2\u201310 days after exposure to 500 ppm or more of NO2. \u201cSilo-filler\u2019s disease,\u201d caused by NO2 generated by the fermentation of ensilage (moist chopped stalks of corn or sorghum used for cattle feed) containing nitrate, is a particularly striking example of nitrogen dioxide poisoning. Deaths have resulted from the inhalation of NO2-containing gases from burning celluloid and nitrocellulose film, and from spillage of NO2 oxidant (used with liquid hydrazine fuel) from missile rocket motors. Although extensive damage to plants is observed in areas receiving heavy exposure to NO2, most of this damage probably comes from secondary products of nitrogen oxides, such as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) formed in smog (see Chapter 14). Exposure of plants to several ppm of NO2 in the laboratory causes leaf spotting and break down of plant tissue. Exposure to 10 ppm of NO causes a reversible decrease in the rate of photosynthesis. The effect on plants of long-term exposure to a few tenths of a ppm of NO2 is less certain.", "Nitrogen oxides are known to cause fading of dyes and inks used in some textiles. This has been observed in gas clothes dryers and is due to NOx formed in the dryer flame. Much of the damage to materials caused by NOx comes from secondary nitrates and nitric acid. For example, stress-corrosion cracking of springs once widely used in telephone relays occurs far below the yield strength of the nickel-brass spring metal because of the action of particulate nitrates and aerosol nitric acid formed from NOx. Concern has been expressed about the possibility that NOx emitted to the atmosphere by supersonic transport planes could catalyze the partial destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer that absorbs damaging short-wavelength (240\u2013300 nm) ultraviolet radiation. This possibility raised initial concerns regarding anthropogenic damage to the stratospheric ozone layer around 1970. Detailed consideration of this effect is quite complicated, and only the main features are considered here. In the upper stratosphere and in the mesosphere, molecular oxygen is photodissociated by ultraviolet light of less than 242-nm wavelength: O2 + hn\u00c6 O + O (11.50) In the presence of energy-absorbing third bodies, the atomic oxygen reacts with molecular oxygen to produce ozone: O2 + O + M \u00c6 O3 + M (11.51) Ozone can be destroyed by reaction with atomic oxygen, O3 + O \u00c6 O2 + O2 (11.52) and its formation can be prevented by recombination of oxygen atoms: O + O + M \u00c6 O2 + M (11.53) Addition of the reaction of nitric oxide with ozone, NO + O3 \u00c6 NO2 + O2 (11.54) to the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with atomic oxygen, NO2 + O \u00c6 NO + O2 (11.55) results in a net reaction for the destruction of ozone: O + O3 \u00c6 O2 + O2 (11.56) Along with NOx, water vapor is also emitted into the atmosphere by aircraft exhausts, which could accelerate ozone depletion by the following two reactions: O + H2O \u00c6 HO\u2211+ HO\u2211 (11.57) HO\u2211+ O3 \u00c6 HOO\u2211+ O2 (11.58) However, there are many natural stratospheric buffering reactions, which tend to mitigate the poten tial ozone destruction from those reactions outlined above. Atomic oxygen capable of regenerating ozone is produced by the photochemical reaction NO2 + hn\u00c6 NO + O (l < 420 nm) (11.59) A competing reaction removing catalytic NO is NO + HOO\u2211\u00c6 NO2 + HO\u2211 (11.60) Current belief is that emissions from even relatively large fleets of supersonic aircraft (unlikely in light of the 2003 demise of the Concorde aircraft) will not cause nearly as much damage to the ozone layer as CFCs. 11.6.3 CONTROL OF NITROGEN OXIDES As noted in Section 10.9, nitrogen oxides compose a class of the six criteria pollutants regulated by the U.S. EPA. Furthermore, they are involved in the formation of tropospheric ozone, O3, another of the regulated criteria pollutants. As discussed in Chapter 13, both hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides are the required ingredients for the production of ozone and other noxious species in the photochemical smog forming process. Initially, efforts to control such production of ozone were concentrated on reducing emissions of volatile organic hydrocarbons. However, in most cases nitrogen oxides are the limiting reactants in the production of photochemical smog and ozone so that control of nitrogen oxides emissions is very important in reducing tropospheric air pollution. There are two general approaches to the control of NOx emissions. The first of these is modifi cation of combustion conditions to prevent formation of NO and the second is treatment of flue gas to remove NOx before it is released to the atmosphere.4 The level of NOx emitted from stationary sources such as power plant furnaces generally falls within the range of 50\u20131000 ppm. NO production is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically by high temperatures and by high excess oxygen concentrations and increases with increasing time of exposure to these conditions. Reduction of these three conditions during combustion lowers the amount of NO formed. Reduction of flame temperature to prevent NO formation is accomplished by adding recirculated exhaust gas, cool air, inert gases, or water, although this decreases the efficiency of energy conversion as calculated by the Carnot equation (see Chapter 19). Low-excess-air firing is effective in reducing NOx emissions during the combustion of fossil fuels. As the term implies, low-excess-air firing uses the minimum amount of excess air required for oxidation of the fuel, so that less oxygen is available for the reaction N2 + O2 \u00c6 2NO (11.61) in the high-temperature region of the flame.", "Incomplete fuel burnout with the emission of hydrocarbons, soot, and CO is an obvious problem with low-excess-air firing. This may be overcome by a two-stage combustion process consisting of the following steps: 1. A fi rst stage in which the fuel is fi red at a relatively high temperature with a substoichiometric amount of air, for example, 90\u201395% of the stoichiometric requirement. NO formation is limited by the absence of excess oxygen. 2. A second stage in which fuel burnout is completed at a relatively low temperature in excess air. The low temperature prevents formation of NO. In some gas-fired power plants, the emission of NO has been reduced by as much as 90% by a two-stage combustion process. Removal of NOx from stack gas presents some formidable problems. Possible approaches to NOx removal are catalytic decomposition of nitrogen oxides, catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, and sorption of NOx by liquids or solids; sorption is limited by the low water solubility of NO, the predominant nitrogen oxide species in stack gas. Commonly used NOx reduction processes use a reducing agent such as methane or ammonia to reduce the N oxide to elemental N2 and H2O over a honeycombed catalyst of vanadium and tungsten oxides on an alumina (Al2O3) support as shown by the following reaction in which ammonia is the reducing agent 4NH3 + 4NO + O2 \u00c6 4N2 + 6H2O (11.62) Denoted as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) the catalytic reduction of NOx is carried out over a catalyst at 300\u2013400\u00b0C with about 80% efficiency. It can also be carried out without a catalyst at a much higher temperature of 900\u20131000\u00b0C, but that is only 40\u201360% effi cient. Sorption processes for SO2 removal using bases are relatively ineffective in removing nitric oxide because of the low acidity and low water solubility of NO. Proposals have been made for oxidation of NO to NO2 and N2O3, which are more efficiently absorbed by base. The NO X SO regenerable dry sorbent process uses sodium carbonate on high-surface-area alumina beads to absorb SO2 and NOx in a fluidized bed through which the flue gas is passed. The beads are regenerated to restore their sorptive properties. An interesting possibility for NOx control is the use of biofi lters.5 A relatively new development in air pollution control, biofilters employ microorganisms in a fixed or fluidized bed confi guration to contact gases and absorb pollutants. The microorganisms degrade pollutants retained on the fi ltration media and produce innocuous products (in the case of sorbed N compounds, N2 is the favored product). Ideally, biofilters operate at relatively low cost and with low maintenance. However, the challenge of maintaining a viable biofilter in the exhaust stream of a large power plant is daunting. 11.7 ACID RAIN As discussed in this chapter, much of the sulfur and nitrogen oxides entering the atmosphere are converted to sulfuric and nitric acids, respectively. When combined with hydrochloric acid arising from hydrogen chloride emissions, these acids cause acidic precipitation (acid rain) that is now a major pollution problem in some areas. Headwater streams and high-altitude lakes are especially susceptible to the effects of acid rain and may sustain loss of fish and other aquatic life. Other effects include reductions in forest and crop productivity; leaching of nutrient cations and heavy metals from soils, rocks, and the sediments of lakes and streams; dissolution of metals such as lead and copper from water distribution pipes; corrosion of exposed metal; and dissolution of the surfaces of limestone buildings and monuments. Dissolution of phytotoxic aluminum from soil by acidic precipitation is especially detrimental to plant and forest growth. As a result of its widespread distribution and effects, acid rain is an air pollutant that may pose a threat to the global atmosphere. Therefore, it is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 14. 11.8 AMMONIA IN THE ATMOSPHERE Ammonia, one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing species in the atmosphere, is present even in unpolluted air as a result of natural biochemical and chemical processes. Among the various sources of atmospheric ammonia are microorganisms in soil, decay of animal wastes, ammonia fertilizer, sewage treatment, coke manufacture, ammonia manufacture, and leakage from ammonia-based refrigeration systems. Livestock and the feedlots in which they are kept are the largest source category of ammonia in the United States with production of probably more than a billion kilogram per year.6 High concentrations of ammonia gas in the atmosphere are generally indicative of accidental release of the gas.", "Ammonia is removed from the atmosphere by its affinity for water and by its action as a base; it is the major atmospheric base. It is a key species in the formation and neutralization of nitrate and sulfate aerosols in polluted atmospheres. Ammonia reacts with these acidic aerosols to form ammonium salts: NH3 + HNO3 \u00c6 NH4NO3 (11.63) NH3 + H2SO4 \u00c6 NH4HSO4 (11.64) Atmospheric ammonia may have a number of effects. Ammonium salts are among the more corrosive salts in atmospheric aerosols. Roughly half of the very small particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere of the eastern United States consists of ammonium sulfate, signifi cantly affecting visibility. Ammonia may affect vegetation with acute exposures causing visible foliar injury. 11.9 FLUORINE, CHLORINE, AND THEIR GASEOUS COMPOUNDS Fluorine, hydrogen fluoride, and other volatile fluorides are produced in the manufacture of aluminum, and hydrogen fluoride is a byproduct in the conversion of fluorapatite (rock phosphate) to phosphoric acid, superphosphate fertilizers, and other phosphorus products. The wet process for the production of phosphoric acid involves the reaction of fl uorapatite, Ca5F(PO4)3, with sulfuric acid: Ca5F(PO4)3 + 5H2SO4 + 10H2O \u00c6 5CaSO4\u00b7 2H2O + HF + 3H3PO4 (11.65) It is necessary to recover most of the by-product fluorine from rock phosphate processing to avoid severe pollution problems. Recovery as fluorosilicic acid, H2SiF6, is normally practiced. Hydrogen fluoride gas is a dangerous substance that is so corrosive it even reacts with glass. It is irritating to body tissues, and the respiratory tract is very sensitive to it. Brief exposure to HF vapors at the part-per-thousand level may be fatal. The acute toxicity of F2 is even higher than that of HF. Chronic exposure to high levels of fluorides causes fluorosis, the symptoms of which include mottled teeth and pathological bone conditions. Plants are particularly susceptible to the effects of gaseous fluorides, which appear to enter the leaf tissue through the stomata. Fluoride is a cumulative poison in plants, and exposure of sensitive plants to even very low levels of fluorides for prolonged periods results in damage. Characteristic symptoms of fluoride poisoning are chlorosis (fading of green color due to conditions other than the absence of light), edge burn, and tip burn. Conifers (such as pine trees) afflicted with fluoride poisoning may have reddish-brown, necrotic needle tips. The sensitivity of some conifers to fluoride poisoning is illustrated by the fact that fluorine produced by aluminum plants in Norway has destroyed forests of Pinus sylvestris up to 8 miles distant; trees were damaged at distances as great as 20 miles. Silicon tetrafl uoride gas, SiF4, is another gaseous fl uoride pollutant produced during some steel and metal smelting operations that employ CaF2, fluorspar. Fluorspar reacts with silicon dioxide (sand), releasing SiF4 gas: 2CaF2 + 3SiO2 \u00c6 2CaSiO3 + SiF4 (11.66) Another gaseous fluorine compound, sulfur hexafl uoride, SF6, occurs in the atmosphere at levels of about 0.3 parts per trillion. It is extremely unreactive with an atmospheric lifetime estimated at 3200 years, and is used as an atmospheric tracer. It does not absorb ultraviolet light in either the troposphere or the stratosphere, and is probably destroyed above 60 km by reactions beginning with its capture of free electrons. Current atmospheric levels of SF6 are significantly higher than the estimated background level of 0.04 parts per trillion in 1953 when commercial production of it began. The compound is very useful in specialized applications including gas-insulated electrical equipment and inert blanketing/degassing of molten aluminum and magnesium. Increasing uses of sulfur hexafl uoride have caused concern because it is the most powerful greenhouse gas known, with a global warming potential (per molecule added to the atmosphere) about 23,900 times that of carbon dioxide. 11.9.1 CHLORINE AND HYDROGEN CHLORIDE Chlorine gas, Cl2, does not occur as an air pollutant on a large scale but can be quite damaging on a local scale. Chlorine was the fi rst poisonous gas deployed in World War I. It is widely used as a manufacturing chemical in the plastics industry, for example, as well as for water treatment and as a bleach. Therefore, possibilities for its release exist in a number of locations. Chlorine is quite toxic and is a mucous-membrane irritant. It is very reactive and a powerful oxidizing agent. Chlorine dissolves in atmospheric water droplets, yielding hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid, an oxidizing agent: H2O + Cl2 \u00c6 H++ Cl-+ HOCl (11.67) Spills of chlorine gas have caused fatalities among exposed persons.", "For example, the rupture of a derailed chlorine tank car at Youngstown, Florida, on February 25, 1978, resulted in the death of eight people who inhaled the deadly gas, and a total of 89 people were injured. Massive chlorine releases from sabotage are a major concern with respect to terrorism. Hydrogen chloride, HCl, is emitted from a number of sources. Incineration of chlorinated plastics, such as PVC, a polymer of vinyl chloride with an empirical formula of C2H3Cl, releases HCl as a combustion product. Some compounds released to the atmosphere as air pollutants hydrolyze to form HCl. Accidents have occurred in which compounds such as silicon tetrachloride, SiCl4, and aluminum chloride, AlCl3, have been released and reacted with atmospheric water vapor: SiCl4 + 2H2O \u00c6 SiO2 + 4HCl (11.68) AlCl3 + 3H2O \u00c6 Al(OH)3 + 3HCl (11.69) Hydrogen chloride may be evolved from inorganic chloride salts, such as NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2, at high temperatures in the presence of SO2, O2, and H2O by the process of sulfation. The overall reaction of sulfation is illustrated below for CaCl2: CaCl + 1O + SO + HO \u00c6 CaSO + 2HC1 2 22 2 2 4 (11.70) As discussed in Section 10.11, it is now believed that deliquesced (moist) chloride particles can react with hydroxyl radical: 2NaCl + 2HO\u2211\u00c6 2NaOH + Cl2 (10.14) This leaves a basic surface conducive to the retention and oxidation of SO2. Hydrolysis of released Cl2 can produce HCl, contributing to acidic material in the atmosphere: Cl2 + H2O \u00c6 HCl + HOCl (11.71) 11.10 REDUCED SULFUR GASES Hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide (OCS), carbon disulfi de (CS2), and dimethyl sulfi de (S(CH3)2) are important gaseous compounds in the atmosphere in which the sulfur is in a lower oxidation state. These gases are oxidized in the atmosphere to sulfate, in some cases with production of intermediate SO2, and are important sources of atmospheric sulfur. Hydrogen sulfide is produced by microbial processes including the decay of sulfur compounds and bacterial reduction of sulfate (see Chapter 6). Hydrogen sulfide is also released from geothermal steam, from wood pulping, and from a number of miscellaneous natural and anthropogenic sources. Approximately 8 \u00a5 109 kg (8 Tg) of H2S are released to the global atmosphere annually. Because it is so readily oxidized, most atmospheric hydrogen sulfide is rapidly converted to SO2. The organic homologs of hydrogen sulfide, the mercaptans, enter the atmosphere from decaying organic matter and have particularly objectionable odors. Hydrogen sulfide pollution from artificial sources is not nearly so widespread as sulfur dioxide pollution. However, there have been several acute incidents of hydrogen sulfide emissions resulting in damage to human health and even fatalities. One of the most notorious such episodes occurred in Poza Rica, Mexico, in 1950. Accidental release of hydrogen sulfide from a plant used for the recovery of sulfur from natural gas caused the deaths of 22 people and the hospitalization of more than 300, although some unofficial reports have put the number of fatalities much higher. In December 2003, a blowout of natural gas contaminated with hydrogen sulfide killed 242 people and seriously injured more than 2000 in China. As an emergency measure, the gas was set on fire, which produced copious quantities of sulfur dioxide, still an air pollutant, but not nearly so deadly as hydrogen sulfide. Efforts to tap very deep natural gas formations have increased the danger of accidental hydrogen sulfi de release. Hydrogen sulfide in \u201csour\u201d natural gas has posed an increasing problem as larger amounts of relatively abundant sour natural gas are tapped for energy. The problem is especially acute in Alberta, Canada, which has some of the world\u2019s most abundant sour natural gas. Recovery of the hydrogen sulfide and conversion to elemental sulfur has caused the supply of sulfur to exceed demand. Now, increasing amounts of hydrogen sulfide accompanied by carbon dioxide, another acidic component of sour natural gas are being injected into underground formations.7 Hydrogen sulfide at levels well above ambient concentrations destroys immature plant tissue. This type of plant injury is readily distinguished from that due to other phytotoxins. More sensitive species are killed by continuous exposure to around 3000 ppb (parts per billion by volume) H2S, whereas other species exhibit reduced growth, leaf lesions, and defoliation. Damage to certain kinds of materials is a very expensive effect of hydrogen sulfi de pollution.", "Paints containing lead pigments, 2PbCO3 \u00b7 Pb(OH)2 (no longer used), are particularly susceptible to darkening by H2S. Darkening results from exposure over several hours to as little as 50 ppb H2S. The lead sulfide originally produced by reaction of the lead pigment with hydrogen sulfi de eventually may be converted to white lead sulfate by atmospheric oxygen after removal of the source of H2S, thus partially reversing the damage. A black layer of copper sulfide forms on copper metal exposed to H2S. Eventually, this layer is replaced by a green coating of basic copper sulfate, CuSO4 \u00b7 3Cu(OH)2. The green \u201cpatina,\u201d as it is called, is very resistant to further corrosion. Such layers of corrosion can seriously impair the function of copper contacts on electrical equipment. Hydrogen sulfide also forms a black sulfi de coating on silver. Carbonyl sulfide, OCS, is now recognized as a component of the atmosphere at a tropospheric concentration of approximately 500 parts per trillion by volume, corresponding to a global burden of about 2.4 Tg. Approximately 1.3 Tg of carbonyl sulfide is released to the atmosphere annually. About half that amount of carbon disulfi de, CS2, is released to the atmosphere annually. Carbonyl sulfide has an atmospheric lifetime of approximately 18 months and is the longest-lived of the common reduced sulfur gases in the atmosphere. Both OCS and CS2 are oxidized in the atmosphere by reactions initiated by the hydroxyl radical. The initial reactions are HO\u2211+ OCS \u00c6 CO2 + HS\u2211 (11.72) HO\u2211+ CS2 \u00c6 OCS + HS\u2211 (11.73) These reactions with hydroxyl radical initiate oxidation processes that occur through a series of atmospheric chemical reactions. The sulfur-containing products that are initially formed as shown by Reactions 11.72 and 11.73 undergo further reactions to sulfur dioxide and, eventually, to sulfate species. The reaction of carbonyl sulfide with hydroxyl radical is so slow that it is probably a minor pathway for OCS loss in the troposphere. This gas is metabolized by higher plant carbonic anhydrase, which normally metabolizes carbon dioxide, and uptake by higher plants is believed to be a signifi cant sink for carbonyl sulfi de. Carbonyl sulfide is so long-lived that significant amounts of it reach the stratosphere. Here it can undergo photolysis, leading to the following sequence of reactions: OCS + hn\u00c6 CO + S (11.74) O + OCS \u00c6 CO + SO (11.75) S + O2 \u00c6 SO + O (11.76) SO + O2 \u00c6 SO2 + O (11.77) SO + NO2 \u00c6 SO2 + NO (11.78) The sulfur dioxide produced by these reactions is eventually oxidized to sulfate and sulfuric acid aerosol. This produces a stratospheric aerosol layer extending from the bottom of the stratosphere to an altitude of approximately 30 km. Named after Christian Junge, who discovered it in 1960 while searching for cosmic dust and debris from nuclear weapons testing, this layer is called the Junge layer. LITERATURE CITED 1.

The effects of organic pollutants in the atmosphere may be divided into two major categories. The first consists of direct effects, such as cancer caused by exposure to vinyl chloride. The second is the formation of secondary pollutants, especially photochemical smog (discussed in detail in Chapter 13). In the case of pollutant hydrocarbons in the atmosphere, the latter is the more important effect. In some localized situations, particularly the workplace, direct effects of organic air pollutants may be equally important. This chapter discusses the nature and distribution of organic compounds in the atmosphere. Chapter 13 deals with photochemical smog and addresses the mechanisms by which organic compounds undergo photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. 12.1.1 LOSS OF ORGANIC SUBSTANCES FROM THE ATMOSPHERE Organic contaminants are lost from the atmosphere by a number of routes. These include dissolution in precipitation (rainwater), dry deposition, photochemical reactions, formation of and incorporation into particulate matter, and uptake by plants. Reactions of organic atmospheric contaminants are particularly important in determining their manner and rates of loss from the atmosphere. Such reactions are discussed in this chapter. Forest trees present a large surface area to the atmosphere and are particularly important in fi ltering organic contaminants from air. Forest trees and plants contact the atmosphere through plant cuticle layers, the biopolymer \u201cskin\u201d on the leaves, and needles of the plants. The cuticle layer is lipophilic, meaning that it has a particular affinity for organic substances, including those in the atmosphere. Uptake increases with increasing lipophilicity of the compounds and with increasing surface area of the leaves. This phenomenon points to the importance of forests in atmospheric purification and illustrates an important kind of interaction between the atmosphere and the biosphere. 12.1.2 GLOBAL DISTILLATION AND FRACTIONATION OF PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS (POP)", "Persistent organic pollutants (POP), compounds that are resistant to chemical and biochemical degradation, are significant atmospheric contaminants.1 On a global scale, it is likely that POP undergo a cycle of distillation and fractionation in which they are vaporized into the atmosphere in warmer regions of the Earth and condense and are deposited in colder regions. The theory of this phenomenon holds that the distribution of such pollutants is governed by their physicochemical properties and the temperature conditions to which they are exposed. As a result, the least volatile POP are deposited near their sources, those of relatively high volatility are distilled into polar regions, and those of intermediate volatility are deposited predominantly at mid-latitudes. This phenomenon has some important implications regarding the accumulation of POP in environmentally fragile polar regions far from industrial sources. 12.2 BIOGENIC ORGANIC COMPOUNDS Biogenic organic compounds in the atmosphere are those produced by organisms. Biogenic compounds are abundant in the atmosphere of forest regions and are significant participants in the atmospheric chemistry of these regions.2 Natural sources are the most important contributors of organics to the atmosphere, and hydrocarbons generated and released by human activities constitute only about one-seventh of the total hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. The release to the atmosphere of organic compounds by organisms is a very important kind of interaction between the atmosphere and the biosphere. Other than methane released primarily by bacteria (see below), the greatest source of biogenic organic compounds in the atmosphere is vegetation. Various plants release hydrocarbons, including isoprene, C10H16 monoterpenes, and C15H24 sesquiterpenes. Oxygenated compounds are released in smaller quantities, but in a great variety, including alcohols, such as methanol and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol; ketones, such as 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one; and hexene derivatives. The heavy preponderance of biogenic organic compounds in the atmosphere is in large part the result of the huge quantities of methane produced by anoxic bacteria in the decomposition of organic matter in water, sediments, and soil: 2{CH2O}(bacterial action) \u00c6 CO2(g) + CH4(g) (12.1) Flatulent emissions from domesticated animals, arising from bacterial decomposition of food in their digestive tracts, add about 85 million metric tons of methane to the atmosphere each year. Anoxic conditions in intensively cultivated rice fields produce large amounts of methane, perhaps as much as 100 million metric tons per year. Methane is a natural constituent of the atmosphere and is present at a level of about 1.8 ppm in the troposphere. Methane in the troposphere contributes to the photochemical production of carbon monoxide and ozone. The photochemical oxidation of methane is a major source of water vapor in the stratosphere. As the most important natural source of nonmethane biogenic compounds, it is possible that vegetation emits thousands of different organic compounds to the atmosphere. Other natural sources include microorganisms, forest fires, animal wastes, and volcanoes. One of the simplest organic compounds given off by plants is ethylene, C2H4. This compound is produced by a variety of plants and released to the atmosphere in its role as a messenger species regulating plant growth. Because of its double bond, ethylene is highly reactive with hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211, and with oxidizing species in the atmosphere. Ethylene from vegetation sources is an active participant in atmospheric chemical processes. Most of the hydrocarbons emitted by plants are terpenes, which constitute a large class of organic compounds found in essential oils. Essential oils are obtained when parts of some types of plants are subjected to steam distillation. Most of the plants that produce terpenes are conifers (evergreen trees and shrubs such as pine and cypress), plants of the genus Myrtus, and trees and shrubs of the genus Citrus. One of the most common terpenes emitted by trees is a-pinene, a principal component of turpentine. The terpene limonene, found in citrus fruit and pine needles, is encountered in the atmosphere around these sources. Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), a hemiterpene, has been identifi ed in the emissions from cottonwood, eucalyptus, oak, sweetgum, and white spruce trees. Linalool is a terpene with the chemical formula (CH3)2C=CHCH2CH2C(CH3)(OH)CH=CH2, which is given off by some plant species common to Italy and Austria, including the pine Pinuspinea and orange blossoms. Other terpenes that are given off by trees include b-pinene, myrcene, ocimene, and a-terpinene. As exemplified by the structural formulas of a-pinene, b-pinene, D3-carene, isoprene, and limonene, shown in Figure 12.1, terpenes contain alkenyl (olefinic) bonds, in some cases, two or more per molecule. Because of these and other structural features, terpenes are among the most reactive compounds in the atmosphere.", "The reaction of terpenes with hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211, is very rapid, and terpenes also react with other oxidizing agents in the atmosphere, particularly ozone, O3, and nitrate radical, NO3. Turpentine, a mixture of terpenes, has been widely used in paint because it reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form a peroxide, then a hard resin. Terpenes such as a-pinene H H H3C CH3 CH3 C C HH H H H HH H H H HH CH H CH3 H CH3H HH3C C CH3HH CH3 CH3 H H H H CH3HH a-Pinene b-Pinene D3-Carene Limonene CH3 H HHOHHH H H3C H CCCC C CCCCCC H H H3C H H HH CH3 Isoprene Linalool FIGURE 12.1 Some common terpenes emitted to the atmosphere by vegetation, primarily trees such as pine and citrus trees. These reactive compounds are involved in the formation of much of the small particulate matter encountered in the atmosphere. and isoprene undergo similar reactions in the atmosphere to form particulate matter. Identifi ed as secondary organic aerosol (SOA), the resulting Aitken nuclei aerosols (see Chapter 10) are a cause of the blue haze in the atmosphere above some heavy growths of vegetation. These SOA particles are a large part of atmospheric fine particulate matter, especially in forested areas.3 Sesquiterpenes consisting of three isoprene units and having the molecular formula C15H24 comprise an important class of terpenes. A common example of a sesquiterpene is d-cadinene: H H3C CH3 C H3C d-Cadinene CH3 Laboratory and smog-chamber experiments have been performed in an effort to determine the fates of atmospheric terpenes. Oxidation initiated by reaction with NO3 of the four cyclic monoterpenes listed above, a-pinene, b-pinene, D3-carene, and limonene, gives products containing carbonyl (C=O) functionality and organically bound nitrogen as organic nitrate. When a mixture of a-pinene with NO and NO2 in air is irradiated with ultraviolet light, pinonic acid is formed: CH3 H Pinonic acid H H Found in forest aerosol particles, this compound is produced by photochemical processes acting upon a-pinene. In addition to products of reactions with NO3 and hydroxyl radical, a significant fraction of the atmospheric aerosol formed as the result of reactions of unsaturated biogenic hydrocarbons results from reactions between them and ozone. Pinonic acid (see above) is produced by the reaction of a-pinene with ozone. Two of the products of the reaction of limonene with ozone are formaldehyde and 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene: O3 H3C H HH HH Limonene 4-Acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene Perhaps the greatest variety of compounds emitted by plants consists of esters. However, they are released in such small quantities that they have little infl uence upon atmospheric chemistry. Esters are primarily responsible for the fragrances associated with much vegetation. Some typical esters that are released by plants to the atmosphere are shown below: H H H H H H O H3C C C C C C C C O C H Citronellyl formate CH3 H H H H CH3 O H H H H OH H H3C C O C C C H3C C O C C C H H H Cinnamyl acetate Ethyl acrylate H H H O HO C C C O C H H3CO Coniferyl benzoate 12.2.1 REMOVAL OF ATMOSPHERIC ORGANIC COMPOUNDS BY PLANTS In addition to being sources of atmospheric organic compounds as discussed above, plants are also repositories of POP thus playing a significant role in their environmental fate and transport, as noted in Section 12.1. The leaves, needles (on pine trees), and stems of higher green plants are covered with an epicuticular wax that is organophilic and thus has an affinity for organic compounds in air. The most important plants in this respect are those in the evergreen boreal coniferous forests in the northern temperate zone. The importance of these forests is due to the heavy forestation of the northern temperate zone and the high amount of leaf surface per unit area of such forests. 12.3 POLLUTANT HYDROCARBONS Ethylene and terpenes, which were discussed in the preceding section, are hydrocarbons, organic compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon. The major classes of hydrocarbons are alkanes, such as 2,2,3-trimethylbutane: H3C H H3C C C CH3 2,2,3-TrimethylbutaneH3C CH3 alkenes (compounds with double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms), such as ethylene, alkynes (compounds with triple bonds), such as acetylene: HC CH and aromatic (aryl) compounds, such as naphthalene: Because of their widespread use in fuels, hydrocarbons predominate among organic atmospheric pollutants. Petroleum products, primarily gasoline, are the source of most of the anthropogenic (originating through human activities) pollutant hydrocarbons found in the atmosphere.", "Hydrocarbons may enter the atmosphere either directly or as by-products of the partial combustion of other hydrocarbons. The latter are particularly important because they tend to be unsaturated and relatively reactive (see Chapter 13 for a discussion of hydrocarbon reactivity in photochemical smog formation). Most hydrocarbon pollutant sources produce about 15% reactive hydrocarbons, whereas those from incomplete combustion of gasoline are about 45% reactive. The hydrocarbons in uncontrolled automobile exhausts are only about 1/3 alkanes, with the remainder divided approximately equally between more reactive alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons, thus accounting for the relatively high reactivity of automotive exhaust hydrocarbons. Alkanes are among the more stable hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. Straight-chain alkanes with one to more than 30 carbon atoms, and branched-chain alkanes with six or fewer carbon atoms, are commonly present in polluted atmospheres. Because of their high vapor pressures, alkanes with six or fewer carbon atoms are normally present as gases, alkanes with 20 or more carbon atoms are present as aerosols or sorbed to atmospheric particles, and alkanes with 6\u201320 carbon atoms per molecule may be present either as vapor or particles, depending upon conditions. In the atmosphere, alkanes (general formula CxH2x+2) are attacked primarily by hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211, resulting in the loss of a hydrogen atom and formation of an alkyl radical: CH\u2211 x 2x+1 Subsequent reaction with O2 causes formation of alkylperoxyl radical: CxH2x+1O2 \u2211 These radicals may act as oxidants, losing oxygen (usually to NO forming NO2) to produce alkoxyl radicals: CxH2x+1O\u2211 As a result of these and subsequent reactions, lower-molecular-mass alkanes are eventually oxidized to species that can be precipitated from the atmosphere with particulate matter to ultimately undergo biodegradation in soil. Alkenes enter the atmosphere from a variety of processes, including emissions from internal combustion engines and turbines, foundry operations, and petroleum refining. Several alkenes, including the ones shown below, are among the top 50 chemicals produced each year, with annual worldwide production of several billion kilograms: H H HH H H H C C C C C H C C HHHH H Ethylene (ethene) Propylene (propene) Styrene H H C C H H C C Butadiene HH These compounds are used primarily as monomers, which are polymerized to create polymers for plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene), synthetic rubber (styrenebutadiene and polybutadiene), latex paints (styrenebutadiene), and other applications. All of these compounds, as well as others manufactured in lesser quantities, are released into the atmosphere. In addition to the direct release of alkenes, these hydrocarbons are commonly produced by the partial combustion and \u201ccracking\u201d at high temperatures of alkanes, particularly in the internal combustion engine. Alkynes occur much less commonly in the atmosphere than do alkenes. Detectable levels are sometimes found of acetylene used as a fuel for welding torches and 1-butyne used in synthetic rubber manufacture: HH HCCH HC CCCH Acetylene 1-Butyne H H Unlike alkanes, alkenes are highly reactive in the atmosphere, especially in the presence of NOx and sunlight. Hydroxyl radical reacts readily with alkenes, adding to the double bond and (rarely) by abstracting a hydrogen atom. If hydroxyl radical adds to the double bond in propylene, for exam ple, the product is: HO H C \u2022 C H C H H H H Addition of molecular O2 to this radical results in the formation of a peroxyl radical: \u2022 O H O H HO C C C H H H H These radicals then react with HOO\u2211, alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO\u2211), or NO, depending upon the availability of these species, leading to the formation of aldehydes and other reactive species that can participate in reaction chains, such as those discussed for the formation of photochemical smog in Chapter 13. Ozone, O3, adds across double bonds and is rather reactive with alkenes. As shown for the reaction with ozone of the natural alkene limonene in Section 12.2, aldehydes are among the products of reactions between alkenes and ozone. Although the reaction of alkenes with NO3 is much slower than that with HO\u2211, the much higher levels of NO3 relative to HO\u2211, especially at night, make it a significant reactant for atmospheric alkenes. (The NO3 radical is present in the atmosphere at appreciable levels only at night because it undergoes photolysis very rapidly when exposed to sunlight.) The initial reaction with NO3 is addition across the alkene double bond which, because NO3 is a free radical species, forms a radical species.", "A typical reaction sequence is the following: H H HHH HHH H O2 H C C C +NO3 HCCCONO2 HCCCONO2 \u2022 H H HH HOH O \u2022 (12.2) H O O HHHNO HC C H +HCH+NO2 HCCCONO2 H HOH \u2022 The reaction of alkenes with hydroxyl radical in the presence of nitrogen oxides can produce b-hydroxynitrates and dihydroxynitrates.4 An example of the formation of a b-hydroxynitrate from a 1-alkene is shown in Reaction 12.3. H HHHHHHH HOHHHHHHH CCCCCCCCH HO\u2022 O2NOCCCCCCCC H (12.3) NOx H HHHHHHH HHHHHHHH 12.3.1 AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS Aromatic (aryl) hydrocarbons may be divided into the two major classes of those that have only one benzene ring and those with multiple rings. As discussed in Chapter 10, the latter are PAH. Aromatic hydrocarbons with two rings, such as naphthalene, are intermediate in their behavior. Some typical aromatic hydrocarbons are: Benzene 2,6-Dimethylnaphthalene Pyrene The following aromatic hydrocarbons are among the top 50 chemicals manufactured each year: Styrene Xylene (3 isomers) Cumene Single-ring aromatic compounds are important constituents of gasoline, although the benzene content of gasoline is restricted because of its possible health effects. Aromatic hydrocarbons are raw materials for the manufacture of monomers and plasticizers in polymers. Styrene is a monomer used in the manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber. Cumene is oxidized to produce phenol and acetone, which are valuable by-products. Because of these applications, plus production of these compounds as combustion by-products, aromatic compounds are common atmospheric pollutants. A group of single-ring aromatic hydrocarbons that are found as urban air pollutants are those in the group known as BTEX consisting of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene.5 Many hydrocarbons containing a single benzene ring and a number of hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene have been found as atmospheric pollutants. In addition, several compounds containing two or more unconjugated rings (not sharing the same p electron cloud between rings) have been detected as atmospheric pollutants. These compounds have been detected in tobacco smoke and biphenyl has been found in diesel engine smoke. As discussed in Section 10.8, PAHs are present as aerosols in the atmosphere because of their extremely low vapor pressures. These compounds are the most stable forms of hydrocarbons having low hydrogen-to-carbon ratios and are formed by the combustion of hydrocarbons under oxygendefi cient conditions. The partial combustion of coal, which has a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio <1, is a major source of PAH compounds. In addition to being formed in the anthrosphere by incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels, PAHs are produced and emitted to the atmosphere by grass and forest fi res.6 12.3.2 REACTIONS OF ATMOSPHERIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS As with most atmospheric hydrocarbons, the most likely reaction of benzene and its derivatives is with hydroxyl radical. Addition of HO\u2211 to the benzene ring results in the formation of an unstable radical species, \u2211 C C where the dot denotes an unpaired electron. The electron is not confined to one atom; therefore, it is delocalized and may be represented in the aromatic radical structure by a half-circle with a dot in the middle. Using this notation for the radical above, its reaction with O2 is OH OH H (12.4) + O2 + HO2 to form stable phenol and reactive hydroperoxyl radical, HOO\u2211. Alkyl-substituted aromatics may undergo reactions involving the alkyl group. For example, abstraction of alkyl H by HO\u2211 from a compound such as p-xylene can result in the formation of a radical H H HC C\u2022 HH which can react further with O2 to form a peroxyl radical, and then enter chain reactions involved in the formation of photochemical smog (Chapter 13). Although reaction with hydroxyl radical is the most common fate of aromatic compounds during daylight, they react with NO3 at night. This oxide of nitrogen is formed by the reaction of ozone with NO2: NO2 + O3 \u00c6 NO3 + O2 (12.5) and can remain in the atmosphere for some time as its addition product with NO2: NO2 + NO3 + M \u00c6 N2O5 + M (12.6) 12.4 CARBONYL COMPOUNDS: ALDEHYDES AND KETONES Carbonyl compounds, consisting of aldehydes and ketones that have a carbonyl moiety, C=O, are often the first species formed after unstable reaction intermediates in the photochemical oxidation of atmospheric hydrocarbons. Carbonyls are very important in atmospheric chemistry because (1) they are formed by the photochemical oxidation of almost all hydrocarbons; (2) they lead to production of very reactive and harmful free radicals, ozone, and peroxyacylnitrates; and (3) some carbonyls, especially formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein, are toxic mutagens, potential carcinogens, and eye irritants.", "The general formulas of aldehydes and ketones are represented by the following, where R and R\u00a2 represent the hydrocarbon moieties (portions), such as the \u2013CH3 group. O OO RCH RCR\u2018 C Aldehyde Ketone Carbonyl moiety Carbonyl compounds are by-products of the generation of hydroperoxyl radicals from organic alkoxyl radicals (see Section 12.3) by reactions such as the following: \u2022 HOH HOH \u2022 (12.7) HCCCH+O2 HCCCH+HO2 HHH HH \u2022 HHO HHO \u2022 (12.8) H + HO2 The simplest and most widely produced of the carbonyl compounds is the lowest aldehyde, formaldehyde: O C FormaldehydeH H Formaldehyde is produced in the atmosphere as a product of the reaction of atmospheric hydrocarbons beginning with their reactions with hydroxyl radical. For example, formaldehyde is the product of the reaction of methoxyl radical with O2: O H3CO\u2022 +O2 HC H + HOO\u2022 (12.9) With annual global industrial production exceeding 1 billion kg, formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of plastics, resins, lacquers, dyes, and explosives. It is uniquely important because of its widespread distribution and toxicity. Humans may be exposed to formaldehyde in the manufacture and use of phenol, urea, and melamine resin plastics, and from formaldehyde-containing adhesives in pressed wood products such as particle board, used in especially large quantities in mobile home construction. However, significantly improved manufacturing processes have greatly reduced formaldehyde emissions from these synthetic building materials. Formaldehyde occurs in the atmosphere primarily in the gas phase. The structural formulas of some important aldehydes and ketones are shown below: Acetaldehyde Acrolein Acetone Methylethyl ketone Acetaldehyde is a widely produced organic chemical used in the manufacture of acetic acid, plastics, and raw materials. Approximately 1 billion kg of acetone are produced each year as a solvent and for applications in the rubber, leather, and plastics industries. Methylethyl ketone is employed as a low-boiling solvent for coatings and adhesives, and for the synthesis of other chemicals. In addition to their production from hydrocarbons by photochemical oxidation, carbonyl compounds enter the atmosphere from a large number of sources and processes. These include direct emissions from internal combustion engine exhausts, incinerator emissions, spray painting, polymer manufacture, printing, petrochemicals manufacture, and lacquer manufacture. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are produced by microorganisms, and acetaldehyde is emitted by some kinds of vegetation. Aldehydes are second only to NO2 as atmospheric sources of free radicals produced by the absorption of light. This is because the carbonyl group is a chromophore, a molecular group that readily absorbs light. It absorbs well in the near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum. The activated compound produced when a photon is absorbed by an aldehyde dissociates into a formyl radical, \u2022 HCO and an alkyl radical. The photodissociation of acetaldehyde illustrates this two-step process: HO HOHO * H CC H+ hv HCC H HC\u2022+\u2022CH (12.10) H (Photoexcited) HH Photolytically excited formaldehyde, CH2O*, may dissociate in two ways. The first of these produces an H atom and HCO radical; the second produces chemically stable H2 and CO. As a result of their reaction with HO\u2211 followed by O2 then NO2, aldehydes are precursors to the production of strongly oxidizing peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs) such as peroxyacetyl nitrate and peroxypropionyl nitrate. This process is discussed in Chapter 13, Section 13.5. Because of the presence of both double bonds and carbonyl groups, alkenyl aldehydes are especially reactive in the atmosphere. The most common of these found in the atmosphere is acrolein, HO H CCCH H Acrolein a powerful lachrymator (tear producer) used as an industrial chemical and produced as a combustion by-product. The presence of significant amounts of acrolein in the atmosphere has been attributed to atmospheric reactions operating on 2-furaldehyde, a biomass burning indicator that occurs in wood smoke.7 The most abundant atmospheric ketone is acetone, CH3C(O)CH3. About half of the acetone in the atmosphere is generated as a product of the atmospheric oxidation of propane, isobutane, isobutene, and other hydrocarbons. Most of the remainder comes about equally from direct biogenic emissions and biomass burning, with about 3% from direct anthropogenic emissions. Acetone photolyzes in the atmosphere, HOH HOH HCC C H+ hv HCC\u2022 +\u2022C H (12.11) HH HH to produce the PAN precursor acetyl radical. It is believed that the mechanism for the removal of the higher ketones from the atmosphere involves an initial reaction with HO\u2211 radical. Carbonyls are commonly found in ambient air associated with severe incidents of photochemical smog formation. For the most part, these compounds are produced as secondary pollutants from the photochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons.", "12.5 MISCELLANEOUS OXYGEN-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS Oxygen-containing aldehydes, ketones, and esters in the atmosphere were covered in preceding sections. This section discusses the oxygen-containing organic compounds consisting of aliphatic alcohols, phenols, ethers, and carboxylic acids. These compounds have the general formulas given below, where R and R\u00a2 represent hydrocarbon moieties, and Ar stands specifically for an aryl moiety, such as the phenyl group (benzene less an H atom): O R OH Ar OH R O R\u2018 R C OH Aliphatic alcohols Phe nols Ethers C arboxylic acids These classes of compounds include many important organic chemicals. 12.5.1 ALCOHOLS Of the alcohols, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and ethylene glycol rank among the top 50 chemicals with annual worldwide production of the order of 1 billion kg or more. The most common of the many uses of these chemicals is for the manufacture of other chemicals. Methanol is widely used in the manufacture of formaldehyde (see Section 12.4) as a solvent, and mixed with water as an antifreeze formulation. Ethanol is used as a solvent and as the starting material for the manufacture of acetaldehyde, acetic acid, ethyl ether, ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, and several important esters. Both methanol and ethanol can be used as motor vehicle fuels, usually in mixtures with gasoline. Ethylene glycol is a common antifreeze compound. Numerous aliphatic alcohols have been reported in the atmosphere. Because of their volatility, the lower alcohols, especially methanol and ethanol, predominate as atmospheric pollutants. Among the other alcohols released into the atmosphere are 1-propanol, 2-propanol, propylene glycol, 1-butanol, and even octadecanol [chemical formula: CH3(CH2)16CH2OH], which is evolved by plants. Alcohols can undergo photochemical reactions, beginning with abstraction of hydrogen by hydroxyl radical. Mechanisms for scavenging alcohols from the atmosphere are relatively effi cient because the lower alcohols are quite water soluble and the higher ones have low vapor pressures. Some alkenyl alcohols have been found in the atmosphere, largely as by-products of combustion. Typical of these is 2-buten-1-ol, HH H HCC C C OH H HH which has been detected in automobile exhausts. Some alkenyl alcohols are emitted by plants. One of these, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, CH3CH2CH=CHCH2CH2OH, is emitted from grass, trees, and crop plants and is known as \u201cleaf alcohol.\u201d In addition to reacting with HO\u2211 radical, alkenyl radicals react strongly with atmospheric ozone, which adds across the double bond. 12.5.2 PHENOLS Phenols are aromatic alcohols that have an \u2013OH group bonded to an aryl ring. They are more noted as water pollutants than as air pollutants. Some typical phenols that have been reported as atmospheric contaminants are the following: Phenol o-cresol m-cresol p-cresol Naphthol The simplest of these compounds, phenol, is among the top 50 chemicals produced annually. It is most commonly used in the manufacture of resins and polymers, such as bakelite, a phenol\u2013 formaldehyde copolymer. Phenols are produced by the pyrolysis of coal and are major by-products of coking. Thus, in local situations involving coal coking and similar operations, phenols can be troublesome air pollutants. 12.5.3 ETHERS Ethers are relatively uncommon atmospheric pollutants; however, the flammability hazard of diethyl ether vapor in an enclosed work space is well known. In addition to aliphatic ethers, such as dimethyl ether and diethyl ether, several alkenyl ethers, including vinylethyl ether, are produced by internal combustion engines. A cyclic ether and important industrial solvent, tetrahydrofuran, occurs as an air contaminant. Methyltertiarybutyl ether (MTBE) became the octane booster of choice to replace tetraethyllead in gasoline. Because of its widespread distribution, MTBE has the potential to be an air pollutant, although its hazard is limited by its low vapor pressure. Largely because of its potential to contaminate water, MTBE has been largely replaced by ethanol as the oxygenated octane booster of choice in gasoline. Another possible air contaminant because of its potential uses as an octane booster is diisopropyl ether (DIPE). The structural formulas of the ethers mentioned above are given below: H H H H HH H H H H H C O C H H C C O C C H C C O C C H H H H H H H H H H Dimethyl ether Diethyl ether Vinylethyl ether H H H H H H C CH HHCHH HCHHCH H H HCOC CH HC O CH H O H HHCHH HCHHCH H HH Tetrahydrofuran Methyltertiarybutyl Diisopropyl ether ether (MTBE) (DIPE) CC Ethers are relatively unreactive and not as water-soluble as the lower alcohols or carboxylic acids. The predominant process for their atmospheric removal begins with hydroxyl radical attack.", "12.5.4 OXIDES Ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, OO HH HH CC C CCH H H H HH Ethylene oxide Propylene oxide rank among the 50 most widely produced industrial chemicals and have a limited potential to enter the atmosphere as pollutants. Ethylene oxide is a moderately to highly toxic, sweet-smelling, colorless, flammable, explosive gas used as a chemical intermediate, sterilant, and fumigant. It is a mutagen and a carcinogen to experimental animals. It is classified as hazardous because of both its toxicity and ignitability. 12.5.5 CARBOXYLIC ACIDS Carboxylic acids have one or more of the functional group, O COH attached to an alkane, alkene, or aryl hydrocarbon moiety. A carboxylic acid, pinonic acid, produced by the photochemical oxidation of naturally produced a-pinene, was discussed in Section 12.2. Many of the carboxylic acids found in the atmosphere probably result from the photochemical oxidation of other organic compounds through gas-phase reactions or by reactions of other organic compounds dissolved in aqueous aerosols. These acids are often the end products of photochemical oxidation because their low vapor pressures and relatively high water solubilities make them susceptible to scavenging from the atmosphere, although they are among the most stable organic compounds while in the atmosphere. They are removed from the atmosphere by both wet and dry deposition processes. Low-molecular-mass formic acid, HCOOH, and acetic acid, H3CCOOH, occur in the gas phase and partition into aqueous aerosol droplets in fog and clouds, playing a significant role in the chemistry that occurs in these droplets. The heavier organic acids are the most abundant constituents of small particles in the urban atmosphere (SOA), examples of which are shown in Figure 12.2.

Typical examples of more than 50 organic acids typically found in polluted and unpolluted atmospheres. 12.6 ORGANONITROGEN COMPOUNDS Organonitrogen compounds formed largely by atmospheric chemical processes operating on hydrocarbons and oxygenated species in the atmosphere are abundant and are involved in the transfer of some atmospheric nitrogen to the hydrosphere and geosphere. These compounds in the atmosphere may be divided between reduced nitrogen compounds such as amines and oxidized organic compounds such as nitrates. The reduced species are predominantly those emitted directly to the atmosphere whereas the oxidized species are normally produced by oxidizing photochemical processes involving HO\u2211, O3, NOx, and NO3 radical. Organic nitrogen compounds that may be found as atmospheric contaminants may be classifi ed as amines, amides, nitriles, nitro compounds, or heterocyclic nitrogen compounds. Structural formulas of common examples of each of these five classes of compounds reported as atmospheric contaminants are: H OH H H3C H HCN NCH CCCN H H3C H H Methylamine Dimethylformamide Acrylonitrile NO2 NH2 N Nitrobenzene Pyridine Aniline The organonitrogen compounds shown above can come from anthropogenic pollution sources. Significant amounts of anthropogenic atmospheric nitrogen may also come from reactions of inorganic nitrogen with reactive organic species. Examples include nitrates produced by the reaction of atmospheric NO3. Amines consist of compounds in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms in NH3 has been replaced by a hydrocarbon moiety. Lower-molecular-mass amines are volatile. These are prominent among the compounds giving rotten fish their characteristic odor\u2014an obvious reason why air contamination by amines is undesirable. The simplest and most important aryl amine is aniline, used in the manufacture of dyes, amides, photographic chemicals, and drugs. A number of amines are widely used industrial chemicals and solvents, so industrial sources have the potential to contaminate the atmosphere with these chemicals. Decaying organic matter, especially protein wastes, produce amines, so rendering plants, packing houses, and sewage treatment plants are important sources of these substances. Aromatic amines are of special concern as air pollutants, especially in the workplace, because some cause urethral tract cancer (particularly of the bladder) in exposed individuals.", "Aromatic amines are widely used as chemical intermediates, antioxidants, and curing agents in the manufacture of polymers (rubber and plastics), drugs, pesticides, dyes, pigments, and inks. In addition to aniline, some aromatic amines of potential concern are the following: Cl H2N NH2 H2N NH2 Cl NH2 Benzidine 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine NH2 NH2 1-Phenyl-2 naphthylamine 1-Naphthylamine 2-Naphthylamine In the atmosphere, amines can be attacked by hydroxyl radicals and undergo further reactions. Amines are bases (electron-pair donors). Therefore, their acid\u2013base chemistry in the atmosphere may be important, particularly in the presence of acids in acidic precipitation. The amide most likely to be encountered as an atmospheric pollutant is dimethylformamide. It is widely used commercially as a solvent for the synthetic polymer, polyacrylonitrile (Orlon, Dacron). Most amides have relatively low vapor pressures, which limit their entry into the atmosphere. Nitriles, which are characterized by the \u2013C\u222bN group, have been reported as air contaminants, particularly from industrial sources. Both acrylonitrile and acetonitrile (CH3CN) have been reported in the atmosphere as a result of synthetic rubber manufacture. As expected from their volatilities and levels of industrial production, most of the nitriles reported as atmospheric contaminants are low-molecular-mass aliphatic or alkenyl nitriles or aryl nitriles with only one benzene ring. Acrylonitrile, used to make polyacrylonitrile polymer, is the only nitrogen-containing organic chemical among the top 50 chemicals with annual worldwide production exceeding 1 billion kg. Among the nitro compounds, RNO2, reported as air contaminants are nitromethane, nitroethane, and nitrobenzene. These compounds are produced from industrial sources. Highly oxygenated compounds containing the NO2 group, particularly peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and peroxypropionyl nitrate, have no known emission sources and are secondary pollutant end products of the photochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons in urban atmospheres. These compounds are intense eye irritants responsible for much of the disagreeable qualities of photochemical smog. They are mutagens and phytotoxins and are suspected of causing skin cancer. HO HHO HCCOONO2 HCCCOONO2 H HH Peroxyacetyl nitrate Peroxypropionyl nitrate A large number of heterocyclic nitrogen compounds have been reported in tobacco smoke, and it is inferred that many of these compounds can enter the atmosphere from burning vegetation. Coke ovens are another major source of these compounds. In addition to the derivatives of pyridine, some of the heterocyclic nitrogen compounds are derivatives of pyrrole: Heterocyclic nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere occur almost entirely in association with aerosols. Nitrosamines, which contain the N\u2013N=O group, and having, therefore, the general formula R NNO R\u2018 deserve special mention as atmospheric contaminants because some are known carcinogens. As discussed in Chapter 22, nitrosamines include compounds that can attach alkyl groups to DNA resulting in modified DNA, which can lead to cancer. Both N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosodiethylamine have been detected in the atmosphere. 12.7 ORGANOHALIDE COMPOUNDS Organohalides consist of halogen-substituted hydrocarbon molecules, each of which contains at least one atom of F, Cl, Br, or I. They may be saturated (alkyl halides), unsaturated (alkenyl halides), or aromatic (aryl halides). The organohalides of environmental and toxicological concern exhibit a wide range of physical and chemical properties. Although most organohalide compounds of pollution concern are from anthropogenic sources, it is now known that a large variety of such compounds are generated by organisms, particularly those in marine environments. Structural formulas of several alkyl halides commonly encountered in the atmosphere are given below: H H F Cl H H C Cl Cl C Cl Cl C Cl Cl C C H H H F Cl H Chlor(bp \u201324\u00b0C) omethane Dichloro(methylene chloride, bp 40\u00b0C) met hane Dichlorodifmethane, Freon-12, bp \u201329\u00b0C) luoro 1,1,1-Trich(methyl chloroform, bp 74\u00b0C) loro ethane, Dichloromethane is a volatile liquid with excellent solvent properties for nonpolar organic solutes. It has been used as a solvent for the decaffeination of coffee, in paint strippers, as a blowing agent in urethane polymer manufacture, and to depress vapor pressure in aerosol formulations. Dichlorodifl uoromethane is one of the CFC compounds once widely manufactured as a refrigerant and involved in stratospheric ozone depletion. One of the more common industrial chlorinated solvents is 1,1,1-trichloroethane. Viewed as halogen-substituted derivatives of alkenes, the alkenyl organohalides contain at least one halogen atom and at least one carbon\u2013carbon double bond. The most significant of these are the lighter chlorinated compounds. Vinyl chloride is consumed in large quantities as a raw material to manufacture pipe, hose, wrapping, and other products fabricated from polyvinyl chloride plastic. This highly fl ammable, volatile, sweet-smelling gas is known to cause angiosarcoma, a rare form of liver cancer. Trichloroethylene is a clear, colorless, nonflammable, volatile liquid.", "It is an excellent degreasing and dry-cleaning solvent, and has been used as a household solvent and for food extraction (e.g., in decaffeination of coffee). Allyl chloride, 3-chloropropene, is an intermediate in the manufacture of allyl alcohol and other allyl compounds, including pharmaceuticals, insecticides, and thermosetting varnish and plastic resins. Some commonly used aryl halide derivatives of benzene and toluene are shown below: Chloro-Bromo-Hexachloro-1-Chloro-2-benzene benzene benzene methylbenzene Aryl halide compounds have many uses. The inevitable result of all these uses has been widespread occurrences of human exposure and environmental contamination. PCBs, a group of compounds formed by the chlorination of biphenyl, Clx (12.12) + xHCl have extremely high physical and chemical stabilities and other qualities that led to their being used in many applications, including heat transfer fl uids, hydraulic fluids, and dielectrics until their manufacture and use were banned in the 1970s because of their pollution potential. As expected from their high vapor pressures and volatilities, the lighter organohalide compounds are the most likely to be found at detectable levels in the atmosphere. On a global basis, the most abundant organochlorine compound in the atmosphere is methyl chloride, CH3Cl, with atmospheric concentrations of the order of tenths of a part per billion largely from natural sources in the ocean and tropical coastal regions. Methyl chloroform, CH3CCl3, is relatively persistent in the atmosphere, with residence times of several years. Therefore, it may pose a threat to the stratospheric ozone layer in the same way as CFCs. Among the other lighter organohalides that have been found in the atmosphere are methylene chloride; methyl bromide, CH3Br; bromoform, CHBr3; assorted CFCs; and halogen-substituted ethylene compounds such as trichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, perchloroethylene, (CCl2 =CCl2), and solvent ethylene dibromide (CHBr=CHBr). 12.7.1 CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS CFCs, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, commonly called freons, are volatile 1- and 2-carbon compounds that contain Cl and F bonded to carbon. These compounds are notably stable and nontoxic. They have been widely used in recent decades in the fabrication of fl exible and rigid foams and as fluids for refrigeration and air conditioning. Until their uses were banned (see below) the most widely manufactured of these compounds were CCl3F (CFC-11, bp 24\u00b0C), CCl2F2(CFC-12, bp -28\u00b0C), C2Cl3F3 (CFC-113), C2Cl2F4 (CFC-114), and C2ClF5 (CFC-115). Halons are related compounds that contain bromine and are used in fi re extinguisher systems. The major commercial halons are CBrClF2 (halon-1211), CBrF3 (halon-1301), and C2Br2F4 (halon2402), where the sequence of numbers denotes the number of carbon, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine atoms, respectively, per molecule. Halons are particularly effective fi re extinguishing agents because of the way in which they stop combustion. Halons act by chain reactions that destroy hydrogen atoms that sustain combustion. The basic sequence of reactions involved is outlined below: CBrClF2 + H\u2211\u00c6 CClF2 \u2211+ HBr (12.13) HBr + H\u2211\u00c6 Br\u2211+ H2 (12.14) H\u2211+ Br\u2211\u00c6 HBr (12.15) Halons are used in automatic fire extinguishing systems, particularly those located in fl ammable solvent storage areas, and in specialty fire extinguishers, particularly those on aircraft. Because of their potential to destroy stratospheric ozone discussed below, the use of halons in fi re extinguishers was severely curtailed in a ban imposed in developed nations on January 1, 1994. The ban on halons has caused concern because of the favorable properties of halons in fire extinguishers, particularly on aircraft. It is possible that hydrogen-containing analogs of halons may be effective as fi re extinguishers without posing a threat to ozone. The nonreactivity of CFC compounds, combined with worldwide production that once reached approximately one-half million metric tons per year and deliberate or accidental release to the atmosphere, has resulted in CFCs becoming homogeneous components of the global atmosphere. In 1974, it was convincingly suggested, in a classic work that earned the authors a Nobel Prize, that chlorofluoromethanes could catalyze the destruction of stratospheric ozone that filters out cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation from the sun.8 Subsequent data on ozone levels in the stratosphere and on increased ultraviolet radiation at earth\u2019s surface showed that the threat to stratospheric ozone posed by CFCs is real. Although quite inert in the lower atmosphere, CFCs undergo photodecomposition by the action of high-energy ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere, which is energetic enough to break their very strong C\u2013Cl bonds through reactions such as Cl2CF2 + hn\u00c6 Cl\u2211+ ClCF2 \u2211 (12.16) thereby releasing Cl atoms. The Cl atoms are very reactive species that initiate chain reactions that destroy stratospheric ozone as discussed in detail in Section 14.4, \u201cOzone Layer Destruction.\u201d", "The U.S. EPA regulations, imposed in accordance with the 1986 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, curtailed the production of CFCs and halocarbons in the United States starting from 1989. The substitutes for these halocarbons are hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrogen-containing fluorocarbons (HFCs), and some volatile hydrocarbon formulations. These have included CH2FCF3 (HFC-134a, 1,1,1,2-tetrafl uoroethane, which became the standard substitute for CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners and refrigeration equipment), CHCl2CF3 (HCFC-123), CH3CCl2F (HCFC-141b), CHClF2 (HCFC-22), and CH2F2 (HFC152a, a flammable material). Because of the more readily broken H\u2013C bonds they contain, these compounds are more easily destroyed by atmospheric chemical reactions (particularly with hydroxyl radical) before they reach the stratosphere. The HFC compounds are favored as CFC substitutes because they contain only fluorine and hydrogen bound to carbon so that they cannot generate any ozone-destroying chlorine atoms. Some of the HFC compounds, particularly HFC-134a, have been criticized for their global warming potential. Among the newer alternatives with much less global warming potential are HFO1234yf, chemical formula CF3CF=CH2. Concerned about the global warming potential of HFCs, European automakers are developing automobile air conditioning systems that use CO2 as a refrigerant fluid. Although carbon dioxide contributes to global warming, the incremental effects from release of this gas from automobile air conditioners would be minuscule because the quantities used in automobile air conditioners would be insignificant compared to emissions from fossil fuels combustion. 12.7.2 ATMOSPHERIC REACTIONS OF HYDROFLUOROCARBONS AND HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS The atmospheric chemistry of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofl uorocarbons (HCFCs) is important, even though these compounds do not pose much danger to the ozone layer. Of particular importance is the photooxidation of these compounds and the fates and effects of their photooxidation products. Initial attack on these compounds leading to their eventual destruction can be from hydroxyl radical or chlorine atoms.9 HFC 134a, CF3CH2F, reacts as follows with hydroxyl radical in the troposphere: CF3CH2F + HO\u2211\u00c6 CF3CHF\u2211+ H2O (12.17) The alkyl radical produced by this reaction forms a peroxy radical with molecular oxygen: CF3CHF\u2211+ O2 + M \u00c6 CF3CHFO2 \u2211+ M (12.18) and the peroxy radical reacts with NO: CF3CHFO2 \u2211+ NO \u00c6 CF3CHFO\u2211+ NO2 (12.19) The product of that reaction can either decompose: CF3CHFO\u2211\u00c6 CF3 \u2211+ HC(O)F (12.20) or react with molecular O2: CF3CHFO\u2211+ O2 \u00c6 CF3C(O)F + HO2 \u2211 (12.21) These latter two processes are thought to occur to about equal extents. Ultimately, products are formed that are purged from the atmosphere. 12.7.3 PERFLUOROCARBONS Perfl uorocarbons are completely fluorinated organic compounds, the simplest examples of which are carbon tetrafl uoride (CF4) and hexafl uoroethane (C2F6). Several hundred metric tons of these compounds are produced annually as etching agents in the electronics industry. However, about 30,000 metric tons of CF4 and about 10% that amount of C2F6 are emitted to the global atmosphere each year from aluminum production. Nontoxic perfluorocarbons do not react with hydroxyl radical, ozone, or other reactive substances in the atmosphere, and the only known significant mechanism by which they are destroyed in the atmosphere is photolysis by radiation less than 130 nm in wavelength. Because of their extreme lack of reactivity, they are involved in neither photochemical smog formation nor ozone layer depletion. As a result of this stability, perfl uorocarbons are very long lived in the atmosphere; the lifetime of CF4 is estimated to be an astoundingly long 50,000 years! The major atmospheric concern with these compounds is their potential to cause greenhouse warming (see Chapter 14). Taking into account their nonreactivity and ability to absorb infrared radiation, perfluorocarbons have a potential to cause global warming over a very long time span with an aggregate effect per molecule several thousand times that of carbon dioxide. 12.7.4 MARINE SOURCES OF ORGANOHALOGEN COMPOUNDS The predominant natural source of volatile atmospheric organohalogens is from marine organisms. This is not surprising considering the high concentrations of chloride ion and lesser levels of bromide and iodide in seawater. Various marine algae are major sources of atmospheric organohalogens. 12.7.5 CHLORINATED DIBENZO-P-DIOXINS AND DIBENZOFURANS Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are pollutant compounds with the general formulas shown below: PCDFs PCDDs TCDD, a PCDD As discussed in Chapters 7 and 24, these compounds are of considerable concern because of their toxicities. One of the more infamous environmental pollutant chemicals is 2,3,7,8-TCDD, often known simply as \u201cdioxin.\u201d PCDDs and PCDFs enter the air from numerous sources, including automobile engines, waste incinerators, and steel and other metal production. A particularly important source may well be municipal solid waste incinerators.", "The formation of PCDDs and PCDFs in such incinerators results in part because of the presence of both chlorine (such as from PVC plastic in municipal waste) and catalytic metals. Furthermore, PCDDs and PCDFs are produced by de novo synthesis on carbonaceous fly ash surfaces in the postcombustion region of an incinerator at relatively low temperatures of around 300\u00b0C in the presence of oxygen and sources of chlorine and hydrogen. Atmospheric levels of PCDDs and PCDFs are quite low, in the range of 0.4\u2013100 pg/m3 of air. Because of their lower volatilities, the more highly chlorinated congeners of these compounds tend to occur in atmospheric particulate matter, in which they are relatively protected from photolysis and reaction with hydroxyl radical, which are the two main mechanisms by which PCDDs and PCDFs are eliminated from the atmosphere. Furthermore, the less highly chlorinated congeners are more reactive because of their C\u2013H bonds, which are susceptible to attack from hydroxyl radical. 12.8 ORGANOSULFUR COMPOUNDS Substitution of alkyl or aryl hydrocarbon groups such as phenyl and methyl for H on hydrogen sulfi de, H2S, leads to a number of different organosulfurthiols (mercaptans, R\u2013SH) and sulfi des, also called thioethers (R\u2013S\u2013R). Structural formulas of examples of these compounds are shown below. H HH H H C SH C C C SH SH H H H Methanethiol 2-Propene-1-thiol Benzenethiol HH H H H H C S C H H C C SSC H HH S H H H Dimethylsulfide Thiophene Ethylmethyldisulfide The most signifi cant atmospheric organosulfur compound is dimethylsulfi de, produced in large quantities by marine organisms and introducing quantities of sulfur to the atmosphere comparable in magnitude to those introduced from pollution sources. Its oxidation produces most of the SO2 in the marine atmosphere. Methanethiol and other lighter alkyl thiols are fairly common air pollutants that have \u201cultragarlic\u201d odors; both 1- and 2-butanethiol are associated with skunk odor. Gaseous methanethiol and volatile liquid ethanethiol are used as odorant leak-detecting additives for natural gas, propane, and butane, and are also employed as intermediates in pesticide synthesis. Allylmercaptan (2-propene-1-thiol) is a toxic, irritating volatile liquid with a strong garlic odor. Benzenethiol (phenyl mercaptan) is the simplest of the aryl thiols. It is a toxic liquid with a severely \u201crepulsive\u201d odor. Alkyl sulfides or thioethers contain the C\u2013S\u2013C functional group. The lightest of these compounds is dimethyl sulfide, a volatile liquid (bp 38\u00b0C) that is moderately toxic by ingestion. Cyclic sulfides contain the C\u2013S\u2013C group in a ring structure. The most common of these compounds is thiophene, a heat-stable liquid (bp 84\u00b0C) with a solvent action much like that of benzene that is used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, dyes, and resins. Although not highly significant as atmospheric contaminants on a large scale, organic sulfur compounds can cause local air pollution problems because of their bad odors. Major sources of organosulfur compounds in the atmosphere include microbial degradation, wood pulping, volatile matter evolved from plants, animal wastes, packing house and rendering plant wastes, starch manufacture, sewage treatment, and petroleum refi ning. Although the impact of organosulfur compounds on atmospheric chemistry is minimal in areas such as aerosol formation or production of acid precipitation components, these compounds are the worst of all in producing odor. Therefore, it is important to prevent their release into the atmosphere. As with all hydrogen-containing organic species in the atmosphere, reaction of organosulfur compounds with hydroxyl radical is a fi rst step in their atmospheric photochemical reactions. The sulfur from both mercaptans and sulfides ends up as SO2. In both cases, there is thought to be a readily oxidized SO intermediate, and HS\u2211 radical may also be an intermediate in the oxidation of mercaptans. Another possibility is the addition of O atoms to S, resulting in the formation of free radicals as shown below for methyl mercaptan: CH3SH + O \u00c6 H3C\u2211+ HSO\u2211 (12.22) The HSO\u2211 radical is readily oxidized by atmospheric O2 to SO2. 12.9 ORGANIC PARTICULATE MATTER Organic species are important constituents of atmospheric particulate matter. Some particles consist almost entirely of organic matter. Others have significant amounts of organic compounds adsorbed to the surfaces of nonorganic material. The visibility-obscuring particles characteristic of photochemical smog (Chapter 13) are composed largely of oxygenated organic material that is the end product of the photochemical smog process. Particles of elemental carbon and of highly condensed PAHs produced as products of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons from sources such as diesel engines have a strong affinity for organic vapors in the atmosphere.", "Organic particulate matter may be emitted directly from sources as primary pollutants or formed as secondary pollutants produced by atmospheric chemical processes operating on organic vapors. Through the action of reactive atmospheric species, especially HO\u2211 radical, O3, NOx, and NO3 radical, oxygen and nitrogen are added to vaporous organic molecules producing much less volatile species that condense and form particles. 12.10 HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANT ORGANIC COMPOUNDS Hazardous air pollutants were designated in the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970 as those likely to cause adverse health effects. These substances are generally regarded as ones that may come from specifi c sources, such as release from a particular factory, as distinguished from criteria air pollutants, such as SO2 and NOx, that are widespread and from a number of sources. The Clean Air Amendments of 1990 specified a list of hazardous air pollutants, which has been modified slightly since then. Table 12.1 lists organic compounds, most of which are on the list of hazardous air pollutants (several have been delisted since the original publication was published). Most of the substances in the list of hazardous air pollutants are organic compounds produced industrially. Although space does not permit a discussion of these substances, the CAS number given for each compound will enable the reader to look up its formula, properties, and literature related to atmospheric pollution on databases such as SciFinder.

Although smog is the term used in this book to denote a photochemically oxidizing atmosphere, the word originally was used to describe the unpleasant combination of smoke and fog laced with sulfur dioxide which was formerly prevalent in London when high-sulfur coal was the primary fuel used in that city. This mixture is characterized by the presence of sulfur dioxide, a reducing compound; therefore it is a reducing smog or sulfurous smog. In fact, sulfur dioxide is readily oxidized and has a short lifetime in an atmosphere where oxidizing photochemical smog is present. Smog has a long history. Exploring what is now southern California in 1542, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo named San Pedro Bay \u201cThe Bay of Smokes\u201d because of the heavy haze that covered the area. Complaints of eye irritation from anthropogenically polluted air in Los Angeles were recorded as far back as 1868. Characterized by reduced visibility, eye irritation, cracking of rubber, and deterioration of materials, smog became a serious nuisance in the Los Angeles area during the 1940s. It is now recognized as a major air pollution problem in many areas of the world.", "Smoggy conditions are manifested by moderate to severe eye irritation or visibility below 3 miles when the relative humidity is below 60%. The formation of oxidants in the air, particularly ozone, is indicative of smog formation. Serious levels of photochemical smog may be assumed to be present when the oxidant level exceeds 0.15 ppm for more than 1 h. The three ingredients required to generate photochemical smog are ultraviolet light, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides. Advanced techniques of analysis have shown a large variety of hydrocarbon precursors to smog formation in the atmosphere. The importance of ozone as an atmospheric pollutant in atmospheres contaminated with photochemical smog have been recognized by changing regulations to lower allowable ozone concentrations in the United States. Allowable ozone levels were further reduced in 2008. From the time it was recognized as a significant air pollution problem in the 1940s, the photochemical smog problem has been the subject of intense studies by chemists, efforts that were largely responsible for the evolution of the discipline of atmospheric chemistry. Much of the progress made in this area was due to advances in the study of chemical kinetics in the gas phase, the power of computers to make complex calculations, and advances in instrumentation to measure low levels of chemical species in polluted atmospheres. This chapter discusses the chemistry of photochemical smog. Photochemical smog forms in the troposphere and is very much influenced by tropospheric conditions. The troposphere can be viewed as being divided into two major regions. The lowest layer, typically around 1 km thick, contains the planetary boundary layer in which there is maximum interaction between tropospheric air and Earth\u2019s surface. It is the region in which temperature inversions (see Figure 9.7) form and hold smog-forming chemicals with minimal mixing and dispersion so that they can interact with sunlight and each other to produce smog. Above this lower layer and extending up to the tropopause where the stratosphere begins is the free troposphere. In August 2003, Europe experienced a devastating heat wave that killed thousands of people. In addition to the intense heat, the incident was characterized by a stagnant boundary layer, strong emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from the anthrosphere, and widespread forest fi res that pumped large quantities of smog-forming emissions into the atmosphere. The result was a long period of photochemical smog formation adding to the misery caused by the prolonged period of high temperatures.1 13.2 SMOG-FORMING EMISSIONS Internal combustion engines used in automobiles and trucks produce reactive hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, two of the three key ingredients required for smog to form. Therefore, automotive air emissions are discussed next. The production of nitrogen oxides was discussed in Section 11.6. At the high temperature and pressure conditions in an internal combustion engine, products of incompletely burned gasoline undergo chemical reactions, which produce several hundred different hydrocarbons. Many of these are highly reactive in forming photochemical smog. As shown in Figure 13.1, the automobile has several potential sources of hydrocarbon emissions other than the exhaust. The first of these to be controlled was the mist of hydrocarbons composed of lubricating oil and \u201cblowby\u201d emanating from the engine crankcase. The latter consists of exhaust gas and unoxidized fuel/air mixture that enters the crankcase from the combustion chambers around the pistons. This mist is destroyed by recirculating it through the engine intake manifold by way of the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve. A second major source of automotive hydrocarbon emissions is the fuel system, from which hydrocarbons are emitted from the fuel tank and vents on carburetors, which used to be the primary means of introducing fuel/air mixtures into automobile engines. When the engine is shut off and the engine heat warms up the fuel system, gasoline may be evaporated and emitted to the atmosphere. In addition, heating during the daytime and cooling at night causes the fuel tank to breathe and emit gasoline fumes. Such emissions are reduced by fuel formulated to reduce volatility. Automobiles are equipped with canisters of carbon, which collect evaporated fuel from the fuel tank and fuel system, to be purged and burned when the engine is operating. Modern automobile engines with fuel injection systems emit much less hydrocarbon vapor than earlier models equipped with carburetors. 13.2.1 CONTROL OF EXHAUST HYDROCARBONS In order to understand the production and control of automotive hydrocarbon exhaust products, it is helpful to understand the basic principles of the internal combustion engine.", "As shown in Figure 13.2, the four steps involved in one complete cycle of the four-cycle engine used in most vehicles are the following: 1. Intake: Air is drawn into the cylinder through the open intake valve. Gasoline is either injected with the intake air or injected separately into the cylinder. 2. Compression: The combustible mixture is compressed at a ratio of about 7:1. Higher compression ratios favor thermal efficiency and complete combustion of hydrocarbons. However, higher temperatures, premature combustion (\u201cpinging\u201d), and high production of nitrogen oxides also result from higher compression ratios. Crankcase (20% of hydrocarbons produced)hydrocarbons produced) FIGURE 13.1 Potential sources of pollutant hydrocarbons from an automobile built in years before automotive air pollutants were controlled. Spark plug Air Intake Compression Ignition/power Exhaust 3. Ignition and power stroke: As the fuel\u2013air mixture normally produced by injecting fuel into the cylinder is ignited by the spark plug near top-dead-center, a temperature of about 2500\u00b0C is reached very rapidly at pressures up to 40 atm. As the gas volume increases with downward movement of the piston, the temperature decreases in a few milliseconds. This rapid cooling \u201cfreezes\u201d nitric oxide in the form of NO without allowing it to dissociate to N2 and O2, which are thermodynamically favored at the normal temperatures and pressures of the atmosphere. 4. Exhaust: Exhaust gases consisting largely of N2 and CO2, with traces of CO, NO, hydrocarbons, and O2, are pushed out through the open exhaust valve, thus completing the cycle. The primary cause of unburned hydrocarbons in the engine cylinder is wall quench, wherein the relatively cool wall in the combustion chamber of the internal combustion engine causes the fl ame to be extinguished within several thousandths of a centimeter from the wall. Part of the remaining hydrocarbons may be retained as residual gas in the cylinder, and part may be oxidized in the exhaust system. The remainder is emitted to the atmosphere as pollutant hydrocarbons. Engine misfi re due to improper adjustment and deceleration greatly increases the emission of hydrocarbons. Turbine engines are not subject to the wall quench phenomenon because their surfaces are always hot. Several engine design characteristics favor lower exhaust hydrocarbon emissions. Wall quench, which is mentioned above, is diminished by design that decreases the combustion chamber surface/ volume ratio through reduction of compression ratio, more nearly spherical combustion chamber shape, increased displacement per engine cylinder, and increased ratio of stroke relative to bore. Spark retard also reduces exhaust hydrocarbon emissions. For optimum engine power and economy, the spark should be set to fire appreciably before the piston reaches the top of the compression stroke and begins the power stroke. Retarding the spark to a point closer to top-dead-center reduces the hydrocarbon emissions markedly. One reason for this reduction is that the effective surface/volume ratio of the combustion chamber is reduced, thus cutting down on wall quench. Second, when the spark is retarded, the combustion products are purged from the cylinders sooner after combustion. Therefore, the exhaust gas is hotter, and reactions consuming hydrocarbons are promoted in the exhaust system. As shown in Figure 13.3, the air/fuel ratio in the internal combustion engine has a marked effect upon the emission of hydrocarbons. As the air/fuel ratio becomes richer in fuel than the stoichiometric ratio, the emission of hydrocarbons increases signifi cantly. There is a moderate decrease in hydrocarbon emissions when the mixture becomes appreciably leaner in fuel than the stoichiometric ratio requires. The lowest level of hydrocarbon emissions occurs at an air/fuel ratio somewhat leaner in fuel than the stoichiometric ratio. This behavior is the result of a combination of factors, including minimum quench layer thickness at an air/fuel ratio somewhat richer in fuel than the Air/fuel ratio (mass/mass) stoichiometric ratio, decreasing hydrocarbon concentration in the quench layer with a leaner mixture, increasing oxygen concentration in the exhaust with a leaner mixture, and a peak exhaust temperature at a ratio slightly leaner in fuel than the stoichiometric ratio. Catalytic converters are now used to destroy pollutants in exhaust gases. Currently, the most commonly used automotive catalytic converter is the three-way conversion catalyst, so called because a single catalytic unit destroys all three of the main class of automobile exhaust pollutants\u2014hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. This catalyst depends upon accurate sensing of oxygen levels in the exhaust combined with computerized engine control, which cycles the air/fuel mixture several times per second back and forth between slightly lean and slightly rich relative to the stoichiometric ratio.", "Under these conditions carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and hydrocarbons (CcHh) are oxidized. CO + 1O \u00c6 CO (13.1) 22 2 H + 1O \u00c6 HO 2 22 2 (13.2) CH + (c + h ) O \u00c6 cCO + h HO ch 42 222 (13.3) Nitrogen oxides are reduced on the catalyst to N2 by carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, or hydrogen as shown by the following reduction with CO: CO + NO \u00c6 1N + CO 22 2 (13.4) Automotive exhaust catalysts are dispersed on a high surface area substrate, most commonly consisting of cordierite, a ceramic composed of alumina (Al2O3), silica, and magnesium oxide. The substrate is formed as a honeycomb-type structure providing maximum surface area to contact exhaust gases. The support needs to be mechanically strong to withstand vibrational stresses from the automobile, and it must resist severe thermal stresses in which the temperature may rise from ambient temperatures to approximately 900\u00b0C over an approximately 2-min period during \u201clightoff\u201d when the engine is started. The catalytic material, which composes only about 0.10\u20130.15% of the catalyst body, consists of a mixture of precious metals. Platinum and palladium catalyze the oxidation of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, and rhodium acts as a catalyst for the reduction of nitrogen oxides; presently, palladium is the most common precious metal in exhaust catalysts. Since lead can poison auto exhaust catalysts, automobiles equipped with catalytic exhaust-control devices require lead-free gasoline, which has now displaced gasoline containing antiknock tetraethyl lead, the dominant automobile engine fuel that was standard until the 1970s. Sulfur in gasoline is also detrimental to catalyst performance, and the sulfur contents of gasoline and, more recently, diesel fuel have been greatly reduced in recent years. The internal combustion automobile engine has been developed to a remarkably high degree of sophistication in terms of its emissions. Increased use of hybrid automobiles combining an internal combustion engine with an electric motor/generator that enable the internal combustion engine to run evenly under optimum operating conditions are lowering emissions even further. The 1990 U.S. Clean Air Act called for reformulating gasoline by adding more oxygenated compounds to reduce emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. However, this measure became rather controversial and problems were encountered with one of the major oxygenated additives, MTBE, which was detected as a common water pollutant in some areas. Because of these concerns, MTBE has been largely eliminated from gasoline and replaced by ethanol as an oxygenated additive. Ethanol in gasoline poses some environmental and sustainability problems. Ethanol is regarded as a renewable fuel source made by fermentation of sugars, primarily from corn in the United States and abundant sugarcane in Brazil. Some studies have suggested that the life cycle of corn-based ethanol in gasoline will increase photochemical smog compared to gasoline that is entirely from petroleum sources.2 Emissions to the atmosphere of volatile ethanol from fuel that is 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline (E85) could contribute to elevated atmospheric levels of photochemically produced acetaldehyde, a noxious smog component. 13.2.2 AUTOMOTIVE EMISSION STANDARDS Federal law and California state law mandate automotive emission standards. The allowable emissions have been on a downward trend since the first standards were imposed in the mid-1960s. Table 13.1 gives Federal emissions prior to controls and those for various time intervals since 1970. 13.2.3 POLLUTING GREEN PLANTS In some areas, biogenic hydrocarbons emitted to the atmosphere by plants are signifi cant\u2014even dominant\u2014sources of hydrocarbons contributing to smog.

Some of the most common biogenic terpenes are shown in Figure 12.1. These compounds include a-pinene from pine trees and limonene from citrus trees. The most widely emitted terpene from plants is isoprene,3 a monomer in natural rubber: CH3H H CC C C IsopreneH H H Photochemical oxidation of isoprene results in the formation of much of the aerosol encountered in forest regions.", "The primary oxidation products of isoprene under smog-forming conditions are the carbonyls methacrolein and methylvinyl ketone: CH3 CH3 H O H CCC CCC HO H HH Methacrolein Methylvinyl ketone A significant product of the atmospheric oxidation of isoprene consists of isoprene nitrates, which can be formed by the reaction of isoprene with hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211, in the presence of nitrogen oxides and by reaction of isoprene with nitrate radical, NO3.4 13.3 SMOG-FORMING REACTIONS OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN THE ATMOSPHERE Hydrocarbons are eliminated from the atmosphere by a number of chemical and photochemical reactions. These reactions are responsible for the formation of many noxious secondary pollutant products and intermediates from relatively innocuous hydrocarbon precursors. These pollutant products and intermediates make up photochemical smog. Hydrocarbons and most other organic compounds in the atmosphere are thermodynamically unstable toward oxidation and tend to be oxidized through a series of steps. The oxidation process terminates with the formation of CO2, solid organic particulate matter which settles from the atmosphere, or water-soluble products (e.g., acids, aldehydes) which are removed by rain. Inorganic species such as ozone or nitric acid are byproducts of these reactions. 13.3.1 PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTIONS OF METHANE Some of the major reactions involved in the oxidation of atmospheric hydrocarbons may be understood by considering the oxidation of methane, the most common and widely dispersed atmospheric hydrocarbon (though also the least reactive in the atmosphere). Like other hydrocarbons, methane reacts with oxygen atoms (generally produced by the photochemical dissociation of NO2 to O and NO) to generate the all-important hydroxyl radical and an alkyl (methyl) radical CH4 + O \u00c6 H3C \u2211+ HO \u2211 (13.5) The methyl radical produced reacts rapidly with molecular oxygen to form very reactive peroxyl radicals, H3C\u2211 + O2 + M (energy-absorbing third body, usually a molecule of N2 or O2) \u00c6 H3COO \u2211+ M (13.6) in this case, methyl peroxyl radical, H3COO\u2211. Such radicals participate in a variety of subsequent chain reactions, including those leading to smog formation. The hydroxyl radical reacts rapidly with hydrocarbons to form reactive hydrocarbon radicals, CH4 +HO\u2211\u00c6H3C\u2211+H2O (13.7) in this case, the methyl radical, H3C\u2211. The following are more reactions involved in the overall oxidation of methane: H3COO\u2211+ NO \u00c6H3CO\u2211+NO2 (13.8) (This is a very important kind of reaction in smog formation because the oxidation of NO by peroxyl radicals is the predominant means of regenerating NO2 in the atmosphere after it has been photochemically dissociated to NO.) H3CO\u2211+O3 \u00c6 various products (13.9) H3CO\u2211+O2 \u00c6CH2O +HOO\u2211 (13.10) H3COO\u2211+NO2 +M \u00c6CH3OONO2 +M (13.11) CH2O h \u00c6photodissociation products +n (13.12) (photodissociation of formaldehyde) As noted throughout this chapter, hydroxyl radical, HO\u2211, and hydroperoxyl radical, HOO\u2211, are ubiquitous intermediates in photochemical chain-reaction processes. These two species are known collectively as odd hydrogen radicals. Reactions such as 13.5 and 13.7 are abstraction reactions involving the removal of an atom, usually hydrogen, by reaction with an active species. Addition reactions of organic compounds are also common. Typically, hydroxyl radical reacts with an alkene such as propylene to form another reactive free radical: HH HH H HO\u2022+HC C C HC C\u2022 COH (13.13) H H HHH Ozone adds to unsaturated compounds to form reactive ozonides: H (13.14) H Organic compounds (in the troposphere, almost exclusively carbonyls) can undergo primary photochemical reactions resulting in the direct formation of free radicals. By far the most important of these is the photochemical dissociation of aldehydes: HO H \u2022 HC CH+ hv H C\u2022+HCO (13.15) HH Organic free radicals undergo a number of chemical reactions. Hydroxyl radicals may be generated from organic peroxyl reactions such as O\u2022 HOH HOH HCCCH HCC CH+HO\u2022 (13.16) HH HH leaving an aldehyde or ketone. The hydroxyl radical may react with other organic compounds, maintaining the chain reaction. Gas-phase reaction chains commonly have many steps. Furthermore, chain-branching reactions take place in which a free radical reacts with an excited molecule causing it to produce two new radicals. Chain termination may occur in several ways, including reaction of two free radicals, 2HO\u2211\u00c6 H2O2 (13.17) adduct formation with nitric oxide or nitrogen dioxide (which, because of their odd numbers of electrons, are themselves stable free radicals), HO\u2211+ NO2 + M \u00c6 HNO3 + M (13.18) or reaction of the radical with a solid particle surface. Hydrocarbons may undergo heterogeneous reactions on particles in the atmosphere. Dusts composed of metal oxides or charcoal have a catalytic effect upon the oxidation of organic compounds. Metal oxides may enter into photochemical reactions.", "For example, zinc oxide photosensitized by exposure to light promotes oxidation of organic compounds. The kinds of reactions just discussed are involved in the formation of photochemical smog in the atmosphere. Much of what is known about the reactions that take place in a smog-forming atmosphere has been learned from studies in large chambers containing a stationary mass of air that is subjected to conditions conducive to the formation of photochemical smog including exposure to ultraviolet radiation, low humidity, and presence of reactive hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides.5 Next, consideration is given to the smog-forming process. 13.4 OVERVIEW OF SMOG FORMATION This section addresses the conditions that are characteristic of a smoggy atmosphere and the overall processes involved in smog formation. In atmospheres that receive hydrocarbon and NO pollution accompanied by intense sunlight and stagnant air masses, oxidants tend to form. In air-pollution parlance, gross photochemical oxidant is a substance in the atmosphere capable of oxidizing iodide ion to elemental iodine. Sometimes other reducing agents are used to measure oxidants. The primary oxidant in the atmosphere is ozone. Other atmospheric oxidants include H2O2, organic peroxides (ROOR\u00a2), organic hydroperoxides (ROOH), and peroxyacyl nitrates such as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). HO HCCOONO2 H Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) Nitrogen dioxide, NO2, is not regarded as a gross photochemical oxidant. However, it is about 15% as efficient as O3 in oxidizing iodide to iodine(0), and a correction is made in measurements for the positive interference of NO2. Sulfur dioxide is oxidized by O3 and produces a negative interference for which a measurement correction must also be made. PAN and related compounds containing the \u2212C(O)OONO2 moiety, such as peroxybenzoyl nitrate (PBN), O C OO NO2 Peroxybenzoyl nitrate (PBN) a powerful eye irritant and lachrymator, are produced photochemically in atmospheres containing alkenes and NOx. PAN, especially, is a notorious organic oxidant. It has several adverse effects including eye irritation, phytotoxicity, and mutagenicity and is perhaps the best single indicator of photochemical smog conditions. In addition to PAN and PBN, some other specific organic oxidants that may be important in polluted atmospheres are peroxypropionyl nitrate (PPN); peracetic acid, CH3(CO)OOH; acetylperoxide, CH3(CO)OO(CO)CH3; butyl hydroperoxide, CH3CH2CH2CH2OOH; and tert-butylhydroperoxide, (CH3)3COOH. Fortunately, levels of PAN, PPN, and other organic oxidants as well have decreased significantly in smog-prone areas such as southern California from the 1960s to the present, the result of emission control measures that have been implemented. As shown in Figure 13.4, smoggy atmospheres show characteristic variations with time of day in levels of NO, NO2, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and oxidants. Examination of the fi gure shows that shortly after sunrise the level of NO in the atmosphere decreases markedly, a decrease that is accompanied by a peak in the concentration of NO2. During midday (significantly, after the concentration of NO has fallen to a very low level), the levels of aldehydes and oxidants become relatively high. The concentration of total hydrocarbons in the atmosphere peaks sharply in the morning, then decreases during the remaining daylight hours. An overview of the processes responsible for the behavior just discussed is summarized in Figure 13.5. The chemical bases for the processes illustrated in this figure are explained in the following section. 13.5 MECHANISMS OF SMOG FORMATION Here are discussed some of the primary aspects of photochemical smog formation. For more details the reader is referred to books on atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric chemistry and physics listed in the Supplementary References at the end of this chapter. Since the exact chemistry of photochemical smog formation is very complex, many of the reactions are given as plausible illustrative examples rather than proven mechanisms. The kind of behavior summarized in Figure 13.4 contains several apparent anomalies, which puzzled scientists for many years. The first of these was the rapid increase in NO2 concentration and decrease in NO concentration under conditions where it was known that photodissociation of NO2 to O and NO was occurring. Furthermore, it could be shown that the disappearance of alkenes and other hydrocarbons was much more rapid than could be explained by their relatively slow reactions with O3 and O. These anomalies are now explained by chain reactions involving the interconversion of NO and NO2, the oxidation of hydrocarbons, and the generation of reactive intermediates, particularly hydroxyl radical (HO\u2211).", "0.4 Pollutant level, ppm by volume 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 M 4 a.m. 8 a.m. 4 p.m. 8 p.m. Time of day Figure 13.5 shows the overall reaction scheme for smog formation, which is based upon the photochemically initiated reactions that occur in an atmosphere containing nitrogen oxides, reactive hydrocarbons, and oxygen. The time variations in levels of hydrocarbons, ozone, NO, and NO2 are explained by the following overall reactions: 1. Primary photochemical reaction producing oxygen atoms: NO2 + hn (l < 394 nm) \u00c6 NO + O (13.19) 2. Reactions involving oxygen species (M is an energy-absorbing third body): O2 + O + M \u00c6 O3 + M O3 + NO \u00c6 NO2 + O2 (13.20) (13.21) Because the latter reaction is rapid, the concentration of O3 remains low until that of NO falls to a low value. Automotive emissions of NO tend to keep O3 concentrations lower along freeways. 3. Production of organic free radicals from hydrocarbons, RH: O + RH \u00c6 R\u2211+ other products (13.22) O3 + RH \u00c6 R\u2211+ and/or other products (13.23) (R\u2211 is a free radical in which the dot denotes an unpaired electron, which may or may not contain oxygen.) 4. Chain propagation, branching, and termination by a variety of reactions such as the following: NO + ROO\u2211\u00c6 NO2 + and/or other products (13.24) NO2 + R\u2211\u00c6 products (e.g., PAN) (13.25) The latter kind of reaction is the most common chain-terminating process in smog because NO2 is a stable free radical present at high concentrations. Chains may terminate also by reaction of free radicals with NO or by reaction of two R\u2211 radicals, although the latter is uncommon because of the relatively low concentrations of radicals compared to molecular species. Chain termination by radical sorption on a particle surface is also possible and may contribute to aerosol particle growth. A large number of specific reactions are involved in the overall scheme for the formation of photochemical smog. The formation of atomic oxygen by a primary photochemical reaction (Reaction 13.19) leads to several reactions involving oxygen and nitrogen oxide species: O + O2 + M \u00c6 O3 + M (13.26) O + NO + M \u00c6 NO2 + M (13.27) O + NO2 \u00c6 NO + O2 (13.28) O3 + NO \u00c6 NO2 + O2 (13.29) O + NO2 + M \u00c6 NO3 + M (13.30) O3 + NO2 \u00c6 NO3 + O2 (13.31) There are a number of significant atmospheric reactions involving nitrogen oxides, water, nitrous acid, and nitric acid: NO3 + NO2 \u00c6 N2O5 (13.32) N2O5 \u00c6 NO3 + NO2 (13.33) NO3 + NO \u00c6 2NO2 (13.34) N2O5 + H2O \u00c6 2HNO3 (13.35) (This reaction is slow in the gas phase but may be fast on surfaces.) Very reactive HO\u2211 radicals can be formed by the reaction of excited atomic oxygen with water, O* + H2O \u00c6 2HO\u2211 (13.36) by photodissociation of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 + hn (l < 350 nm) \u00c6 2HO\u2211 (13.37) or by the photolysis of nitrous acid, HNO2 + hn\u00c6 HO\u2211+ NO (13.38) This reaction may be the main source of hydroxyl radical during early morning hours when sources deriving from the presence of ozone are minimal. Among the inorganic species with which the hydroxyl radical reacts are oxides of nitrogen, HO\u2211+ NO2 \u00c6 HNO3 (13.39) HO\u2211+ NO + M \u00c6 HNO2 + M (13.40) and carbon monoxide, CO + HO\u2211+ O2 \u00c6 CO2 + HOO\u2211 (13.41) The last reaction is significant in that it is responsible for the disappearance of much atmospheric CO (see Section 11.3) and because it produces the hydroperoxyl radical HOO\u2211. One of the major inorganic reactions of the hydroperoxyl radical is the oxidation of NO: HOO\u2211+ NO \u00c6 HO\u2211+ NO2 (13.42) For purely inorganic systems, kinetic calculations and experimental measurements cannot explain the rapid transformation of NO to NO2 that occurs in an atmosphere undergoing photochemical smog formation and predict that the concentration of NO2 should remain very low. However, in the presence of reactive hydrocarbons, NO2 accumulates very rapidly by a reaction process beginning with its photodissociation! It may be concluded, therefore, that the organic compounds form species that react with NO directly rather than with NO2. A number of chain reactions have been shown to result in the general type of species behavior with time shown in Figure 13.4.", "When alkane hydrocarbons, RH, react with O, O3, or HO\u2211 radical, RH + O + O2 \u00c6 ROO\u2211+ HO\u2211 (13.43) RH + HO\u2211+ O2 \u00c6 ROO\u2211+ H2O (13.44) reactive oxygenated organic radicals, ROO\u2211, are produced. Alkenes are much more reactive, undergoing primarily addition reactions with hydroxyl radical, R C R R C R HO\u2022 Very rapid HO R C R R C\u2022 R Oxidation products (13.45) Radical adduct (where R may be one of a number of hydrocarbon moieties or an H atom), with oxygen atoms, O\u2022 RRR Oxidation C C+O RC C\u2022 (13.46) productsRR RR Biradical or with ozone: O O ORR Oxidation C C +O3 RC CR (13.47) productsRR RR Aromatic hydrocarbons, Ar-H, may also react with O and HO\u2211. Addition reactions of aromatics with HO\u2211 are favored. The product of the reaction of benzene with HO\u2211 is phenol, as shown by the following reaction sequence in which the half-circle and dot inside the hexagon structure represents a free radical formed by adding HO\u2211 to the aromatic ring: H OH + HO\u2022 (13.48) H OH OH + O2 + HOO\u2022 (13.49) In the case of alkyl benzenes, such as toluene, the hydroxyl radical attack may occur on the alkyl group, leading to reaction sequences such as those of alkanes. Aldehydes react with HO\u2211, OO R C H+HO\u2022+O2 R C OO\u2022+H2O (13.50) H C O+HO\u2022+ O2 CO2+HOO\u2022+H2O (13.51) 3 2 H and undergo photochemical reactions: O R C H+ hv + 2O2 ROO\u2022 + CO + HOO\u2022 (13.52) H C O+ hv + 2O2 CO + HOO\u2022 (13.53) H Hydroxyl radical (HO\u2211), which reacts with some hydrocarbons at rates that are almost diffusion-controlled, is the predominant reactant in early stages of smog formation. Significant contributions are made by hydroperoxyl radical (HOO\u2211), O3, and (at night) NO3 after smog formation is well underway. One of the most important reaction sequences in the smog-formation process begins with the abstraction by HO\u2211 of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon and leads to the oxidation of NO to NO2 as follows: RH + HO\u2211\u00c6 R\u2211+ H2O (13.54) The alkyl radical, R\u2211, reacts with O2 to produce a peroxyl radical, ROO\u2211: R\u2211+ O2 \u00c6 ROO\u2211 (13.55) This strongly oxidizing species very effectively oxidizes NO to NO2, ROO\u2211+ NO \u00c6 RO\u2211+ NO2 (13.56) thus explaining the once-puzzling rapid conversion of NO to NO2 in an atmosphere in which the latter is undergoing photodissociation. The alkoxyl radical product, RO\u2211, is not so stable as ROO\u2211. In cases where the oxygen atom is attached to a carbon atom that is also bonded to H, a carbonyl compound is likely to be formed by the following type of reaction: O H3CO\u2022+O2 H C H+HOO\u2022 (13.57) The rapid production of photosensitive carbonyl compounds from alkoxyl radicals is an important stimulant for further atmospheric photochemical reactions. In the absence of extractable hydrogen, cleavage of a radical containing the carbonyl group occurs: O H3C C O\u2022 H3C\u2022 +CO2 (13.58) Carbonyl compounds, which are discussed in more detail in Section 12.4, are important initiators, intermediates and end products of smog formation. More than 50 carbonyls may be present in highly polluted air. The most abundant carbonyls in the polluted urban atmosphere are usually formaldehyde and acetaldehyde; acetone is usually the most abundant ketone. The oxidation of NO to NO2 in the atmosphere was noted above. Another reaction that can lead to the oxidation of NO is of the following type: O R C OO\u2022+NO+O2 ROO\u2022+NO2+CO2 (13.59) Peroxyacyl nitrates are formed by an addition reaction with NO2: O O R C OO\u2022 + NO2 R C OO NO2 (13.60) When R is the methyl group, the product is PAN, mentioned in Section 13.4. Although it is thermally unstable, PAN does not undergo photolysis rapidly, reacts only slowly with HO\u2211 radical, and has a low water solubility. Therefore, the major pathway by which it is lost from the atmosphere is thermal decomposition, the reverse of Reaction 13.60. Peroxyacyl nitrates are highly significant air pollutants that are symptomatic of photochemical smog. These compounds are eye irritants and mutagens. As potent phytotoxins, they are damaging to plants and they are agents for the atmospheric transport of reactive nitrogen. There is concern that the increasing use of ethanol as a gasoline antiknock additive will increase levels of PAN.", "This is because ethanol is photochemically oxidized to acetaldehyde, the photochemical oxidation of which leads to the formation of PAN.6 Alkyl nitrates and alkyl nitrites may be formed by the reaction of alkoxyl radicals (RO\u2211) with nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide, respectively: RO\u2211+ NO2 \u00c6 RONO2 (13.61) RO\u2211+ NO \u00c6 RONO (13.62) Addition reactions with NO2 and NO such as those shown in Reactions 13.61 and 13.62 are important in terminating the reaction chains involved in smog formation. The fact that NO2 is involved in a chain termination step (Reaction 13.61) as well as a chain initiation step (Reaction 13.19) may limit the effectiveness of moderate reductions in NOx emissions in curtailing smog formation. Nitrates and peroxynitrates are important constituents of smoggy atmospheres. As shown in Reaction 13.57, the reaction of oxygen with alkoxyl radicals produces hydroperoxyl radical. Peroxyl radicals can react with one another to produce reactive hydrogen peroxide, alkoxyl radicals, and hydroxyl radicals: HOO\u2211+ HOO\u2211\u00c6 H2O2 + O2 (13.63) HOO\u2211+ ROO\u2211\u00c6 RO\u2211+ HO\u2211+ O2 (13.64) ROO\u2211+ ROO\u2211\u00c6 2RO\u2211+ O2 (13.65) 13.5.1 NITRATE RADICAL First observed in the troposphere in 1980, nitrate radical, NO3, is now recognized as being an important atmospheric chemical species, especially at night. This species is formed by the reaction NO2 + O3 \u00c6 NO3 + O2 (13.66) and exists in equilibrium with NO2: NO + NO + M NO + M (energy-absorbing third body) 2 3 2 5 (13.67) Levels of NO3 remain low during daylight, typically with a lifetime at noon of only about 5 s, because of the following two dissociation reactions: NO3 + hn (l< 700 nm) \u00c6 NO + O2 (13.68) NO3 + hn (l< 580 nm) \u00c6 NO2 + O (13.69) It is likely that NO3 levels become high enough in the hour before sunset to begin to have an effect on tropospheric chemistry. At night the levels of NO3 become much higher, typically reaching values of around 8 \u00a5 107 molecules/cm3 compared to only about 1 \u00a5 106 molecules/cm3 for hydroxyl radical. Although the hydroxyl radical reacts 10\u20131000 times faster than NO3, the much higher concentration of the latter means that it is responsible for much of the atmospheric chemistry that occurs at night. The nitrate radical adds across the double bonds in alkenes leading to the formation of reactive radical species that participate in smog formation. 13.5.2 PHOTOLYZABLE COMPOUNDS IN THE ATMOSPHERE It may be useful at this time to review the types of compounds capable of undergoing photolysis in the troposphere and thus initiating chain reaction. Under most tropospheric conditions, the most important of these is NO2: NO2 + hn (l < 394 nm) \u00c6 NO + O (13.19) In relatively polluted atmospheres, the next most important photodissociation reaction is that of carbonyl compounds, particularly formaldehyde: CH2O + hn (l < 335 nm) \u00c6 H\u2211+ HC \u2211 O (13.70) Hydrogen peroxide photodissociates to produce two hydroxyl radicals: HOOH + hn (l < 350 nm) \u00c6 2HO\u2211 (13.71) Finally, organic peroxides may be formed and subsequently dissociate by the following reactions, starting with a peroxyl radical: H3COO\u2211+ HOO\u2211\u00c6 H3COOH + O2 (13.72) H3COOH + hn (l < 350 nm) \u00c6 H3CO\u2211+ HO\u2211 (13.73) It should be noted that Reactions 13.70, 13.71, and 13.73 each gives rise to two free radical species per photon absorbed. Ozone undergoes photochemical dissociation to produce excited oxygen atoms at wavelengths less than 315 nm. These atoms may react with H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals. 13.6 REACTIVITY OF HYDROCARBONS The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the smog formation process is an important consideration in understanding the process and in developing control strategies. It is useful to know which are the most reactive hydrocarbons so that their release can be minimized. Less reactive hydrocarbons, of which propane is a good example, may cause smog formation far downwind from the point of release. Hydrocarbon reactivity is best based upon the interaction of hydrocarbons with hydroxyl radical. Methane, the least reactive common gas-phase hydrocarbon with an atmospheric half-life exceeding 10 days, is assigned a reactivity of 1.0. (Despite its low reactivity, methane is so abundant in the atmosphere that it accounts for a significant fraction of total hydroxyl radical reactions.) In contrast, b-pinene produced by conifer trees and other vegetation, is almost 9000 times as reactive as methane, and d-limonene, produced by orange rind, is almost 19,000 times as reactive. Relative to their rates of reaction with hydroxyl radical, hydrocarbon reactivities may be classified from I through V as shown in Table 13.2.", "13.7 INORGANIC PRODUCTS FROM SMOG Two major classes of inorganic products from smog are sulfates and nitrates. Inorganic sulfates and nitrates, along with sulfur and nitrogen oxides, can contribute to acidic precipitation, corrosion, reduced visibility, and adverse health effects.

Although slow in a clean atmosphere, the oxidation of SO2 to sulfate species is relatively rapid under smoggy conditions. During severe photochemical smog conditions, oxidation rates of 5\u201310% per hour may occur, as compared to only a fraction of a percent per hour under normal atmospheric conditions. Thus, sulfur dioxide exposed to smog can produce very high local concentrations of sulfate, which can aggravate already bad atmospheric conditions. Several oxidant species in smog can oxidize SO2. Among the oxidants are compounds, including O3, NO3, and N2O5, as well as reactive radical species, particularly HO\u2211, HOO\u2211, O, RO\u2211, and ROO\u2211. The two major primary reactions are oxygen transfer, SO2 + O (from O, RO\u2211, ROO\u2211) \u00c6 SO3 \u00c6 H2SO4, sulfates (13.74) or addition of other species. As an example of the latter, HO\u2211 adds to SO2 to form a reactive species which can further react with oxygen, nitrogen oxides, or other species to yield sulfates, other sulfur compounds, or compounds of nitrogen: HO\u2211+ SO2 \u00c6 HOSOO\u2211 (13.75) The presence of HO\u2211 (typically at a level of 3 \u00a5 106 radicals/cm3, but appreciably higher in a smoggy atmosphere) makes this a likely route. Addition of SO2 to RO\u2211 or ROO\u2211 can yield organic sulfur compounds. It should be noted that the reaction of H2S with HO\u2211 is quite rapid. As a result, the normal atmospheric half-life of H2S of about one-half day becomes much shorter in the presence of photochemical smog. Inorganic nitrates or nitric acid are formed by several reactions in smog. Among the important reactions forming nitric acid are the reaction of N2O5 with water (Reaction 13.35) and the addition of hydroxyl radical to NO2 (Reaction 13.39). The oxidation of NO or NO2 to nitrate species may occur after absorption of gas by an aerosol droplet. Nitric acid formed by these reactions reacts with ammonia in the atmosphere to form ammonium nitrate: NH3 + HNO3 \u00c6 NH4NO3 (13.76) Other nitrate salts may also be formed. Nitric acid and nitrates are among the more damaging end products of smog. In addition to possible adverse effects on plants and animals, they cause severe corrosion problems. Electrical relay contacts and small springs associated with electrical switches are especially susceptible to damage from nitrate-induced corrosion. 13.8 EFFECTS OF SMOG The harmful effects of smog occur mainly in the areas of (1) human health and comfort, (2) damage to materials, (3) effects on the atmosphere, and (4) toxicity to plants. The exact degree to which exposure to smog affects human health is not known, although substantial adverse effects are suspected. Pungent-smelling, smog-produced ozone is known to be toxic. Ozone at 0.15 ppm causes coughing, wheezing, bronchial constriction, and irritation to the respiratory mucous system in healthy, exercising individuals. In March 2008, the U.S. EPA released a revised eight-hour national ambient air quality standard for ground-level ozone of 0.075 ppm ozone based upon likely health effects of this pollutant. At the same time, the EPA also revised the secondary standard for ground-level ozone to the same 0.075 ppm level. The secondary standard is based upon evidence of ozone damage to plants, trees, and crops during the growing season. In addition to ozone, oxidant peroxyacyl nitrates and aldehydes found in smog are eye irritants. Materials are adversely affected by some smog components. Rubber has a high affinity for ozone and is cracked and aged by it. Indeed, the cracking of rubber used to be employed as a test for the presence of ozone.", "Ozone attacks natural rubber and similar materials by oxidizing and breaking double bonds in the polymer according to the following reaction: H CH3 H H O O CH3 CCC C +O3 RCC CR' O (13.77) HH H n OO Rubber polymer R C OH + H3C C R' This oxidative scission type of reaction causes bonds in the polymer structure to break and results in deterioration of the polymer. Aerosol particles that reduce visibility are formed by the polymerization of the smaller molecules produced in smog-forming reactions.7 Since these reactions largely involve the oxidation of hydrocarbons, it is not surprising that oxygen-containing organics make up the bulk of the particulate matter produced from smog. Ether-soluble aerosols collected from the Los Angeles atmosphere have shown an empirical formula of approximately CH2O. Among the specific kinds of compounds identified in organic smog aerosols are alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, organic acids, esters, and organic nitrates. Hydrocarbons of plant origin are prominent among the precursors to particle formation in photochemical smog. Smog aerosols likely form by condensation on existing nuclei rather than by self-nucleation of reaction product molecules. In support of this view are electron micrographs of these aerosols showing that smog aerosol particles in the micrometer-size region consist of liquid droplets with an inorganic electron-opaque core (Figure 13.6). Thus, particulate matter from a source other than smog may have some influence on the formation and properties of smog aerosols. In view of worldwide shortages of food, the known harmful effects of smog on plants are of particular concern. These effects are largely due to oxidants in the smoggy atmosphere. The three major oxidants involved are ozone, PAN, and nitrogen oxides. Of these, PAN has the highest toxicity to plants, attacking younger leaves and causing \u201cbronzing\u201d and \u201cglazing\u201d of their surfaces. Exposure for several hours to an atmosphere containing PAN at a level of only 0.02\u20130.05 ppm will damage vegetation. The sulfhydryl group of proteins in organisms is susceptible to damage by PAN, which reacts with such groups as both an oxidizing agent and an acetylating agent. Fortunately, PAN is usually present at only low levels. Nitrogen oxides occur at relatively high concentrations during smoggy conditions, but their toxicity to plants is relatively low. Short-chain alkyl hydroperoxides, which were mentioned in Section 13.4, occur at low levels under smoggy conditions, and even in remote atmospheres. It is possible that these species can oxidize DNA bases, causing adverse genetic effects. Alkyl hydroperoxides are formed under smoggy conditions by the reaction of alkyl peroxy radicals with hydroperoxy radical, HO2 \u2211, as shown for the formation of methyl hydroperoxide below: H3CO2 \u2211+ HO2 \u2211\u00c6 H3COOH + O2 (13.78) Ames assays of methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl hydroperoxides (see Chapter 22) have shown some tendency toward mutagenicity on select strains of Salmonella typhimurium, although any conclusions drawn from such studies on human health should be made with caution. The low toxicity of nitrogen oxides and the usually low levels of PAN, hydroperoxides, and other oxidants present in smog leave ozone as the greatest smog-produced threat to plant life. Some plant species, including sword-leaf lettuce, black nightshade, quickweed, and double-fortune tomato, are so susceptible to the effects of ozone and other photochemical oxidants that they are used as bioindicators of the presence of smog. Typical of the phytotoxicity of O3, ozone damage to a lemon leaf is manifested by chlorotic stippling (characteristic yellow spots on a green leaf), as represented in Figure 13.7. Ponderosa and Jeffrey pines exposed to ozone and smog in California\u2019s San Bernardino Mountains have suffered chlorotic mottle and premature needle death. Reduction in plant growth may occur without visible lesions on the plant. Brief exposure to approximately 0.06 ppm of ozone may temporarily cut photosynthesis rates in some plants in half. Crop damage from ozone and other photochemical air pollutants in California alone is estimated to cost millions of dollars each year. The geographic distribution of damage to plants in California is illustrated in Figure 13.8. LITERATURE CITED 1. Guerova, G. and N.

These include fossil records, isotopic abundances in polar ice, and air entrained in it. For conditions going back to several centuries, the size and trace element content of tree rings are particularly useful and refl ect abundance of water, temperatures, air composition, and presence of pollutants under which each ring was formed.1 There is a very strong connection between life forms on Earth and the nature of the earth\u2019s climate, which determines its suitability for life. As proposed by James Lovelock, a British chemist, this forms the basis of the Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the atmospheric O2/CO2 balance established and sustained by organisms determines and maintains the earth\u2019s climate and other environmental conditions. For about 3.5 billion years, stabilizing feedback mechanisms have maintained the earth/atmosphere boundary region within narrow liquid water conditions in which life can exist.", "It is incumbent upon humankind to avoid upsetting this delicate balance within just a few years\u2019 period of time. Ever since life first appeared on Earth, the atmosphere has been influenced by the metabolic processes of living organisms. When the first primitive life molecules were formed approximately 3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere was very different from its present state. At that time, it was chemically reducing and was thought to contain nitrogen, methane, ammonia, water vapor, and hydrogen, but no elemental oxygen. These gases and water in the sea were bombarded by intense, bond-breaking ultraviolet radiation which, along with lightning and radiation from radionuclides, provided the energy to bring about chemical reactions that resulted in the production of relatively complicated molecules, including even amino acids and sugars. From this rich chemical mixture, life molecules evolved. Initially, these very primitive life forms derived their energy from fermentation of organic matter formed by chemical and photochemical processes, but eventually they gained the capability to produce organic matter, \u201c{CH2O},\u201d by photosynthesis utilizing solar light energy (hn), CO2 + H2O + hn\u00c6 {CH2O} + O2(g) (14.1) and the stage was set for the massive biochemical transformation that resulted in the production of almost all the atmosphere\u2019s oxygen. The oxygen initially produced by photosynthesis was probably quite toxic to primitive life forms. However, much of this oxygen was converted to iron oxides by reaction with soluble iron(II): 4Fe2++ O2 + 4H2O \u00c6 2Fe2O3 + 8H+ (14.2) The enormous deposits of iron oxides thus formed provide convincing evidence for the liberation of free oxygen into the primitive atmosphere. Eventually enzyme systems developed that enabled organisms to mediate the reaction of waste-product oxygen with oxidizable organic matter in the sea. Later this mode of waste-product disposal was utilized by organisms to produce energy for respiration, which is now the mechanism by which nonphotosynthetic organisms obtain energy. In time, oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere, providing an abundant source of O2 for respiration. It had an additional benefit in that it enabled the formation of an ozone shield against solar ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. With this shield in place, Earth became a much more hospitable environment for life, and life forms were enabled to move from the protective surroundings of the sea to the more exposed environment of the land. Other instances of climatic change and regulation induced by organisms can be cited. An important example is the maintenance of atmospheric carbon dioxide at low levels through the action of photosynthetic organisms (note from Reaction 14.1 that photosynthesis removes CO2 from the atmosphere). But, at an ever-accelerating pace during the last 200 years, another organism, humankind, has engaged in a number of activities that are altering the atmosphere profoundly. As noted in Chapter 1, human influences are so strong that it is useful to invoke a fifth sphere of the environment, the anthrosphere. The atmosphere receives a number of contaminants from the anthrosphere. These substances may have pronounced effects far out of proportion to their fraction of the total mass of the atmosphere, especially in the following areas: (1) absorption of outgoing infrared radiation, thereby warming the atmosphere, (2) scattering and reflection of sunlight, (3) formation of photochemically reactive species such as NO2 that are activated by absorption of ultraviolet radiation, (4) formation of catalytic species such as ozone-destroying Cl atoms produced by the photodissociation of CFCs in the stratosphere. Human activities that have a strong influence on the atmosphere include industrial activities that emit particles and pollutant gases; fossil fuel combustion that emits particles and oxides of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen; modes of transportation reliant on fossil fuels that emit air pollutants; alteration of land surfaces, including deforestation and desertification; burning of biomass and vegetation that emits soot and carbon and nitrogen oxides; and agricultural practices such as the cultivation of rice, which emits large quantities of methane. Major effects of these processes include increased acidity of the atmosphere, elevated levels of atmospheric oxidants, increased global warming, increased levels of gases that threaten the stratospheric ozone layer, and increased corrosivity of the atmosphere. In 1957, photochemical smog was only beginning to be recognized as a serious problem, acid rain and the greenhouse effect were scientific curiosities, and the ozone-destroying potential of CFCs had not even been imagined. In that year, Revelle and Suess2 prophetically referred to human perturbations of Earth and its climate as a massive \u201cgeophysical experiment.\u201d The effects that this experiment may have on the global atmosphere are discussed in this chapter.", "14.1.1 CHANGES IN CLIMATE Ample evidence exists of massive changes in the earth\u2019s climate in times past. Indeed, humankind exists now in an approximately 10,000-year interglacial era called the holocene. Evidence from the past suggests that major changes in climate may occur very rapidly, within a few years\u2019 period of time. These may occur through positive feedback mechanisms in which, once a certain threshold is passed, the change feeds on itself and proceeds rapidly and irreversibly. One analogy is that of a canoe. Leaning gently to one side will cause the canoe to tip slightly such that it rights itself once the occupant has stopped leaning. However, beyond a certain point, the canoe tips over completely and irreversibly. Cooling of the climate may result in more coverage of the earth\u2019s surface with ice and snow, which reflects solar energy and results in more cooling and more ice and snow. Drought can destroy vegetation, without which there is less transpiration of moisture into the atmosphere, causing less rainfall and even greater loss of vegetation. Fluctuations in climate have significant ecological effects, both direct and indirect. In recent years, attention has shifted from short-term, localized weather phenomena (rainfall, snow coverage, temperature) to climate phenomena on a larger scale and over longer time periods. Global scale phenomena, especially the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation can have very significant ecological effects lasting for several years over huge areas of the globe. Effects on terrestrial plants and their productivity can cause changes in animal populations and the relationships between herbivores and carnivores. Upwelling of nutrients and ocean temperatures can cause variations in photosynthetic activity in marine environments, thereby affecting fish populations and other marine biota. 14.2 GLOBAL WARMING This section deals with infrared-absorbing trace gases (other than water vapor) in the atmosphere that contribute to global warming and with the influence of particles on temperature. Figure 14.1 shows global temperature trends since 1880 and illustrates a steady warming trend during recent decades. In addition to being a scientific issue, greenhouse warming of the atmosphere has also become a major policy, political, and economic issue. Carbon dioxide and other infrared-absorbing trace gases in the atmosphere contribute to global warming\u2014the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d\u2014by allowing incoming solar radiant energy to penetrate into the earth\u2019s surface while reabsorbing infrared radiation emanating from it. As shown in Figure 14.2, atmospheric levels of \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d carbon dioxide have increased at a rapid rate during recent decades and are continuing to do so. Concern over this phenomenon has intensified since about 1980. Adding to that concern is that, according to the Goddard Institute of Space Science, the eight warmest years on record have occurred since 1998 and the 14 warmest years recorded have taken place since 1990. The warmest of these was 2005. The year 2007 was tied with 1998 as the second warmest year on record. The near record warmth of 2007 is all the more remarkable because the year was at a minimum of solar irradiance and the natural El Ni\u00f1o\u2013La Ni\u00f1a cycle of the equatorial Pacific Ocean was in its cool phase. 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 \u20130.2 \u20130.4 Year FIGURE 14.1 Global temperature trend since 1880. Earlier values are less certain because of the lack of sophisticated means of measuring temperature.

Chemically and photochemically, carbon dioxide is a comparatively insignificant species because of its relatively low concentrations and low photochemical reactivity. The one signifi cant photochemical reaction that carbon dioxide undergoes, and a major source of stratospheric CO, is the photo-dissociation of CO2 by energetic solar ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere: CO2 + hn\u00c6 CO + O (14.3) The most obvious factor in increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is consumption of carbon-containing fossil fuels. In addition, release of CO2 from the biodegradation of biomass and uptake by photosynthesis are important factors determining overall CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The role of photosynthesis is illustrated in Figure 14.2, which shows a seasonal cycle in carbon dioxide levels in the northern hemisphere. Maximum values occur in April and minimum values in late September or October.", "These oscillations are due to the \u201cphotosynthetic pulse,\u201d influenced most strongly by forests in middle latitudes and located predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere. Forests have a much greater influence than other vegetation because trees carry out more photosynthesis. Furthermore, forests store enough fixed but readily oxidizable carbon in the form of wood and humus to have a marked influence on atmospheric CO2 content. Thus, during the summer months, forest trees carry out enough photosynthesis to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide content markedly. During the winter, metabolism of biota, such as bacterial decay of humus, releases a significant amount of CO2. Therefore, the current worldwide destruction of forests and conversion of forest lands into agricultural uses contributes substantially to a greater overall increase in atmospheric CO2 levels. With current trends, it is likely that global CO2 levels will double from preindustrial levels later this century, which may well raise the earth\u2019s mean surface temperature by 1.5\u20134.5\u00b0C. Such a change might have the potential to cause more massive irreversible environmental changes than any other disaster short of global nuclear war or asteroid impact. A consistent annual increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide of about 1 ppm/year was characteristic of the trends shown in Figure 14.2 until relatively recently, but now the annual increase is closer to 2 ppm. As shown in Figure 14.3, per capita carbon dioxide emissions are highest for industrialized countries and development of countries with high populations, such as China and India, can be expected to add large quantities of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in the future. CFCs, which also are greenhouse gases, were not even introduced into the atmosphere until the 1930s. Although trends in levels of these gases are well known, their effects on global temperature and climate are much less certain. The phenomenon has been the subject of much computer modeling. Most models predict global warming of at least 3.0\u00b0C and up to 5.5\u00b0C occurring over a period of just a few decades. These estimates are sobering because they correspond to the approximate temperature increase since the last ice age 18,000 years ago, which took place at a much slower pace of only about 1\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C per 1000 years. Such warming would have profound effects on rainfall, plant growth, and sea levels, which might rise as much as 0.5\u20131.5 m. Both positive and negative feedback mechanisms may be involved in determining the rates at which carbon dioxide and methane (discussed below) build up in the atmosphere. Laboratory studies indicate that increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere cause accelerated uptake of this gas by plants undergoing photosynthesis, which tends to slow the buildup of atmospheric CO2. Given adequate rainfall, plants living in a warmer climate that would result from the greenhouse effect would grow faster and take up more CO2. This could be an especially significant effect of forests, which have a high CO2-fixing ability. However, the projected rate of increase in carbon dioxide levels is so rapid that forests would lag behind in their ability to fix additional CO2. Similarly, higher atmospheric United States Canada Australia Russian Federation Germany Japan Global average China Mexico India 0 123 45 6 Metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted perperson each year CO2 concentrations will result in accelerated sorption of the gas by oceans. The amount of dissolved CO2 in the oceans is about 60 times the amount of CO2 gas in the atmosphere. However, the times for the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean are of the order of years. Because of low mixing rates, the times for the transfer of carbon dioxide from the upper approximately 100-m layer of the oceans to ocean depths is much longer, of the order of decades. Therefore, like the uptake of CO2 by forests, increased absorption by oceans will lag behind the emissions of CO2. A concern with increased levels of CO2 in the oceans is the lowering of ocean water pH that will result. Even though such an effect will be slight, of the order of one tenth to several tenths of a pH unit, it has the potential to strongly impact organisms that live in ocean water. Severe drought conditions resulting from climatic warming could cut down substantially on CO2 uptake by plants. Warmer conditions would accelerate the release of both CO2 and CH4 by microbial degradation of organic matter.", "(It is important to realize that about twice as much carbon is held in soil in dead organic matter\u2014necrocarbon\u2014potentially degradable to CO2 and CH4 as is present in the atmosphere.) Global warming might speed up the rates at which biodegradation adds these gases to the atmosphere. 14.2.1 METHANE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES Among the gases other than carbon dioxide that contribute to global warming are CFCs, fl uorocarbons, HCFC, HFCs, N2O, and, especially, methane, CH4. Now at a level of around 1.8 ppm in the atmosphere, methane is going up at a rate of almost 0.02 ppm/year. The comparatively very rapid increase in methane levels is attributed to a number of factors resulting from human activities. Among these are direct leakage of natural gas, by-product emissions from coal mining and petroleum recovery, and release from the burning of savannas and tropical forests. Biogenic sources resulting from human activities produce large amounts of atmospheric methane. These include methane from bacteria degrading organic matter such as municipal refuse in landfi lls; methane evolved from anaerobic biodegradation of organic matter in rice paddies; and methane emitted as the result of bacterial action in the digestive tracts of ruminant animals. In addition to acting as a greenhouse gas, methane has significant effects upon atmospheric chemistry. It produces atmospheric CO as an intermediate oxidation product and infl uences concentrations of atmospheric hydroxyl radicals and ozone. In the stratosphere, it produces hydrogen and H2O, but acts to remove ozone-destroying chlorine. A term called radiative forcing is used to describe the reduction in infrared radiation penetrating outward through the atmosphere per unit increase in the level of gas in the atmosphere. The radiative forcing of CH4 is about 25 times that of CO2. Increases in the concentration of methane and several other greenhouse gases have such a disproportionate effect on retention of infrared radiation because their infrared absorption spectra fill gaps in the overall spectrum of outbound radiation not covered by much more abundant carbon dioxide and water vapor. Therefore, whereas an increase in carbon dioxide concentration has a comparatively small incremental effect because the gas is already absorbing such a high fraction of infrared radiation in regions of the spectrum where it absorbs, an increase in the concentration of methane, CFC, or other greenhouse gases has comparatively a much larger effect. 14.2.2 PARTICLES AND GLOBAL WARMING Whereas the effects of carbon dioxide and other gases on temperature are relatively easy to calculate, the effects of particles are much more complicated. Atmospheric particles have both direct effects exerted by scattering and absorbing radiation and indirect effects in changing the microphysical structure, lifetimes, and quantities of clouds (see condensation nuclei in Section 9.5). Particles interact with and scatter the radiation that is of a wavelength similar to the size of the particles most strongly. Most of the incoming solar energy is at wavelengths < 4 \u03bcm and most particles are smaller than 4 \u03bcm, so the major effect of atmospheric particles is to scatter radiation from incoming solar energy, which has a cooling effect on the atmosphere. Some kinds of particles, such as those composed of black carbon and soot, absorb incoming solar radiation, thereby warming the atmosphere. Liquid water droplets composing clouds can both scatter incoming radiation and absorb outbound infrared radiation. Clouds at lower altitudes act mainly to lower atmospheric temperature by scattering lower wavelength radiation, whereas clouds at higher altitudes tend to absorb outbound infrared causing temperature increases. Aerosol particles, such as sulfate salts that act as cloud condensation nuclei upon which atmospheric water vapor condenses, tend to increase the number of particles, which are therefore more numerous. In general, this has a cooling effect. Overall, the effects of particles on global temperature are variable and not particularly well understood. Both cooling and warming effects may occur. Modeling these effects are much more challenging than modeling the effects of gaseous atmospheric constituents such as carbon dioxide. 14.2.3 THE OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL WARMING AND ASSOCIATED EFFECTS It is certain that atmospheric CO2 levels will continue to increase significantly. The degree to which this occurs depends upon future levels of CO2 production and the fraction of that production that remains in the atmosphere. Given the plausible projections of CO2 production and a reasonable estimate that half of that amount will remain in the atmosphere, projections can be made that indicate that sometime approximately during the next 100 years, the concentration of this gas will reach 600 ppm in the atmosphere.", "This is well over twice the levels estimated for preindustrial times. Much less certain are the effects that this change will have on climate. It is virtually impossible for the elaborate computer models used to estimate these effects to accurately take account of all variables, such as the degree and nature of cloud cover. Clouds both reflect incoming light radiation and absorb outgoing infrared radiation, with the former effect tending to predominate. The magnitudes of these effects depend upon the degree of cloud cover, brightness, altitude, and thickness. In the case of clouds, too, feedback phenomena occur; for example, warming induces formation of more clouds, which reflect more incoming energy. Drought is one of the most serious problems that could arise from major climatic change resulting from greenhouse warming. Typically, a three-degree warming would be accompanied by a 10% decrease in precipitation. Water shortages would be aggravated, not just from decreased rainfall, but from increased evaporation as well. Increased evaporation results in decreased runoff, thereby reducing water available for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use. Water shortages, in turn, lead to increased demand for irrigation and to the production of lower quality, higher salinity runoff water and wastewater. In the United States, such a problem would be especially intense in the Colorado River basin, which supplies much of the water used in the rapidly growing U.S. Southwest. A variety of other problems, some of them unforeseen as of now, could result from global warming. An example is the effect of warming on plant and animal pests\u2014insects, weeds, diseases, and rodents. Many of these would certainly thrive much better under warmer conditions. Interestingly, another air pollutant, acid-rain-forming sulfur dioxide (see Section 14.4), may have a counteracting effect on greenhouse gases. This is because sulfur dioxide is oxidized in the atmosphere to sulfuric acid, forming a light-reflecting haze. Furthermore, the sulfuric acid and resulting sulfates act as condensation nuclei upon which atmospheric water vapor condenses, thereby increasing the extent, density, and brightness of light-reflecting cloud cover. Sulfate aerosols are particularly effective in counteracting greenhouse warming in central Europe and the eastern United States during the summer. 14.3 GREEN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO ALLEVIATE GLOBAL WARMING Although there are still \u201cglobal-warming denyers\u201d who attempt to discredit those who have concern over global warming, the overwhelming consensus of reputable scientists is that global warming is taking place and that greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, are the main cause. The question for responsible people then becomes what to do about the problem. The possibilities can be divided into three categories: (1) minimization, (2) counteracting measures, and (3) adaptation. 14.3.1 MINIMIZATION Minimization refers to measures taken to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Minimization is tied inextricably to energy production and utilization, since most greenhouse gas emissions are from the burning of fossil fuels. Fortunately, fossil fuel may be consumed much more effi ciently utilizing existing and developing energy conservation measures. Efficient utilization of fossil energy can be accomplished without major economic disruption. A prime example would be the conversion of the U.S. private vehicle fleet to hybrid internal combustion/electric propulsion. Hybrid vehicles can be manufactured with the capability to charge their batteries from house electrical current to provide sufficient charge for approximately 30 km of travel before the internal combustion engine even has to be turned on, which would take care of as much as half of routine commuting and travel. As a green fringe benefit without additional charge, employers could provide charging stations in parking facilities so that vehicles could be recharged during the work day. Such a system could readily reduce by 50% the amount of fuel and hence the emissions of greenhouse gases of current private automotive transport systems. Conversion of the current U.S. freight transportation system from truck to electrified rail to the maximum extent possible would make a further major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Since about 1990, there has been a significant shift in the amount of freight transported by rail in the form of shipping containers and truck trailers to the point that some rail freight lines are nearing their maximum capacity. Unlike Europe, most railways in the United States are not electrifi ed, although that certainly could be done and the electricity could be generated by means that do not require burning of fossil fuels. Interstate highway rights of way can serve as routes for new rail lines in some cases. Utilization of fossil fuels for heating and air conditioning can be done much more effi ciently.", "The best fuel for home heating is natural gas (methane, CH4). This fuel emits the least amount of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide per unit heat delivered because of its relatively high content of hydrogen. Rather than burning methane in a furnace, it can be used as a fuel in a small internal combustion engine connected to a heat pump to pump heat from the outside. The exhaust gases from the engine can be cooled and the water vapor in them condensed to capture additional heat. One way to reduce the release of carbon dioxide is by using biomass as fuel or raw material for the manufacture of various products. Burning a biomass fuel does release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but an exactly equal amount of carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere in the photosynthetic process by which the biomass is made, so there is no net addition of CO2. Unless and until biomass-derived materials used in feedstocks are burned, their use represents a net loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Another potential use of green chemistry to prevent addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is through carbon sequestration in which carbon dioxide is produced, but is bound in a form such that it is not released to the atmosphere.3 This approach has the greatest potential in applications where the carbon dioxide is produced in a concentrated form. Carbon from coal can be reacted with oxygen and water to produce elemental hydrogen and carbon dioxide in a coal gasifi cation process. The net reaction for this production is the following: 2C + O2 + 2H2O \u00c6 2CO2 + 2H2 (14.4) The hydrogen generated can be used as a pollution-free fuel in fuel cells or combustion engines. The carbon dioxide can be pumped into deep ocean waters, although this has the potential to lower ocean pH slightly, which would be detrimental to marine organisms. Another option is to pump the carbon dioxide deep underground. A side benefit of the latter approach is that in some areas carbon dioxide pumped underground can be used to recover additional crude oil from depleted oil-bearing formations. Carbon dioxide can actually be converted to fuel if there is an abundant and cheap source of elemental H2, such as might be the case by electrolyzing water with excess electrical power generated by wind or by abundant geothermal energy, a process used in Iceland. The way in which this can be done is by the following reverse water gas shift reaction: CO2 + H2 \u00c6 CO + H2O (14.5) Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis can then be used to make hydrocarbons and other organic fuels and chemicals from the CO and additional elemental hydrogen. The best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from home heating is to avoid the use of fossil fuels entirely. Substantial progress has been made in solar heating systems that heat homes without using fossil fuels. Another good measure is the use of electricity for heating and air conditioning, generating the electricity from energy sources other than fossil fuels. Additional options for generating electricity without adding to the burden of greenhouse gases are discussed in Chapter 19. A green technological approach to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is to develop alternative methods of energy production. One thing that would be very beneficial is the development of more efficient photovoltaic cells. These devices have become marginally competitive for the generation of electricity, and even relatively small improvements in efficiency would enable their much wider use, replacing fossil fuel sources of electricity generation. Another device that would be extremely useful is a system for the direct photochemical dissociation of water to produce elemental hydrogen and oxygen, which could be used in fuel cells. An application of green biochemistry that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions is the development of plants with much higher effi ciencies for photosynthesis. Plants now are only about 0.5% efficient in converting light energy to chemical energy. Raising this value to only 1% would make a vast difference in the economics of producing biomass as a substitute for fossil carbon. Regardless of the technologies used to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, political and economic pressures must be applied to ensure that they are implemented and sustained. One of the most directly effective measures consists of mileage standards for vehicles. These were imposed in the United States during the earlier years of the \u201cenergy crisis\u201d but inexcusably were allowed to languish during the latter 1900s and early 2000s.", "Finally, in 2007, laws were passed requiring gradual imposition of higher mileage for new vehicles. Another useful device is that of carbon taxes on fuels that emit carbon dioxide. Very high taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel have for years resulted in the use of very efficient vehicles in Europe. Inherently more efficient diesel-powered vehicles are popular in Europe, but diesel automobiles are rare in the United States where gasoline has been relatively cheap. Another effective means for reducing carbon dioxide emissions is the cap and trade system in which concerns are allocated specific amounts of carbon that they can emit. If they emit less than the limit, they may sell the right to emit carbon to a concern that is exceeding its limit. All of these measures have the advantage of not dictating technologies to be used, leaving that aspect to the ingenuity of the private sector. One of the more contentious issues related to greenhouse gas emissions has been the Kyoto treaty and the refusal of the United States to ratify that agreement. This treaty evolved from a 1997 meeting of 160 nations in Kyoto, Japan. The agreement called for stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels during the period 2008\u20132012, which would have led to 23% less of the emissions below levels projected during the 1990s without remedial action. The United States has refused to ratify the agreement because it exempted large developing countries, especially India and China, from participating for economic reasons. Such countries produce only a small fraction of as much greenhouse gas per capita as is the case with the United States and several other industrial countries. During the early 2000s, as the economies of India and China have developed, their emissions of greenhouse gases have accelerated signifi cantly. 14.3.2 COUNTERACTING MEASURES Counteracting measures for reducing global warming consist of schemes such as the injection of light-reflecting particles into the upper atmosphere. The scale required of such measures is so great that they are probably impossible to implement in a meaningful way. One possibility is to increase (or at least not reduce) the amount of sulfur gases emitted to the atmosphere that oxidize to sulfuric acid which serves to generate condensation nuclei that produce light-reflecting clouds. Another far-out possibility would be to use high-flying tanker aircraft to separately inject hydrogen chloride and ammonia vapors into the atmosphere. Any chemistry student who has had separate beakers of hydrochloric acid and ammonia solution close together knows that HCl and NH3 react, as shown in the following equation, HCl(g) + NH3(g) \u00c6 NH4Cl(s) (14.6) to produce a dense fog of ammonium chloride particles that might serve as cloud condensation nuclei. In addition to the obvious questions regarding air pollution that this remedy raises, it might be difficult to find aircrew willing to fly Airbus A380 jumbo jet aircraft into the lower stratosphere laden with pressurized tanks of corrosive hydrogen chloride and ammonia. A possibly significant counteracting measure is modification of the earth\u2019s surface in a manner so as to refl ect light. This can potentially be done with appropriate kinds of vegetation in the form of forests and grasslands and by agricultural practices that minimize exposure of light-absorbing freshly cultivated soil. Again, the scale required to make any significant difference would be huge. Another small effect might be obtained by designing surfaces (roofs and parking lot surfaces) of anthrospheric structures to maximize reflection of solar radiation. Such a measure would favor reflective aluminum roofs over dark roofing and light-colored concrete over black asphalt for parking lot surfaces. 14.3.3 ADAPTATION Since global warming will in fact occur and neither minimization nor counteracting measures will be sufficient to stop it, adaptation to climate warming will be required. Other than increases in global temperature, there are many effects of global warming suggesting a variety of adaptations. It may be anticipated that adaptation to global warming will be one of the most signifi cant activities of green science and technology in the future. Water shortages and drought will constitute perhaps the most troublesome aspects of climate warming. Water, already in short supply in many parts of the world, will become scarcer. It will be necessary to implement more efficient irrigation practices and to grow crops that require less irrigation. One approach with significant promise is to grow crops on arid coastal lands irrigated with seawater.", "Plants that can grow in seawater are called halophytes and can produce 1\u20132 kg of dry biomass per square meter of field area, which is about the same production as conventional crops such as alfalfa. Some of the most productive plants that grow in seawater have relatively unattractive names including glasswort, sea blite, saltbush, and salt grass. Though not producing grain, some of these plants produce abundant forage that can be eaten by animals. One small problem is that because of the high salt content of the forage, animals that consume it must drink signifi cantly greater amounts of fresh water. One saltwater plant that has does produce abundant seeds is Salicornia bigelovii that rapidly colonizes new mud flats. With a salt content of <3%, the seeds are 35% protein and 30% highly polyunsaturated oil, similar to safflower oil in composition. The seeds contain bitter saponins, which somewhat limit the amount of seed or meal left after extracting oil that can be fed to animals. Especially for oil production, production of oil-producing algae in saltwater ponds, such as those filled with brackish groundwater, is a promising approach. One of the greatest adverse effects of global warming results from the effects of high temperatures on people, particularly the vulnerable elderly. This was illustrated tragically in Europe in August 2003. The highest temperatures ever recorded in the United Kingdom to that date occurred on August 10, 2003, with temperatures of 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) at London\u2019s Heathrow airport and 38.1\u00b0C at Gravesend, Kent. Over 1000 people died from the heat wave in the United Kingdom. However, the greatest toll was in France where about 15,000 people, mostly elderly, died from the heat in August 2003. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that France is not used to extreme heat and the custom is for many people, including government ministers and physicians who would have been involved in remedial measures, to take August off for vacation. Funeral homes were overwhelmed and refrigerated warehouses had to be used to store bodies until they could be identifi ed and buried. A major concern was that the nuclear reactors that provide much of France\u2019s electrical power could not be adequately cooled and in some cases their cooling had to be augmented by spraying with hoses. Other countries were adversely affected. Portugal lost 10% of its forests in forest fires. On the positive side, the hot dry summer yielded grapes with very high sugar contents resulting in one of the best years ever for French wines. In the hot, dry summer of 2007, much of the forests in Greece were consumed by fi re. As global warming occurs, a major adaptation will need to be the installation of air conditioning and other cooling measures in regions of the world where air conditioning in homes and commercial buildings has been uncommon. This is particularly true in Europe where periods of hot weather will become more common, though of shorter duration than in much of the United States, for example. In addition to the installation of air conditioning, provision will need to be made to provide sustainable power for it. This could include a need for fuel turbine peaking facilities for electrical power generation and for greater reserves of cooling water for nuclear power reactors. 14.4 ACID RAIN Precipitation made acidic by the presence of acids stronger than CO2(aq) is commonly called acid rain; the term applies to all kinds of acidic aqueous precipitation, including fog, dew, snow, and sleet.4 In a more general sense, acid deposition refers to the deposition on the earth\u2019s surface of aqueous acids, acid gases (such as SO2), and acidic salts (such as NH4HSO4). According to this defi nition, deposition in solution form is acid precipitation, and deposition of dry gases and compounds is dry deposition. Although carbon dioxide is present at higher levels in the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide, SO2, contributes more to the acidity of precipitation for two reasons. The first of these is that sulfur dioxide is significantly more soluble in water than is carbon dioxide, as indicated by its Henry\u2019s law constant (Section 5.3) of 1.2 mol/L/atm compared to a value of 3.38 \u00a5 10-2 mol/L/atm for CO2. Secondly, the value of Ka1 for SO2(aq), SO (aq) + HO H++ HSO-(14.7) 22 3 [H+][HSO3 -] -2 K= = 1.7 \u00a5 10 (14.8) a1 [SO2] is more than four orders of magnitude higher than the value of 4.45 \u00a5 10-7 for CO2.", "Although acid rain can originate from the direct emission of strong acids, such as HCl gas or sulfuric acid mist, most of it is a secondary air pollutant produced by the atmospheric oxidation of acid-forming gases such as the following, both shown as overall reactions consisting of several steps: + 2 SO + 1O + H O\u00c6 {2H + SO }(aq) (14.9) 2222 4 2NO2 + 21 O2 + H2O \u00c6 2{H++ NO3 -}(aq) (14.10) Chemical reactions such as these play a dominant role in determining the nature, transport, and fate of acid precipitation. As the result of such reactions the chemical properties (acidity, ability to react with other substances) and physical properties (volatility, solubility) of acidic atmospheric pollutants are altered drastically. For example, even the small fraction of NO that does dissolve in water does not react significantly. However, its ultimate oxidation product, HNO3, though volatile, is highly water-soluble, strongly acidic, and very reactive with other materials. Therefore, it tends to be removed readily from the atmosphere and to do a great deal of harm to plants, corrodible materials, and other things that it contacts. Although emissions from industrial operations and fossil fuel combustion are the major sources of acid-forming gases, acid rain has also been encountered in areas far from such sources. This is due in part to the fact that acid-forming gases are oxidized to acidic constituents and deposited over several days, during which time the air mass containing the gas may have moved as much as several thousand kilometers. It is likely that the burning of biomass, such as is employed in \u201cslash-andburn\u201d agriculture, evolves the gases that lead to acid formation in more remote areas. In arid regions, dry acid gases or acids sorbed to particles may be deposited with effects similar to those of acid rain deposition. Acid rain spreads out over areas of several hundred to several thousand kilometers. This classifies it as a regional air pollution problem compared to a local air pollution problem for smog and a global one for ozone-destroying CFCs and greenhouse gases. Other examples of regional air pollution problems are those caused by soot, smoke, and fly ash from combustion sources and fi res (forest fires). Nuclear fallout from weapons testing or from reactor fires (of which, fortunately, there has been only one major one to date\u2014the one at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union) may also be regarded as a regional phenomenon. Acid precipitation shows a strong geographic dependence, as illustrated in Figure 14.4, representing the pH of precipitation in the continental United States. The preponderance of acidic rainfall in the northeastern United States, which also affects southeastern Canada, is obvious. Analyses of the movements of air masses have shown a correlation between acid precipitation and prior movement of an air mass over major sources of anthropogenic sulfur and nitrogen oxides emissions. This is particularly obvious in southern Scandinavia, which receives a heavy burden of air pollution from densely populated, heavily industrialized areas in Europe. Acid rain has been observed for well over a century, with many of the older observations from Great Britain. The first manifestations of this phenomenon were elevated levels of SO42- in precipitation collected in industrialized areas. More modern evidence was obtained from analyses of precipitation in Sweden in the 1950s, and of U.S. precipitation a decade or so later. A vast research effort on acid rain was conducted in North America by the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, which resulted from the U.S. Acid Precipitation Act of 1980 and data are still being collected as an outgrowth of this program. Table 14.1 shows typical major cations and anions in pH-4.25 precipitation. Although actual values encountered vary greatly with time and location of collection, this table does show some major features of ionic solutes in precipitation. From the predominance of sulfate anion, it is apparent that sulfuric acid is the major contributor to acid precipitation. Nitric acid makes a smaller but growing contribution to the acid present. Hydrochloric acid ranks third. Ample evidence exists of the damaging effects of acid rain. The major effects are the following: \u2022 Direct phytotoxicity to plants from excessive acid concentrations. (Evidence of direct or indirect phytoxicity of acid rain is provided by the declining health of Eastern United States and Scandinavian forests and especially by damage to Germany\u2019s Black Forest.) \u2022 Phytotoxicity from acid-forming gases, particularly SO2 and NO2, which accompany acid rain. \u2022 Indirect phytotoxicity.", "One of the most harmful effects of acidic precipitation is the dissolution of Al3+ from soil at levels that are harmful to plants. \u2022 Destruction of sensitive forests. \u2022 Respiratory effects on humans and other animals. \u2022 Acidification of lake water with toxic effects to Lake Flora and Fauna, especially fi sh fi ngerlings. \u2022 Corrosion of exposed structures, electrical relays, equipment, and ornamental materials. Because of the effect of hydrogen ion: 2H++ CaCO3(s) \u00c6 Ca2++ CO2(g) + H2O Limestone, CaCO3, is especially susceptible to damage from acid rain. \u2022 Associated effects, such as reduction of visibility by sulfate aerosols and the infl uence of sulfate aerosols on physical and optical properties of clouds. (As mentioned in Section 14.2, intensification of cloud cover and changes in the optical properties of cloud TABLE 14.1 Typical Values of Ion Concentrations in Acidic Precipitation Cations Anions Concentration Concentration Ion Equivalents/L \u00a5 106 Ion Equivalents/L \u00a5 106 H+ 56 SO42-51 NH4 + 10 NO3 -20 Ca2+ 7 Cl-12 Na+ 5 Total 83 Mg2+ 3 K+ 2 Total 83 droplets\u2014specifically, increased reflectance of light\u2014resulting from acid sulfate in the atmosphere may even have a mitigating effect on greenhouse warming of the atmosphere.) A significant association exists between acidic sulfate in the atmosphere and haziness. Soil sensitivity to acid precipitation can be estimated from CEC (see Chapter 5). Soil is generally insensitive if free carbonates are present or if it is flooded frequently. Soils with a CEC above 15.4 meq/100 g (on the basis of the dry mass of soil) are also insensitive because the soil acts as a buffer by taking up H+ ion. Soils with cation exchange capacities between 6.2 meq/100 g and 15.4 meq/100 g are slightly sensitive. Soils with cation exchange capacities below 6.2 meq/100 g normally are sensitive if free carbonates are absent and the soil is not frequently fl ooded. Forms of precipitation other than rainfall may contain excess acidity. Acidic fog can be especially damaging because it is very penetrating. In early December 1982, Los Angeles experienced a severe, 2-day episode of acid fog. This fog consisted of a heavy concentration of acidic mist particles at ground level which reduced visibility and were very irritating to breathe. The pH of the water in these particles was 1.7, much lower than ever before recorded for acid precipitation. Another source of precipitation heavy in the ammonium, sulfate, and nitrate ions associated with atmospheric acid is acid rime. Rime is frozen cloudwater which may condense on snowflakes or exposed surfaces. Rime constitutes up to 60% of the snowpack in some mountainous areas, and the deposition of acidic constituents with rime may be a significant vector for the transfer of acidic atmospheric constituents to the Earth\u2019s surface in some cases. 14.5 STRATOSPHERIC OZONE DESTRUCTION Recall from Section 9.9 that stratospheric ozone, O3, serves as a shield to absorb harmful ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere, protecting living beings on Earth from the effects of excessive amounts of such radiation. The two reactions by which stratospheric ozone is produced are O2 + hn\u00c6 O + O (l < 242.4 nm) (14.11) O + O2 + M \u00c6 O3 + M (energy-absorbing N2 or O2) (14.12) and it is destroyed by photodissociation O3 + hn\u00c6 O2 + O (l < 325 nm) (14.13) and a series of reactions from which the net result is the following: O + O3 \u00c6 2O2 (14.14) The concentration of ozone in the stratosphere is a steady-state concentration resulting from the balance of ozone production and destruction by the above processes. The region of the stratosphere in which signifi cant amounts of ozone occur is called the ozone layer. The boundaries of the ozone layer vary with altitude, but it is generally regarded as extending from 15 to 35 km. At higher altitudes above 35 km, the level of atmospheric gases is very low, most of the oxygen is dissociated to O atoms, and there is very little molecular O2 with which the O atoms can combine to produce O3. At lower altitudes below about 15 km, most of the short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation capable of producing O atoms required for ozone production has been filtered from sunlight by the atmosphere above. A total of about 350,000 metric tons of ozone are formed and destroyed daily in the ozone layer. Ozone never makes up more than a small fraction of the gases in the ozone layer.", "In fact, if the entire atmosphere\u2019s ozone were averaged in a uniform layer at sea level at a temperature of 25\u00b0C and 1 atm pressure, it would be only 3 mm thick! This would represent an ozone layer of 0.3 atm-cm. The total amount of ozone in the atmosphere above a particular location is measured in Dobson units (DU). The DU is 0.001 atm-cm so the average ozone layer is about 300 DU. 14.5.1 SHIELDING EFFECT OF THE OZONE LAYER Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation very strongly in the region 220\u2013330 nm. Therefore, it is effective in filtering out dangerous UV-B radiation, 290 nm <l <320 nm. (UV-A radiation, 320\u2013400 nm, is relatively less harmful and UV-C radiation, <290 nm does not penetrate into the troposphere.) If UV-B were not absorbed by ozone, severe damage would result to exposed forms of life on Earth. Absorption of electromagnetic radiation by ozone converts the radiation\u2019s energy to heat and is responsible for the temperature maximum encountered at the boundary between the stratosphere and the mesosphere at an altitude of approximately 50 km. The reason that the temperature maximum occurs at a higher altitude than that of the maximum ozone concentration arises from the fact that ozone is such an effective absorber of ultraviolet light, so that most of this radiation is absorbed in the upper stratosphere where it generates heat and only a small fraction reaches the lower altitudes, which remain relatively cool. Increased intensities of ground-level ultraviolet radiation caused by stratospheric ozone destruction would have some significant adverse consequences. One major effect would be on plants, including crops used for food. The destruction of microscopic plants that are the basis of the ocean\u2019s food chain (phytoplankton) could severely reduce the productivity of the world\u2019s seas. Human exposure would result in an increased incidence of cataracts. The effect of most concern to humans is the elevated occurrence of skin cancer in individuals exposed to ultraviolet radiation. This is because of photochemical reactions in cellular DNA (Chapter 22) that has absorbed UV-B radiation such that the genetic code is improperly translated during cell division leading to uncontrolled cell division and skin cancer. People with light complexions lack protective melanin, which absorbs UV-B radiation, and are especially susceptible to its effects. The most common type of skin cancer resulting from ultraviolet exposure is squamous cell carcinoma, which forms lesions that are readily removed and has little tendency to spread (metastasize). Readily metastasized malignant melanoma caused by absorption of UV-B radiation is often fatal. Fortunately, this form of skin cancer is relatively uncommon. 14.5.2 OZONE LAYER DESTRUCTION One of the major threats to the environment is destruction of stratospheric ozone by substances released to the atmosphere that catalyze conversion of O3 back to O2. The major culprit in ozone depletion consists of CFC compounds, commonly known as \u201cFreons.\u201d In 1974 it was convincingly suggested by Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland that chlorofluoromethanes could catalyze the destruction of stratospheric ozone. Subsequent data on ozone levels in the stratosphere and on increased ultraviolet radiation at the earth\u2019s surface showed that the threat to stratospheric ozone posed by CFCs is real. Along with atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen, these investigators received a richly deserved Nobel Prize in 1995 for this classic work. Developed in the 1930s as substitutes for hazardous sulfur dioxide and ammonia refrigerant fluids, CFCs were used and released to a very large extent over several decades. In addition to their major use as refrigerant fluids, other applications have included solvents, aerosol propellants, and blowing agents in the fabrication of foam plastics. The same extreme chemical stability that makes CFCs nontoxic enables them to persist for years in the atmosphere and to enter the stratosphere. In the stratosphere, as discussed in Section 12.7, the photochemical dissociation of CFCs by intense ultraviolet radiation, CF2Cl2 + hn\u00c6 Cl\u2211+ CClF2 \u2211 (14.15) yields chlorine atoms, each of which can go through chain reactions involving first the reaction of atomic chlorine with ozone: Cl\u2211+ O3 \u00c6 ClO \u2211+ O2 (14.16) In the most common sequence of reactions involved with stratospheric ozone destruction, the ClO\u2211 radicals react to form a dimer, which then reacts to regenerate Cl atoms, which in turn react with ozone to regenerate ClO\u2211 in the following cyclical reaction sequence (where M is an energy-absorbing third body, such as an N2 molecule): ClO\u2211+ ClO\u2211\u00c6 ClOOCl (14.17) ClOOCl + hn\u00c6 ClOO\u2211+ Cl\u2211 (14.18) ClOO\u2211+ M \u00c6 Cl\u2211+ O2 + M (14.19) 2Cl\u2211+", "2O3 \u00c6 2ClO\u2211+ 2O2 (14.20) 2O3 \u00c6 3O2 (net reaction) (14.21) The net effect of these reactions is catalysis of the destruction of several thousand molecules of O3 for each Cl atom produced. Because of their widespread use and persistency, the two CFCs of most concern in ozone destruction are CFC-11 and CFC-12, CFCl3, and CF2Cl2, respectively. Even in the intense ultraviolet radiation of the stratosphere, the most persistent CFCs have lifetimes of the order of 100 years. The most prominent instance of ozone layer destruction is the so-called \u201cAntarctic ozone hole\u201d that was first noted in 1985 by the British Antarctic Survey and observed with great alarm in subsequent years. (Re-examination of earlier data showed that the ozone hole had been ongoing for several years prior to 1985.) This phenomenon is manifested by the appearance of severely depleted stratospheric ozone (up to 50%) over the polar region during the Antarctic\u2019s late winter and early spring months of September and October. The ozone hole is defined by a boundary of 220 DU chosen because prior to 1979, no ozone measurements below 220 DU were observed. Figure 14.5 shows the size and thickness of the Antarctic ozone hole in recent years. In the Southern Hemisphere spring of 2008, the hole in the stratospheric ozone layer reached the fi fth largest on record, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).5 The 2008 ozone hole reached its maximum size on September 12, covering an area of 27.2 million km2 and extending 6.5 km deep, according to NOAA. The record ozone hole was measured in 2006, peaking at a size of 29.5 km2 million sq miles. Although the production of CFCs responsible for the Antarctic ozone hole has been officially phased out, they persist for decades in the atmosphere and may take several years to rise high in the atmosphere where their effects are felt. NOAA scientists estimate that full recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole may not occur until after 2050. The reasons why the Antarctic ozone hole occurs is due to the formation of a unique cloud in the lower stratosphere when temperatures drop well below -70\u00b0C for several months in the winter (a similar thing happens in the Arctic, but to a much lesser extent). In the absence of sunlight in the winter, this cloud persists as a rapidly whirling vortex. It is composed largely of ice crystals and supercooled ternary mixtures of HNO3, HNO3\u00b73H2O, H2SO4, and H2O. Also present is some HCl generated when CFCs undergo photochemical dissociation and abstract H from stratospheric CH4. This HCl and chlorine nitrate produced by the following reaction are unreactive in ozone destruction: ClO + NO2 \u00c6 ClONO2 (14.22) During the darkness of the Antarctic winter, Cl sequestered in the stratospheric cloud cover above Antarctica undergoes sequences of reactions that produce accumulations of photochemically reactive Cl2 and HOCl.

The lower plot illustrates the thickness of the ozone layer in DU showing a decrease until the mid-1990s and generally level values since then. Data from NASA. of ultraviolet solar radiation from the sun required to produce Cl\u2211 atoms. Several important chemical processes are initiated on the surface of the stratospheric cloud particles which may be covered with a thin liquid aqueous layer. Chlorine nitrate may release HOCl: ClONO2 + H2O \u00c6 HOCl + HNO3 (14.23) Chlorine nitrate reacts in several steps with gaseous HCl to produce elemental chlorine and leads to an accumulation of photochemically reactive Cl2: ClONO2 + HCl \u00c6 Cl2 + HNO3 (14.24) Some Cl2 reacts with water to produce HOCl, Cl2 + H2O \u00c6 HOCl + H++ Cl- (14.25) And some chloride from HCl reacts with HOCl to generate Cl2: Cl-+ HOCl \u00c6 Cl2 + OH- (14.26)", "As sunlight returns to the lower stratosphere above Antarctica in spring, the Cl2 and the HOCl produced by the reactions above undergo photodissociation, Cl2 + hn\u00c6 2Cl\u2211 (14.27) HOCl + hn\u00c6 HO\u2211+ Cl\u2211 (14.28) to produce Cl atoms that can undergo the sequence of chain reactions (Reactions 14.16 through 14.20)leading to the net reaction for ozone destruction (Reaction 14.21). Therefore, over the winter months, photoreactive Cl2 and HOCl accumulate in the Antarctic stratospheric region in the absence of sunlight and then undergo a burst of photochemical activity when spring arrives, leading to stratospheric ozone destruction and the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole. 14.5.3 GREEN CHEMISTRY SOLUTIONS TO STRATOSPHERIC OZONE DEPLETION As discussed in Section 12.7, the U.S. EPA regulations, imposed in accordance with the 1986 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, curtailed the production of CFCs and halocarbons in the United States, starting in 1989. One of the most active areas of endeavor in green chemistry has been to find environmentally acceptable substitutes for ozone-depleting CFCs. One of the easiest measures for CFC replacement was the application of carbon dioxide in producing foams for polystyrene plastic foams used in packing, food containers, and insulation. Global production of polystyrene foam amounts to about 5 million metric tons each year. The volume (and waste disposal problems) with this material can be appreciated considering that the foam is about 95% gas used as a blowing agent in making it. The Dow Chemical Company won the 1996 Presidential Green Challenge Award for their development of a process to use carbon dioxide as a complete replacement for CFCs in making polystyrene foam. (The incremental addition of greenhouse-gas carbon dioxide from this application is miniscule and CO2 by-product of processes such as fermentation to produce ethanol can be used for foam blowing.) As noted in Chapter 12, the substitutes for CFCs have been hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrogen-containing fluorocarbons (HFCs), and some volatile hydrocarbon formulations. The presence of hydrogen in an H\u2013C bond in these compounds provides a point of attack for hydroxyl radical to initiate compound decomposition in the troposphere. The fi rst class of substitutes to be widely used was the HCFCs, which generally have only about 5% of the ozone-depleting potential of CFCs. One of the most popular of these has been HCFC-22, chemical formula CHClF2, that was widely used in air conditioners, refrigerators, and as a foam blowing agent. Other popular HCFCs have included HCFC-142b (CH3CClF2, used as a refrigerant, often in a blend with HCFC-22), CHCl2CF3 (HCFC-123), CF3CHClF (HCFC-124), and CH3CCl2F (HCFC-141b). Although the HCFCs deplete stratospheric ozone much less than the CFCs, they still do so and are being phased out of general use. Ozone depletion potentials of CFC substitutes have been compiled that depend upon several factors including numbers of H\u2013C bonds susceptible to attack and rate of reaction with HO\u2211 radical. Ozone depletion potentials are expressed relative to a value of 1.0 for CFC-11, a non-hydrogen-containing CFC with a formula of CFCl3, which is particularly destructive to ozone because of its long atmospheric lifetime and high Cl content. Low ozone depletion potential correlates with short tropospheric lifetime, which means that the compound is destroyed in the troposphere before migrating to the stratosphere. The ozone-depletion potentials of some HCFC compounds that have been used as substitutes for CFCs are HCFC-22, 0.030; HCFC-123, 0.013; HCFC-141b, 0.10; HCFC-124, 0.035; and HCFC-142b, 0.038. A kind of CFC substitute that does not harm stratospheric ozone consists of HFCs. These have included CH2FCF3 (HFC-134a, 1,1,1,2-tetrafl uoroethane, which became the standard substitute for CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners and refrigeration equipment) and CH2F2 (HFC-152a, a fl ammable material). These compounds not only contain the more readily broken H\u2013C bonds, they are chlorine-free and cannot generate the Cl atoms that attack stratospheric ozone. HFCs are favored as CFC replacements in North America. There is some concern over their global warming potential and, particularly in the case of popular HFC-134a, their potential to generate toxic fl uoroacetic acid degradation products. Arguably the most environmentally benign CFC substitutes are low-molecular-mass hydrocarbons including cyclopentane and isobutane. First used as refrigerants in 1867 and favored along with ammonia for this purpose until CFCs were developed in the 1930s, volatile hydrocarbons are now banned from use as home refrigerants in the United States because of their flammability, but are favored in Europe and other parts of the world.", "14.6 ATMOSPHERIC BROWN CLOUDS In Chapter 13, photochemical smog was discussed largely as a regional problem affecting large urban areas such as the one in the Los Angeles Basin. Smog is actually part of a larger problem that the United Nations Environment Programme defined in November 2008 as the Atmospheric Brown Cloud.6 Generated by sources including automobiles, coal-fired power plants, slash-and burn agriculture, and cooking over fires fueled by wood or dung, the brown cloud consists of a layer of polluted air approximately 3 km thick that extends from the Arabian Peninsula across China and the western Pacific Ocean, at times even touching on the west coast of the United States Laden with soot and other particles, noxious air pollutants including ozone and greenhouse gases, the cloud is now recognized to have many adverse effects including the darkening of megacities such as New Delhi and Beijing, increased melting of Himalayan glaciers, decreased agricultural productivity, and greater extremes in weather events. Increased melting of the Hindu Kush\u2013Himalayan\u2013Tibetan glaciers is a particular concern because they provide head-waters for most Asian rivers that provide water to hundreds of millions of people as well as irrigation water essential to the production of rice and other crops. Because of its content of sunlight-refl ecting sulfates and other particles, the cloud may be masking greenhouse warming of affected areas by 20\u201380%. A major cause of the brown cloud phenomenon is inefficient, unsustainable burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, but also including biomass. Deforestation, including burning of forest residues, also contributes. The brown cloud has been studied most intensively in Asia because the region contains about half of the world\u2019s population, has undergone very rapid economic growth in recent years, and has a variable climate including annual monsoons. However, similar brown clouds occur in parts of Europe, North America, southern Africa, and the Amazon Basin. The severities of brown cloud events that occur in the North American eastern seaboard and Europe are reduced by winter precipitation, which wash pollutants out of the sky. The United Nations report identifies the following several regional brown cloud hotspots of most crucial concern: \u2022 East Asia, a region covering eastern China \u2022 The southeast Asian countries of Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam \u2022 The Indo-Gangetic plains extending from eastern Pakistan across India to Bangladesh and Myanmar \u2022 The southeast Asian region of Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam \u2022 The sub-Saharan region of Africa extending into Angola, Zambia, and Zimbabwe \u2022 The South American Amazon Basin region \u2022 At least 13 megacities in Asia and Africa: Bangkok, Beijing, Cairo, Dhaka, Karachi, Kolkata, Lagos, Mumbai, New Delhi, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Tehran The particles in brown clouds have two major effects. Sulfates, including sulfuric acid droplets and ammonium sulfates, largely from burning coal, scatter sunlight and reflect it back into space. Black soot and carbon particles from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels absorb incoming sunlight. These phenomena have a light-dimming effect, particularly in urban areas. India as a whole has noted light dimming of about 2% per decade since 1960 and China has experienced dimming of 3\u20134% since the 1950s; in both countries the effect has become more pronounced since 1980. Dimming of 10\u201325% has been noted in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Karachi, and New Delhi. Brown cloud particles may also contribute to increased cloud cover from condensation of atmospheric water vapor to small cloud droplets, further increasing the dimming effect. The dimming effects of brown clouds result in cooling of affected areas. Some climatologists believe that this masks the greenhouse gas warming of affected areas by 20\u201380%. This leads to the interesting conclusion that abrupt elimination of brown cloud pollution (a very unlikely event) could trigger warming of affected areas by about 2\u00b0C, which would adversely affect climate. Overall, temperature patterns in India, China, and surrounding areas have exhibited complex behavior during recent decades with warming in some places and cooling in others, which may well be the result of the influence of the brown clouds. A particular concern regarding the potential effects of the brown cloud has to do with its infl uence on Asian monsoons, which are crucial to food production in the region. Several trends in Asian monsoons and rainfall have been observed in recent years which may be influenced by the brown cloud phenomenon. Since the 1950s, monsoon precipitation over India and southeast Asia has decreased 5\u20137% and the Indian summer monsoon has experienced fewer rainy days.", "Extreme rain events of more than 10 cm have increased in both China and India and very heavy rainfalls of more than 15 cm per day have nearly doubled. A particular concern has been the potential influence of the brown cloud on glaciers. The most important of these in Asia has been the Hindu Kush\u2013Himalayan\u2013Tibetan glaciers that compose the head-waters of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, Mekong, and Yangtze rivers. With a population of more than 400 million people, India\u2019s Ganges basin contains 40% of India\u2019s irrigated farmland, so water input to the Ganges river from glacial sources is crucially important. About 70% of Ganges river water comes from the Gangotri glacier. China\u2019s 47,000 glaciers have decreased by about 5% and 3000 km2 since 1980. Deposition of black carbon on glacier surfaces has increased light absorption and accelerated melting. The brown cloud is likely having significant effects on agriculture and food production including the key food crops of rice, wheat, corn, and soybeans. Ground-level ozone above 40 parts per billion is believed to reduce crop production. Such levels are reached in parts of Asia, peaking during February to June and again between September and November, reducing yields of wheat, rice, and legumes. Other adverse brown cloud effects on crop production come from deposition of acidic and toxic particles on plants and reduced photosynthesis due to dimming of sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. Several important health effects could be caused by brown clouds especially by particles smaller than 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5 discussed in Section 10.9). Toxic substances including carcinogens are inhaled with air in brown clouds. Brown cloud air pollutants are linked to respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease. Hundreds of thousands of premature deaths in countries affected by the brown cloud may be due to inhalation of smoke particles from indoor cooking fires fueled by wood, coal, and even dried animal dung. 14.6.1 YELLOW DUST Closely tied to the brown cloud, yellow dust consists of huge masses of windblown dust and sand that afflict parts of the world each year. The most common yellow dust phenomenon begins with winds over deserts in Mongolia and China spreading east across China and affecting the Korean peninsula, Japan, and even Russia\u2019s Pacific port of Vladivostok. In its movement across China\u2019s industrial areas, the yellow dust mixes with the brown cloud of air pollutants to produce a highly noxious brew of very unpleasant air. Yellow dust is most prevalent in China from March until May. Deforestation and desertification, probably aggravated by global warming are contributing to the yellow dust phenomenon. The economic damage from yellow dust amounts to millions of dollars each year. Manufacturers of high-tech goods that require clean environments are especially afflicted. The human costs are quite high with increased occurrence of asthma, lung disease, and immune diseases. In contrast to the damaging dust storms that afflict southeast Asia, dust storms that originate in Africa\u2019s Sahara desert are thought to be important in sustaining life in some other parts of the world. About half of the Saharan dust comes from a small region called the Bodele Depression where a gap between the Tibesti and Ennedi mountains forms a natural wind tunnel through which winds blow across the Bodele Depression picking up an average of 700,000 metric tons of dust in a day. Easterly trade winds blow this dust across the Atlantic Ocean, depositing about 40 million tons of dust each year onto the Amazon region of South America. This dust is a significant source of nutrients for the Amazon forests helping to counteract the strong leaching effect of heavy rainfall in these regions. Much of the Saharan dust is deposited in the Atlantic Ocean as it is carried toward South America where it fertilizes the phytoplankton organisms that form the base of the oceanic food chain. Ocean water tends to be iron-deficient and it is believed that the Saharan dust replenishes nutrient iron in regions of the Atlantic where it is deposited. 14.7 ATMOSPHERIC DAMAGE BY PHOTOCHEMICAL SMOG Photochemical smog, an air pollution phenomenon discussed in Chapter 13, is a signifi cant contributor to the brown cloud discussed above. It occurs in urban areas where the combination of pollution-forming emissions and appropriate atmospheric conditions are right for its formation. In order for high levels of smog to form, relatively stagnant air must be subjected to sunlight under low humidity conditions in the presence of pollutant nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons.", "The automobile is a major source of these pollutants, but hydrocarbons may come from biogenic sources, of which a-pinene and isoprene from trees are the most abundant (see Section 12.2). Under smog-forming conditions, the urban atmosphere acts as a huge chemical reactor in which hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and oxygen undergo reactions driven by sunlight to produce ozone, organic oxidants, aldehydes, organic particles, nitrates, sulfates, and other noxious products. Smog does pose significant hazards to living things and materials in local urban areas in which millions of people are exposed and the oxidants generated by it have detrimental effects on crop production. Ironically, ozone, which serves an essential protective function in the stratosphere, is the major culprit in tropospheric smog. In fact, surface ozone levels are used as a measure of smog. Ozone\u2019s phytotoxicity raises particular concern with respect to trees and crops. Ozone is the smog constituent responsible for most of the respiratory system distress and eye irritation, characteristic of human exposure to smog. Breathing is impaired at ozone levels approaching only about 0.1 ppm. Ozone is the \u201ccriterion\u201d air pollutant that has been most resistant to control measures. Because of its strongly oxidizing nature, ozone attacks unsaturated bonds in fatty acid constituents of cell membranes. Other oxidants, such as PAN (Section 13.4), also contribute to the toxicity of smog, as do aldehydes produced as reactive intermediates in smog formation. Smog is a secondary air pollutant that forms some time after and some distance from the injection into the atmosphere of the primary pollutant nitrogen oxides and reactive hydrocarbons required for its formation. The U.S. EPA\u2019s Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach uses the concept of an air parcel to model smog formation. This model utilizes the concept of a \u201cparcel\u201d of relatively unpolluted air moving across an urban area in which it becomes contaminated with smog-forming gases. When the upper boundary of this parcel is restricted to about 1000 m by a temperature inversion and subjected to sunlight, the primary pollutants react to form smog in a system that involves photochemical reaction processes, transport, mixing, and dilution. As the hydrocarbons are consumed by photochemical oxidation processes in the air, and as nitrogen oxides are removed as nitrates and nitric acid (especially at nighttime), ozone levels reach a peak concentration at a time and place that may be some distance removed from the source of pollutants. The most visible manifestation of smog is the urban aerosol, which greatly reduces visibility in smoggy urban atmospheres and contributes to the brown cloud phenomenon. Many of the particles composing this aerosol are condensation aerosols made from gases by chemical processes (see Chapter 10) and are therefore quite small, usually less than 2 \u03bcm. Particles of such a size are especially harmful because they scatter light most efficiently and are the most respirable. Aerosol particles formed from smog often contain toxic constituents, such as respiratory tract irritants and mutagens. The urban aerosol also contains particle constituents that originate from processes other than smog formation. Oxidation of pollutant sulfur dioxide by the strongly oxidizing conditions of photochemical smog, SO + 1O + HO \u00c6 H SO (overall process) (14.29) 2222 24 produces sulfuric acid and sulfate particles. Nitric acid and nitrates are produced at night when sunlight is absent, a process that involves intermediate NO3 radical: O3 + NO2 \u00c6 O2 + NO3 (14.30) NO3 + NO2 + M (energy-absorbing third body) \u00c6 N2O5 + M (14.31) N2O5 + H2O \u00c6 2HNO3 (14.32) HNO3 + NH3 \u00c6 NH4NO3 (14.33) As indicated by the last reaction above, ammonium salts are common constituents of urban aerosol particles; they tend to be particularly corrosive. Metals, which may contribute to the toxicity of urban aerosol particles and which may catalyze reactions on their surfaces, occur in the particles. Water is always present, even in low humidity atmospheres, and is usually present in urban aerosol particles. Carbon and PAHs from partial combustion and diesel engine emissions are usually abundant constituents; elemental carbon is usually the particulate constituent most responsible for absorbing light in the urban aerosol. If the air parcel originates over the ocean, it contains sea salt particles consisting largely of NaCl, from which some of the chloride may be lost as volatile HCl by the action of less volatile strong acids produced by smog. This phenomenon is responsible for Na2SO4 and NaNO3 found in the urban aerosol.", "PAHs (see Section 10.8), are among the urban aerosol particle constituents of most concern, particularly because metabolites of some of these compounds (see the 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide of benzo(a)pyrene in Figure 23.3) are carcinogenic. PAHs include unsubstituted compounds as well as those with alkyl, oxygen, or nitrogen substituents, or O or N hetero atoms: Benzo(j)fluoranthene 3-Nitroperylene (mutagenic) These kinds of compounds are emitted by internal combustion engine exhausts and occur in both the gas and particulate phases. Numerous mechanisms exist for their destruction and chemical alteration, particularly reaction with oxidant species\u2014HO\u2211, O3, NO2, N2O5, and HNO3. Direct photolysis is also possible. PAH compounds in the vapor phase are destroyed relatively rapidly by these means, whereas PAHs sorbed to particles are much more resistant to reaction. Another kind of urban aerosol particulate matter of considerable concern is acid fog, which may have pH values below 2 due to the presence of H2SO4 or HNO3. Acid fog formation covers a wide range of atmospheric chemical and physical phenomena. The gas-phase oxidation of SO2 and NO produces strong acids, which form very small aerosol particles. These, in turn, act as condensation nuclei for water vapor. Acid\u2013base phenomena occur in the droplets, and the droplets act as scavengers to remove ionic species from air. Because fog aerosol particles form in areas of intense acid gas pollution near the surface, the concentrations of acids and ionic species in fog aerosol droplets tend to be much higher than in cloud aerosol droplets at higher altitudes. In addition to health effects and damage to materials, one of the greater problems caused by smog is the destruction of crops and the reduction of crop yields. The annual cost of these effects in California alone is several billion dollars. Even lightly populated nonindustrial areas are subject to the effects of smog brought about by human activities. Particularly, the practice of burning savanna grasses for agricultural purposes causes smog. This burning produces NOx and reactive hydrocarbons that are required for smog formation. Furthermore, these grasses grow in tropical regions which have the intense sunlight required for smog formation. The net result is the rapid development of smoggy conditions as manifested by ozone levels several times normal background values. Since about 1970, significant progress has been made in eliminating the emissions of organic compounds and NOx that cause smog formation. These efforts resulted in a less-than-anticipated reduction in smog; for example, urban ozone in the United States declined only about 8% during the 1980s. In an effort to reduce ozone and other manifestations of air pollution more rapidly, the U.S. Congress passed a new, more rigorous set of Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990. The Amendments were written to further reduce automotive exhaust emissions, require changes in automotive fuel formulations, reduce emissions from stationary sources, and mandate other changes designed to reduce photochemical smog and other forms of air pollution. As a result of the enforcement of regulations under the Clean Air Act and technological advances, particularly in the area of automobile emissions, substantial progress has been made in controlling smog in the United States since the early 1990s. 14.8 NUCLEAR WINTER Nuclear winter is a term used to describe a catastrophic atmospheric effect that might occur after a massive exchange of nuclear firepower between major powers as well as natural phenomena, particularly huge volcanic eruptions and asteroid impact, which would have much the same effect. The heat from the nuclear blasts and from resulting fires would cause powerful updrafts carrying sooty combustion products to stratospheric regions. This would result in several years of much lower temperatures and freezing temperatures even during summertime. There are several reasons for such an effect. First of all, the highly absorbent, largely black particulate matter would absorb solar radiation high in the atmosphere so that it would not reach the earth\u2019s surface. Cooling would also occur from a phenomenon opposite to that of the greenhouse effect. That is because outgoing infrared radiation from particles high in the atmosphere would have to penetrate relatively much less into the atmosphere and, therefore, would be exposed to much less infrared-absorbing water vapor and carbon dioxide gas. This would deprive the lower atmosphere of the warming effect of outgoing infrared radiation and would mean that less infrared would be re-radiated from the atmosphere back to the earth\u2019s surface.", "The cooling would also inhibit the evaporation of water, thereby reducing the amount of infrared-absorbing water vapor in the atmosphere and slowing the process by which particulate matter is scavenged from the atmosphere by rain. In addition to the direct suffering caused, starvation of millions of people would result from crop failures accompanying years of nuclear winter. Conditions similar to those of a nuclear winter have resulted from huge volcanic eruptions. One of these occurred in 1816, \u201cthe year without a summer,\u201d following the astoundingly enormous Tambora, the Indonesian volcanic explosion of 1815. Brutally cold years around 210 BC that followed a similar volcanic incident in Iceland were recorded in ancient China. The June 1991 explosion of the Philippine volcano Pinatubo, which blasted millions of tons of material into the atmosphere, resulted in an approximately 0.5\u00b0C cooling the following year. The greatest climatic effects of volcanoes result from emission of millions of tons of sulfur gases into the atmosphere, which produce sunlight-reflecting sulfuric acid aerosols and sulfate particles. The pronounced cooling effect of the Pinatubo volcano was mainly due to the 15\u201330 million tons of sulfur dioxide that it emitted to the atmosphere. Eruptions near the equator cause global events whereas those at higher latitudes affect the hemisphere in which they occur. The volcanic incidents cited above clearly illustrate the climatic effects of huge quantities of particulate matter ejected high into the atmosphere. And it will happen again, perhaps on a scale that will dwarf even the Tambora eruption. Massive destructive eruptions can occur with supervolcanoes, one of the largest of which is the Yellowstone volcano in the United States. With a caldera about 50 km in diameter, another major eruption of this volcano could well occur again. An article entitled \u201cIs the \u2018Beast\u2019 Building to a Violent Tantrum?\u201d states the following: \u201cWhen the volcano in Yellowstone National Park blew 6,400 centuries ago, it obliterated a mountain range, felled herds of prehistoric camels hundreds of miles away, and left a smoking hole in the ground the size of the Los Angeles Basin.\u201d7 Such an event could well extinguish civilization on Earth. Evidence exists to suggest that military explosives can result in the introduction of large quantities of particulate matter into the atmosphere. For example, carpet bombings of cities, such as the tragic bombing of Dresden, Germany, near the end of World War II, have produced huge fi restorms that created their own wind causing a particle-laden updraft into the atmosphere. Of course, the effect of a full-scale nuclear exchange would be manyfold higher. An idea of the potential climatic effect resulting from a full-scale nuclear exchange may be obtained by considering the magnitude of the blasts that might be involved. Only two nuclear bombs have been used in warfare, both dropped on cities in Japan in 1945. The Hiroshima fi ssion bomb had the explosive force of 12 kilotons of Trinitrotoluene (TNT) explosive. Its blast, fi reball, and instantaneous emissions of neutrons and gamma radiation, followed by fires and exposure to radioactive fission products, killed about 100,000 people and destroyed the city on which it was dropped. In comparison with this 12-kiloton bomb, modern fusion bombs are typically rated at 500 kilotons, and 10-megaton weapons are common. A full-scale nuclear exchange might involve a total of the order of 5000 megatons of nuclear explosives. As a result, unimaginable quantities of soot from the partial combustion of wood, plastics, paving asphalt, petroleum, forests, and other combustibles would be carried to the stratosphere. At such high altitudes, tropospheric removal mechanisms for particles are not effective because there is not enough water in the stratosphere to produce rainfall to wash particles from the air, and convection processes are very limited. Much of the particulate matter would be in the micrometer size range in which light is refl ected, scattered, and absorbed most effectively and settling is very slow. Therefore, vast areas of Earth would be overlain by a stable cloud of particles and the fraction of sunlight reaching the earth\u2019s surface would be drastically reduced, resulting in a dramatic cooling effect. There would be other effects as well. The extreme heat and pressure in the fireball would result in the fixation of nitrogen by the following reaction: O2 + N2 \u00c6 2NO (14.34) The large quantities of NO generated would catalyze the destruction of protective stratospheric ozone. The timing and location of nuclear blasts are very important in determining their climatic effects.", "Atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, including a 58-megaton monster detonated by the Soviet Union, has had little atmospheric effect. Such tests were carried out at widely spaced intervals on deserts, small tropical islands, and other locations with minimal combustible matter. In contrast, military use of nuclear weapons would involve a high concentration of firepower, both in time and in space, on industrial and military targets consisting largely of combustibles. Furthermore, destruction of hardened military sites requires blasts that disrupt large quantities of soil, rock, and concrete, which are pulverized, vaporized, and blown into the atmosphere. On a hopeful note, the East\u2013West conflict that dominated world politics and threatened nuclear war from the mid-1900s until 1990 has now abated and the probability of nuclear warfare seems to have diminished. However, continued armed conflict in the Middle East, tense relations between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, efforts by potentially unstable countries to acquire nuclear weapons, racial hatred accompanied by a determination to perform \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d and a \u201ctrigger-happy\u201d state of mind among even educated people who should know better still give cause for concern with respect to the prospect of \u201cnuclear winter.\u201d 14.8.1 DOOMSDAY VISITORS FROM SPACE Of all the possible atmospheric catastrophes that can occur, arguably the most threatening would be one caused by the collision of a large asteroid with Earth. Convincing evidence now exists that mass extinctions of species in the past have resulted from Earth being hit by asteroids several kilometers in diameter. It is well established that the impact of a huge asteroid caused the extinction of dinosaurs and most other animal species 66 million years ago. Fossil evidence suggests that even greater extinctions that occurred millions of years earlier, including one that destroyed about 90% of all living species 251 million years ago, were probably the result of asteroid impact. Such an impact would cause much the same effects as those from \u201cnuclear winter,\u201d though with a large asteroid, the effects would be much more pronounced. Around 13,000 years ago, Earth was just emerging from the most recent Ice Age when it reverted to a cold period lasting for 1300 years called the Younger Dryas or \u201cBig Freeze.\u201d8 As a result, about 35 animal species including several large mammals such as the short-faced bear, American lion, and mastodons became extinct. Geologically, the beginning of the Younger Dryas is marked by a thin black layer of carbon indicative of massive fi res, probably from burning forests. It is possible that this catastrophic event was caused by the impact of a large comet that rained large numbers of meteorites over the earth\u2019s surface. The discovery of very small diamonds (\u201cnanodiamonds\u201d) in the black layer is indicative of such an event. 14.9 WHAT IS TO BE DONE? Of all environmental hazards, there is little doubt that major disruptions in the atmosphere and climate have the greatest potential for catastrophic and irreversible environmental damage. If levels of greenhouse gases and reactive trace gases continue to increase at present rates, major environmental effects are virtually certain. On a hopeful note, the bulk of these emissions arise from industrialized nations which, in principle, can apply the resources needed to reduce them substantially. The best example to date has been the 1987 \u201cMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,\u201d an international treaty through which a large number of nations agreed to cut CFC emissions by 50% by the year 2000. This agreement and subsequent ones, particularly the Copenhagen Amendment of 1992, may pave the way for more encompassing agreements covering carbon dioxide and other trace gases. More ominous, however, is the combination of population pressure and desire for better living standards on a global basis. Consider, for example, the demand that these two factors place on energy resources and the environmental disruption that may result. In many highly populated developing nations, high-sulfur coal is the most readily available, cheapest source of energy. It is understandably difficult to persuade populations faced with real hunger to forego short-term economic gain for the sake of long-term environmental quality. Destruction of rain forests by \u201cslash-and-burn\u201d agricultural methods does seem to make economic sense to those engaged in subsistence farming to obtain badly needed hard currency, which can be earned by converting forest to pasture land and exporting fast-food-hamburger beef to wealthier nations. What is to be done? First of all, it is important to keep in mind that the atmosphere has a strong ability to cleanse itself of pollutant species.", "Water-soluble gases, including greenhouse-gas CO2, acid-gas SO2, and fine particulate matter are removed with precipitation. For most gaseous contaminants, oxidation precedes or accompanies removal processes. To a degree, oxidation is carried out by O3. To a larger extent, the most active atmospheric oxidant is hydroxyl radical HO\u2211. As illustrated in Figure 9.10, this atmospheric scavenger species reacts with all important trace gas species except for CO2 and CFCs. It is now generally recognized that HO\u2211 is an almost universal atmospheric cleansing agent. Given this crucial role of HO\u2211 radical, any pollutants that substantially reduce its concentration in the atmosphere are potentially troublesome. One concern over carbon monoxide emissions to the atmosphere is the reactivity of HO\u2211 with CO, CO + HO\u2211\u00c6 CO2 + H (14.35) which could result in removal of HO\u2211 from the atmosphere. Of all the major threats to the global climate, it is virtually certain that humankind will have to try to cope with greenhouse warming and the climatic effects thereof. The measures to be taken in dealing with this problem fall into the three following categories: \u2022 Minimization by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, switching to alternate energy sources, increasing energy conservation, and reversing deforestation. It is especially sensible to use measures that have major benefits in addition to reduction of greenhouse warming. Such measures include, as examples, reforestation, restoration of grasslands, increased energy conservation, and a massive shift to solar and wind energy sources. \u2022 Counteracting measures, such as injecting light-reflecting particles into the upper atmosphere. \u2022 Adaptation, particularly through increased efficiency and flexibility of the distribution and use of water, which might be in very short supply in many parts of the world as a consequence of greenhouse warming. Important examples are implementation of more efficient irrigation practices and changes in agriculture to grow crops that require less irrigation. Emphasis on adaptation is favored by those who contend that not enough is known about the types and severity of global warming to justify massive expenditures on minimization and counteractive measures. In any case, adaptation will certainly have to be employed as a means of coping with global warming. Potentially, tax strategy can be very effective in reducing the use of carbonaceous fuels and greenhouse CO2 emissions. This is the rationale behind the carbon tax, which is tied with the carbon content of various fuels. Another option is to dispose off carbon dioxide to a sink other than the atmosphere. The most obvious such sink is the ocean; other possibilities are deep subterranean aquifers and exhausted oil and gas wells. A common measure taken against the effects of another atmospheric hazard, ultraviolet radiation, provides an example of adaptation. This measure is the use of sunscreens placed on the skin as lotions to filter out UV-B and in some formulations UV-A radiation, thus reducing the likelihood of skin cancer. The active ingredient of sunscreen must absorb or reflect ultraviolet light effectively. Suspensions of small particles of zinc oxide or titanium oxide are used in sunscreen formulations as physical blockers of ultraviolet radiation. Water-insoluble suspensions of organic octinoxate (octyl methoxycinnamate) absorb UV-B radiation and oxybenzone is effective against UV-A radiation (see structural formulas below). These and related compounds act as chemical absorbers, which are generally aromatic compounds conjugated with a carbonyl group. Chemical absorbers normally act by absorbing ultraviolet radiation to reach an excited state and then dissipating the absorbed energy by reverting to the ground state to regenerate the absorbing species. Octinoxate (octylmethoxycinnamate) Oxybenzone (2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)phenylmetanone The \u201ctie-in strategy,\u201d sometimes called the \u201cno-regrets\u201d policy, has been proposed as a sensible approach to dealing with the kinds of global environmental problems discussed in this chapter. This approach was first enunciated in 1980.9 It advocates taking measures consisting of \u201chigh-leverage actions,\u201d which are designed to prevent problems from occurring, which improve resiliency and adaptability, and which have substantial merit even if the major problems that they are designed to avoid do not materialize. An example is implementation of environmentally sound substitutes for fossil fuels to lower atmospheric CO2 output and prevent greenhouse warming. Even if it turns out that the greenhouse effect is exaggerated, such substitutes would save Earth from other kinds of environmental damage, such as disruption of land by strip mining coal or preventing oil spills from petroleum transport. Definite economic and political benefits would also accrue from lessened dependence on uncertain, volatile petroleum supplies.", "Increased energy effi ciency would diminish both greenhouse gas and acid rain production, while lowering costs of production and reducing the need for expensive and environmentally disruptive new power plants. Even when changes such as in climate are inevitable, measures that slow the changes are desirable because adaptation is usually much more feasible over longer time periods. The implementation of tie-in strategies requires some degree of incentive beyond normal market forces and, therefore, is opposed by some on ideological grounds. A good example is opposition to mandatory fuel mileage standards for automobiles. Although free market purists tend to oppose measures such as fuel mileage standards, a market that does not factor in environmental costs is not truly a free market. LITERATURE CITED 1.
