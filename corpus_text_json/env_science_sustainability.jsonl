Science and the Environment \u201cThere was once a town in the heart of America where all life seemed to live in harmony with its surroundings. The town lay in the midst of a checkerboard of prosperous farms, with fields of grain and hillsides of orchards where, in spring, white clouds of blossom drifted above the green fields. . . . The countryside was, in fact, famous for the abundance and variety of its bird life, and when the flood of migrants was pouring through in spring and fall people traveled from great distances to observe them. . . . So it had been from the days many years ago when the first settlers raised their houses, sank their wells, and built their barns. 1 \u201d These are words from the classic Silent Spring, written by biologist RachelCarson to open her first chapter, titled \u201cA Fable for Tomorrow.\u201d After painting this idyllic picture, the chapter goes on to describe \u201ca strange blight\u201d that began to afflict the town and its surrounding area. Fish died in streams, farm animals sickened and died, families were plagued with illnesses and occasional deaths. The birds had disappeared, their songs no longer heard\u2014it was a \u201csilent spring.\u201d And on the roofs and lawns and fields remnants of a white powder could still be seen, having fallen from the skies a few weeks before. Rachel Carson explained that no such town existed, but that all of the problems she described had already happened somewhere, and that there was the very real danger that \u201c. . . this imagined tragedy may easily become a stark reality we all shall know. \u201d2 She published her book in 1962, during an era when pesticides and herbicides were sprayed widely on the landscape to control pests in agricultural crops, forests, towns, and cities. In Silent Spring, Carson was particularly critical 1Rachel Carson, Silent Spring (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1962), 1, 2. 2Ibid., 3. Rachel Carson, the author of Silent Spring. 1.1 A Paradox: What Is the Real State of the Planet? 3 of the widespread spraying of DDT. This pesticide was used to control Dutch elm disease, a fungus that invades trees and eventually kills them. The fungus is spread by elm bark beetles and DDT was used to kill the beetles. In towns that employed DDT spraying, birds began dying off, until in some areas people reported their yards were empty of birds. Thousands of dead songbirds were recovered and analyzed in laboratories for DDT content; all had toxic levels in their tissues. DDT was also employed in spraying salt marshes for mosquito control, and the result was a drastic reduction in the fish-eating bald eagle and osprey. Fallout. Rachel Carson brought two important qualities toher work: she was very careful to document every finding reported in the book, and she had a high degree of personal courage. She was sure of her scientific claims, and she was willing to take on the establishment and defend her work. In spite of the fact that her work was thoroughly documented, her book ignited a firestorm of criticism from the chemical and agricultural establishment. Even respected institutions such as the American Medical Association joined in the attack against her. Despite this criticism, Silent Spring caught the public\u2019s eye, and it quickly made its way to the President\u2019s Science Advisory Committee when John F. Kennedy read a serialized version of it in the New Yorker. Kennedy charged the committee with studying the pesticide problem and recommending changes in public policy. In 1963, Kennedy\u2019s committee made recommendations that fully supported Carson\u2019s thesis. Congress began holding hearings, public debate followed, and Carson\u2019s voice was joined by others who called for new policies to deal 1.1 A Paradox: What Is the Real State of the Planet?", "Paradox (n.): A statement exhibiting contradictory or inexplicable aspects or qualities. 3 A group of scientists from McGill University recently published a paper in which they identified a so-called environmentalist\u2019s paradox. 4 The paradox, they said, is this: over the past 40 years, human well-being has been steadily improving, while natural ecosystems (from which we derive many goods and services) have been declining. To explain this paradox, the authors advanced four hypotheses: 3Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1995), s.v. \u201cparadox.\u201d 4Ciara Raudsepp-Hearne et al., \u201cUntangling the Environmentalist\u2019s Paradox: Why Is Human Well-Being Increasing as Ecosystem Services Degrade?\u201d Bioscience 60 (September 2010): 576\u2013589. not only with pesticides, but also with air and water pollution and more protection for wild areas. Finally, in 1969, Congress passed a bill known as the Environmental Policy Act, the first legislation to recognize the interconnectedness of ecological systems and human enterprises. Shortly after that, a commission appointed by President Richard Nixon to study environmental policy rec ommended the creation of a new agency that would be re sponsible for dealing with air, water, solid waste, the use of pesticides, and radiation standards. The new agency, called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was given a mandate to protect the environment, on behalf of the public, against pressures from other governmental agencies and from industry. The year was 1970, the same year that 20 million Americans celebrated the first Earth Day. In what must be seen as a triumph of Rachel Carson\u2019s work, DDT was banned in the United States and most other industrialized countries in the early 1970s. (The DDT story is more fully documented in Chapter 13. ) Unfortunately, Rachel Carson did not live long after her world-shaking book was published; she died of breast cancer in 1964. Her legacy, however, is a lasting one: she is credited with initiating major reforms in pesticide policy as well as an environmental aware ness that eventually led to the modern environmental movement and the creation of the EPA. Moving On. This is a story of science and the environment,but it is more than that; it is a story of a courageous woman who changed the course of history. In this chapter, we briefly explore the current condition of our planet and then introduce three themes that provide structure to the primary goal of this text: to promote a sustainable future. We will take a brief look at four important global trends and keep in mind these hypotheses (the scientific method and hypotheses are explained later in the chapter) as we engage in our initial examination of the state of our planet: (1) human population and well-being, (2) the status of vital ecosystem services, (3) global climate change, and (4) the loss of biodiversity. Each of these topics is explored in greater depth in later chapters. Population Growth and Human Well-Being The world\u2019s human population, more than 7.3 billion in 2014, has grown by 2 billion in just the past 25 years. It is continuing to grow, at the rate of about 80 million persons per year. Even though the growth rate (now 1.1%/year) is gradually slowing, the world population in 2050 is likely to exceed 9.3 billion, according to the most recent projections from CHAPTER 1 Science and the Environment Figure 1\u20131 World population 12 explosion. World population started a 11 rapid growth phase in the early 1800s and 10 A.D. 1500 A.D. 2000 The Plague Industrial Revolution 2100 has increased sixfold in the past 200 years. At present it is growing by 80 million people 9 2043 per year. Future projections are based on 2024 8 Billions of people assumptions that birthrates will continue 7 2011 to decline. 6 1999 (Source: Data from UN Population Division, 2012 revision, and from Population Reference Bureau 1987 5 2014 report.) 4 1975 3 1960 2 1 0 A.D. 1000 the United Nations (UN) Population Division (Figure 1\u20131) . The 2.2 billion persons added to the human population by 2050 will all have to be fed, clothed, housed, and, hopefully, supported by gainful employment. Virtually all of the increase will be in developing countries. Human Development Index. Each year since 1990, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has published a Human Development Report. 5 A key part of the report is the Human Development Index (HDI), a comprehensive assessment of human well-being in most countries of the world. With this index, well-being is measured in health, education, and basic living standards.", "The 2014 report highlighted the importance of resiliency and the vulnerability of the poor, suggesting that poverty is not simply a function of the amount of money people have, but is also a function of factors such as literacy and stability. The 2010 report included a unique four-decade comparison in which worldwide trends in HDI were plotted over the 40 years since 1970 (Figure 1\u20132) . Only three of the 135 countries analyzed declined in HDI, while most of the countries showed marked improvement. During those 40 years, life expectancy rose from 59 years to 70, school enrollment climbed from 55% to 70%, and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) doubled to more than $10,000. It is this overall progress that has provided one side of the environmentalist\u2019s paradox. As a result of these facts, the McGill team concluded that its first hypothesis is not supported; there are too many indications that human well-being has indeed improved markedly. Is It All Good? However, the overall progress can, and does, mask serious inequalities. Economic growth has been extremely unequal, both between and within countries. And there are huge gaps in human development across the world. For example, in developing countries, an estimated 1.1 billion people still experience extreme poverty, existing on an income of $1.25 a day. More than 800 million people, about 13% of 5United Nations Development Program, Human Development Report 2014: Sustaining Human Progress: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Building Resilience. (New York: UNDP, July 24, 2014), http://hdr.undp.org/en/2014-report. 1930 1830 Year the people living in developing countries, remain undernourished. Some 6.9 million children per year do not live to see their fifth birthday. Addressing these tragic outcomes of severe poverty has been a major concern of the UNDP, and in 2000, all UN member countries adopted a set of goals\u2014the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\u2014to reduce extreme poverty and its effects on human well-being by 2015 (see Table 9\u20132 for a list of the eight goals). Several of the MDGs were met ahead of schedule, while others were not met. The world has now moved to a post-2015 development agenda, driven by a set of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) discussed at length later (Chapter 9). The SDGs are a set of goals for world development and poverty alleviation, described by the UN, for 2015\u20132030. Ecosystem Goods and Services Natural and managed ecosystems support human life and economies with a range of goods and services. As crucial as they are, there is evidence that these vital resources are not being managed well. Around the world, human societies are depleting groundwater supplies, degrading agricultural soils, overfishing the oceans, and cutting forests faster than they can regrow. The world economy depends heavily on many renewable resources, as we exploit these systems for goods\u2014 water, all of our food, much of our fuel, wood for lumber and paper, leather, furs, raw materials for fabrics, oils and alcohols, and much more. These same ecosystems also provide a flow of services that support human life and economic well-being, such as the breakdown of waste, regulation of the climate, erosion control, pest management, and maintenance of crucial nutrient cycles. In a very real sense, these goods and services can be thought of as capital\u2014ecosystem capital. Human well-being and economic development are absolutely dependent on the products of this capital\u2014its income, so to speak. As a result, the stock of ecosystem capital in a nation and its income-generating capacity represent a major form of the wealth of the nation (see Chapter 2). These goods and services are provided year after year, as long as the ecosystems producing them are protected.

New York: UNDP, p. 27. ) UNDERSTANDING THE DATA 1.1 A Paradox: What Is the Real State of the Planet? 5 Patterns of Resource Consumption. As the human population grows, each person requires food, water, shelter, clothing, and other resources. Many of the goods and services that people need are derived from ecosystems.", "However, not all people use the same amount of resources. Any discussion of population growth, development, and the preservation of ecosystem services needs to include the idea that some people consume more resources than is necessary. One way to imagine individual consumption patterns is to picture what it would require to have everyone consume resources at the same level. For example, if all humans alive today replicated the resource consumption patterns of the average American, we would need more than four Earths to accommodate all of their needs. The concept of individual consumption will be covered extensively later (Chapters 2, 8, and 23 ). Measuring Ecosystem Health: A Huge Undertaking. To protect ecosystem goods and services for future generations, we need to know what they are, how they are being used, and what is happening to them. To find out, scientists have carried out a number of large-scale assessments. The most prominent, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, compiled available information on the state of ecosystems across the globe. During a period of four years, some 1,360 scientists from 95 countries gathered, analyzed, and synthesized information from published, peer-reviewed research. The project focused especially on the linkages between ecosystem services and human well-being on global, regional, and local scales. Ecosystem goods and services were grouped into provisioning services (goods such as food and fuel), regulating services (processes such as flood protection), and cultural services (nonmaterial benefits such as recreation) (see Table 1\u20131 on the following page). Supporting services (not included in the table), such as primary productivity and habitat, are necessary to the other three. In a summary report, the most prominent finding of the scientists was the widespread degradation and overexploitation of ecosystem resources. More than 60% of the classes of ecosystem goods and services assessed by the team were being degraded or used unsustainably ( Table 1\u20131). The sci entists concluded that if this trend is not reversed, the next half century could see deadly consequences for humans as the ecosystem services that sustain life are further degraded. Since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a number of other assessments have been conducted; several are listed in Table 1\u20132 (on the following page). Some of these assessments considered global patterns and others focused on regional ecosystems, but all found similar trends. One set of provisioning ecosystem services has actually been enhanced over recent years: the production of crops, livestock, and aquaculture. As a result, the production of food has kept pace with population growth, improving human health and increasing life expectancy. However, many ecosystem services and resources such as groundwater, soil, wild fish, and forestry products have declined, in part because of the way we use land and other resources to provide food, shelter, and consumer goods for humans. CHAPTER 1 Science and the Environment Paradox Resolved? The McGill team set out to explain further hypotheses remain: (3) our use of technology makes the environmentalist\u2019s paradox\u2014the fact that human well-us less dependent on ecosystem services, and (4) the existence being has been improving while natural ecosystems have been of a time lag between the loss of goods and services and the declining. It rejected hypothesis 1, which stated that human impact on human well-being, with the possibility of exceedwell-being is actually declining. The team concluded that ing limits and bringing on ecosystem collapse. The McGill hypothesis 2 was confirmed: enhanced food production out-University team concluded that these last two hypotheses weighs the effects of declines in other ecosystem services. Two help explain the environmentalist\u2019s paradox, although not as Table 1\u20131 The global status of ecosystem services. Human use has degraded almost two-thirds of the identified services; 20% are mixed, meaning they are degraded in some areas and enhanced in others; and 17% have been enhanced by human use. Source: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Synthesis. Washington, DC: Island Press, 2005. 1.1 A Paradox: What Is the Real State of the Planet? clearly as hypothesis 2. The team concluded that the paradox Atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa Observatory is not fully explained by any of the hypotheses, although 400 hypothesis 1 was rejected. It also concluded that ecosystem conditions are indeed continuing to decline, with unknown and perhaps severe impacts on human well-being in the fu-380 ture. The most serious concern is global climate change, the worldwide alteration of patterns of temperature, precipita tion, and the intensity of storms. Global Climate Change Parts per million 360 340 The global economy runs on fossil fuel.", "Every day in 2013 we burned some 91.3 million barrels of oil, 324 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 11.6 million tons of coal. All of this combustion generates carbon dioxide (CO2), which is released into the atmosphere at a rate of 80 million tons a day. Because of past and present burning of fossil fuels, the CO2 content of the atmosphere increased from 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1900 to 400 ppm in 2014. For the past decade, the level of atmospheric CO2 has increased by 2 ppm per year, and given our dependency on fossil fuels, there is no end in sight. Monitoring Carbon Dioxide and Its Effects. Carbon dioxide is a natural component of the lower atmosphere, along with nitrogen and oxygen. It is required by plants for photosynthesis and is important to the Earth-atmosphere energy system. Carbon dioxide gas absorbs infrared (heat) energy radiated from Earth\u2019s surface, thus slowing the loss of this energy to space. The absorption of infrared energy by CO2 and other gases warms the lower atmosphere in a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. As the greenhouse gases trap heat, they keep Earth at hospitable temperatures. Although the concentration of CO2 is a small percentage of the atmospheric gases, increases in the volume of this gas affect temperatures. Figure 1\u20133 graphs changes in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere from 1958 to the present. (The yearly peaks and valleys on the graph result from seasonal changes in the uptake of CO2. In summer, plants take in more CO2 for photosynthesis than they do in winter, causing the 320 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Figure 1\u20133 Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. This record of CO2 has been measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory since 1958. The atmospheric content of CO2 has risen by 45% since the Industrial Revolution began around 1750. (Source: Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, NOAA Research Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography.) total concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to decrease. The pattern of peaks and valleys reflects the seasons of the Northern Hemisphere, where most of Earth\u2019s landmasses and plants are located.) Figure 1\u20134 shows changes in global temperature since 1880. Both of these parameters are increasing. This is not proof that increases in CO2 caused the increase in global temperature, but the argument based on the well-known greenhouse effect is quite convincing. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the UN in 1988 and given the responsibility to report its assessment of climate change at five-year intervals. The latest of these assessments, the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), was released during 2013 and 2014. The work of thousands of scientific experts, this assessment produced convincing evidence of human-induced global warming that is Annual Global Land and Ocean Temperature Anomalies Figure 1\u20134 Global temperatures since 1880.

Polar ice is melting at an unprecedented rate, glaciers are retreating, storms are increasing in intensity, and sea level is rising. Because the oceans are absorbing half of the CO2 produced by burning fossil fuels and producing cement, the pH of seawater is declining, making the oceans more acidic. The Sound Science essay, Oysters Sound the Alarm (see p. 13) explores one consequence of ocean acidification. The IPCC concluded that future climate change could be catastrophic if something is not done to bring the rapidly rising emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases under control. With few exceptions, the scientists who have studied these phenomena have reached a clear consensus: Climate change is a huge global problem, and it must be addressed on a global scale. Responses. The solutions to this problem are not easy. The most obvious need is to reduce global CO2 emissions; the reduction of emissions is called mitigation.", "At issue for many countries is the conflict between the short-term economic impacts of reducing the use of fossil fuels and the long-term consequences of climate change for the planet and all its inhabitants. Future climate changes are likely to disrupt the provision of ecosystem goods and services essential to human well-being, and because the extremely poor depend especially on natural ecosystems, they will suffer disproportionately. International agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have been forged, and some limited mitigation has been achieved. Most observers believe that the best course forward is to aim toward an effective, binding international treaty to reduce emissions, but for countries also to act independently on a more immediate scale. The United States is moving forward to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under existing air pollution laws and to encourage renewable energy development. Without doubt, this is one of the defining environmental issues of the 21st century. ( Chapter 18 explores the many dimensions of global climate change.) Loss of Biodiversity Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms, both terrestrial and aquatic. It includes the variety within species, among species, and within ecosystems. The rapidly growing human population, with its increasing appetite for food, water, timber, fiber, and fuel, is accelerating the conversion of forests, grasslands, and wetlands to agriculture and urban development. The inevitable result is the loss of many of the wild plants and animals that occupy those natural habitats. Pollution also degrades habitats\u2014particularly aquatic and marine habitats\u2014 eliminating the species they support. Further, hundreds of species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and butterflies, as well as innumerable plants, are exploited for their commercial value. Even when species are protected by law, many are hunted, killed, and marketed illegally. According to the Global Biodiversity Outlook 4 (GBO 4) assessment, the majority of wild plant and animal species are declining in their range and/or population size. 6 6Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Global Biodiversity Outlook 4 (Montreal, 2014), accessed September 5, 2014, www.cbd.int/gbo3. As a result of these human activities, Earth is rapidly losing many of its species, although no one knows exactly how many. About 2 million species have been described and classified, but scientists estimate that 5 to 30 million species may exist on Earth. Because so many species remain unidentified, the exact number of species becoming extinct can only be estimated. Recently the World Wildlife Fund reported that since 1970, more than 10,000 populations of vertebrates, representing more than 3,000 species, have been reduced on average by half. 7 The most dramatic declines occurred in freshwater species; regionally, more declines occurred in the tropics. Why is the loss of biodiversity so critical? Biodiversity is the mainstay of agricultural crops and of many medicines. It is a key factor in maintaining the stability of natural systems and enabling them to recover after disturbances such as fires or volcanic eruptions. Many of the essential goods and services provided by natural systems are derived directly from various living organisms. These goods and services are especially important in sustaining the poor in developing countries. There are also aesthetic and moral arguments for maintaining biodiversity: Once a species is gone, it is gone forever. Finding ways to protect the planet\u2019s biodiversity is one of the major challenges of environmental science. (Chapter 6 covers loss of biodiversity.) Environmental Science and the Environmental Movement As you read this book, you will encounter descriptions of the natural world and how it works. You will also encounter a great diversity of issues and problems that have arisen because human societies live in this natural world. We use materials from it (goods taken from natural ecosystems); we convert parts of it into the built environment of our towns, cities, factories, and highways; and we transform many natural ecosystems into food-producing agricultural systems. We also use the environment as a place to dump our wastes\u2014solids, liquids, gases\u2014which affects the rest of the world. The environment, then, includes the natural world, human societies, and the human-built world; it is an extremely inclusive concept. Environmental Science. Things go wrong in the environment, sometimes badly. We have already considered four trends\u2014human population growth, ecosystem decline, global climate change, and loss of biodiversity\u2014that signal to us that we are creating problems for ourselves that we ignore at our peril. Lest you think that all we do is create problems, however, consider some of the great successes human societies have achieved.", "We have learned how to domesticate landscapes and ecosystems, converting them into highly productive food-producing systems that provide sustenance for more than 7 billion people. We have learned how to convert natural materials into an endless number of manufactured goods and structures, all useful for the successful building of cities, roadways, vehicles, and all that makes up a 21st-century human society. All of these successes, however, carry with them hazards. 7World Wildlife Fund, Living Planet Report 2014. Human actions have negative effects on the environment in two broad categories: cumulative impacts and unintended consequences. Sometimes we simply do too much of any one activity\u2014too much burning, too much tree cutting, too much mining on steep slopes. Activities that would not pose a problem if a few people engaged in them are big problems if millions of people do. Sometimes it isn\u2019t the accumulation of an activity; it is that we are not paying attention to how the world works. There are unintended consequences of using chemical pesticides, as we\u2019ve seen, or of dumping trash in wetlands. These two concepts, cumulative impacts and unintended consequences, will come up in the chapters ahead. This is where environmental science comes in. Simply put, environmental science is the study of how the world works. Scientists help figure out ways to lower the negative impacts of our actions, to find alternative ways to meet the same needs, and to better anticipate the likely effects of what we are doing. All sorts of disciplines contribute to environmental science: history, engineering, geology, physics, medicine, biology, and sociology, to name a few. It is perhaps the most multidisciplinary of all sciences. As you study Events People Policies 1.1 A Paradox: What Is the Real State of the Planet? environmental science, you have an opportunity to engage in something that can change your life and that will certainly equip you to better understand the world you live in now and will encounter in the future. The Early Environmental Movement. To understand how the world works today, we need some sense of history. Figure 1\u20135 is a timeline of some of the events and scientific findings, people, and policies of the American environmental movement as well as several international environmental events that will come up throughout the book. In the United States, the modern environmental movement began less than 60 years ago. The roots of this movement were in the late 19th century, when some people realized that the unique, wild areas of the United States were disappearing. Environmental degradation, resource misuse, and disastrous events sparked scientific study and sometimes grassroots action. Scientific study yielded information on how the world works. Individuals and groups worked as stewards to make changes. Policies were put into place to better protect resources and people from environmental degradation. Figure 1\u20135 Timeline of selected American and international environmental events, people, and policies. These critical pieces of environmental history will be covered throughout the book. Numbers next to each of the events and scientific findings, people, and policies are the chapters in which they are discussed. International subjects are labeled in green. In the late 19th century, the indiscriminate killing of birds and other animals and the closing of the western frontier sparked a reaction. Around that time, several groups devoted to conservation formed: the National Audubon Society, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Sierra Club, which was founded in California by naturalist John Muir, who helped popularize the idea of wilderness. President Theodore Roosevelt promoted the conservation of public lands, and the national parks were formed. An increasing awareness of the environment marked the first half of the 20th century. Unwise agricultural practices following World War I eventually helped create an environmental crisis\u2014the Dust Bowl of the 1930s (enormous soil erosion in the American and Canadian prairielands). During the Great Depression (1930\u20131936), conservation provided a means of both restoring the land and providing work for the unemployed, such as workers in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), who built trails and did erosion control in national parks and forests. The two decades following World War II (1945\u20131965) were full of technological optimism. New developments, ranging from rocket science to computers and from pesticides to antibiotics, were redirected to peacetime applications. However, although economic expansion enabled most families to have a home, a car, and other possessions, certain problems became obvious. The air in and around cities was becoming murky and irritating to people\u2019s eyes and respiratory systems.", "Rivers and beaches were increasingly fouled with raw sewage, garbage, and chemical wastes from industries, sewers, and dumps. Conspicuous declines occurred in many bird populations (including that of our national symbol, the bald eagle), aquatic species, and other animals. The decline of the bald eagle and other bird populations was traced to the accumulation in their bodies of DDT, the long-lasting pesticide that had been used in large amounts since the 1940s. In short, it was clear that we were seriously contaminating our environment. The Modern Environmental Movement. In 1962, biologist Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring, presenting her scenario of a future with no songbirds. Carson\u2019s voice was soon joined by others, many of whom formed organizations to focus and amplify the voices of thousands more in demanding a cleaner environment. This was the beginning of the modern environmental movement, in which a newly motivated citizenry demanded the curtailment of pollution, the cleanup of polluted environments, and the protection of pristine areas. Pressured by concerned citizens, Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970 and passed numerous laws promoting pollution control and wildlife protection, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act of 1972, the Marine Mammals Protection Act of 1972, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. A disastrous hazardous waste problem in Love Canal, New York, prompted the Superfund Act of 1980. Scientific studies on acid rain, the decline of the ozone layer, and global climate change caused more environmental groups to form and more policies to be put into place. Concerns about hazardous waste disposal triggered the rise of the Green Chemistry Movement. You will read more about these and more recent laws and their effects later in this book. As a result of these efforts, the air in our cities and the water in our lakes and rivers are far cleaner than they were in the late 1960s. Without a doubt, absent the environmental movement, our air and water would now be a toxic brew. By almost any measure, the environmental movement has been successful, at least in solving some pollution problems. In the early stages of the environmental movement, sources of problems were specific and visible, and the solutions seemed relatively straightforward: for example, install waste treatment and pollution control equipment and ban the use of very toxic pesticides, substituting safer pesticides. Today, there are political battles surrounding almost every environmental issue. Bitter conflicts have emerged over issues involving access to publicly owned resources such as water, grazing land, and timber. As environmental public policies are developed and enforced, the controversies that accompany those policies remind us that it is often difficult to get people with different priorities to agree on solutions. CONCEPT CHECK How is the environmental movement of today different from that of the early 20th century? From that of 1970? \u2610\u2713 1.2 Sustainability What will it take to move our civilization in the direction of a long-term sustainable relationship with the natural world? The answer to this question is not simple, but we would like to next present three unifying themes that provide coherence to the issues and topics covered in this text. In reality, these themes deal with how we should conceptualize our task of forging a sustainable future (Figure 1\u20136) . Each theme is a concept that we believe is essential to environmental science. The first theme is sustainability\u2014the practical goal toward which our interactions with the natural world should be working. The second is sound science\u2014the basis for our understanding of how the world works and how human systems interact with it. The third theme is stewardship\u2014the actions and programs that manage natural resources and human well-being for the common good. These themes will be applied to public policy and individual responsibility throughout the text and will also be explored in brief essays within each chapter. As each chapter of this text develops, the concepts behind these themes will come into play at different points. At the end of each chapter, we will revisit the themes, summarizing their relevance to the chapter topics and often adding our own perspective. Sustainable Yields A system or process is sustainable if it can be continued indefinitely, without depleting any of the material or energy resources required to keep it running. The term was first applied to the idea of sustainable yields in human endeavors such as forestry and fisheries.", "Trees, fish, and other biological species normally grow and reproduce at rates faster than 1.2 Sustainability 11 (a) Sustainability (b) Stewardship (c) Sound Science Figure 1\u20136 Three unifying themes. Sustainability, stewardship, and sound science are three vital concepts that move societies toward a sustainable future if they are applied to public policies and private environmental actions. (a) Sustainability includes the actions we take to protect ecosystems and their services, here represented by wind turbines. (b) These people represent stewardship by caring for the place they are in. (c) Sound science, demonstrated by these polar studies, is critical to understanding the effects of human activities and making good policy. those required just to keep their populations stable. Thus it is possible to harvest a certain percentage of trees or fish every year without depleting the forest or reducing the fish population below a certain base number. As long as the size of the harvest stays within the capacity of the population to grow and replace itself, the practice can be continued indefinitely. The harvest then represents a sustainable yield. The concept of a sustainable yield can also be applied to freshwater supplies, soils, and the ability of natural systems to absorb pollutants without being damaged. The notion of sustainability can be extended to include ecosystems. Sustainable ecosystems are entire natural systems that persist and thrive over time by recycling nutrients, maintaining a diversity of species, and using the Sun as a source of sustainable energy. As we\u2019ll see, ecosystems are enormously successful at being sustainable (Chapters 3, 4, and 5). Sustainable Societies Applying the concept of sustainability to human systems, we say that a sustainable society is a society in balance with the natural world, continuing generation after generation, neither depleting its resource base by exceeding sustainable yields nor producing pollutants in excess of nature\u2019s capacity to absorb them. Many primitive societies were sustainable in this sense for thousands of years. Many of our current interactions with the environment are not sustainable, however. This is demonstrated by such global trends as the decline of biodiversity and essential ecosystems and the increased emissions of greenhouse gases. Although population growth in industrialized countries has almost halted, these countries are using energy and other resources at unsustainable rates, producing pollutants that are accumulating in the atmosphere, water, and land. In contrast, developing countries are experiencing continued population growth, yet are often unable to meet the needs of many of their people in spite of heavy exploitation of natural resources. As our modern societies pursue continued economic growth and consumption, we are apparently locked into an unsustainable mode. How do we resolve this dilemma? One answer is the concept of sustainable development. Sustainable Development Sustainable development is a term that was first brought into common use by the World Commission on Environment and Development, a group appointed by the United Nations. The commission made sustainable development the theme of its final report, Our Common Future, published in 1987. The report defined sustainable development as a form of development or progress that \u201cmeets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d The concept arose in the context of a debate between the respective environmental and developmental concerns of groups of developed and developing countries. Development refers to the continued improvement of human well-being, usually in the lower and middle income countries. Both developed and developing countries have embraced the concept of sustainable development, although industrialized countries are usually more concerned about environmental sustainability, while developing countries are more concerned about economic development. The basic idea, however, is to maintain and improve the well-being of both humans and ecosystems. The concept of sustainable development sounds comforting, so people want to believe that it is possible, and it appears to incorporate some ideals that are sorely needed, such as equity\u2014whereby the needs of the present are actually met and future generations are seen as equally deserving as those living now. Sustainable development means different things to different people, however. Economists, for example, are concerned mainly with growth, efficiency, and the optimum use of resources. Sociologists focus on human needs and concepts such as equity, empowerment, social cohesion, and cultural identity. Ecologists show their greatest concern for preserving the integrity of natural systems, for living within the carrying capacity of the environment, and for dealing effectively with Figure 1\u20137 Sustainable solutions. Sustainable solutions are much more achievable when the concerns of sociologists, economists, and ecologists intersect. pollution.", "It can be argued that sustainable solutions will be found mainly where the concerns of these three groups intersect, as illustrated in Figure 1\u20137. There are many dimensions to sustainable development\u2014 environmental, social, economic, and political\u2014and no societies today have achieved it. Nevertheless, as with justice, equality, and freedom, it is important to uphold sustainable development as an ideal\u2014a goal toward which all human societies need to be moving, even if we have not achieved it completely anywhere. For example, policies that reduce infant mortality, improve air quality, and restore coastal fisheries move societies toward a sustainable future. In addition, the outcomes of such policies are measurable, so it is possible to assess our progress in achieving sustainable development. Communities and organizations are forging sustainable development indicators and goals to track their progress, such as the Environmental Sustainability Index (produced by Yale University, 1999\u20132005), which evaluated a society\u2019s natural resources and its stewardship of those resources and the people they support. An Essential Transition What will it take to make the transition to a sustainable future? There is broad agreement on the following major points: This is not an exhaustive list, but it does give a glimpse of what a sustainable future might look like. One thing is certain: we cannot continue on our present trajectory and hope that everything will turn out well. The natural world is being degraded, its ecosystem capital eroded. One essential tool for achieving sustainability is sound science. CONCEPT CHECK If a society is not using up resources rapidly but continues to have high inequality between rich and poor, what aspects of sustainability are missing? How does equity promote sustainability? \u2610\u2713 1.3 Sound Science Some environmental issues are embroiled in controversies so polarized that no middle ground seems possible. On one side are those who argue using seemingly sound scientific facts to support their position. On the other side are those who present opposing explanations of the same facts. Both groups may have motives for arguing their case that are not apparent to the public. In the face of such controversy, many people are understandably left confused. It is our objective to give a brief overview of the nature of science and the scientific method and then to show how science forms the foundation for understanding controversial issues. The Scientific Method In its essence, science is simply a way of gaining knowledge; that way is called the scientific method. The term science further refers to all the knowledge gained through that method. We employ the term sound science to distinguish legitimate science from what can be called junk science, information that is presented as valid science but that does not conform to the rigors of the methods and practice of legitimate science. Sound science involves a disciplined approach to understanding how the natural world works\u2014the scientific method. Assumptions. To begin, the scientific method rests on four basic assumptions that most of us accept without argument. 1.3 Sound Science 13 SOUND SCIENCE Although assumptions, by definition, are premises that are simply accepted, the fact is that the assumptions underlying science have served us well and are borne out by everyday experience. For example, we suffer severe consequences if we do not accept our perception of fire as real. Similarly, our experience confirms that gravity is a predictable force acting throughout the universe and that it is not subject to unpredictable change. Thus, whether we are conscious of the fact or not, we all accept the basic assumptions of science in the conduct and understanding of our everyday lives. Observation. The foundation of all science and scientific discovery is observation. Indeed, many branches of science, such as natural history (the study of where and how various plants and animals live, mate, reproduce, etc.), astronomy, anthropology, and paleontology, are based almost entirely on observation because experimentation is either inappropriate or impossible. For example, it simply is impossible to conduct experiments on stars or past events. Even experimentation, as we will discuss shortly, is conducted to gain another window of observation. How can we be sure that observations are accurate? One answer is that scientists use a variety of tools and technologies to help them make accurate observations. Our current understanding of climate, for example, depends on remarkably precise maps and measurements from satellites. Even so, not every reported observation is accurate, for reasons ranging from honest misperceptions or instrument error to calculated mischief.", "Therefore, an important aspect of science, and a trait of scientists, is to be sceptical of any new findings until they are replicated. Constructing Models. Various observations, like the pieces of a puzzle, are often put together into a larger picture\u2014 a model of how a system works. Models may be mathematical formulas, computer simulations, diagrams, conceptual descriptions, or other representations. What all models have in common is an attempt to portray the important parts of a real system; although a model is simpler than the system it portrays, it can be used to predict outcomes. To give a simple example, we observe that water evaporates, making the air moist, and that water from moist air condenses on a cool surface. We also observe clouds and precipitation. Putting these observations together logically, we derive a conceptual description of the hydrologic cycle, described later ( Chapter 10). Water evaporates and then condenses as air is cooled, condensation forms clouds, and precipitation follows. Water thus makes a cycle from the surface of Earth into the atmosphere and back to Earth (Figure 10\u20133). Note how this simple example incorporates the four assumptions described previously: there is an objective reality, it operates according to principles, every result has a cause, and we can discover the principles according to which reality operates. So, the essence of science and the scientific method may be seen as a process of making observations and logically integrating those observations into a model of how some natural system works. This is where the sequence consisting of observation, hypothesis, test (experiment), and explanation comes in. Figure 1\u20138 shows the typical sequence of these step. Experimentation. Experimentation is simply setting up situations to make more systematic observations regarding causes and effects. For example, biologists put organisms into specific situations in which they can carefully observe and measure their responses to particular conditions or treatments. Figure 1\u20139 depicts scientists exposing marine organisms to different pH levels in order to determine the effects of acidification. To solve a particular problem (e.g., What is the cause of this event?), a systematic line of experimentation is used. One of the reasons experimentation is so powerful is because it includes a control\u2014a point against which you compare what you find under experimental conditions. Experiments need to include replication\u2014that is, more than a one-time measurement of a factor. After the measurements are taken, scientists use statistics to determine whether or not their findings show an effect big enough to conclude that the results probably do not result from random chance. Hypotheses. Let\u2019s consider the problem of the death of oyster larvae at the Whiskey Creek hatchery (see Sound Science, p. 13 ). The owners\u2019 question was What is killing the oyster larvae in the incubation tanks? The first step in solving the problem was to make educated guesses as to the cause. Each such educated guess is a hypothesis. Each hypothesis is then tested by making further field observations or by conducting experiments to determine whether or not the hypothesis really accounts for the observed effect. In the case of the oysters, the owners performed what were essentially a series of informal experiments. The owners found high numbers of pathogenic bacteria in the tanks (hypothesis: the bacteria were killing the larvae). They installed a new filtration system that removed bacteria before they could multiply, essentially conducting an experiment. The larvae still died. They rejected that hypothesis. Then a crucial observation was made about the timing of the bay water brought into the tanks, water that had come from recently upwelled coastal surface water. This water had a lower pH (closer to the acid range) than usual (hypothesis: water with a lower pH was killing the larvae). By monitoring the pH of incoming water, the owners were able to avoid the water with lower pH and time water withdrawals to daytime hours when the pH was higher. The results were dramatic: the larvae were able to thrive and grow. In this case, the hypothesis was supported because the larval death ended. Figure 1\u20138 shows how such a process moves from observations to hypotheses, experiments, and finally to an answer that fits the data better than other answers and can be used to make predictions\u2014that is, a better model of how the world works. Figure 1\u20139 Experiment demonstrating the effect of ocean acidification on marine organisms.", "Researchers from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center conduct experiments to test effects of ocean acidification on fish, shellfish, and cold water corals in the North Pacific ocean, a region considered to be especially vulnerable to acidification. 1.3 Sound Science 15 Uncertainty. Testing hypotheses helps scientists learn how the world works, but scientists never confirm a hypothesis. Instead, they reject a null hypothesis, which is what would be true if there were no relationship between the variables they are investigating. Scientists compare their findings to what they would expect to see from random chance. Then they can say something like, \u201cWith 95% confidence, we reject that this result came from random chance, that is, we reject the null hypothesis.\u201d Notice that the statement includes a measure of confidence or its opposite, uncertainty. Scientific uncertainty can result from errors in measurement or understanding; it can also result from accurate (correct) but imprecise (not finely divided) measurements. Because there is always a limit to what we can think of, measure, or know, we can never be 100% certain that our model is correct. There is always a possibility that some other explanation fits the data better than the explanation we have. However, that possibility can be so small that we can use our model to predict outcomes with a high degree of success. That is the sign of a good model. Theories. We have already noted how various specific observations (e.g., evaporation, precipitation) may fit together to give a logically coherent conceptual framework (e.g., the hydrologic cycle). A hypothesis is a tentative explanation that answers a question. An overarching conceptual framework that explains many observations and is well supported by evidence is called a theory. Through logical reasoning, theories can be used to suggest or predict certain events or outcomes. Predictions require experiments, testing, further data gathering, and more observation. When theories reach a state of providing a logically consistent framework for relevant observations and when they can be used to reliably predict outcomes, they are accepted. For example, we have never seen atoms directly (or, until recently, even indirectly), but innumerable observations and experiments support and are explained by the atomic theory of matter. Of course, because of the nature of science, theories are always less than absolutely certain. Natural Laws. The second assumption underlying science\u2014that the universe functions according to certain basic principles and natural laws that remain consistent through time and space\u2014cannot be established with absolute certainty. Still, all our observations, whether direct or through experimentation, demonstrate that matter and energy behave neither randomly nor even inconsistently, but in precise and predictable ways. We refer to these principles by which we can define and precisely predict the behavior of matter and energy as natural laws. Examples are the Law of Gravity, the Law of Conservation of Matter, and the various Laws of Thermodynamics. Our technological success in space exploration and many other fields is in no small part due to our recognition of these principles and our precise calculations based on them. Conversely, trying to make something work in a manner contrary to a natural law invariably results in failure. In many situations, the outcome of scientific work results in well-established explanations that must be expressed in the mathematical language of probability and statistics. This is especially true of biological phenomena such as predator\u2013prey relationships and the effects of pesticides. In such cases, it is appropriate to speak of concepts rather than laws. Concepts are perfectly valid explanations of data gathered from the natural world, but they don\u2019t reach the status of laws. Concepts model the way we believe the natural world works and enable us to make qualified predictions of future outcomes. Thus, on the basis of our understanding of the effects of DDT (a potent pesticide) on mosquitoes and on the basis of our observation that mosquitoes can develop resistance to DDT, we might predict that regular spraying of the local salt marshes with DDT to eradicate unwelcome mosquitoes is likely to result in the development of a more resistant mosquito population in the future. The Scientific Community The process of science and its outcomes take place in the context of a scientific community and a larger society. There is no single authoritative source that makes judgments on the validity of scientific explanations. Instead, it is the collective body of scientists working in a given field who, because of their competence and experience, establish what is sound science and what is not.", "Scientists communicate their findings to each other and to the public by publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals. In the process of peer review, experts in a given field scrutinize the results of their colleagues\u2019 work, with the objective of rooting out poor or sloppy science and affirming work that is of good quality. Professional Societies. Scientists also operate through professional societies, which may put out statements, white papers, or reports that represent the best scientific understanding of their members. For example, the report What We Know, published in 2014 by the American Academy for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), describes the current state of scientific understanding on climate change. 8 Members of the U.S. National Academies of Science (NAS), the top scientific society in the United States, are preeminent American scientists chosen by their peers. The NAS provides leadership for the country by describing the current state of scientific knowledge in different fields. Disagreements. Even with the checks and balances that work to establish scientific knowledge and with all the procedures of the scientific method, disagreements arise that pit one group against another, with both groups claiming that they have science on their side. For example, we will make the claim that the global climate is changing because of hu man activities (Chapter 18) . A few scientists disagree with this claim, although for most the evidence is convincing. There are at least four reasons why such disagreements occur. 1. New information. We are continually confronted by new observations\u2014the hole in the ozone layer, for in stance (see Chapter 19). It takes some time before all the hypotheses regarding the cause of the new observation can be adequately tested. During this time, there is often much debate as to which hypothesis is most likely. Some disagreement is the inevitable outcome of the scientific process itself, but much of it is attributable to less-noble causes. Unfortunately, the media and the public may be unaware of the true nature of the information and will often give equal credibility to opposing views on an issue. This leads us to the topic of junk science. Junk Science. Junk science refers to information that is presented as scientifically valid but that does not conform to the rigors imposed by the scientific community. Junk science can take many forms: the presentation of selective results (picking and choosing only those results that agree with one\u2019s preconceived ideas), politically motivated distortions of scientifically sound information, and the publication of poor work in quasi-scientific (unreviewed) journals and books. Quite often, junk science is generated by special interest groups trying to influence the public debate about science-related concerns. As a result, the public arena may consider the junk science to be equally as valid as the sound science. Information presented by the Tobacco Institute, for example, is clearly suspect, due to its corporate-related funding. Junk science has been heavily employed in promoting the (scientifically debunked) idea that vaccines cause autism, a common misconception in the United States. In recent years, another use of the term junk science has appeared that has created some confusion. In some cases, 8Molina, M., et al., What We Know: The Reality, Risks and Response to Climate Change (AAAS, 2014), accessed November 7, 2014, http://whatweknow.aaas.org/ wp-content/uploads/2014/07/whatweknow_website.pdf. 1.4 Stewardship 17 people with a bias have used the term to refer to anything that threatens their preferred viewpoint; conversely, sound science becomes anything that supports their viewpoint. One example of this usage has come from those who do not support the Endangered Species Act. They label as \u201cjunk science\u201d the legitimate use of computer models to make predictions about the survival of endangered species. This limits scientific input to a much smaller number of studies and could mean that decisions are made without the full range of available information. Evaluating Issues. Whether we are scientists or simply concerned citizens, we can use facets of the scientific method to deal with disagreements about science and to develop our own capacity for logical reasoning. Here are some basic questions to ask: In sum, sound science is absolutely essential to forging a sustainable relationship with the natural world. Our planet is dominated by human actions. Our activities have reached such an intensity and such a scale that we are now one of the major forces affecting the rest of nature.", "Our influence on the natural ecosystems that support most of the world economy and process our waste is strong and widespread, and we need to know how to manage the planet so as to maintain a sustainable relationship with it. As a result, the information gathered by scientists needs to be accurate, credible, and communicated clearly to policy makers and the public; the policy makers, in turn, need to handle that information responsibly (the interaction between science and politics is explored in Chapter 2). CONCEPT CHECK If an advertisement claims that magnets can cure cancer, what information would you want to have before you considered the claim to be sound science rather than junk science? \u2610\u2713 1.4 Stewardship The third of our themes is stewardship\u2014the actions and programs that manage natural resources and human well-being for the common good. Stewardship is a concept that can be traced back to ancient civilizations. A steward was put in charge of his master\u2019s household, responsible for maintaining the welfare of the people and the property of the owner. Because a steward did not own the property himself, the steward was responsible for caring for something on behalf of someone else. Applying this concept to the world today, stewards are those who care for something\u2014from the natural world or from human culture\u2014that they do not own and that they will pass on to STEWARDSHIP the next generation. Stewardship is compatible with the goal of sustainability, but it is different from it, too, because stewardship deals more directly with how sustainability is to be achieved\u2014what actions are taken, and what values and ethical considerations are behind those actions. Ethics is the study of moral principles; it is concerned with what is good\u2014those values and virtues we should encourage\u2014and what is right\u2014our moral duties as we face practical problems. A stewardship ethic is concerned with right and wrong as they apply to actions taken to care for the natural world and the people in it. It recognizes that even our ownership of land is temporary; the land will be there after we die, and others will own it in turn. Because a steward is someone who cares for the natural world on behalf of others, we might ask, \u201cTo whom is the steward responsible?\u201d Many would answer, \u201cThe steward is responsible to present and future generations of people who depend on the natural world as their life-support system.\u201d There are several underlying reasons for a stewardship ethic, some stronger than others. For people with religious convictions, stewardship stems from a belief that they are stewards on behalf of a higher power. For others, stewardship becomes a matter of concern that stems from a deep understanding and love of the natural world and the necessary limitations on our use of that world. Is there a well-established stewardship ethic? Insofar as human interests are concerned, ethical principles and rules are fairly well established, even if they are often violated by public and private acts. However, there is no firmly established ethic that deals with care for natural lands and creatures for their own sake. Most of our ethic concerning natural things deals with how those things serve human purposes; that is, our current ethic is highly anthropocentric. For example, a basic ethical principle from the UN Declaration on Human Rights and the Environment is, \u201cAll persons have the right to a secure, healthy, and ecologically sound environment.\u201d Here, the point of the healthy environment is for humanity. Ethics for protec tion of other species will be covered later (Chapter 6) . Who Are the Stewards? How is stewardship achieved? Sometimes stewardship leads people to try to stop the destruction of the environment or to stop the pollution that is degrading human neighborhoods and health. For example, Rachel Carson was a steward who alerted the public about the dangers of pesticides and their role in decimating bird populations. The late Wangari Maathai (the first Kenyan woman to earn a Ph.D.) founded the Green Belt Movement to help rural Kenyan women. The grassroots movement eventually involved more than 6,000 groups of women who planted 47 million trees in Kenya. Maathai was beaten and jailed when she went on to protest government corruption. Eventually, she was appointed deputy environment minister under a new Kenyan president and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 (Figure 1\u201310) \u2014the first environmental activist to receive that honor.", "Ramesh Agrawal ( Figure 1\u201311) is an Indian activist who opposed the powerful Jindal Steel and Power Company and led a grassroots campaign of India\u2019s poor villagers against environmentally damaging mining operations. Agrawal was imprisoned and later shot in the leg for his activism. Even so, his efforts have succeeded in helping the poor in India who did not know their legal rights. In recognition of this work, Agrawal was awarded the 2014 Goldman Environmental Prize. Figure 1\u201310 Stewardship at work. Wangari Maathai receiving the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize from Ole Danbolt Mj, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. She is an example of unusual environmen-tal stewardship at work. More often, stewardship is a matter of everyday people caring enough for each other and for the natural world that they do the things that are compatible with that care. These include participating fully in recycling efforts, purchasing cars that pollute less and use less energy, turning off the lights in an empty room, refusing to engage in the conspicuous consumption constantly being urged on them by commercial advertising, supporting organizations that promote sustainable practices, staying informed on environmentally sensitive issues, and expressing their citizenship by voting for candidates who are sympathetic to environmental concerns and the need for sustainable development. Figure 1\u201311 Goldman Prize winner, 2014. Ramesh Agrawal was shot in the leg as a result of his efforts to help poor Indian villagers demand their right to information about the environmental impact of industrial projects. (Source: Goldman Environmental Prize.) Justice and Equity The stewardship ethic is concerned not only with caring for the natural world, but also with establishing just relationships among humans. This concern for justice is seen in the United States in the environmental justice movement. One major problem addressed by the movement is environmental racism\u2014the placement of waste sites and other hazardous industries in towns and neighborhoods where most of the residents are nonwhite. The flip side of this problem is seen when wealthier, more politically active, and often predominantly white communities receive a disproportionately greater share of facility improvements, such as new roads, public buildings, and water and sewer projects. People of color are seizing the initiative to correct these wrongs, creating citizen groups and watchdog agencies to bring effective action and monitor progress. For example, the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, recently underwent a huge renewal that changed its reputation from being \u201cthe dirtiest city in America\u201d to the \u201cRenaissance City of the South.\u201d Yet most of this renewal bypassed Chattanooga\u2019s Southside, an area that is populated largely by African Americans. In 2010, Southside community members formed Chattanooga Organized for Action (COA), a group that has quickly become a voice for social justice. Among other actions, COA has organized the restoration of funding for family-planning programs for low-income and minority women and forced a more thorough cleanup of a former chemical plant site in Southside. Justice is not only about racial concerns. Injustices can occur wherever people lack equal protection from environmental degradation. In some countries, extreme poverty is brought on by injustices within societies where wealthy elites maintain political power and, through corruption and nepotism, steal money and give corporations preferential treatment. It takes significant government reform to turn this situation around so that the poor can achieve justice in securing property rights and gain greater access to ecosystem goods and services. Some of the poverty of the developing countries can be attributed to unjust economic practices of the wealthy industrialized countries. The current pattern of international trade is an example. The industrialized countries have maintained inequities that discriminate against the developing countries by taxing and restricting imports from the developing countries and by flooding the world markets with agricultural products that are subsidized (and, therefore, priced below real cost). This is the number one issue at every meeting of the World Trade Organization, where global trade agreements 1.5 Moving Toward a Sustainable Future 19 are negotiated (see Chapter 2). Wealth inequality and de velopment are discussed at length later ( Chapters 8 and 9). Operating under a stewardship ethic ought to cause us to care for the natural world in ways that protect ecosystem resources for all of us\u2014in a just way. How does a stewardship ethic relate to climate change and biodiversity loss, described in Section 1.1? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 1.5 Moving Toward a Sustainable Future Without doubt, one of the dominant trends of our times is globalization\u2014the accelerating interconnectedness of human activities, ideas, and cultures.", "For centuries, global connections have brought people together through migration, trade, and the exchange of ideas. What is new about the current scene is the increasing intensity, speed, extent, and impact of connectedness, to the point where its consequences are profoundly changing many human enterprises. These changes are most evident in the globalization of economies, cultural patterns, political arrangements, environmental resources, and pollution. For many in the world, globalization has brought undeniable improvements in well-being and health: economic exchanges have connected people to global markets, information exchanges have improved public health practices, and agricultural research has improved crop yields. For others, however, globalization has brought the dilution or even destruction of cultural norms and religious ideals while doing little to improve economic well-being. Whether helpful or harmful, globalization is taking place, so it is important to recognize its impacts and to identify where those impacts are harmful or undesirable. Moving toward a sustainable future will occur in the context of globalization. Social Changes The major elements of globalization may be the economic reorganization of the world and the changes wrought by social media. These transformations have been facilitated by the globalization of communication, whereby people are instantly linked through the Internet, satellite, and cable. Other components of the global economic reorganization are the relative ease of transportation and financial transactions and the dominance of transnational corporations, such as Nokia, Roche, Philips Electronics, and Nestl\u00e9. All of these changes occur within the context of the demographic patterns of urbanization, mass migration, and aging populations in some countries. Moreover, economic changes bring cultural, environmental, and technological changes in their wake. Western diet, styles, and culture are marketed throughout the world, to the detriment of local customs and diversity. Environmental Changes On the one hand, the increased dissemination of information has made it possible for environmental organizations and government agencies to connect with the public and has enabled people to become politically involved with current issues. It has also enabled consumers to find more environmentally friendly consumer goods and services, such as shade-grown coffee and sustainably harvested timber. On the other hand, globalization has contributed to some notoriously harmful outcomes, such as the worldwide spread of emerging diseases such as the SARS virus, H1N1 swine influenza, and HIV/AIDS; the global dispersion of exotic species; the trade in hazardous wastes; the spread of persistent organic pollutants; the radioactive fallout from nuclear accidents; the exploitation of oceanic fisheries; the destruction of the ozone layer; and global climate change. These outcomes must be addressed in the move toward a sustainable future. A New Commitment People in all walks of life\u2014scientists, sociologists, workers and executives, economists, government leaders, and clergy, as well as traditional environmentalists\u2014are recognizing that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d is not sustainable. Many global trends are on a collision course with the fundamental systems that maintain our planet as a tolerable place to live. A finite planet cannot continue to grow by 80 million persons annually without significant detrimental effects. The current degradation of ecosystems, atmospheric changes, losses of species, and depletion of water resources inevitably lead to a point where resources are no longer adequate to support the human population without significant changes in the way we live. The news is not all bad, however. Food production has improved the nutrition of millions in the developing world, life expectancy continues to rise, and the percentage of individuals who are desperately poor continues to decline. Population growth rates continue to fall in many countries. A rising tide of environmental awareness in the industrialized countries has led to the establishment of policies, laws, and treaties that have improved environmental protection. Professional groups such as ecologists, climatologists, and engineers are proposing scientific and technological solutions to environmental problems. Figure 1\u201312 shows one such technological solution\u2014one of the many types of fuel-efficient stoves developed for use in places where wood is used for cooking. Numerous caring people are beginning to play an important role in changing society\u2019s treatment of Earth. For example, in January 2011, a group of 70 engineers produced a report proposing engineering development goals and stated, \u201c. . . the engineers of today, and the future, will need to be innovative in the application of sustainable solutions and increasingly engaged with the human factors that influence their decisions.\u201d 9", "Likewise, people in business have formed the Business Council for Sustainable Development, economists have formed the International Society for Ecological Economics, religious leaders have formed the National Religious Partnership for the 9Institution of Mechanical Engineers, \u201cPopulation: One Planet, Too Many People?\u201d (2011), accessed September 21, 2011, http://www.imeche.org/Libraries/ 2011_ Press_Releases/Population_report.sflb.ashx. Environment, and environmental philosophers are calling for a new ethic of \u201ccaring for creation.\u201d Higher education is involved in transforming society as well. The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) promotes sustainability and its teaching in thousands of institutions. The movement toward sustainability is growing as people, businesses, and governments slowly but surely begin to change direction. Some examples include: wind energy is the fastest-growing source of electricity; cap-and-trade markets are being established to curb carbon emissions; car-sharing companies are springing up in our cities; chemists have embraced the initiatives of \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d; and microfinance is opening up opportunities for small-scale businesses, thereby helping very poor people. In addition, \u201cgreen investments\u201d are attracting increasing capital, and the nations of the world are working on agreements to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. These developments show that people\u2019s behavior toward the environment can be transformed from exploitation to conservation.

Economics, Politics, and Public Policy By all measures, China has become the economic giant of the early 21st century. Take your pick: umbrellas, toys, shoes, appliances, electronics, souvenirs, clothes\u2014chances are that they were made in China. In 2012, the Chinese economy was growing at 7.8 percent, which represented a slowing from the massive growth from the late 1970s to the early 2000s, when it averaged 10% per year. In contrast, the U.S. economy grew only 2.5% in 2012 and averaged only about 3% per year in the latter decades of the 20th century. A new Chinese middle class numbers between 100 million and 150 million. Middle-class Chinese citizens commonly own a car and an apartment and have opportunities to travel and purchase pricey consumer goods. With a population of 1.35 billion, China has a huge pool of labor. Each year millions of rural Chinese move to urban centers, attracted by jobs created by factories that spring up almost overnight. Chinese schools have created a workforce with a literacy rate that is over 95%. These changes have not come without stress. Traditions are being overthrown by the Internet, by the fierce drive to learn English, and by the social mobility that accompanies the economic boom. Toxic Air. There are clear signs that China\u2019s race to achieve economic superpower status carries with it some costs that go well beyond a stretching of the social fabric. Several Chinese cities are among the most polluted cities in the world. The air is loaded with sulfur and nitrogen oxides and particulates from burning fuels, especially coal. In the last 10 years, the number of lung cancer patients has increased by 60%, although smoking rates have not increased. According to one estimate, 750,000 premature deaths occur annually because of air pollution.

Chinese citizens walk through heavy smog in Harbin, northeast China\u2019s Heilongjiang province, in October 2013. The city of Harbin, known for its winter festival, is an example of the complexity of modernization. A city of 10 million, Harbin is located in China\u2019s northeast Heilongjiang province. In October 2013, Harbin had an extended period when air pollution levels were so severe that residents could not see 10 meters (33 ft.) in front of themselves. A lack of wind, the burning of stubble in farm fields, and the burning of coal contributed to the crisis, which resulted in officials closing schools, the airport, and other city functions. Air quality index readings hit 500, the maximum possible level; levels above 300 are considered dangerous to human health. Environmental Policy. The smog in Harbin is only one example of the pollution problems China faces as a result of rapid economic growth. The Chinese economy has flourished in large degree because of the decentralization of power in the 1980s, when local governments and private industries were encouraged to develop their resources relatively free of the restraints of central planning. The booming economy has also put greater power in the hands of the local governments and industries and has enabled them to flout existing environmental laws and policies. China has a Ministry of Environmental 2.1 Economics and the Environment Economics is the social science that deals with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services and with the theory and management of economies or economic systems. Because economic goods and services are usually connected to\u2014and indeed dependent on\u2014environmental goods and services, economics needs to be grounded in an understanding of the biological and physical world. Simply put, no environmental goods and services, no economy. Relationships Between Economic Development and the Environment An economy is the system of exchanges of goods and services worked out by the members of a society. Goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed as people make economic decisions about what they need and want and what they will do to become players in the system\u2014what they might provide that others would need and want. As societies develop, economic activity assumes increasingly broader dimensions, with increasingly pervasive impacts on the whole society and the environment. For example, in future chapters we will see numerous instances in which pollution from economic activity has damaged the environment and human health. Furthermore, an unregulated economy can make intolerable inroads into natural resources. These changes result from development that is unsustainable. Fortunately, economic activity in a nation can also provide the resources needed to solve the problems that economic activity creates. A strong relationship exists between Protection, similar to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but the country is so large that the ministry has been unable to keep up with the need for enforcement of its environmental regulations. Recently, the Chinese government has been turning to international nongovernmental organi zations (NGOs) and has encouraged concerned citizens to form home-grown NGOs that focus attention on pollution and other environmental issues. Bottom Line. China\u2019s example demonstrates that economic growth can lift millions out of poverty and establish a country\u2019s strong place in the world market. But when this growth is at the cost of natural resources and the health of many of its people, it is clearly unsustainable. China is now in the process of developing smart growth that is less environmentally damaging. A s a new study suggests, sustainable growth will be better for the economy. The Chinese example shows that economic growth should be accompanied by the development and enforcement of just and effective environmental public policies. In this chapter, we look first at economics and its connections to the natural environment. the level of development of a nation and the effectiveness of its environmental public policies. Figure 2\u20131 shows three patterns that describe relationships between various environmental problems and per capita (per individual in the population) income levels. The key to solving problems brought on by economic activity is the development of effective public policies and institutions. To understand these relationships better, let us look at how economic systems work.", "Economic Systems Economic systems are social and legal arrangements that people construct in order to satisfy their needs and wants and to improve their well-being. Economic systems range from communal barter systems to the current global economy, which is so complex that it defies description. In any kind of economy, there are basic components that determine the economic flow 2.1 Economics and the Environment 25 Intensity of Environmental Problem of goods and services. Classical economic theory considers land (natural resources), labor, and capital to be the three elements that constitute the \u201cfactors of production.\u201d Economic activity involves the circular flow of money and products, as shown in Figure 2\u20132. Money flows from households to businesses as people pay for goods and services, and from businesses to households as people are paid for their labor. Labor, land, and capital are invested in the production of goods and services by businesses, and the products provided by businesses are consumed, or used, by households. Two Economic Systems. In the organized societies of today\u2019s world, two broad kinds of economic systems have emerged: centrally planned economies, characteristic of dictatorships, and free-market (or capitalist) economies, characteristic of democracies. The cycles shown in Figure 2\u20132 apply to both kinds of economic systems; the two systems differ mostly in how economic decisions are made. Economies and the policies that drive them determine many of the effects of human activity on environmental systems, in somewhat different ways. Figure 2\u20132 Classical view of economic activity. Land (natural resources), labor, and capital are the three elements constituting the \u201cfactors of production\u201d (bottom green arrow). Economic activity involves the circular flow of money (blue arrows) and products (top green arrow). CONSUMPTION Households Businesses PRODUCTION Labor Capital Land In a centrally planned economy, the rulers make the basic decisions regarding what and how much will be produced, where, and by whom. The government owns or manages most industries, and the workers often lack the freedom to choose or change jobs. This system was most prominent during the 20th century in the communist regimes of the Soviet Union and its satellites and in mainland China and several Asian countries. Government control of economic activity has largely failed, both economically and environmentally. The failure of the centrally planned economy in the former Soviet Union led to economic chaos in the countries that it once comprised or dominated; the countries of the former Soviet Union are some of the most polluted on Earth. China also has many pollution problems. North Korea, Cuba, and a few African countries are the last to retain centrally planned economies. In fact, Cuba has some of the world\u2019s most exten sive support of urban agriculture (Chapter 12). In a pure free-market economy, the market itself determines what will be exchanged. Goods and services are offered in a market that is free from government interference. The whole system is in private hands and is driven by the desire of people and businesses to acquire goods, services, and wealth as they act in their self-interest. The system is completely open to competition and the interplay of supply and demand. If supply is limited relative to demand, prices rise. If there is an oversupply, prices fall because people and corporations economize and pay the lowest price possible. Competition spurs efficiency as inferior products and services are forced out of the market. In an ideal world, all \u201cplayers\u201d have free access to the market. People can make informed decisions about their purchases because there is sufficient information about the benefits and harms associated with economic goods. However, these theoretical conditions of a free-market economy rarely, if ever, occur. For example, powerful business interests may manipulate facets of a market economy, and unscrupulous people may exploit the freedom of the market in order to defraud people. The Role of Governments. In reality, no country has a pure form of either kind of economy. Recently, a hybrid economic system has emerged, called state capitalism, most fully developed in China, Russia, and the Gulf oil states. These countries, rich in natural resources or in abundant labor (China), have used their exports to amass capital, which they have used to build up the country\u2019s infrastructure and to form state-owned corporations. Although major players in the global economy, these are countries where democracy is restricted.", "As they develop, their people are increasingly joining a global middle class and the tensions between state control of the economy and political freedom are becoming evident (as in the 2011 \u201cArab spring\u201d upheaval in the Middle East, which triggered ongoing conflicts in several countries, including Syria). Even in democracies with market economies, government involvement occurs at many levels. Governments can, for example, own and operate different facets of the country\u2019s infrastructure, such as postal services, power plants, and public transport systems. Governments may control interest rates, determine the amount of money in circulation, and adopt policies that stimulate economic growth in times of slowdown. Governments also maintain surveillance over financial processes. Limits to the Free Market? Many people believe that the conventional capitalist economic system lacks a \u201cconscience.\u201d They argue that many workings of the market economy create hardships for people (and countries) at the bottom of the economic ladder. For example, if population growth is rapid and there are not enough jobs to go around, the result often is exploitation of workers. Furthermore, a market economy only offers people access to goods and services; if people lack the means to pay, access alone will not meet their needs. In this situation, a society could employ a \u201csafety net\u201d to provide food security for impoverished people\u2014something the market does not do (see Chapter 12). One of the chief problems with the free market is the pressure to externalize costs, that is, to put part of the cost of producing a good or service someplace else in the economy, rather than in the price of the good or service itself. (We will discuss this problem further in Section 2.2.) International Economies and Trade Trade is a fundamental economic activity. The exchange of goods drives the engine of the free-market economy. In today\u2019s world, trade has become increasingly globalized; in the process, world trade has become one of the most dominant forces in society. On the global level, there are a number of organizations that work to foster cooperation in economic activity and development. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was created to enforce trade rules between nations, although such an outcome is hard to guarantee. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an organization of 188 countries supporting cooperation, financial stability, and trade, as well as working to promote employment and lower poverty. The World Bank is a group of agencies with the goal of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity by improving the incomes of the bottom earners in each country. The World Bank in particular plays a role in development for the poorest countries (Chapter 9) . People disagree about whether these organizations are effective, and in some cases, just. Governments can find ways to manipulate the market in their own favor, imposing protective barriers and subsidies that prevent the free flow of goods and services. The developed nations are major exporters of agricultural products, and they subsidize their farmers heavily; the developing nations want to protect their farmers from competition with these low-priced farm products, so they impose tariffs. The WTO is supposed to solve some of this problem. The WTO was created in 1993 by trade ministers from many countries meeting to build on the foundation for global trade laid by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In effect, the WTO became a force for the globalization of trade, facilitating it by encouraging the reduction or elimination of trade barriers (tariffs) between countries and of subsidies to domestic industries that tended to discriminate against foreign-produced goods. Unfortunately, the WTO has established a reputation for elevating free trade over concerns about human rights and environmental resources. In Seattle, Washington, in December 1999, more than 40,000 protesters took to the streets to block the delegates from assembling\u2014and were subjected to tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets as things began to turn ugly (Figure 2\u20133) . The protesters were an unusual alliance of environmental activists and organized labor, groups that are often at odds over timber harvests and fishing. They joined forces to protest what they saw as unfair disadvantages to the poorest countries. Talks at the 1999 WTO meetings in Seattle eventually broke down because the key players\u2014the United States, Japan, and Europe\u2014refused to move from their positions. Subsequent WTO meetings have failed to reach agreement on the issues of farming subsidies and trade barriers. Recently, there have been small steps forward.", "During a 2013 meeting in Bali, Indonesia, progress was made as WTO members adopted the \u201cBali Package,\u201d an agreement with components designed to facilitate trade, cut port delays, and improve development. There was some commitment to reducing subsidies for agricultural exports, although it remains to be seen how that will play out over time. The Need for a Sustainable Economy The recent economic growth of China illustrates the power of the global economy in mobilizing people to engage in economic activity. As a result, the well-being of many people around the globe has increased; life expectancy has never been higher; labor-saving devices remove much of the toil in wealthy countries; and aircraft, cars, computers, and cell phones open up lifestyles and work opportunities unimaginable a few decades ago. However, the global economy has also helped to 2.2 Resources in a Sustainable Economy 27 create environmental problems that harm human well-being. For example, according to a recent study, the recent decline in fish stocks in much of Asia has made it harder and harder to catch fish, so more labor is needed. This need for more labor has led to an increase in the use of child slavery in fisheries. The continued poverty and hunger in developing countries, decline of ecosystem goods and services, rising global temperatures and sea levels, and loss of biodiversity result, in part, from an unsustainable economy. In contrast to what can be called the brown economy\u2014all the current economic activities that are contributing to environmental degradation and resource depletion\u2014there is a clear need for a different kind of economy, a sustainable green economy. CONCEPT CHECK A country has national energy companies and nationally owned industries such as steel and various manufacturing sectors, but does not have workers\u2019 rights or competition for goods and services. What term best describes this type of economy? \u2610\u2713 2.2 Resources in a Sustainable Economy There is a movement afoot to change the way we look at economies. Classical economics says that land (which represents the environment), labor, and capital are the components needed for a country to be able to mount its economy. In recent years, however, a new breed of economists, often called ecological economists, has taken issue with this view. Ecological economists point out that the clas sical view (Figure 2\u20132) sees the environment as just one set of resources within the larger sphere of the human economy. They argue that the classical approach looks at things backward, because the natural environment actually encompasses Figure 2\u20133 Protestors at the WTO meeting. The World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, Washington, in 1999, drew thousands of protestors who highlighted the problems globalization can cause. Some protestors were repelled by police using tear gas and water cannons. the economy, which is constrained by the limits of resources in the environment. The ecosystems and natural resources found in a given country provide the context for that country\u2019s economy. Similarly, the total global ecosphere is the context for the global economy ( Figure 2\u20134) . Ecological economists describe economic production as the process of converting the natural world to the manufactured world. Renewable and nonrenewable resources and the ecosystems containing them are turned into cars, toys, books, food, buildings, highways, computers, and so forth. Wastes are returned to the ecosystem. 1 The ecological economists\u2019 view emphasizes the role of natural ecosystems as essential life-support elements\u2014 ecosystem capital (Chapter 1) . The more inclusive term natural capital refers to the combination of ecosystem capital and nonrenewable mineral resources, such as fossil fuels and metal ores. Ecological economics brings sustainability 1Thomas Prugh, Robert Costanza, and Herman E. Daly, The Local Politics of Global Sustainability (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2000). sharply into focus. In time, economic production and consumption must come to a steady state; to be sustainable, this must happen before our natural capital is consumed beyond its ability to support our economy. Without a doubt, the ecosystems and mineral resources of a given country\u2014its natural capital\u2014are a major element in the wealth of that country. In recent years, the World Bank\u2019s Environment Department has been working on ways of measuring the wealth of nations and has produced some insightful analyses, which we consider next. Measuring the Wealth of Nations What are the components of a nation\u2019s wealth? In a document titled Where Is the Wealth of Nations?", "Measuring Capital for the 21st Century, the World Bank indicates three major components of capital that determine a nation\u2019s wealth: produced capital, natural capital, and intangible capital (Figure 2\u20135) . 2 2World Bank, Where Is the Wealth of Nations? Measuring Capital for the 21st Century. (Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 2006). Sun ecycling Figure 2\u20134 Ecological economists\u2019 view of economic activity. The human economy is embedded in the natural world. Energy flows through the system, arriving from the Sun and leaving in the form of heat. Other ecosystem goods and services are used by the human economy, and materials are recycled. 2.2 Resources in a Sustainable Economy 29 (a) Produced capital (b) Natural capital (c) Intangible capital Figure 2\u20135 The wealth of nations. Three major components of a nation\u2019s capital determine its wealth: (a) produced capital, (b) natural capital, and (c) intangible capital, which largely consists of human capital such as knowledge and institutions, represented here by students on a university campus. Produced capital. Produced capital is all of the human-made buildings and structures, machinery and equipment, vehicles and ships, highways and power lines, monetary savings and stocks, and so forth that are essential to the production of economic goods and services. Produced capital is the most easily measured of the three components of a nation\u2019s wealth. Produced capital assets have very clear income-earning potential, but they may also be subject to obsolescence and must be renewed continually. For example, a clothing factory produces a flow of goods destined for consumers, but the machinery wears out over time, and the building itself ages. Thus, we have income\u2014a flow of goods\u2014and depletion, which is referred to as capital consumption. Natural capital. Natural capital refers to the goods and services supplied by natural ecosystems (renewable) and the mineral resources (nonrenewable) in the ground. Renewable natural capital (ecosystem capital) includes forests, fisheries, agricultural soil, water resources, and the like, which can be employed in the production of a flow of goods (e.g., lumber, fish, grain). In addition to producing goods, natural capital provides a flow of ecosystem services such as the production of oxygen, the breakdown of wastes, and the regulation of cli mate (Chapters 1, 5). Renewable natural capital is subject to depletion, but it has the capacity to yield a sustained income if it is managed wisely. Nonrenewable natural capital, such as oil and mineral deposits, is also subject to depletion, but it provides no services unless it is extracted and converted into some useful form. Some components of natural capital are easier to measure than others. For instance, the lumber in a forest can be reckoned in board feet; it is more difficult to assess the impact of a forest on the local climate and the forest\u2019s capacity to sustain a high level of biodiversity. Unfortunately, the World Bank report did not assess the service components of natural capital because of difficulties in measuring them. Instead, the authors calculated mainly the actual resource inputs into production, such as mineral assets and forests as a source of timber. Intangible capital. Intangible capital has three components. The first is human capital, which refers to the population and its physical, psychological, and cultural attributes, such as innate talents, competencies, and abilities. To this is added the value imparted by formal or informal education, which enables people to acquire skills that are useful in an economy. Investments in health and nutrition also contribute to increases in human capital. The second component is social capital, the social and political environment that people create for themselves in a society. Social capital includes formal structures and relationships as defined by government, the rule of law, the court system, and civil liberties, as well as the relationships of people as they associate into religious or ethnic affiliations or join organizations in which they have a common interest. The third component is knowledge assets, the codified or written fund of knowledge that can be readily transferred to others across space and time. These assets are useful only if people have access to them; hence, the vital importance of libraries, schools, universities, and the Internet. Measuring True Economic Progress The gross national product, or GNP, is the sum of all goods and services produced (really, consumed) by a country in a given time frame. The GNP was once the most commonly used indicator of the economic health and wealth of a country. Now, however, most countries use the gross domestic product, or GDP.", "The GDP is the GNP minus net income from abroad. As a per capita (per person) index, the GDP is often used to compare rich and poor countries and to assess economic progress in developing countries. An important aspect of calculating a net GDP is accounting for the assets that are used in the production processes. Buildings and equipment, for example, are essential to production, but they gradually wear out or depreciate. Their depreciation (called capital depreciation) is charged against the value of production; that is, an accounting of capital depreciation is subtracted from the production of goods and services in order to generate a net GDP. Problems with Using the GDP. Unfortunately, the GDP measurement is flawed because it does not include goods created and services performed by a family for itself. Thus, subsistence farming in developing countries is not measured, and this omission surely produces a falsely lower GDP for these countries. The GDP also omits the natural services provided by ecosystems. For example, even though clean air is as important as medicine in treating asthma, only the medicine is included in the GDP. In addition, the economists who invented the GNP never took into account the depreciation of natural capital. Such depreciation was regarded as external to a country\u2019s balance sheet. Following the classical view of economics, natural resources and their associated natural services were regarded as a \u201cgift from nature.\u201d Therefore it is possible for a nation to cut down a million acres of forest and count the sale of the timber on the income side of the GDP ledger, while including only the depreciation of chain saws and trucks on the expense side. Completely hidden from this accounting is the loss of all the natural services once performed by the forest; incredibly, the disappearance of the million acres of forest is shown as an economic asset. As long as this discrepancy remains, it is possible for nations to underestimate the value of their natural resources. They are able to remove forests, deplete fisheries, lose soil by intensive farming, and degrade rangelands by overgrazing and still account for these activities as economic productivity. The GDP can increase due to production by industries that deplete and pollute the environment and then increase again with cleanups of that pollution\u2014a double benefit! Correcting this system of accounting would require calculating the current market value of natural assets and considering it to be part of the stock of a nation\u2019s wealth, as recommended by the World Bank. To this value would be added the value of the natural services performed by the ecosystems in which the resources are found (omitted by the World Bank analysis). The natural assets and the services they perform are the nation\u2019s natural capital. Other economists have produced reports that agree\u2014when the nation\u2019s natural resources are drawn down, the depreciation represented by the loss of natural capital should be entered into Figure 2\u20136 Three measures of progress. Development of GDP, ISEW, and GPI indicators in Finland in 1945\u20132010 A comparison of the GDP, GPI, and ISEW of (per capita in real prices) 35 Finland from 1945 to 2010; units are in thousands of euros per capita. The GDP (gross domestic product) is the conventional measure 30 of economic progress used by economists. The GPI (Genuine Progress Indicator) is a measure 25 of progress that includes negatives, similar to the ISEW (Index of Sustainable Economic 20 Welfare). Note how the GPI and ISEW are falling behind the GDP. 15 (Source: Redrawn from J. Hoffren, \u201cFuture Trends of Genuine Progress in Finland,\u201d Trends and Future 10 of Sustainable Development, Tampere 9-10, June 2011, http://www.docstoc.com/docs/84610133/ Energy-and-material-flows.) 5 0 the ledger as the GDP is calculated. Similar arguments can be made for human resources as a measure of a nation\u2019s wealth. A more accurate GDP would have to take all of these depreciations into account. Other Possible Indicators. If the GDP is simply unable to measure true economic progress, some other index is necessary. There are several other ways to measure development. The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) is one. This index takes into account a wide array of economic activities and their effects on human well-being, because some economic activity is negative. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a measure of economic progress that extends the idea of the ISEW.", "Like the ISEW, the GPI is calculated by assuming that some kinds of economic activity are positive and sustainable and others are not, even if the latter are included in the GDP. Some of the positive factors in the GPI\u2014such as labor that goes into housework, parenting, and volunteering\u2014are not calculated in the GDP. Negatives in the GPI include factors such as the costs of crime, loss of leisure time, costs of pollution, depletion of nonrenewable resources, and loss of farmland. Figure 2\u20136 contrasts the ISEW and GPI of Finland with the GDP during the same period. Over the years, the per capita GPI has remained fairly constant, while the GDP has risen sharply, suggesting that the benefits of GDP growth are increasingly offset by the rising environmental and social costs of economic activity. Other economists have recommended using the Human Development Index (HDI), a somewhat simpler measure of human flourishing used by the UN. The HDI reflects health indicators, life expectancy, and literacy rates. However, one problem with both the GDP and HDI is that they do not require natural capital to be maintained, or that wealth be measured to include sustainability. Figure 2\u20137 shows the Human Development Index and per capita resource use, or ecological footprint, of different countries. Environmental scientists often refer to the amount of resources required to support a person or group of people as their footprint, an idea that we will consider in greater detail later (Chapter 8).

Note that bio-capacity declined between 1961 and 2009, making the \u201csafe space\u201d for humanity smaller. The idea of a safe space for humanity is discussed elsewhere (Chapter 3). Environmental Accounting. Environmental economists have concluded that valuation of ecosystem services is critical. In 2007, environment ministers from the leading global economies, coordinated by the UN Environment Program (UNEP), initiated a study intended to show how to apply economic thinking to the ecosystem services that are so beneficial to societies. That study, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), has produced seven reports, culminating in a 2010 final report that shows \u201chow economic concepts and tools can help equip society with the means to incorporate the values of nature into decision making at all levels,\u201d to quote from the preface. 3 Such environmental accounting requires the accurate valuation of ecosystem services and the inclusion of their depreciation in economic models. For example, ARIES (Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services) is a Web-based technology that allows users to rapidly assess and evaluate ecosystem services in order to make better environmental decisions or track the value of ecosystem goods and services. ARIES is funded by the National Science Foundation through researchers at the University of Vermont, Conservation International, and Earth Economics. This technology has helped groups in locations from Puget Sound to Madagascar. The use of economics to conserve resources we once took for granted will only increase in the future. A 2014 study estimated that ecosystems services contribute \u201cmore than twice as much to human well-being as global GDP.\u201d They estimated the annual global loss of ecosystem services due to changes in land use at $4.3\u201320.2 trillion. 4 Essential Conditions for Development. There are many reasons why some countries have undergone rapid development and others have not; population growth is one that is cited in this text (Chapter 9). Perhaps the most important reasons relate to the major institutions that coordinate social and political life and that make up the social capital 3TEEB, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity: Mainstreaming the Economics of Nature:", "A Synthesis of the Approach, Conclusions and 4R. Costanza et al., \u201cChanges in the Global Value of Ecosystem Services,\u201d Global Recommendations of TEEB, 2010. Environmental Change 26 (2014): 152\u2013158. of a society. For example, the definition of rights, the enforcement of those rights, and the facilitation of economic exchange are all considered essential to the successful development of human capital and produced capital. A well-developed body of law, an honest legal system, broad civic participation, and a free press are essential for maintaining the rights of all people within a society. A well-developed market economy and free entry into and exit from markets for people and businesses are conducive to development. Functioning communication and transportation networks and viable financial markets are also needed to sustain a market economy. In societies where such resources are not in place, corruption, inefficiency, injustice, and intolerance often prevail. Continuing poverty and environmental degradation are the predictable outcomes. For example, one of the major components of intangible capital as measured by the World Bank is the \u201crule of law index.\u201d Denmark scores an 88 out of 100 on this index, while Pakistan, with its corruption and human rights abuses, scores 36. CONCEPT CHECK How might an economist include the cost of the over-use of water in the price of a water-intensive product such as cotton? What are the downsides to this economic approach? \u2610\u2713 2.3 Economy, Environment, and Ethics To achieve long-term sustainability, we will need to live within boundaries in which people have sufficient human development, and populations and per capita resource use are low enough to maintain global ecosystem capital. There are a number of reasons why this is hard to accomplish. In addition to resource limitations, inequality in access to resources makes environmental sustainability difficult to achieve. None of the resources that are crucial to an economy are evenly distributed among nations or within nations. Great differences in wealth exist among the nations of the world, something we will see many times in other chapters. Any economy comes with ethical dilemmas, some due to these differences in wealth and opportunity, and some because what benefits one person economically may harm another, as we have seen already in several cases. In order to live sustainably, we need to address these ethical concerns. Human Rights and Resources Simply having natural capital and being able to transform it into produced capital does not guarantee human development for everyone in a society. For example, Guatemala has a great deal of natural capital, including highly productive agricultural land and the largest contiguous forest in the Americas, except for the Amazon. Yet Guatemala has the fourth highest level of chronic malnutrition in the world; the indigenous Mayan peoples have even higher rates of malnutrition. Causes of malnutrition include poverty and diets low in fresh foods with protein and vitamins. This chronic malnutrition hurts the poor and costs the Guatemalan economy an estimated $8.4 million per day in lost wages, illness, loss of schooling, and other costs to society. Sometimes urban leaders who make decisions do not understand the lives of those in rural poverty and consequently don\u2019t make policies to address real problems. Part of the issue, however, is that Guatemala\u2019s economy is focused on export crops. Many people work for others, growing crops that they cannot afford to eat. In some cases, the best land is used to grow cash crops and only the poorest land is used to grow the maize that is eaten by local families. While the free market has given many people a way to make a living, not everyone has the means to be a part of that market. The operation of the market does not reflect the needs of those who lack money. Often, it isn\u2019t simply that people cannot purchase what they need, but that their livelihoods are removed by the economic activities of others. When economic activities use up scarce resources or disperse pollution through the environment, the people most benefit-ting from these economic activities are rarely the ones who suffer the most from their effects. This is particularly true when indigenous peoples interact with the outside world. This inequity is a central ethical dilemma we will see in many later chapters. Thus an interest in human rights means an interest in the economic and political rights of the poor, including indigenous groups. These concerns overlap substantially with concern about environmental sustainability. Intergenerational Equity", "What we have just discussed is a matter of intra-generational equity\u2014the \u201cgolden rule\u201d of making possible for others what is possible for you. All forms of current assets need to be managed well to improve the well-being of people who already exist. Sustainable development is also about intergenerational equity\u2014meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Economists point to some problems with this perspective, however. Economics deals with future resources by applying what is called the discount rate, the rate used for finding the present value of some future benefit or cost. The discount rate often approximates current interest rates. For example, a dollar is worth more to us today than it will be five years from now, even without inflation, because we can put the dollar to use now and can earn interest on that dollar if we invest it. At a 5% rate of interest, in five years our dollar would be worth $1.28. Turning this idea around, a dollar five years from now is worth only $0.78 today. Following this reasoning, it can be concluded that some resources or benefits are worth more now than they will be in the future. This concept can be applied to a stand of trees. The owner has several options: (1) cut all the trees and sell the timber today; (2) hold onto the trees in the hope that they will bring a better price at some time in the future; or (3) harvest the trees on a sustainable basis, spreading out profits over time. If it turns out that the trees grow more slowly than current interest rates, the economically profitable decision would be to cut them now and invest the proceeds. Thus using the discount rate can be a problem for natural capital, because in many cases it would appear to argue for 2.4 Environmental Public Policy 33 maximizing short-term profit over sustainable, long-term use of the resource. For example, if we let future generations cope with global climate change, we can continue to enjoy the present benefits of the unrestrained use of fossil fuels. The same can be said about other resources, such as swordfish: We can harvest them now, and when they\u2019re gone, we can switch to some other species of fish. Unfortunately, the self-interest of present individuals and generations is often at odds with the longer-term sustainable interests of a community or a society. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the interests of the wealthy today are often considered to trump the interests of the poor, either now or in the future. To make things a bit more challenging, some have argued that conserving resources for the future could actually be thought of as putting the interests of future generations above those of the poor today. In answer, it can be said that both sets of interests are legitimate. Waste Wealth is often accompanied by waste. The way economies work for most goods and services, if a consumer can pay for a product, he or she is free to use it or even to waste it. There is no law against purchasing a shirt and throwing it away after wearing it only once, or taking a huge plate of food from a buffet and then throwing most of it away. However, when something is both necessary and scarce, societies may move to a different way of operating. Food rationing during wartime and bans on outdoor water use during a drought are examples. According to some estimates, about 40% of the food produced in the United States is discarded as waste; this waste occurs in all parts of food production, from spoilage in agricultural fields to food that is discarded after preparation (Figure 2\u20138) . Laws designed to protect public health have unexpected consequences: expiration dates on food and laws requiring restaurants to throw out food once it has been served (even if it has not been touched) increase the level of food waste. The production of food requires a great deal of water and energy (Chapter 12 ). While it might be impossible to ship your half-eaten sandwich to someone who is hungry, wasting less food generally brings down food prices and reduces the amount of land, water, and energy used in food production. The United Nations has identified food waste as a problem whose solution is critical to alleviating poverty. Many people are working on solutions.", "The City of London, for example, started an innovative program to help reduce food waste in restaurants. Participating restaurants offered special portion sizes, revised the way they served side dishes, and used left-over inventory to make soups. The pilot program helped 15 small businesses save \u00a3100,000 ($170,000) and eliminated 1.75 tons of food waste. This was accomplished without passing new laws, because reducing waste was both smart and financially sound. However, sometimes we need environmental public policy, which makes possible both the present and future well-being for human societies. CONCEPT CHECK Guatemala has high levels of malnutrition, even though the country has an abundant supply of natural resources. What are two reasons for this situation? \u2610\u2713 Figure 2\u20138 Food Waste. A s much as 40% of the food in the United States is discarded as waste. The United Nations estimates that the global cost of food waste is $750 billion per year. 2.4 Environmental Public Policy Environmental public policy includes all of a society\u2019s laws and agency-enforced regulations that deal with that society\u2019s interactions with the environment. Public policies are developed at all levels of government: local, state, federal, and international. The purpose of environmental public policy is to promote the common good. Just what the common good consists of may be a matter of debate, but at least two goals stand out: the improvement of human welfare and the protection of the natural world. Environmental public policy addresses two sets of environmental issues: (1) the prevention or reduction of air, water, and land pollution and (2) the use of natural resources such as forests, fisheries, oil, and land. All public policy is developed in a sociopolitical context that we will simply call politics. Human societies and their economic activities have the potential for doing great damage to the environment, and that damage has a direct impact on present and future human welfare (see Table 2\u20131 on the following page.). The effects of pollution and the misuse of resources are seen most clearly in those parts of the world where environmental public policy is not well established. As Table 2\u20131 shows, millions of deaths and widespread disease are directly traceable to degraded environments. The costs to human welfare are felt in the areas of health, economic productivity, and the ongoing ability of the natural environment to support human life. Therefore, laws to protect the environment are not luxuries; they are part of the foundation of any well-organized human society and essential for achieving sustainability. Policy in the United States The U.S. Constitution is widely regarded as responsible for establishing a very effective form of government. The conveners of the Constitution decided on three branches of government, all of which play a role in establishing and enforcing environmental public policy (Figure 2\u20139 ). The legislative branch, or the Congress, consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. All of these legislators are elected by the people from the 50 states. The Congress has the power to establish laws, which must pass both houses of the legislature and then go to the executive branch of the government for approval by the president. A host of administrative agencies report to the president. We will encounter many of these agencies as we examine different environmental problems. The judicial branch of government is responsible for interpreting the law, from the Constitution and its amendments to the many pieces of legislation passed by the Congress. Rules and Regulations. Environmental public-policy law is the responsibility of the Congress. Once a piece of legislation is passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate and is signed into law by the president, it is implemented by the appropriate government agencies. The EPA and most other federal agencies are required to develop rules and regulations for issues only broadly covered in the laws; it is these rules that put the bite in the laws passed by Congress. In making rules, agencies are required to solicit public comments, evaluate the comments, and adjust the rules, depending on the validity of the comments. Finally, agencies publish their new rules in the Federal Register for all interested parties to see. One final role of the Congress is to pass appropriations for the various programs that have already been authorized by law. The executive branch (the president) draws up a budget asking for appropriations for all of the government agencies and programs, and the Congress decides how much of what the president asks for will actually get funded.", "Thus, the two times the Congress can influence a given issue are when it is formulated into law and when it receives appropriations. Appropriations must be authorized every year, and new laws can always amend or abolish existing laws, so there are many opportunities for the political system to influence environmental public policy. 2.4 Environmental Public Policy 35 Capitol Building White House Supreme Court Building Legislative Congress House of Representatives Executive President Vice President Cabinet Administrative Agencies Judicial Supreme Court Federal Courts Circuit and District Courts Senate Figure 2\u20139 The three branches of the United States government. The legislative, executive, and judicial branches provide a balance of power as laws are enacted, administered, and sometimes reviewed. State and Local Levels. Policies to solve local and regional problems are developed at the state and community levels. States replicate much of the structure of the federal government, with legislatures, governors, a judiciary, and various agencies. Cities and towns employ conservation commissions, planning boards, health boards, water and sewer commissions, and the like. Cities and towns often establish zoning regulations to protect citizens from haphazard and incompatible land uses. Some municipalities and regions go further and establish broader policies, such as \u201csmart growth\u201d to address the problems of urban sprawl. Indeed, states and municipalities frequently initiate experiments in environmental public policy that lead the way to changes in national policy. California, for example, has passed a number of regulations that tackle environmental issues, such as banning incandescent bulbs and plastic single-use bags; it was also a pioneer in promoting auto emissions standards and efficiency standards for appliances (see California\u2019s Green Economy, p. 39). Policy Options: Market or Regulatory? The objective of environmental public policy is to change the behavior of polluters or resource-users so as to benefit public welfare and the environment. This is usually accomplished by using either a direct regulatory approach, also called a command-and-control strategy, or a market-based approach to set prices on pollution and the use of resources. Many policies include elements of each. Regulatory Policies. Most of the laws that give the U.S. Envi ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) its authority prescribe command-and-control solutions. These laws direct the EPA to regulate pollution problems, often specifying many of the details to be used. For example, legislators may choose to set standards on pollutants that protect the health of the most vulnerable members of the population. This is the case with the basic criteria covering air pollutants (see Chapter 19). To meet these standards, regulations are established, and polluters are required by law to comply with the regulations. One of the shortcomings of the regulatory approach is that if a polluter is told to use a particular technology or is given a cap on emissions, there is no incentive for the polluter to invest in technologies that would keep pollution at lower levels. A better approach might be to set a standard (for water quality, for example) and let the polluter decide how best to achieve the standard; another approach would be to provide incentives for investments that reduce pollu tion (Chapter 22). Market-Based Policies. In contrast, market-based policies have the virtues of simplicity, efficiency, and, in theory, equity. All polluters are treated equally and may choose their responses on the basis of economic principles having to do with profitability. With a market-based approach, there are strong incentives to reduce the costs of using resources or of generating pollution. The cap-and-trade system for SO2 emissions under the Clean Air Act of 1990 is a good example of the market approach to pollution control (see Chapter 19). User fees (pay as you throw) for the disposal of municipal solid waste are another (Chapter 21) . A new market-based initiative for conserving the services provided by ecosystems is payments for ecosystem services (PES). Forest, farm, and wetlands owners hold properties that provide valuable services to societies, such as sequestering carbon, preserving biodiversity, and preventing soil erosion. Yet landowners are seldom compensated for these services. A PES program uses some form of environmental accounting, and those who benefit from the service pay the landowner to maintain the service and not convert the land to some environmentally undesirable use. Often the government does the paying on behalf of the society, as in the Conservation Reserve Program, where farmers are paid to protect the open space and wetlands they own (Chapter 11). Whether regulation-based or market-based, public policy does not appear out of nowhere. We will now examine how public policy is developed.", "CONCEPT CHECK Some parts of the Clean Air Act impose fines for emitting pollutants. Is this an example of a commandand-control or a market-based approach to regulation? \u2610\u2713 36 CHAPTER 2 Economics, Politics, and Public Policy Figure 2\u201310 The policy life cycle. Most environmen tal issues pass through a policy life cycle, and each issue is accorded a different degree of political \u201cweight\u201d as it moves through each stage of the cycle. In initial stages there is more dissention or disagreement about the reality of the problem or what society needs to do. The final result is a policy that has been incorporated into the society and a problem that is under control. The Public Policy Life Cycle When specific problems are addressed through public policy in democratic societies, the development of that policy often takes a predictable course, which we will call the policy life cycle. The typical policy life cycle has four stages: recognition, formulation, implementation, and control (Figure 2\u201310) . Each of the stages carries a certain amount of political weight, which varies over time and is represented in the figure by the course of the life-cycle line. We will use the discovery of ozone depletion in the stratosphere as a case study to illustrate the policy life cycle. Recognition Stage. In the early 1970s, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were hailed as miracle chemicals: virtually inert, nontoxic, nonflammable, noncorrosive. They were ideal aerosol propellants, were extremely useful as refrigerants, and were effective as cleaning agents for electronics. Soon they were appearing in thousands of products and applications, including telecommunications, food processing, and cosmetics. While working at the University of California at Irvine in 1972, physical chemist Sherwood Rowland and postdoctoral student Mario Molina (Figure 2\u201311) decided to investigate the question of what happens to CFCs in the atmosphere. The two scientists reasoned that CFCs would not break down unless they entered the stratosphere, where solar radiation is strong enough to break the tough molecules. They hypothesized that the breakdown of CFCs would release chlorine and that this chlorine would in turn react with ozone molecules in the strato sphere (Chapter 19). Rowland and Molina suddenly realized that the process they had uncovered had the potential to reduce the stratospheric ozone layer that blocked ultraviolet radiation from entering the lower atmosphere, where it could seriously damage biological tissues. They published their results in 1974 and began calling public attention to the dangers of CFCs. The chemical industry responded by ridiculing their work and verbally attacking the scientists wherever they spoke. 5 5Mario Molina and F. S. Rowland, \u201cStratospheric Sink for Chlorofluoromethanes: Chlorine Atom-Catalysed Destruction of Ozone,\u201d Nature 24, no. 9 (June 28, 1974): 810\u2013812. The recognition stage of public policy begins with the early perceptions of an environmental problem, often coming as a result of scientific research. Scientists then publish their findings, and the media pick up the information and popularize it. During the recognition stage, dissension is high. Opposing views on the problem surface. Eventually, the problem gets attention from some level of the government, and the possibility of addressing it with public policy is considered. Formulation Stage. In 1976 the National Academy of Sciences appointed a committee to look into the claims of Rowland and Molina. The committee issued a report that confirmed the dangers of CFCs and recommended banning the chemicals. The EPA considered the evidence and banned the use of CFCs in spray cans in 1978. CFCs continued to be used in increasing amounts, however, in other applications. Then, Figure 2\u201311 Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland. These two physical chemists discovered the threat posed by chlorofluorocarbons to the ozone layer in the stratosphere. Their work led to the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out the use of ozone-destroying chemicals around the world. They were awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work. 2.4 Environmental Public Policy 37 in 1985, a British team working in Antarctica reported a huge \u201chole\u201d in the ozone layer over that continent. Further research showed that the ozone hole was due to the high release of chlorine from CFCs and to subsequent ozone destruction. The world scientific and environmental organizations began calling for global action. This led to a meeting convened by the United Nations in Montreal, Canada, in 1987. There, member nations agreed to scale back CFC production 50% by 2000. Thus, the formulation stage is a stage of rapidly increasing political weight. The public is now aroused, and debate about policy options occurs.", "The political battles may become fierce, as questions dealing with regulation and who will pay for the proposed changes are addressed. Media coverage is high, and politicians begin to hear from their constituencies and lobbyists. During the formulation stage, policy makers consider the \u201cThree Es\u201d of environmental public policy: effectiveness (whether the policy accomplishes what it intends to do in improving the environment), efficiency (whether the policy accomplishes its objectives at the least possible cost), and equity (whether the policy parcels out the financial burdens fairly among the different parties involved). Implementation Stage. The ozone hole continued to grow, however, so the signers of the Montreal Protocol agreed to speed up the phase-out of CFCs, moving the date for completion to 1996. The major chemical companies were already developing more benign substitutes for CFCs. Several other chemicals with ozone-destroying potential were added to CFCs as substances to be regulated. At this point, the policy had reached the implementation stage. In this stage, policy has been determined, and the focal point moves to regulatory agencies. By now, the issue is not very interesting to the media, and the emphasis shifts to the development of specific regulations and their enforcement. Industry learns how to comply with the new regulations. Control Stage. The final stage in the policy life cycle is the control stage. Today CFCs are no longer being manufactured and released into the atmosphere. Substitutes for them are readily available. The size of the ozone hole has stopped increasing, and the amount of CFCs in the stratosphere is starting to decline. The Montreal Protocol stands as a remarkable achievement of international diplomacy and concord. Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1995 for their discovery. By this point, years have passed since the early days of the recognition stage. Problems are rarely completely resolved, but the environment is improving, with things moving in the right direction. Policies (and their derived regulations) are broadly supported and often become embedded in the society. At any one time, different problems will be in different stages of the life cycle. Figure 2\u201312 shows the life-cycle stages of a number of environmental problems in the industrialized countries. Because new public policies can be costly, countries in different stages of economic development will be in different stages of the policy life cycle for a given problem. Economic Effects of Environmental Public Policy Most environmental policies impose significant economic costs that must be paid by some segment of society. For instance, we establish policies that control pollution because their benefits are judged to outweigh their costs\u2014that is, the public welfare is improved, and the environment is protected. Who pays the costs? The equity principle implies that those benefiting from the policies\u2014the customers of businesses whose activities are regulated and the people whose health is protected by laws against polluting\u2014should pay, through taxes or higher charges; such costs are passed along to consumers, who are purchasing the product or service at its true cost (or closer to true). On the other hand, some policies have relatively little or no direct monetary cost\u2014they do not require major investments of administration or resources. For example, removing subsidies to special interests and denying special access to national resources saves money. It can result in a more efficient and equitable operation of the economy and can protect the environment. Figure 2\u201312 Environmental problems in the 1. Recognition 3. Implementation policy life cycle. Different environmental problems are in different stages of the policy life cycle in industrial societies. In the United States, the fees charged for using federal lands are often significantly less than the fees charged by private landowners. This amounts to a subsidy for grazing cattle or harvesting timber on federal lands (Figure 2\u201313a) . The real costs\u2014and environmental consequences\u2014of the products are not paid by the producers or the people buying the products. Instead, they are paid by all taxpayers and by future generations. One example of a person benefiting from a shared resource without paying the cost is rancher Cliven Bundy (Figure 2\u201313b) , who has had a 20-year dispute with the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in southeastern Nevada because he refuses to pay fees for grazing his cattle on federal lands. Bundy was in the news in 2014 over a standoff with federal agents attempting to remove his cattle. Impact on the Economy.", "People who oppose environmental regulation have argued that environmental policies are excessive and bad for the economy\u2014that our concern for environmental protection costs hundreds of thousands of jobs, reduces our competitiveness in the marketplace, or drives up the price of products and services. In recent years, these concerns have been investigated by many economists, and the general findings of their studies indicate that the \u201cenvironment versus economy\u201d trade-off is a myth. Even without considering the environmental benefits, economists found that environmental protection has no significant adverse effect on the economy; in fact, it has a pronounced positive effect. Here are some examples of what these studies have revealed. Environmental Protection and Jobs. Environmental protection is a huge industry. We need people to monitor soil and water quality, remove leaky underground oil tanks, protect wildlife habitat, and make sure cars produce fewer emissions. We need technologies to help us perform these tasks, and those technologies need to be invented and produced. The United States is the largest single producer of environmental technologies, accounting for 40% of the world\u2019s total market (about $782 billion); this industry provides 1.7 million workers with jobs in 117,000 U.S. enterprises. Worldwide, environmental technology is even larger. On the whole, environmental public policy does not diminish the wealth of a nation; rather, it transfers wealth from polluters to pollution controllers and to less polluting companies. The environmental protection industry is a major job-creating, profit-making, sales-generating industry. We can only conclude that the argument that environmental protection is bad for the economy is simply unsound. Not only is environmental protection good for the economy, but environmental public policy is responsible for a safer, healthier, and more enjoyable environment. How does the degree of dissension about an issue change during the public policy life cycle? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 (b) (a) Figure 2\u201313 Subsidized access to pubic resources.

Both foresters and ranchers pay only a fraction of the market value of the resource they use. 2.5 Cost-Benefit Analysis of Environmental Public Policy 39 SUSTAINABILITY 2.5 Cost-Benefit Analysis of Environmental Public Policy Economics plays a strong role in the development of public policy. Those developing policies need to assess the potential benefits of laws and regulations and weigh them against the costs of their implementation. One of the key tools employed in this process is the cost-benefit analysis. In this section, we\u2019ll look at the details of cost-benefit analysis. In doing so, we will address the question of how to measure the cost-effectiveness of regulating pollution. The president of the United States has the power to issue executive orders, which are usually directives to government agencies or departments designed to accomplish a presidential initiative. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan, concerned that the U.S. economy and business interests might be over-regulated, issued Executive Order 12291. This order required that all significant regulations (those that impose annual costs of at least $100 million) be supported by a cost-benefit analysis. Subsequent presidents, including President Obama, have issued similar executive orders that basically continue most of the policies of Reagan\u2019s order. A cost-benefit analysis (or benefit-cost analysis) begins by examining the need for the proposed regulation and then describes a range of alternative approaches. Afterward, it compares the estimated costs of the proposed action and the main alternatives to the benefits that will be achieved. All costs and benefits are given monetary values (where possible) and compared by means of a cost-benefit (or benefit-cost) ratio. A favorable ratio for an action means that the benefits outweigh the costs, and the action is said to be cost effective. There is an economic justification for proceeding with it. If costs are projected to outweigh benefits, the project may be revised, dropped, or shelved for later consideration. Cost-benefit analysis of environmental regulations is intended to build efficiency into policy so that society does not have to pay more than is necessary for a given level of environmental quality. If the analysis is done properly, it will consider all of the costs and benefits associated with a regulatory option. In so doing, it must address the problem of external costs. External Costs In economics, an external cost (or externality) is an effect of a business process that is not included in the usual calculations of profit and loss.", "For example, when a business pollutes the air or water, the pollution imposes a cost on society in the form of poor health or the need to treat water before using it. This is an external bad. When workers improve their job performance as a result of experience and learning, the improvement is not credited in the company\u2019s ledgers, although it is considered an external good. Amenities such as clean air, uncontaminated groundwater, and a healthy ozone layer are not privately owned. In the absence of regulatory controls, there are no direct costs to a business for degrading these amenities. In other words, they are external costs. Therefore, there are no economic incentives to refrain from polluting the air or water. By including all of the costs and benefits of a project or a regulation, cost-benefit analysis effectively brings the externalities into the economic accounting. Sometimes it is difficult to figure out where to put the cost of an externality. For example, international trade is important in improving the economy throughout the world. Yet the process of shipping goods is the biggest cause of the spread of invasive species, a problem that costs upwards of $300 billion a year in just six countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, India, and Brazil. The cost of items that are shipped long distances ought to account for the likelihood that they will bring pest species to distant areas. Environmental Regulations Impose Real Costs The costs of pollution control include the price of purchasing, installing, operating, and maintaining pollution-control equipment and the price of implementing a control strategy. Even the banning of an offensive product has costs because jobs may be lost, new products must be developed, and machinery may have to be scrapped. In some instances, a pollution-control measure may result in the discovery of a less expensive way of doing something. In most cases, however, pollution control costs money. Thus, the effect of most regulations is to prevent an external bad by imposing economic costs that are ultimately shared by government, industry, and consumers. Pollution-control costs tend to increase exponentially with the level of control to be achieved (Figure 2\u201314) . That is, a partial reduction in pollution may be achieved by a few relatively inexpensive measures, but further reductions generally require increasingly expensive measures, and 100% control is likely to be impossible at any cost. Because of this exponential relationship, regulatory control often has to focus on an optimum cost-effectiveness, as Figure 2\u201314 indicates. In most cases, pollution-control technologies and strategies are understood and available. Thus, equipment, labor, and maintenance costs can be estimated fairly accurately. Unanticipated problems that increase costs may occur, but as technology advances and becomes more reliable, experience is gained, and lower-cost alternatives frequently emerge.

However, benefits to be derived from pollution pacts of pollution or is spared increasing degradation.

The optimum cost-effectiveness is expenditures in the short term (5\u201310 years) may in fact be highly cost-achieved at less than 100% control. effective expenditures in the long term. environmental regulations over time. The costs of pollution control are likely to be highest at the time they are initiated and then decrease as time passes. Policy costs are often overestimated. A look at some historical examples reveals that industry reports predict higher costs of regulations than government studies do, and surprisingly, even government analysts often overestimate the costs of regulations. For example, industry sources claimed that the costs of eliminating CFCs from automobile air conditioners would increase the price of new cars by anywhere from $650 to $1,200. In reality, the price increase turned out to be much lower\u2014from $40 to $400. One study of cost-benefit analyses revealed that overestimates of costs occurred in 12 of 14 regulations.", "The primary reason given for the overestimates is a failure to anticipate the impact of technological innovation. The costs of pollution control constitute a powerful incentive to make substitutions, to recycle materials, or to redesign industrial processes. The Benefits of Environmental Regulation The costs of improving the quality of the environment represent a major economic outlay. What benefits have we received in return? The Regulatory Right-to-Know Act directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to submit an annual report to the Congress containing, among other things, an estimate of the costs and benefits of federal rules. The 2014 study of costs and benefits during the decade from October 1, 2003, to September 30, 2012, showed that the benefits (those that could be measured in monetary units) far exceeded the costs. The benefits were estimated at between $147 billion and $800 billion, while industries, states, and municipalities spent an estimated $56 billion to $84 billion to comply with the rules. The OMB report demonstrated that the benefits of major regulations issued between 2000 and 2012 far exceeded the costs (Figure 2\u201316) . The lion\u2019s share of both the costs and the benefits for 2012 was attributed to the EPA\u2019s regulation of sulfur dioxide in the air, as mandated by the Clean Air Act. Reductions in hospital visits, lost workdays, and premature deaths were benefits associated with reductions in this air pollutant. Calculating Benefits. The benefits of regulatory policies are seldom as easy to calculate as the costs. Estimating benefits $100 $80 $60 $40 $20 $0 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Fiscal Year Billions of 2001$ 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2.5 Cost-Benefit Analysis of Environmental Public Policy 41 is often a matter of estimating the costs of poor health and damages that would have occurred if the regulations had not been imposed (Figure 2\u201315b). For example, the projected environmental damage that would have resulted from a given level of sulfur dioxide emissions from a coal-fired power plant (an external bad) becomes a benefit (an external good) when a regulatory action prevents half of those emissions. Benefits include such things as improved human health, reduced corrosion and deterioration of materials, reduced damage to natural resources, preservation of aesthetic and spiritual qualities of the environment, increased opportunities for outdoor recreation, and continued opportunities to use the environment in the future. Examples of benefits are listed in Table 2\u20132, on the following page. The values of some benefits can be estimated fairly accurately. For example, air-pollution episodes increase the number of people seeking medical attention. Because the medical attention provided has a known dollar value, eliminating a certain number of air-pollution episodes provides a health benefit of that value. Shadow Pricing. Many benefits, however, are difficult to estimate. Putting a dollar value on maintaining the integrity of a coastal wetland or the enjoyment of breathing cleaner air is hard. One way people try to do so is to find out how much people are willing to pay to maintain these benefits. Economists use the concept of shadow pricing, which involves assessing what people might pay for a particular benefit if it were up to them to decide. For example, to evaluate the costs of noise nuisance from aircraft (an external bad) in the vicinity of Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, researchers evaluated the housing prices in the vicinity of many airports around the world. They found that the closer the airport, and therefore the greater the noise, the lower the house value when compared with similar houses farther away. In this case, the benefit is seen as being free from the nuisance of low-flying aircraft, and people\u2019s willingness to pay is seen in the price of houses. Shadow pricing becomes difficult when the analysis has to place a value on human life. Most of the pollutants to which people are exposed are hazardous, exacting a toll on health and life expectancy. To estimate the benefits of regulating such pollutants, it is necessary to calculate how Figure 2\u201316 Costs and benefits of major regulations, 2000\u20132013. Clearly, the benefits of regulations far outweigh the costs of implementing the rules. Costs (Source: Office of Management and Budget, 2014 Report to Congress on the Benefits and Costs of Benefits Federal Regulations and Unfunded Mandates on State, Local and Tribal Entities, June 2014.) many lives will be saved or how many people will enjoy better health.", "The lower the value that is put on a human life, the less likely it is that a regulation will pass the cost-benefit test. Finding a value for these benefits is fraught with ethical difficulties. Different approaches have resulted in a range of values for human life, from tens of thousands of dollars to $10 million per life saved. For example, the EPA calculated that new clean-air standards for ozone and particulates would prevent 18,700 premature deaths annually, and the monetary benefit of this prevention was valued at $110 billion (close to $6 million per life saved). The values of nonhuman components of natural environments\u2014a population of rare wildflowers, for example, or a wilderness site\u2014are also difficult to value. The values of these things depend entirely on how willing people are to pay for their preservation, which may involve their own aesthetics, the difficulty of their financial situation, or the amount of information they have. When monetary values are assigned to their existence, the outcome will be strongly influenced by highly subjective elements in the analysis. The Cost of Doing Nothing. Today many economists are trying to estimate the costs and benefits of various laws related to climate change adaptation and mitigation (covered in Chapter 18 ). However, doing nothing has costs as well. For example, economists have found that the government of Bangladesh is already spending $1 billion per year (6\u20137% of its annual budget) on climate change adaptations, such as resettling people whose homes are destroyed by rising seas. (This total does not include contributions from donor nations.) Thus the high costs of changing the way we use energy today have to be compared with the costs of not doing so. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Cost-effectiveness analysis is another method of evaluating the costs of regulations. Here the merits of the goal are accepted, and the question is: How can that goal be achieved at the least cost? To find out, the costs of alternative strategies for reaching the goal are analyzed, and the least costly method is adopted. Cost-effectiveness can be applied to the desired level of pollution control. As Figure 2\u201314 shows, a significant benefit may be achieved by modest degrees of cleanup. But note how differently the cost and benefit curves behave with increasing reduction of pollution. At some point in the cleanup effort, the lines cross and the costs exceed the benefits. Few additional benefits are realized when cleanup begins to approach 100%, yet costs increase exponentially. This behavior follows from the fact that living organisms\u2014including humans\u2014can often tolerate a threshold level of pollution without ill effect. Therefore, reducing the level of a pollutant below its threshold level will not yield an observable improvement. Optimum cost-effectiveness that meets the efficiency criterion for public policy is achieved at the point where the benefit curve is the greatest distance above the cost curve. However, the perspective of time should be considered in calculating cost-effectiveness (Figure 2\u201315c). A situation that appears to be cost ineffective in the short term may prove extremely cost effective in the long term. This is particularly true for problems such as acid deposition and groundwater contamination from toxic wastes. Progress What has been the result of environmental regulation to date? Pollution of air and surface water reached critical levels in many areas of the United States in the late 1960s. Since that time, huge sums of money have been spent on pollution 2.6 Getting Society to Agree on Policy 43 abatement. Cost-benefit analysis shows that, overall, these expenditures have paid for themselves many times over in decreased health care costs and enhanced environmental quality. As an example, consider the phase-out of leaded gasoline. The project cost about $3.6 billion, according to an EPA benefit-cost report. Benefits were valued at more than $50 billion, $42 billion of which were for medical costs that were avoided! The following are some of the accomplishments of environmental public policy between 1980 and 2013, as reported by the EPA: Many of these environmental improvements occurred even as the GDP grew by 145%, the population rose by 40%, and the annual number of motor vehicle miles driven increased by 96%. A cost-benefit analysis accompanies every new regulatory rule from the EPA and other federal agencies. Even when a rule is not classified as a major regulation, the accompanying documentation must demonstrate, by cost-benefit analysis, that the rule does not qualify as significant. Like it or not, cost-benefit analysis is now part of public policy in the United States.", "CONCEPT CHECK Define cost-benefit analysis as it relates to environmental regulation. How does this method of analysis address external costs? How does it differ from cost-effectiveness analysis? \u2610\u2713 2.6 Getting Society to Agree on Policy Environmental concerns are often a battle of special interest groups. The issues are up for grabs, and protecting the environment often depends largely on the strength of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). James Skillen, former executive director of the Center for Public Justice, says that this is a seriously flawed situation. Skillen believes that the protection of land, air, water, and the associated biota should not have to depend on special interest groups for its advocacy. Rather, it is a matter of the public good and, as such, should be seen as a basic responsibility of government. To quote Skillen, \u201cRecognition in basic law of the necessity of ecological health as the precondition of all public and market relations should become as fundamental as the recognition that certain human rights exist as the precondition of all public rules and market regulations.\u201d 8 Moving environmental protection out of the arena of special interest groups and into law requires the efforts of citizens working together to improve the laws in their own countries. It also requires international regulations. Citizen Involvement As citizens, we are directly involved in public policy because we experience the outcomes of the policies. We pay for the benefits we receive through higher taxes and higher costs of the products we consume. We should care deeply about public policies. And the evidence of polls indicates that the American public does care. For example, a 2014 poll showed that American voters support the EPA in efforts to stop pollution from coal burning power plants even if it raises energy costs. 9 What can you do to have an impact on environmental public policy? Here are some suggestions: 8James Skillen, How Can We Do Justice to Both Public and Private Trusts?

Change the Economy to Green Choices made by consumers can change the economy. When consumers decide to purchase products that have fewer negative effects on the environment, the outcome of their decisions can change the marketplace as effectively as laws and regulations. For example, deciding to purchase fish and forest products that are certified as being environmentally sustainable (Chapter 7) can lead to an increase in the number of environmentally sustainable products in the marketplace. Another way of supporting a more sustainable economy is to purchase products that are produced locally; such purchases help prevent the outsourcing of jobs and the need for long shipments that allow the influx of invasive species. Green businesses and green investments move money that is already in the economy into products and services that are less environmentally damaging. For example, the Climate Works Foundation and the World Bank recently released a study promoting climate-smart development. The study showed that development projects that begin with the goals of increasing the economy and lowering the emission of pollutants can be financially sound and improve environmental quality and human health. Improving two problems with one solution promotes co-benefits, a better way to get the most out of problem-solving efforts. Another way of promoting a green economy is through social entrepreneurship, the process of pursuing innovative solutions to social problems. Business owners typically measure their success by calculating the ratio of the money they make to the capital they invest. Social entrepreneurs also consider the value of their business to the common good. Social entrepreneurship often uses cutting edge social media such as the WIKI Appropedia, a sharing site for collaborative solutions to problems, including sustainability. Many social entrepreneurs support open-source-appropriate technology. These technologies are available free to the public and can be modified without the restrictions often imposed by patents, making them appropriate for use by people with little money. Nonprofit organizations can also be environmentally conscious and entrepreneurial. One such organization is Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation, the dream of one hiker, Gregg Treinsh. This citizen-scientist group connects hikers with scientists; so far it has allowed more than 1,200 hikers to collect data on wilderness areas for 120 scientists.", "Similar ideas can be found in innovation networks such as Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs and Inhabit: Design for a Better World. International Regulation As difficult as it is to get nations to pass environmentally sound regulations, it is even harder to get countries to agree on sound environmental treaties. Table 2\u20133 lists some of the international laws or treaties that protect the environment; Review Questions 45 we will refer to many of them in later chapters. As the world becomes more crowded and human consumption uses an even greater proportion of Earth\u2019s ecosystem services, international cooperation about global environmental issues will become even more critical. Our global environment is intimately intertwined with human economies and systems of making laws and regulations. To move toward a sustainable future, we have to use the tools of accurate accounting in economics and wise decision making in public policy. We will also need innovative business and development solutions. As former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman said in the introduction to the agency\u2019s Draft Report on the Environment 2003: \u201cWe are all stewards of this shared planet, responsible for protecting and preserving a precious heritage for our children and grandchildren. As long as we work together and stay firmly focused on our goals, I am confident we will make our air cleaner, our water purer, and our land better protected for future generations.\u201d CONCEPT CHECK What are some of the ways ordinary consumers can change the brown economy to a green economy?

Basic Needs of Living Things The movie March of the Penguins brought the lives of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) to the big screen and the public imagination. The largest of the penguins, emperor penguins are known for their lives in the harsh antarctic. They live on a diet of fish, with some krill and the occasional squid or octopus, diving into the cold ocean waters from islands of sea ice. Those fish and squid feed on tiny animals called zooplankton, which in turn eat algae. Penguins also provide food for their own predators, the powerful leopard seals. much of the emperor penguins\u2019 year is spent at inland breeding grounds and in epic treks between them and the ocean. after mating, a female lays a single egg, which the male carefully protects under a flap of skin over his feet. The male spends the hard winter incubating the egg, surviving howling gales by huddling in a flock of similarly protective males. meanwhile the female treks back to the ocean, where she swims and feeds. When she has packed on enough fat, the female treks back to the breeding ground. The parents then trade places, and the female takes over the chick rearing. relieved of duty, the thin and worn male leaves for his own trip to feed in the ocean. Antarctic Adaptations. Penguins have a number of specialized adaptations that allow them to survive in this harsh environment. Their heavy bones and dense, waterproof feathers allow them to swim through ice-cold water. In addition, their hemoglobin functions in the low-oxygen conditions, and they can shut down their metabolism while diving. on land, they breed in the coldest environment of any bird species.", "Their blubber, high feather density, and ability to maintain their body temperature through a wide range of air temperatures allow them to succeed under conditions that would kill most other animals. Yet in order to survive, grow, and reproduce, emperor penguins require certain conditions from their environment, such as particular sources of food and locations that are suitable for reproduction. Emperor penguins have basic needs for survival, as do their prey and predators. 3.1 Organisms in Their Environment 49 A Changing World. Penguins face the loss of ocean fish from overfishing and changes in sea ice from climate change. In the future, it may be that their environmental requirements will not be met, but new evidence suggests that penguins may already be adapting their behavior to adjust to environmental change. In this chapter, we will follow the penguin and the other organisms in its food chain as examples of organisms living in their environment. all organisms get nutrients and energy from the environment and use them to build the cells and tissues of their bodies and to carry out activities such as moving, getting food, protecting themselves, reproducing, and getting rid of wastes. 3.1 Organisms in Their Environment Emperor penguins are just one species in a family of about 20 species of flightless aquatic birds. Some, like the emperor penguin, live in extreme cold. Other species of penguins live in temperate waters, and one even lives near the equator. The areas in which each of these species lives is a function of several factors: the penguin\u2019s habitat requirements, its evolutionary history, and its interactions with other organisms. Penguins need certain resources to survive, such as food and a place to nest. Their food organisms, largely fish and squid, live on a diet of smaller animals, such as zooplankton, which are themselves supported by algae. Each of these parts of the food chain requires particular conditions, such as certain water temperatures, to survive. The distribution and abundance of the emperor penguin is a function of its requirements for growth and the history of the relationship between penguins and other species, including humans. To understand whether emperor penguins will thrive in the future, we need to turn to the discipline of ecology. The Hierarchy of Ecology Ecology (from oikos, meaning \u201chouse or home\u201d) is the study of all processes influencing the distribution and abundance of organisms and the interactions between living things and their environment. A very basic understanding of ecological terms and concepts will help later as we look at how changes in the environment affect living things. Ecologists studying the conservation of emperor penguins ask an array of different questions. They may investigate what conditions the algae at the base of the food chain need, or the requirements of the penguins\u2019 fish and squid prey. They might ask what conditions allow penguins to grow most rapidly, or look for the factors that influence successful breeding. Any of these inquiries constitutes an ecological question, and several different branches of ecology exist to address them. Ecology can be described as a group of different, but related, disciplines: a hierarchy of studies. Scientists in different branches of the discipline might operate at different scales and ask different questions about the same system. The concept of ecological hierarchy is depicted in Figure 3\u20131 on the next page. Both the penguins and their prey have adaptations for dealing with the conditions under which they live. In this chapter, we will see how the basic functions of organisms fit into the scientific discipline of ecology. We will explore basic physical rules about matter and energy and how they control the lives of organisms in their environments. To do this, we will need to understand some basic chemistry and physics. at the chapter\u2019s end, we will look at the global movements of important nutrients and how those huge cycles both affect individual organisms and are affected by human activities. As we investigate the science of ecology, we will look at these different levels in the hierarchy. We start by examining individual organisms at the species level. We will see how species are grouped into larger categories and how these groups interact. Species exist in specific habitats because those habitats provide the nutrients and other factors that a species needs to survive; we will look at how those needs are met. Lastly, we will take a broader view of matter and energy, and how energy and nutrients cycle through the various systems on Earth.", "All of these different processes are interlinked. Ecologists study the connections as well as the whole. Species. A species is a group of individuals that share certain characteristics distinct from other such groups (robins versus redwing blackbirds, for example). Species are classified into closely related groups called genera (singular, genus), and they in turn are grouped into families. These are grouped into larger groups: orders, classes, phyla (singular, phylum), kingdoms, and domains. The official scientific name of any species is always Latin and has two parts: the genus name and the species epithet, or descriptive term. For example, the emperor penguin\u2019s name, Aptenodytes forsteri, tells us first the genus (Aptenodytes, meaning \u201cwithoutwings-diver\u201d) and second a descriptive word (the species epithet, forsteri, named after explorer Johann Forster). All penguins are in the same family: Spheniscidae. Only the emperor penguin and one other species, the king penguin, are in the genus Aptenodytes, because they are considered to be more closely related to each other than to other penguins. Sometimes it is difficult to determine exactly what constitutes a species. The biological definition of a species is all members that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Members of different species generally do not interbreed. This definition is good for many organisms, but does not work for those that do not need to mate to produce offspring. In those cases, scientists use a variety of other classification methods. New species can arise over periods of time through evolution, and species classifications are occasionally altered to reflect this. Populations. Each species in a biotic community is represented by a certain population\u2014that is, by a certain number of individuals that make up the interbreeding, reproducing Levels of Biological Organization Figure 3\u20131 The hierarchy of life. organisms can be seen as a hierarchy of complex systems from subcellular components not shown here, to cells to tissues to organs to systems to whole individuals. likewise, individuals function in a set of increasingly complex systems that make up the disciplines of ecology. These include populations, communities, ecosystems, and landscapes. The very largest regions are called biomes. Together, all living things make up the biosphere. 3.1 Organisms in Their Environment 51 group. The distinction between population and species is that population refers only to those individuals of a certain species that live within a given area\u2014for example, all of the gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park. Species is all inclusive, such as all of the gray wolves in the world. Biotic Communities. The grouping of populations we observe when studying a forest, grassland, or pond is referred to as the area\u2019s biota (bio means \u201cliving\u201d) or biotic community. The biota includes all vegetation, from large trees through microscopic algae, and all animals, from large mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians through earthworms, tiny insects, and mites. It also includes microscopic creatures such as bacteria, fungi, and protozoans. The particular kind of biotic community found in a given area is, in large part, determined by abiotic (nonliving, chemical, and physical) factors. Abiotic factors include the amount of water or moisture present, climate, salinity (saltiness), and soil type. Sometimes, we quickly refer to a community by its most obvious members, such as the dominant plants, usually indicators of the environmental conditions of a site. For example, we might describe a \u201chemlock/beech forest\u201d or an \u201coak/hickory forest\u201d (Figure 3\u20132) . The species within a community depend on one another. For example, certain animals will not be present unless certain plants that provide food and shelter are also present. In this way, the plant community supports (or limits by its absence) the animal community. In addition, every plant and animal species is adapted to cope with the abiotic factors of its region. For example, every species that lives in a temperate region is adapted in one way or another to survive the winter season, which includes a period of freezing temperatures (Figure 3\u20133) . These interactions among organisms and their environments will be discussed later. For now, keep in mind that the populations of different species within a biotic community are constantly interacting with each other and with the abiotic environment. Ecosystems. An ecosystem is an interactive complex of communities and the abiotic environment affecting them within a particular area. Forests, grasslands, wetlands, sand dunes, and coral reefs each contain certain species in particular spatial areas, and are all distinct ecosystems. Humans are parts of ecosystems, too, and some branches of ecology, such as urban ecology, focus on human-dominated systems.", "Other ecologists study the interaction between humans and nonhuman ecosystems, such as salt marshes or the open ocean, which are deeply affected by humans. While it is convenient to divide the living world into different ecosystems, you will find that there are seldom distinct boundaries between them and that they are not totally isolated from one another. Many species occupy (and are a part of) two or more ecosystems or, as in the case of migrating birds, may move from one ecosystem to another at different times. Transitional regions between ecosystems are known as ecotones. An ecotone shares many of the species and characteristics of both ecosystems it passes through. Ecotones may lack unique (and contain fewer overall) species when compared Figure 3\u20132 Predictable vegetation. an oak/hickory forest is dominated by oak and hickory trees, which define the type of forest habitat other species experience. Figure 3\u20133 Winter in the forest. many trees and other plants of temperate forests are so adapted to the winter season that they actually require a period of freezing temperature in order to grow again in the spring.

(b) an ecotone may create a unique habitat that harbors specialized species not found in either of the ecosystems bordering it. for example, cattails, reeds, and lily pads typically grow in the ecotone between land and freshwater ponds. to bordering ecosystems, as in the ecotone between grassland and forest shown in Figure 3\u20134a. Alternatively, ecotones may house and support more different species than the ecosystems they pass through, as in the marshy ecotone that often occurs between the open water of a lake and dry land (Figure 3\u20134b) . Landscapes and Biomes. Clusters of interacting ecosystems like forests, open meadows, and rivers together constitute landscapes. Landscape ecologists study issues such as how much suitable habitat will be left for fish to lay eggs in a riverbed if the surrounding forest is clear-cut or how far squirrels will be able to travel if the forest is broken into small segments. Landscapes are usually on a scale humans can envision; for example, if you look out at the horizon and see a forest merge into a field or meadow, you are seeing a landscape. However, landscapes can also be observed on a large scale: one could also pull back from Earth and look at large areas of its surface that have similar characteristics (such as dominant vegetation). Many scientists use digital technology tools such as geographic information systems to study landscape features. They also use remote sensing, including images from satellites (Figure 3\u20135) . A new area of ecology, macrosystems ecology, uses large amounts of data across many types of ecosystems to answer questions that are extremely wide in scope, such as questions about climate change or the effects of invasive species. Tropical rain forests, grasslands, and deserts are biomes (discussed in Chapter 5 ). A biome is a large area of Earth\u2019s surface that shares climate and has similar vegetation. Biomes are much larger than landscapes. For example, grasslands (such as prairies) are geographical regions whose locations can be predicted by their rainfall and temperatures. On different continents, they may have different species, but they are still grasslands, described by the dominant type of vegetation. As with ecosystems, there are generally no sharp boundaries between biomes. Instead, one grades into the next through transitional regions. Major categories of aquatic ecosystems, such as estuaries, rivers, and the open ocean, are sometimes referred to as biomes. The characteristics of aquatic ecosystems are determined primarily by the depth, salinity, and permanence of the water in them (Chapter 5) . Biosphere. Regardless of how we choose to categorize and name different ecosystems, they are interconnected and interdependent. Terrestrial ecosystems are connected by the flow of rivers and by migrating animals. Sediments and nutrients washing from the land may nourish or pollute the ocean. Seabirds and marine mammals connect the oceans with the land, and all biomes share a common atmosphere and water cycle. All the species on Earth live in ecosystems, and ecosystems are interconnected so that all living things form one huge system called the biosphere.", "This concept is analogous to the idea that the cells of our bodies form tissues, tissues form organs, organs are connected into organ systems, and all are interconnected to form the whole body. Figure 3\u20135 Landscape Ecology. here a researcher demonstrates a mapping tool used in landscape ecology. This is a prototype of a geographical information system called Soilfit. CONCEPT CHECK What are three different ecological scales? Give an example of a question that a researcher could ask about emperor penguins at each scale. \u2610\u2713 3.2 Environmental Factors Let\u2019s look back at the emperor penguins in the Antarctic. Why are the penguins living there and not in another part of the world? The answer is both the environment and history. The penguins and their prey have evolved to live in the Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica, with the physical, chemical, and biological factors it contains. As already discussed, we describe these factors as either biotic (living) or abiotic (nonliving). The factors can be further characterized as either conditions or resources. Conditions are any factors that vary in space and time, but that are not used up or made unavailable to other species. These include temperature (extremes of heat and cold as well as average temperature), wind, pH (acidity), salinity (saltiness), and fire. Resources are any factors\u2014biotic or abiotic\u2014that are consumed by organisms. These include water, chemical nutrients (like nitrogen and phosphorus), light (for plants and algae), oxygen, food, and space for resting or nesting. Some factors can be conditions in one situation and resources in another. For example, plants in the desert compete for water as a resource; however, in the ocean, water is a condition for which algae, fish, and penguins need special adaptations and for which they are not competing. The degree to which each factor is present or absent profoundly affects the ability of organisms to survive. However, each species may be affected differently by each factor, and its response determines whether or not it will occupy a given region. Optimums, Zones of Stress, and Limits of Tolerance Different species thrive with different combinations of environmental factors. This principle applies to all living things, both plants and animals. For example, bamboo plants thrive in full sun and warm temperatures, with plenty of water and well-drained, nitrogen-rich soil. In contrast, desert cacti are generally adapted for low amounts of water, poor soil fertility, and extremes of heat and cold. Aquatic systems also vary in their environmental factors and residents\u2014for example, the amounts of freshwater and saltwater determine the varieties of fish and other organisms present. 3.2 Environmental Factors 53 Organismal ecologists study the adaptations of organisms to specific environmental factors. Organisms can be grown under controlled conditions in which one factor is varied while other factors are held constant. Such experiments demonstrate that, for every factor, there is a certain level at which the organisms grow or survive most; an optimum (plural, optima). At higher or lower levels than the optimum, the organisms do less well, and at further extremes, they may not be able to survive at all. Figure 3-6 on the following page shows the optimum temperature for a species of bamboo. It is common to speak of an optimal range, the range over which the best response occurs. The entire span that allows any growth at all is called the range of tolerance. The points at the high and low ends of the range of tolerance are called the limits of tolerance. Between the optimal range and the high or low limit of tolerance are zones of stress. Outside of the optimal range, the organisms experience increasing stress, until, at either limit of tolerance, they cannot survive. A Fundamental Biological Principle. Based on the consistency of observations and experiments, the following is considered to be a fundamental biological principle: Every species has an optimal range, zones of stress, and limits of tolerance with respect to every abiotic factor, and these characteristics vary between species. For instance, some plants cannot tolerate any freezing temperatures; others can tolerate slight freezing; and some actually require several weeks of freezing temperatures to complete their life cycles. Some species have a very broad range of tolerance, whereas others have a much narrower range. The range of tolerance for any factor affects more than just the growth of individuals. Because the health and vigor of individuals affect their ability to reproduce, the survival of the next generation is also affected, which in turn influences the population as a whole.", "Consequently, the population density (individuals per unit area) of a species is greatest where all conditions are optimal, and it decreases as any one or more conditions depart from the optimum. You expect to see the most bamboo in the places where all conditions are best for bamboo and less where conditions are not so favorable. Law of Limiting Factors. In 1840, Justus von Liebig studied the effects of chemical nutrients on plant growth. He observed that restricting any one of the many different nutrients at any given time had the same effect: it limited growth. A factor that limits growth is called (not surprisingly) a limiting factor. If any one factor is outside the optimal range, it will cause stress and limit the growth, reproduction, or even survival of a population. Ecologists now refer to this observation as the law of limiting factors or Liebig\u2019s law of the minimum. A limiting factor may be a problem of too much instead of a problem of too little. For example, plants may be stressed or killed not only by underwatering or underfertilizing, but also by overwatering or overfertilizing, which are common pitfalls for beginning gardeners. Note also that the limiting factor may change from one time to another. For instance, temperature may be limiting in the early spring, nutrients may be limiting in the winter, and water may be limiting if a drought occurs. Figure 3\u20136 Survival curve. for every factor influencing growth, reproduction, and survival, there is an optimum level. above and below the optimum, stress increases until survival becomes impossible at the limits of tolerance. The total range between the high and low limits is the range of tolerance. Celsius temperature Limit of tolerance Death Optimum Limit of tolerance DeathRange of tolerance occurs occurs While one factor may be limiting at a given time, several factors outside the optimum may combine to cause additional stress or even death. In particular, pollutants may act in a way that causes organisms to become more vulnerable to disease or drought. Such cases are examples of synergistic effects, or synergisms, which are defined as two or more factors interacting in a way that causes an effect much greater than one would anticipate from each of the two acting separately. Habitat and Niche. Habitat refers to the kind of place\u2014 defined by the plant community and the physical environment\u2014 where a species is biologically adapted to live. For example, deciduous forests, swamps, and grassy fields are types of habitats. Different types of forests (for instance, coniferous versus tropical) provide markedly different habitats and support different species of wildlife. Because some organisms operate on very small scales, we use the term microhabitat for things like puddles, spaces sheltered by rocks, and holes in tree trunks that might house their own small community (Figure 3\u20137) . Even when different species occupy the same habitat, competition may be slight or nonexistent because each species has its own niche. An ecological niche is the sum of all of the conditions and resources under which a species can live: what and where it feeds, what it feeds on, where it finds shelter and nests, and how it responds to abiotic factors. Similar species can coexist in the same habitat but have separate niches. Competition is minimized because potential competitors are using different resources. For example, bats and swallows both feed on flying insects, but they do not compete because bats feed on night-flying insects and swallows feed during the day. In the next section, we will see how organisms take these materials from the environment and use them to grow and maintain their bodies and do activities necessary for survival. CONCEPT CHECK You fertilize your lawn with nitrogen. At first the grass grows rapidly, but then its growth slows down. How might this change relate to the Law of Limiting Factors? \u2610\u2713 3.3 Matter in Living and Nonliving Systems Living organisms need to be able to take in matter and energy from their environment to grow and function. For example, the algae in the ocean can survive only because they are able to take the Sun\u2019s energy and combine it with materials from the water around them to make the basic building blocks of their own tissues and to power their cellular activities. In turn, the algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are eaten by fish, which in turn are eaten by penguins.", "Both the penguins and their prey get from their food the energy and matter necessary to build their own tissues and to do the work they need to do in each of their cells. To understand this simple ecological relationship, we need to know some basic chemistry and physics. Later, we will explore what happens to energy and matter as they move through the biosphere. Figure 3\u20137 Habitat and niche. for part of its life cycle, this species of damselfly lives in a pool of water trapped by a type of tropical plant; the tiny pool is a microhabitat. The specific conditions required by the damselfly, such as the pool and the types of food it eats there or where it lays its eggs as an adult, are its niche. Basic Units of Matter Matter is defined as anything that occupies space and has mass. This definition covers all solids, liquids, and gases as well as all living and nonliving things. Matter is composed of atoms\u2014very small pieces\u2014that are combined to form molecules, which in turn can be combined into more complex structures. Atoms. The basic building blocks of all matter are atoms. Only 94 different kinds of atoms occur in nature, and these are known as the naturally occurring elements. Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons, which in turn are made up of still smaller particles. For example, lead (Pb) is an element. An atom of lead is the smallest amount of lead 3.3 Matter in Living and Nonliving Systems 55 existing that has the characteristics of lead. A lead atom has a characteristic number of protons (positive particles), neutrons (neutral particles), and electrons (negative particles). How can these relatively few building blocks make up the countless materials of our world, including the tissues of living things? Picture each kind of atom as a different-sized Lego\u00ae block. Like Legos, atoms can build a great variety of things. Also like Legos, natural materials can be taken apart into their separate constituent atoms, and the atoms can then be reassembled into different materials. All chemical reactions, whether occurring in a test tube, in the environment, or inside living things (and whether they occur very slowly or very quickly), involve rearrangements of atoms to form different kinds of matter. Atoms do not change during the disassembly and reassembly of different materials. A carbon atom will always remain a carbon atom. In chemical reactions, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. The same number and kind of different atoms exist before and after any reaction. This constancy of atoms is regarded as a fundamental natural law, the Law of Conservation of Matter. Nuclear reactions differ from the chemical reactions we are discussing and can result in the splitting of an atom of one element into multiple atoms of another element. However, this is a very specific, rare instance and is not a chemical reaction. (Nuclear reactions will be discussed in Chapter 15. ) Now we turn our attention to the ways atoms are put together and how atoms are incorporated into organisms. Molecules and Compounds. A molecule consists of two or more atoms (either the same kind or different kinds) bonded in a specific way. The properties of a material depend on the exact way in which atoms are bonded to form molecules as well as on the atoms themselves. A compound consists of two or more different kinds of atoms that are bonded. For example, the fundamental units of oxygen gas, which consist of two bonded oxygen atoms, are molecules (O2) but not compounds. By contrast, when an oxygen atom binds with hydrogen atoms to create water, it is both a molecule and a compound (H2O). On the chemical level, the cycle of growth, reproduction, death, and decay of organisms is a continuous process of using various molecules and compounds from the environment (food), assembling them into living organisms (growth), disassembling them (decay), and repeating the process. Four Spheres During growth and decay, atoms move from the environment into living things and then return to the environment. To picture this process, think of the environment as three open, nonliving systems, or \u201cspheres,\u201d interacting with the biosphere. The atmosphere is the thin layer of gases (including water vapor) separating Earth from outer space. The hydrosphere is water in all of its liquid and solid compartments: oceans, rivers, ice, and groundwater. The lithosphere is Earth\u2019s crust, made up of rocks and minerals.", "Matter is constantly being exchanged within and between these four spheres, as shown in Figure 3\u20138 on the following page. are normally stable, but under some circumstances, they react chemically to form new compounds. For example, ozone is produced from oxygen in the upper atmosphere (Chapter 18). Plants take carbon dioxide in from the atmosphere, usually through their leaves. Animals usually take oxygen in through some type of specialized organ such as a lung, but some, like earthworms, can simply absorb oxygen through their skin. Biosphere (Living systems) Lithosphere Figure 3\u20138 The four spheres of Earth\u2019s environment. The biosphere is all of life on Earth. It depends on, and interacts with, the atmosphere (air), the hydrosphere (water), and the lithosphere (soil and rocks). (Source: adapted from Geosystems, 5th ed., by robert W. christopherson, \u00a9 2005 Pearson Education, Inc.) Atmosphere. The lower atmosphere is a mixture of molecules of three important gases\u2014oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), and carbon dioxide (CO2)\u2014along with water vapor and trace amounts of several other gases. The gases in the atmosphere (+) Hydrosphere. While the atmosphere is a major source of carbon and oxygen for organisms, the hydrosphere is the source of hydrogen. Each molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom, so the chemical formula for water is H2O. A weak attraction known as hydrogen bonding exists between water molecules. Water is an important molecule for living things and usually needs to be available in liquid form. Water occurs in three different states. At temperatures below freezing, hydrogen bonding holds the molecules in position with respect to one another, and the result is a solid crystal structure (ice or snow). At temperatures above freezing but below vaporization, hydrogen bonding still holds the molecules close but allows them to move past one another, producing the liquid state. Vaporization (evaporation) occurs as hydrogen bonds break and water molecules move into the air independently. As temperatures are lowered again, all of these changes of state go in the reverse direction. Generally, water undergoes melting and evaporation, but sometimes water molecules leave snow or ice and go directly into the air. This process is sublimation ( Figure 3\u20139) . Moving from one state to another either releases or requires a great deal of energy. This is one reason why many animals sweat to cool off: changing from vapor) Solid (ice) Freezing Liquid (water) Melting Figure 3\u20139 Water and its three states. (a) Water consists of molecules, each of which is formed when two hydrogen atoms bond to an oxygen atom (h2o). (b) In water vapor, the molecules are separate and independent. (c) In liquid water, the weak attraction between water molecules known as hydrogen bonding gives the water its liquid property. (d) at freezing temperatures, hydrogen bonding holds the molecules firmly, giving the solid state\u2014ice. (d) (c) 3.3 Matter in Living and Nonliving Systems 57 Figure 3\u201310 Minerals. minerals (hard, crystalline compounds) are composed of dense clusters of atoms of two or more elements. The at-oms of most elements gain or lose one or more electrons, becoming neg-ative (\u2212) or positive (+) ions, and form a predictable pattern held closely together. This photograph is of a mineral, gypsum, in a mine in Texas. the liquid to gas state requires heat and removes it from the organism. Despite the changes of state, the water molecules themselves retain their basic chemical structure of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom; only the relationship between the molecules changes. Lithosphere. All the other elements that are required by living organisms, as well as the approximately 72 elements that they do not require, are found in the lithosphere, in the form of rock and soil minerals. A mineral is a naturally occurring solid, made by geologic processes; it is a hard, crystalline structure of a given chemical composition ( Figure 3\u201310) . Most rocks are made up of relatively small crystals of two or more minerals, and soil generally consists of particles of many different minerals. Each mineral is made up of dense clusters of two or more kinds of atoms bonded by an attraction between positive and negative charges on the atoms (Appendix C). Interactions. Air, water, and minerals interact with each other in a simple, but significant, manner. Gases from the air and ions (charged atoms) from minerals may dissolve in water. Therefore, natural water is inevitably a solution containing variable amounts of dissolved gases and minerals.", "This solution is constantly subject to change because various processes may remove any dissolved substances in it or additional materials may dissolve in it. Molecules of water enter the air by evaporation and leave it again via condensation and precipitation (see the hydrologic cycle, Chapter 10). Thus, the amount of moisture in the air fluctu ates constantly. Wind may carry dust or mineral particles, but the amount changes constantly because the particles gradually settle out from the air. These interactions are summarized in Figure 3\u201311. The materials in these three spheres interact with the biosphere as living organisms take materials from the spheres and use them to create complex molecules in their bodies. We will discuss the process of building these molecules next. Organic Compounds Your body, like that of the emperor penguin, is composed of relatively large chemical compounds in a number of broad categories, such as proteins, carbohydrates (sugars and starches), lipids (fatty substances), and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). These compounds usually contain six key elements: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S). Living things need other elements as well, sometimes in smaller, but no less important, amounts. Table 3\u20131 on the following page lists the elements in living organisms. Unlike the relatively simple molecules that occur in the environment (such as CO2, H2O, and N2), the key chemical elements in living organisms bond to form very large, complex molecules. The chemical compounds making up the tissues of living organisms are referred to as organic. Some of these molecules may contain millions of atoms. These molecules are constructed mainly from carbon atoms bonded into chains, with hydrogen and oxygen atoms attached. Nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur may be present also, but the key common denominator is carbon\u2013carbon and carbon\u2013 hydrogen or carbon\u2013oxygen bonds. Inorganic, then, refers to molecules or compounds with neither carbon\u2013carbon nor carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds. While this is the general rule, some exceptions occur; by convention, a few compounds that contain carbon bonds, such as carbon dioxide, are still considered inorganic. All plastics and countless other human-made compounds are also based on carbon bonding and are, chemically speaking, organic compounds. To resolve any confusion this may cause, the compounds making up living organisms are referred to as natural organic compounds and the human-made ones as synthetic organic compounds. The term organic can have a completely different meaning, such as in organic farming (Chapter 12) . To summarize: the elements essential to life (C, H, O, and so on) are present in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, or lithosphere in relatively simple molecules. In the living organisms of the biosphere, these elements are organized into highly complex organic compounds. For example, algae in the Southern Ocean use the energy of sunlight to combine simple molecules from the water and air into the complex organic molecules that make up their cells. When algae are eaten, their organic molecules are digested and recombined to form the tissues of zooplankton. This process occurs again when zoo-plankton are eaten by fish, and once again when fish are eaten by emperor penguins. When the algae, fish or penguins die, the reverse process occurs through decomposition and decay. Each of these processes is discussed in more detail later in the chapter. Next, we discuss energy, the force that helps change chemical matter into substances that support life. CONCEPT CHECK How is the process of dissolving salt (NaCl) in water (H2O) different from the formation of water from oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H+)? \u2610\u2713 3.4 Matter and Energy The universe is made up of matter and energy. Recall that matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. By contrast, light, heat, movement, and electricity do not have mass, nor do they occupy space. These are the common FORMS OF ENERGY Kinetic Energy Potential Energy Light and other forms of Reservoir behind radiation hydroelectric dam 3.4 Matter and Energy 59 forms of energy that you are familiar with. What do the various forms of energy have in common? They affect matter, causing changes in its position or state. For example, the release of energy in an explosion causes things to go flying\u2014a change in position. Heating water causes it to boil and change to steam, a change of state. On a molecular level, changes of state are actually also movements of atoms or molecules. For instance, the degree of heat energy contained in a substance is a measure of the relative vibrational motion of the atoms and molecules of the substance.", "Therefore, we can define energy as the ability to move matter. Energy Basics Energy can be categorized as either kinetic or potential (Figure 3\u201312) . Kinetic energy is energy in action or motion. Light, heat, physical motion, and electrical current are all forms of kinetic energy. Potential energy is energy in storage. A substance or system with potential energy has the capacity, or potential, to release one or more forms of kinetic energy. A stretched rubber band has potential energy; it can send a paper clip flying. Numerous chemicals, such as gasoline and other fuels, release kinetic energy\u2014heat, light, and movement\u2014when ignited. The potential energy contained in such chemicals and fuels is called chemical energy. Energy may be changed from one form to another in innumerable ways. Besides understanding that potential energy can be converted to kinetic energy, it is especially important Figure 3\u201312 Forms of energy. Energy is distinct from matter in that it neither has mass nor occupies space. It has the ability to act on matter, though, changing the position or the state of the matter. Kinetic energy is energy in one of its active forms. Potential energy is the potential that systems or materials have to release kinetic energy. Heat High pressure Four Types of Chemical Potential Energy Battery Gasoline Motion Explosives Electrical power Firewood Figure 3\u201313 Energy can be transformed from one form to another. Each time energy is transformed, some energy is transformed into heat (thermal) energy and is lost to the system\u2019s pool of usable energy. heat dissipates from hotter to cooler areas, eventually radiating out into space. Thus energy transformations are never 100% efficient, except when the objective is to transform energy to heat. Light Motor Heat Motion Black surface Electrical energy Kinetic energy Light energy Heat energy Electrical energy Light + Heat energy High-pressure + steam \u2013 Water Heat Turbine Generator Electrical energy Chemical energy Heat energy Kinetic energy Electrical energy to recognize that kinetic energy can be converted to potential energy, illustrated in Figure 3\u201313. (Consider, for example, charging a battery or pumping water into a high-elevation reservoir.) We shall see later in this section that photosynthesis does just that. Because energy does not have mass or occupy space, it cannot be measured in units of weight or volume. Instead, energy is measured in other kinds of units. One of the most common energy units is the calorie, which is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram (1 milliliter) of water 1 degree Celsius. This is a very small unit, so it is frequently more convenient to use the kilocalorie (1 kilocalorie = 1,000 calories), the amount of thermal (heat) energy required to raise 1 liter (1,000 milliliters) of water 1 degree Celsius. Kilocalories are sometimes denoted as \u201cCalories\u201d with a capital \u201cC.\u201d Food Calories, which measure the energy in given foods, are actually kilocalories. Temperature measures the molecular motion in a substance caused by the kinetic energy present in it. If energy is defined as the ability to move matter, then no matter can be moved without the absorption or release of energy. Indeed, no change in matter\u2014from a few atoms coming together or apart in a chemical reaction to a major volcanic eruption\u2014can be separated from its respective change in energy. Laws of Thermodynamics. Because energy can be converted from one form to another, numerous would-be inventors over the years have tried to build machines that produce more energy than they consume. One common idea was to use the output from a generator to drive a motor that in turn would be expected to drive a generator to keep the cycle going and yield additional power in the bargain (a perpetual-motion machine). Unfortunately, all such devices have one feature in common: They don\u2019t work. When all the inputs and outputs of energy are carefully measured, they are found to be equal. There is no net gain or loss in total energy. This observation is now accepted as a fundamental natural law, the Law of Conservation of Energy. It is also called the First Law of Thermodynamics, and it can be expressed as follows: Energy is neither created nor destroyed, but may be converted from one form to another. What this law really means is that you can\u2019t get something for nothing. Imaginative \u201cenergy generators\u201d fail for two reasons: First, in every energy conversion, a portion of the energy is converted to heat energy.", "Second, there is no way of trapping and recycling heat energy without expending even more energy in doing so. Consequently, in the absence of energy inputs, any and every system will sooner or later come to a stop as its energy is converted to heat and lost. This is now accepted as another natural law, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and it can be expressed as follows: In any energy conversion, some of the usable energy is always lost. Thus, you can\u2019t get something for nothing (the first law), and in fact, you can\u2019t even break even (the second law)! Entropy. The principle of increasing entropy underlies the loss of usable energy and its transformation to heat energy. 3.4 Matter and Energy 61 Entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder in a system, so increasing entropy means increasing disorder. Without energy inputs, everything goes in one direction only\u2014toward increasing entropy. The conversion of energy and the loss of usable energy to heat are both aspects of increasing entropy. Heat energy is the result of the random vibrational motion of atoms and molecules. It is the lowest (most disordered) form of energy, and its spontaneous flow to cooler surroundings is a way for that disorder to spread. Therefore, the Second Law of Thermodynamics may be more generally stated as follows: Systems will go spontaneously in one direction only\u2014 toward increasing entropy (Figure 3\u201314) . The second law also states that systems will go spontaneously only toward lower potential energy, a direction that releases heat from the systems. It is possible to pump water uphill, charge a battery, stretch a rubber band, and compress air. All of these require the input of energy in order to increase the potential energy of a system. The verbs pump, charge, stretch, and compress reflect the fact that energy is being put into the system. In contrast, flow in the opposite direction (which releases energy) occurs spontaneously (Figure 3\u201315) . Whenever something gains potential energy, therefore, keep in mind that the energy is being obtained from somewhere else (the first law). Moreover, the amount of usable Figure 3\u201314 Entropy. Systems go spontaneously only in the direction of increasing entropy. This spray can illustrates the idea. It took energy to concentrate a liquid in the can. once it is dispersed, the energy is dissipated and entropy is increased. energy lost from that \u201csomewhere else\u201d is greater than the amount gained (the second law). We now relate these concepts of matter and energy to organic molecules, organisms, ecosystems, and the biosphere.

(a) a simple physical example of the storage and release of potential energy. (b) The same principle applied to ecosystems. Energy Changes in Organisms Picture someone building a fire in a fireplace. The wood is largely composed of complex organic molecules. These molecules required energy to form, and therefore, their chemical bonds contain high potential energy. Lighting a fire causes a series of reactions that break these molecules and release energy. When released, the energy contained in those bonds can be used to do work. This chemical reaction involves oxidation, a loss of electrons, usually accomplished by the addition of oxygen (which causes burning). The heat and light of the flame are the potential energy being released as kinetic energy. In contrast, most inorganic compounds, such as carbon dioxide, water, and rock-based minerals, are nonflammable because they have very low potential energy. Thus, the production of organic material from inorganic material represents a gain in potential energy. Conversely, the breakdown of organic matter releases energy. Inside the cells of the emperor penguin eating squid, the reaction that takes place is similar to that of burning wood in a fireplace, except that it occurs in a set of small steps and is much more controlled. Producers and Photosynthesis. The relationship between the formation and breakdown of organic matter, where energy is gained and released from chemical bonds, forms the basis of the energy dynamics of ecosystems. Producers (primarily plants and algae) make high-potential-energy organic molecules for their needs from low-potential-energy raw materials in the environment\u2014namely, carbon dioxide, water, and a few dissolved compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other elements ( Figure 3\u201316) .", "This \u201cuphill\u201d conversion is possible because producers use chlorophyll to absorb light energy, which \u201cpowers\u201d the production of the Figure 3\u201316 Producers as chemical factories. Using light energy, producers make glucose from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a by-product. Breaking down some of the glucose to provide additional chemical energy, they combine the remaining glucose with certain nutrients from the soil to form other complex organic molecules that the plant then uses for growth. complex, energy-rich organic molecules. On the other hand, consumers (all organisms that live on the production of others) obtain energy for movement and growth from feeding on and breaking down organic matter made by producers ( Figure 3\u201317) . Plants and algae use the process of photosynthesis to make sugar (glucose, which contains stored chemical energy) from carbon dioxide, water, and light energy ( Figure 3\u201316) . This process, which also releases oxygen gas as a by-product, is described by the following chemical equation: Photosynthesis (An energy-demanding process) 6 CO2 + 12 H2O \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O carbon dioxide water light energy glucose oxygen water (gas) (gas) (low potential energy) (high potential energy) Chlorophyll in the plant cells absorbs the kinetic energy of light and uses it to remove the hydrogen atoms from water (H2O) molecules. The hydrogen atoms combine with carbon atoms from carbon dioxide to form a growing chain of carbons that eventually becomes a glucose molecule. After the hydrogen atoms are removed from water, the oxygen atoms that remain combine with each other to form oxygen gas, which is released into the air. Water appears on both sides of the equation because 12 molecules are consumed and 6 molecules are newly formed during photosynthesis. The key energy steps in photosynthesis take the hydrogen from water molecules and join carbon atoms together to form the carbon\u2013carbon and carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds of glucose. These steps convert the low-potential-energy bonds in water and carbon dioxide molecules to the high-potentialenergy bonds of glucose. 3.4 Matter and Energy 63 Figure 3\u201317 Consumers. only a small portion of the food ingested by a consumer is assimilated into body growth and repair. Some food provides energy in chemical bonds that are broken by the process of cellular respiration: this is the reverse process of photosynthesis, and waste products are carbon dioxide, water, and various mineral nutrients. a third portion is not digested and becomes fecal waste. Within the Plant. The glucose produced in photosynthesis serves three purposes in the plant: (1) Glucose, with the addition of other molecules, can be the backbone used for making all the other organic molecules (proteins, carbohydrates, and so on) that make up the stem, roots, leaves, flowers, and fruit of the plant. (2) It takes energy to run the cellular activities of plants, such as growth. This energy is obtained when the plant breaks down a portion of the glucose to release its stored energy in a process called cellular respiration. (3) A portion of the glucose produced may be stored for future use. For storage, the glucose is generally converted to starch, as in potatoes or grains, or to oils, as in many seeds. This stored energy is what is available to be eaten by consumers ( Figure 3\u201317). None of these reactions, from the initial capture of light by chlorophyll to the synthesis of plant structures, takes place automatically. Each step is catalyzed by specific enzymes, proteins that promote the synthesis or breaking of chemical bonds. The same is true of cellular respiration. Cellular Respiration. Inside each cell, organic molecules may be broken down through a process called cellular respiration to release the energy required for the work done by that cell. Most commonly, cellular respiration involves the breakdown of glucose, and the overall chemical equation is basically the reverse of that for photosynthesis: Cellular Respiration (An energy-releasing process) C6H12O6 + 6 O2 \u2192 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + energy glucose oxygen carbon dioxide water (high potential energy) (low potential energy) The purpose of cellular respiration is to release the potential energy contained in organic molecules to perform the activities of the organism. Note that oxygen is released in photosynthesis but consumed in cellular respiration to break down glucose to carbon dioxide and water. All organisms need to perform cellular respiration, even producers like plants and algae. In order to have the oxygen they need, animals such as deer grazing on grass ( Figure 3\u201317) must obtain oxygen through some type of respiratory organ.", "This means that their ability to use food depends on the availability not only of food, but also of oxygen. Many animals, such as deer, use lungs to obtain oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Oxygen is more limited in water, and fish use gills to obtain it, but many aquatic places are severely oxygen limited. In keeping with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, converting the potential energy of glucose to the energy required to do the body\u2019s work is not 100% efficient. The energy released from glucose is stored in molecules that work like compressed springs\u2014that is, they store the energy so that the body can use it in cells later. But the number of \u201cenergy units\u201d that come from respiration is not nearly as high as the amount of solar energy required for the photosynthesis of glucose. Cellular respiration is only 40\u201360% efficient. This is a great example of the Second Law of Thermodynamics at work. The rest of the energy is released as waste heat, and this is the source of body heat. This heat output can be measured in animals (cold-blooded or warmblooded) and in plants. Gaining Weight. The basis of weight gain or loss becomes apparent in this context. If you consume more calories from food than your body needs, the excess may be converted to fat and stored, and you gain weight as a result. In contrast, the principle of dieting is to eat less and exercise more, to create an energy demand that exceeds the amount of energy contained in your food. The overall reaction for cellular respiration is the same as that for simply burning glucose. Thus, it is not uncommon to speak of \u201cburning\u201d our food for energy. There are other ways of releasing stored energy from food that do not require oxygen. Such anaerobic respiration includes fermentation, as in the process used to make wine. Yeast cells use anaerobic respiration to convert grape sugars into usable energy, releasing alcohol as a by-product. However, these methods are less efficient than oxidation, and organisms that use them do not thrive unless oxygen is severely limited. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are necessary for life on Earth to survive. Next we will see how the energy from the Sun that fuels photosynthesis moves through Earth\u2019s systems. One-Way Flow of Energy What happens to all the solar energy entering ecosystems? Most of it is absorbed by the atmosphere, oceans, and land, heating them in the process. The small fraction (2\u20135%) captured by living plants is either passed along to the consumers and detritivores (organisms that live on dead or decaying organisms) that eat them or degraded into the lowest and most disordered form of energy\u2014heat\u2014as the plants decompose. Eventually, all of the energy entering ecosystems escapes as heat. According to the laws of thermodynamics, no energy will actually be lost. So many energy conversions are taking place in ecosystem activities, however, that entropy is increased, and all the energy is degraded to a form unavailable to do further work. That heat energy may stay in the atmosphere for some period of time, but will eventually be re-radiated out into space. The ultimate result is that energy flows in a one-way direction through ecosystems and eventually leaves Earth; it is not lost to the universe, but it is no longer available to ecosystems, so it must be continually resupplied by sunlight. Energy flow is one of the two fundamental processes that make ecosystems work. In contrast with the flow of energy, we talk about the cycling of nutrients and other elements, which are continually reused from those already available on Earth. Explain how the growth of a tree can be a part of carbon storage although trees are eaten by herbivores. CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 3.5 The Cycling of Matter in Ecosystems Earlier we saw that the molecules that make up cells, which in turn make up tissues, contain certain key elements. For example, all organic molecules contain carbon; photosynthesis requires water (hydrogen and oxygen) and carbon dioxide (carbon and oxygen); potassium is part of the energy-holding mechanism in each cell; nitrogen is contained in every protein; and sulfur bonds help proteins stay in the right shape. There are many other necessary nutrients. Some are only necessary in very small amounts. For example, to make the protein hemoglobin in the blood of animals like the penguin, small amounts of iron are needed.", "According to the Law of Conservation of Matter, atoms cannot be created or destroyed, so recycling is the only possible way to maintain a dynamic system. To see how recycling takes place in the biosphere, we now focus on the pathways of four key elements heavily affected by human activities: carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulfur. Because these pathways are circular and involve biological, geological, and chemical processes, they are called biogeochemical cycles. Some processes in biogeochemical cycles, such as photosynthesis and respiration, occur rapidly. Others, such as the formation of coal from the remains of plants, take hundreds of millions of years (Figure 3\u201318) . (The water, or hydrologic, cycle is covered in Chapter 10). Figure 3\u201318 The lithosphere as a nutrient sink. When plants and animals die, elements from their bodies can be converted to rocks and stored underground. The carbon and the fossilized leaves in this piece of coal came from plants that grew in lush forests during the coal age, about 300 million years ago. The Carbon Cycle The global carbon cycle is illustrated in Figure 3\u201319. Boxes represent major pools of carbon, and arrows represent the movement, or flux, of carbon from one compartment to another. For descriptive purposes, it is convenient to start the carbon cycle with the reservoir of carbon dioxide (CO2 molecules present in the air). Through photosynthesis and further metabolism, carbon atoms from CO2 become the carbon atoms of the organic molecules making up a plant\u2019s body. The carbon atoms can then be eaten by an animal, such as the deer, and become part of the tissues of all the other organisms in the ecosystem. About half of the carbon-containing molecules are respired by plants and animals, and half are deposited to the soil (a large reservoir) in the form of detritus (dead plant and animal matter). Respiration by organisms in the soil that eat dead matter returns more carbon to the atmosphere (as CO2). The cycle is different in the oceans: Photosynthesis by phytoplankton and macroalgae removes CO2 from the huge pool of inorganic carbonates in seawater, and feeding moves the organic carbon through marine food webs. Respiration by the biota returns the CO2 to the inorganic carbon compounds in solution. The carbon cycle includes several other important processes. The figure indicates two in particular: (1) diffusion exchange between the atmosphere and the oceans; and (2) the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases CO2 into the atmosphere. Some geological processes of the carbon cycle are not shown in Figure 3\u201319. For example, the fossilization of dead plants and animals produced coal deposits in many 3.5 The Cycling of Matter in Ecosystems 65 areas of Earth. This process removed vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and trapped it underground. Burning the coal and oil created by this process releases the CO2 to the atmosphere. For another example, limestone (such as that formed by ancient corals) also keeps carbon out of circulation; however, the weathering of exposed limestone releases carbon into the aquatic system. Because the total amount of carbon in the atmosphere is about 854 Gt (gigatons, or a billion metric tons) and photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems removes about 150\u2013175 Gt/year, a carbon atom cycles from the atmosphere through one or more living things and back to the atmosphere about every five or six years. Human Impacts. Human intrusion into the carbon cycle is significant. As we will see shortly, we are diverting (or removing) 40% of the photosynthetic productivity of land plants to support human enterprises. By burning fossil fuels, we have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by 35% over preindustrial levels (Chapter 18). In addition, until the mid 20th century, deforestation and soil degradation released significant amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. However, more recent reforestation and changed agricultural practices have improved this somewhat. The Phosphorus Cycle The phosphorus cycle is similar to the cycles of other mineral nutrients\u2014those elements that have their origin in the rock and soil minerals of the lithosphere, such as iron, calcium, and potassium. We focus on phosphorus because its shortage tends to be a limiting factor in a number of ecosystems and its excess can stimulate unwanted algal growth in freshwater systems. The phosphorus cycle is illustrated in Figure 3\u201320, on the next page. Like the carbon cycle, it is depicted as a set of pools of phosphorus and fluxes to indicate key processes. Phosphorus exists in various rock and soil minerals as the inorganic ion phosphate (PO43\u2212).", "As rock gradually breaks down, phosphate and other ions are released in a slow process. Plants absorb PO43\u2212 from the soil or from a water solution. Once the phosphate is incorporated into organic compounds by the plant, it is called organic phosphate. Moving through food chains, organic phosphate is transferred from producers to the rest of the ecosystem. As with carbon, at each step it is highly likely that the organic compounds containing phosphate will be broken down in cellular respiration or by decomposers, releasing PO43\u2212 in urine or other waste material. Phosphate is then reabsorbed by plants to start the cycle again. Phosphorus enters into complex chemical reactions with other substances that are not shown in this simplified version of the cycle. For example, PO43\u2212 forms solid, insoluble compounds with a number of cations (positively charged ions), such as iron (Fe3+), aluminum (Al3+), and calcium (Ca3+). Phosphorus can bind with these ions to form chemical precipitates (solid, insoluble compounds) that are largely unavailable to plants. The precipitated phosphorus can slowly release PO43\u2212 as plants withdraw naturally occurring PO43\u2212 from soil, water, or sediments. Human Impacts. The most serious human intrusion into the phosphorus cycle comes from the use of phosphorus-containing fertilizers. Phosphorus is mined in several locations around the world and is then made into fertilizers, animal feeds, detergents, and other products. Phosphorus is a common limiting factor in soils and, when added to croplands, can greatly stimulate production. Unfortunately, human applications have tripled the amount of phosphorus reaching the oceans. This increase is roughly equal to the global use of phosphorus fertilizer in agriculture. Humans are accelerating the natural phosphorus cycle as it is mined from the earth and as it subsequently moves from the soil into aquatic ecosystems, creating problems as it makes its way to the oceans. There is essentially no way to return this waterborne phosphorus to the soil, so the bodies of water end up overfertilized. This leads in turn to a severe water pollution problem known as eutrophica tion (Chapter 17). Eutrophication can cause the overgrowth of algae and bacteria and the death of fish. The Nitrogen Cycle The nitrogen cycle (Figure 3\u201321 ) has similarities to both the carbon cycle and the phosphorus cycle. Like carbon, nitrogen has a gas phase; like phosphorus, nitrogen acts as a limiting factor in plant growth. Like phosphorus, nitrogen is in high demand by both aquatic and terrestrial plants. The nitrogen cycle is otherwise unique. Most notably, unlike in the other cycles, bacteria in soils, water, and sediments perform many of the steps of the nitrogen cycle. The main reservoir of nitrogen is the air, which is about 78% nitrogen gas (N2). This form of nitrogen is called nonreactive nitrogen; most organisms are not able to use it in chemical reactions. The remaining forms of nitrogen are called reactive nitrogen (Nr) because they are used by most organisms and can make chemical reactions more easily. Plants in terrestrial ecosystems (\u201cnon-N-fixing produc ers\u201d in Figure 3\u201320) take up Nr as ammonium ions (NO4+) or nitrate ions (NO3\u2212). The plants incorporate the nitrogen into essential organic compounds such as proteins and nucleic acids. The nitrogen then moves from producers through consumers and, finally, to decomposers. At various points, nitrogen wastes are released, primarily as ammonium compounds. 3.5 The Cycling of Matter in Ecosystems 67 Industrial N-fixation N-compounds Fertilizer Non-legume crops Animals Nitrogen gas (N2) in air Nitrogen oxides in air Fossil fuel combustion Manure compost Soil bacteria Nitrate compounds \u2013 NO3 Soil bacteria Ammonium compounds + NH4 N-fixing by lightning Consumers Figure 3\u201321 The global nitrogen cycle. like phosphorus, nitrogen is often a limiting factor. Its cycle heavily involves different groups of bacteria. A group of soil bacteria, the nitrifying bacteria, oxidizes the ammonium to nitrate in a process that yields energy for the bacteria. At this point, the nitrate is again available for uptake by green plants\u2014a local ecosystem cycle within the global cycle. In most ecosystems, the supply of Nr is quite limited, yet there is an abundance of nonreactive N\u2014if it can be accessed. The nitrogen cycle in aquatic ecosystems is similar. Nitrogen Fixation. A number of bacteria and cyanobacteria (chlorophyll-containing bacteria, formerly referred to as blue-green algae) can use nonreactive N through a process called biological nitrogen fixation. In terrestrial ecosystems, the most important among these nitrogen-fixing microbes live in nodules on the roots of legumes, the plant family that includes peas and beans.", "The legume provides the bacteria with a place to live and with food (carbohydrates and proteins) and gains a source of nitrogen in return. From legumes, nitrogen enters the food web. The legume family includes a huge diversity of plants. Without them, plant production would be sharply impaired due to a lack of available nitrogen. Three other important processes also \u201cfix\u201d nitrogen. One is the conversion of nitrogen gas to the ammonium form by discharges of lightning in a process known as atmospheric nitrogen fixation: the ammonium then comes down with rainfall. The second is the industrial fixation of nitrogen in the manufacture of fertilizer: the Haber-Bosch process, which converts nitrogen gas and hydrogen to ammonia, is the main source of agricultural fertilizer. The third is a consequence of the combustion of fossil fuels, during which nitrogen from coal and oil is oxidized; some nitrogen gas is also oxidized during high-temperature combustion. These last two processes lead to nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere, which are soon converted to nitric acid and then brought down to Earth as acid precipita tion (Chapter 19). Denitrification. Denitrification is a microbial process that occurs in soils and sediments depleted of oxygen. A number of microbes can take nitrate (which is highly oxidized) and use it as a substitute for oxygen. In so doing, the nitrogen is reduced (it gains electrons) to nitrogen gas and released back into the atmosphere. In sewage treatment systems, denitrification is promoted to remove nitrogen from wastewater before it is released into the environment (Chapter 20). Human Impacts. Human involvement in the nitrogen cycle is substantial. Many agricultural crops are legumes (peas, beans, soybeans, alfalfa), so they draw nitrogen from the air, thus increasing the rate of nitrogen fixation on land. Crops that are nonleguminous (corn, wheat, potatoes, cotton, and so on) are heavily fertilized with nitrogen derived from industrial fixation. Both processes benefit human welfare profoundly. Also, fossil fuel combustion fixes nitrogen from the air ( Figure 3\u201319). However, human actions more than double the rate at which nitrogen is moved from the atmosphere to the land. The consequences of this global nitrogen fertilization are serious. Nitric acid (and sulfuric acid, produced when sulfur is also released by burning fossil fuels) has destroyed thousands of lakes and ponds and caused extensive damage to forests (Chapter 19 ). Nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere contribute to ozone pollution, global climate change, and stratospheric ozone depletion (Chapter 18 ). Surplus nitrogen has led to the \u201cnitrogen saturation\u201d of many natural areas, whereby nitrogen can no longer be incorporated into living matter and is released into the soil. Washed into surface waters, nitrogen makes its way to estuaries and coastal areas of oceans, where, just like phosphorus, it triggers a series of events leading to eutrophication, resulting in dead seafood, detriments to human health, and areas of oceans that are unfit for fish (Chapter 20 ). This complex series of ecological effects is known as the nitrogen cascade, in recognition of the sequential impacts of Nr as it moves through environmental systems, creating problems as it goes. The Sulfur Cycle Sulfur is the last element we will investigate. Sulfur is important to living things because it is a component of many proteins, hormones, and vitamins. Sulfur is often linked in nature with oxygen atoms, as in sulfate (SO4) ( Figure 3\u201322) . Most of Earth\u2019s sulfur is found in rocks and minerals, including deep ocean sediments. The weathering of rocks and volcanic activity sends sulfur into the atmosphere or soil. Sulfur also gets into the air when fossil fuels are burned and when mined metals are processed. In soil, sulfate can be taken up by plants and microorganisms. In air, sulfur dioxide (SO2) contributes to acid rain when it combines with water vapor and forms sulfuric acid. Sulfates are added to water bodies as sulfur compounds fall from the atmosphere or are weathered from rocks. There they can be serious pollutants. Human Impacts. The largest human impact of the sulfur cycle is the addition of sulfur oxides to the atmosphere and the addition of sulfates to water. Unlike phosphorus and 3.5 The Cycling of Matter in Ecosystems 69 SUSTAINABILITY nitrogen, sulfur is not usually directly added to soils in order to improve their fertility. However, soil and water sulfate levels are increased by human action. Acid rain and water pollution are the major effects.", "For example, in heavily developed areas of the Everglades, the percent of sulfates in water is 60 times what it would normally be expected to be. Sulfate compound aerosols (small particles or drops) also play a role in the climate. They act to temporarily cool the atmosphere, although the compounds cause other problems when they fall to earth. Comparing the Cycles The four cycles we have looked at in depth differ in some important ways (Table 3\u20132) . Carbon is found in large amounts in the atmosphere in a form that can be directly taken in by plants, so carbon is rarely the limiting factor in the growth of vegetation. Both nitrogen and phosphorus are often limiting factors in ecosystems. Phosphorus has no gaseous atmospheric component (though it can be found in airborne dust particles) and thus, unless added to an ecosystem artificially, enters very slowly. Nitrogen is unique because of the importance of bacteria in driving the cycle forward. Sulfur can get into the atmosphere, but only for a short time. It is also different from the others because of its concentration in mining runoff. All four cycles have been sped up considerably by human actions. Nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere contribute to acid rain, and carbon dioxide is being moved from underground storage in carbon molecules to the atmosphere, where it acts as a greenhouse gas. Both nitrogen and phosphorus are put on soil as fertilizer or get into water from sewage and runoff. Both act in water to promote overgrowth of algae ( Chapter 20). Sulfur adds to acid rain and to water pollution. Although we have focused on carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulfur, cycles exist for oxygen, hydrogen, iron, and all the other elements that play a role in living things. While the routes taken by distinct elements may differ, all of the cycles are going on simultaneously, and all come together in the tissues of living things. As elements cycle through ecosystems, energy flows in from the Sun and through the living members of the ecosystems. The links between these two fundamental processes of ecosystem function are shown in Figure 3\u201323. In this chapter, we introduced the various fields of ecology and showed that the science of ecology encompasses living things and their relationships with each other and the environment. We looked at two ecological levels in greater detail in this chapter\u2014what is happening with individuals (organismal ecology) and what is happening to the large scale movement of matter and energy through the biosphere (ecosystem ecology). To understand the flow of matter and energy, we also included some background on the basics of atoms, molecules, and the laws of energy. Later, we will investigate the other subdisciplines of ecology introduced here, especially population ecology and community ecology.

Trunks swaying side to side, they seek out shrubs and grasses. Nearby, the indigenous people graze their herds of rangy cattle on the sparse, tough grasses. These pastoralists view the elephants as competitors that reduce the amount of food available to their cattle. The herders resent the elephants\u2019 use of the land, while the villagers fear that the elephants will trample their crops. Current Threats. Like many large, slow-growing animals, these elephants are increasingly rare.", "Numbering from 3 to 5 million at the start of the 20th century, today there are only 450,000 to 700,000. Loss of habitat is one reason for their decline. In addition, poachers kill them for their ivory, even though the ivory trade is illegal. A s climate change increases drought, elephants have to migrate farther and face more conflicts with humans than before. In 2014, a team of researchers from Elephants Without Borders began using light aircraft to document every group of elephants in the 13 sub-Saharan countries where 90% of savanna elephants live. Their initial findings documented the heavy poaching of elephants in numerous places. While the number of elephants is declining, another native species, the aggressive Sodom apple (Solanum campylacanthum), is increasing. Unfortunately for the herders, this weedy shrub is toxic to grazing animals such as cattle, sheep, and zebras. In Kenya, the eradication of the noxious Sodom apple is costing the government millions. A Win-Win Solution? In spite of the problems caused by the ongoing changes in East Africa, there is a small amount of good news. Unlike grazing animals, browsers such as elephants and impalas can eat the Sodom apple. In fact, elephants have a voracious appetite for the shrub, which may provide a Chapter 4 Learning Objectives 4.1 Dynamics of Natural Populations: Describe three models of the way populations grow and the graph that would illustrate each. 4.2 Limits on Populations: Identify factors that limit populations, including those that increase as populations become more dense (such as predation and resource limitation) and factors that are unrelated to population density. 4.3 Community Interactions: Define the types of interactions that can occur between species in a community and the effect of those interactions on each species. 4.4 Evolution as a Force for Change: Describe the major ideas in the theory of evolution, such as inheritance and natural selection, and list examples of adaptations that allow organisms to survive.

African savanna elephants can eat plants that are unpalatable to sheep and cattle. win-win situation for pastoralists and conservationists. New research shows that the presence of elephants and impalas increases the availability of grass in some places where domestic and wild animals coexist. The African elephant is a good example of the problems a declining species can face. Under changing environmental conditions, a species may adapt or find a new niche to exploit. 4.1 Dynamics of Natural Populations Like the African elephant in the savanna, each species in an ecosystem exists as a population; that is, each exists as a reproducing group. A population is a group of members of the same species living in an area, and the populations of different species living together in one area constitute a community (Chapter 3). Ecologists often want to know the pattern of change in the numbers of individuals in a population. In any population, this is easy to figure out if you have enough information. Births and immigration cause the population to grow, and deaths and emigration cause the population to shrink. This can be described by a simple equation: (Births 1 Immigration) 2 (Deaths 1 Emigration) 5 Change in population This equation shows the change in the size of the population, or population growth. If births plus immigration are more or less equal to deaths plus emigration, the population is said to be in equilibrium. There is no change in the size of the population, so the population growth is zero. But often, populations are either increasing or decreasing\u2014that is, their population growth is not zero. If you take the amount a population has changed and divide it by the time it had to change, you get the population growth rate. Imagine there is a very small population just coming into a new ecosystem. A scientist might want to know how many individuals there are right now, how fast the population will grow, or even what the future population size will be, using the current population and the growth rate. In order to calculate these parameters, scientists use population growth curves\u2014graphs of how populations grow. We will look at several examples that represent broad types of growth patterns. Population Growth Curves In a natural setting, the growth of a population can follow several patterns. A constant rate of population growth is the simplest type of growth to model.", "Although constant growth rarely occurs in nature, it serves as a good comparison to other growth patterns because it is so simple. Constant population growth is calculated by this equation: Starting population 1 (A constant 3 Time) 5 Ending population In this case, eating an invasive species opens up new resources for the elephant. But environmental changes may also put species in danger of extinction. In this chapter, we will look at how populations grow and what types of limitations populations can face. We will also see how populations of different species interact with each other, how species change over time, and how human activities can affect populations and groups of species. That is, the population at the end of a period of time is equal to the population at the beginning plus a constant multiplied by the number of time units. The blue line in Figure 4\u20131 illustrates constant population growth. Exponential Increase. Every species has the capacity to increase its population when conditions are favorable. For example, a beetle population growing in a bag of cereal could double every week (the first week 2, then 4, then 8, then 16 beetles). Such a series is called an exponential increase. In contrast to our first example of constant growth, exponential growth does not add a constant number of individuals to the population for each time period. Instead, the doubling time of the population remains constant. That is, if it takes two days to go from 8 beetles to 16 beetles, it will take two days to go from 1,000 beetles to 2,000 beetles. Such growth results in what is called a population explosion. If we plot numbers over time during an exponential increase, the pattern produced is commonly called a J-curve because of its shape (see the green line in Figure 4\u20131 ). To calculate the growth rate of a population undergoing exponential growth, you need to know the current size of the population, the period of time over which the population will grow, and the number of offspring individuals can Population Generations Figure 4\u20131 Three simple models of population growth. Constant growth is represented by the blue line, exponential growth by the green line, and logistic growth by the orange line. The black dotted line represents the carrying capacity. produce in a given amount of time if resources are unlimited. This last value is often designated rmax, or just r. The equation for exponential growth can be described as follows: Starting population 3 A constant (e) multiplied by itself a certain number of times 5 Ending population The number of times you multiply e by itself is equal to the value of r (the potential to produce offspring) multiplied by time. This means that under unlimited conditions, populations of organisms with a high r value will grow more rapidly than those with a low r value. Exponential growth can continue indefinitely only if there are no limits to the size the population can reach, but in nature this is extremely rare. There are a few times when exponential growth occurs in nature. A beetle population getting into a big sack of cereal is a good example of a population explosion. However, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. There is an upper limit to the population of any particular species that an ecosystem can support. This limit is called the carrying capacity (K) ( Figure 4\u20131). More precisely, the car rying capacity is the maximum population of a species that a given habitat can support without being degraded over the long term\u2014in other words, a sustainable system. Logistic Growth. As a population increases, one of two outcomes will eventually occur. One outcome is that the population will keep growing until it exhausts its essential resources, often food. Starvation or other problems will then cause the population to crash, or die off precipitously. Such a pattern of growth can be plotted as a J-curve followed by a steep drop, as shown by the green line in Figure 4\u20132. Alternatively, some processes may slow population growth so that the size of the population levels off. The Figure 4\u20132 Real-life growth. In real populations, exponential growth is often followed by a crash (green line), and logistic growth is often modified so that the population fluctuates around K (orange line). Real-life populations often do not follow idealized equations, but such simple models help us to understand possible outcomes. 4.1 Dynamics of Natural Populations 75 simplest version of this pattern is known as logistic growth.", "Plotting this type of growth on a graph results in an S-shaped curve, or S-curve, as shown by the orange line in Figure 4\u20131. The point at which the population levels off is the carrying capacity (K). The equation for logistic growth can be explained this way: Starting population 1 (Reproductive capacity (r) 3 Population 3 A number that represents how far the population is from carrying capacity) 5 Ending population There are two things to notice about the logistic growth curve. First, as the population nears its carrying capacity, the growth of the population slows until the population size remains steady; at this time the population growth equals zero. Second, the maximum rate of population growth occurs halfway to carrying capacity. If, for example, you were to monitor the number of beetles in a sack of grain, you would find that the maximum production of new beetles occurs when the beetle population is at half its carrying capacity, not at a larger or smaller number. Real-Life Growth. The population growth figures calculated using these simple models rarely match the exact growth figures found in real life, although many populations show J-shaped explosions followed by crashes (Figure 4\u20132). J-curves occur when there are unusual disturbances, such as the introduction of a foreign species, the elimination of a predator, or the sudden alteration of a habitat, all of which can allow the rapid growth of a population. This growth is, however, followed by some type of crash. In some cases, huge overshoots of carrying capacity (K) by one population result in a collapse of the habitat for many species. Other populations, often those controlled by complex relationships among species, show some type of S-curve, followed by cycles of lower and higher numbers roughly around carrying capacity. Many shoot somewhat above carrying capacity and then a little below, and eventually they cycle around the carrying capacity. This is illustrated by the orange line in Figure 4\u20132. Biotic Potential Versus Environmental Resistance The rate at which members of a species reproduce under unlimited conditions (which we saw in the equations above as r) is a measure of its biotic potential\u2014the number of offspring (live births, eggs laid, or seeds or spores set in plants) that members of a species can produce under ideal conditions. The biotic potentials of different species vary tremendously, averaging from less than one birth per year in certain mammals and birds to millions per year for many plants and some invertebrates. To have any effect on the size of subsequent generations, however, the young must survive and reproduce in turn. Survival through the early growth stages to become part of the breeding population is called recruitment. SUSTAINABILITY Culling ends Culling begins Elephants culled Elephant population 2000 Sometimes changes in the environment offer 16000 a natural experiment from which scientists can 1800 learn valuable lessons.

The ban on hunting al- Elephant population Elephants culled lowed the elephant population to increase rapidly. Because elephants grow slowly and have only a few offspring that require a great deal of parental care, they are not usually prone to 10000 1200 8000 1000 6000 rapid population growth. Yet during this period, the elephant population grew exponentially, its graph resembling a J-curve. In part, this growth 4000 occurred because the elephants were not able to break into smaller groups and spread out 2000 across the landscape. Habitat loss limited them from the vast ranges over which they would have traveled, leaving them crowded together in the park. Eventually the elephants depleted their food resources, resulting in starvation and damage to the park ecosystem. The concept of the \u201cbalance of nature\u201d\u2014that somehow natural forces would cause the elephant population to even out\u2014was not upheld because most of the elephants\u2019 natural predators had been reduced by hunting. Elephant population of Kruger National Park, South Africa. The elephant population exploded after hunting was stopped and the migration of elephants was restricted. Between 1967 and 1994, culling (selected killing) was used to stabilize populations, which rapidly rose once culling was stopped. 1. Which equation would you use to model the change in elephant population from 1923 to 1967? As scientists realized that the \u201cexperiment\u201d had not worked as expected and the elephants and their ecosystem were in danger, managers had to come up with another plan for controlling the elephant population.", "This situation provided an opportunity for another type of experiment: In order to compare the effectiveness of several management strategies, the park was divided into regions with different management plans. From 1967 to 1994, more than 16,000 elephants were culled from the population. A much smaller number were moved to new locations outside of the park. Unfortunately, hunting some of the adults left orphaned elephants and disrupted elephant 2. How many elephants lived in the park in 1973? How many were culled? (Hint: Use the two scales.) groups. In 1994, the practice of culling the herds was abandoned. After that, elephant numbers rose again. The impacts on biodiversity in the park, especially tree species, have been significant. Today wildlife managers are still attempting to control elephant populations and protect ecosystems in one of the only areas of the world where elephants aren\u2019t declining, but the problem of high elephant density is not yet solved. Strategies such as contraception and translocation have been less successful and more expensive than hoped. The elephants in Kruger National Park illustrate how even large, slow-growing species can undergo exponential growth. They also illustrate the difference between local and global populations\u2014elephants can be overabundant locally while they are quite rare globally. The story of the Kruger elephants also shows the difficulties of managing wildlife. Source: H. Biggs, ed., The Kruger Experi ence; Ecology and Management of Savanna Heterogeneity (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2003) and www.elephantdatabase.org. Environmental Resistance. Unlimited population growth is seldom seen in natural ecosystems because biotic and abiotic factors cause mortality (death) in populations. Among the biotic factors that cause mortality are predation, parasites, competition, and lack of food. Among the abiotic factors are unusual temperatures, moisture, light, salinity, and pH; lack of nutrients; and fire. The combination of all the biotic and abiotic factors that limit a population\u2019s increase is referred to as environmental resistance ( Figure 4\u20133) . Sometimes environmental resistance lowers the rate of reproduction as well as causing mortality directly. For example, the loss of suitable habitat often prevents animals from breeding; certain pollutants also affect reproduction adversely. Such situations are defined as environmental resistance because they either block a population\u2019s growth or cause its decline. Additionally, environmental resistance can cause migration patterns to change, as when animals leave a drought-stricken area. Migration can lower or increase local populations. 4.1 Dynamics of Natural Populations 77 o Figure 4\u20133 Biotic potential and environ mental resistance. A stable population in nature is the result of the interaction between factors tending to increase the population and Biotic Potential Reproductive rate Ability to migrate (animals) or disperse (seeds) Ability to invade new habitats Defense mechanisms Ability to cope with adverse conditions Environmental Resistance Lack of food or nutrients Lack of water Lack of suitable habitat Adverse weather conditions Predators Disease Parasites Competitors Reproductive Strategies. The interplay of environmental resistance and biotic potential drives the success of two common reproductive strategies in the natural world. The first is to produce massive numbers of young, but then leave survival to the whims of nature. This strategy often results in very low recruitment. Organisms with this strategy have life histories with rapid reproduction, rapid movement, and often a short life span. This strategy is highly successful if a species is adapted to an environment that can suddenly change and become very favorable, such as a rain-fed temporary pond. Organisms with this strategy are usually small and tend to have huge boom-and-bust populations. Because these organisms usually have a high r, they are called r-strategists or r-selected species. They are also called weedy or opportunistic species. One familiar r-strategist is the housefly, which multiplies very quickly but also has a high mortality rate. In contrast, the second strategy is to have a much lower reproductive rate (that is, a lower biotic potential) but to care for the young until they can compete for resources with adult members of the population. The savanna elephant is a good example of this strategy. This strategy works best where the environment is stable and already well populated by the species. Organisms with such a strategy are larger, longer lived, and well adapted to normal environmental fluctuations. Because their populations are more likely to fluctuate around the carrying capacity, such species are sometimes called K-strategists or K-selected species. They are also called equilibrial species (Table 4\u20131) .", "Characteristics such as the age at first reproduction and the length of life are a part of an organism\u2019s life history\u2014the progression of changes an organism undergoes in its life. Species such as the housefly and the elephant have very different life histories that reflect two extreme sets of adaptations. These life histories can be visualized in a graph called a survivorship curve, in which the number remaining from a group all born at the same time is shown decreasing over time until the maximum life span for the species Table 4\u20131 General Characteristics of r-strategists is reached. Some species, like humans, have relatively low mortality in early life, and most individuals live almost the full natural life span for that species. This survivorship pattern is depicted as Type I in Figure 4\u20134. Other species, such as dandelions and oysters, have many offspring; most of their offspring die young, so only a few live to the end of a life span. Such a life history pattern is called Type III survivorship. Generally, r-strategists show the Type III pattern and K-strategists show the Type I pattern. Some species are not easily defined as either r-strategists or K-strategists. They may also have an intermediate survivorship pattern, depicted as Type II. Squirrels and corals are likely to fall into this intermediate category. Species actually form a continuum of these survivorship curves, much as they do in terms of the characteristics of r-and K-strategists. We have examined species in decline, such as the savanna elephant. We will also study species experiencing rapid increase, such as pest species overtaking habitats (see Chapter 13). The reason we look at population growth equations is to show that there is a predictable connection between species characteristics, such as biotic potential (r), and patterns of growth lived out in different life histories. As we will see in Section 4.4, there are foreseeable ways that environmental pressures work on species with different biotic potentials. There is also a predictable pattern to the way species are affected by large-scale human activities. While there are many exceptions, it is often the case that r-strategists become pests when humans alter the environment and that K-strategists become more rare, endangered, or extinct. Houseflies, dandelions, and cockroaches increase with human activity, while elephants, eagles, and oaks decline. Some exceptions to this rule include rare opportunistic species (r-strategists) that are so separated from new habitat that in spite of a high biotic potential, they cannot succeed. Figure 4\u20134 Survivorship curves. Some organisms, 1,000 like humans (Type I), experience low mortality throughout their lives, and most live to old age. Others (Type III), represented by an oyster, have many offspring, most of which die early. Still others are intermediate (Type II), here represented by a squirrel. Type I and Type III roughly correspond to the K-strategists and 100 r-strategists. 10 1 0 Number of survivors (log scale) In sum, whether a population grows, remains stable, or decreases is the result of interplay between its biotic potential and environmental resistance. In general, a population\u2019s biotic potential remains constant; it is changes in environmental resistance that allow populations to increase or cause them to decrease. Population balance is a dynamic balance, which means that additions (births and immigration) and subtractions (deaths and emigration) are occurring continually, and the population may fluctuate around a median. Some populations fluctuate very little, whereas others fluctuate widely. As long as decreased populations restore their numbers and the ecosystem\u2019s capacity is not exceeded, the population is considered to be at equilibrium. CONCEPT CHECK Which kind of population growth curve would you expect to see in a population of squirrels in a forest? Which would you expect to see in ragweed growing on a construction site? Why? \u2610\u2713 4.2 Limits on Populations The carrying capacity of a habitat reflects how large a population can be sustained there, but it may not explain what is actually limiting the population. Sometimes limiting factors, such as crowding or disease, have a greater effect when there are more individuals in the population. The higher the population density (the number of individuals per unit area), the greater the role of that limiting factor. In other cases, the effect of a limiting factor is independent of the number of individuals in a population. For example, a tornado may reduce the number of trees in a forest, but the strength of the tornado has nothing to do with the density of the trees.", "We will see both of these types of limits in the next section. Age in relative units 4.2 Limits on Populations 79 Density Dependence and Independence Rabbits thrive in a field with lush grass. As rabbits become more plentiful, foxes and coyotes find it easier to catch and eat more of them and less of something else. This slows the population growth of the rabbits. In this example, predation acts as a density-dependent limit on a population. A density-dependent limit is one that increases as population density increases\u2014such as a disease or a food shortage. The environmental resistance caused by this limit increases mortality. Conversely, as population density decreases, the environmental resistance lessens, allowing the population to recover. Other factors in the environment that cause mortality are density-independent limits\u2014those whose effects are independent of the size of the population. For example, a fire that sweeps through a forest may kill all small mammals in its wake, regardless of their numbers. Such a fire is a density-independent cause of mortality. Although density-independent factors can be important sources of mortality, they are not involved in maintaining population equilibrium. In the natural world, a population is subject to the sum of all the biotic and abiotic environmental factors around it. Many of these factors may cause mortality, but only those that are density dependent are capable of regulating the population, or keeping it in equilibrium. Because logistic growth occurs when populations become more crowded (and as they approach their carrying capacity), logistic growth is sometimes referred to as density-dependent population growth. Environmental scientists distinguish between top-down and bottom-up regulation. Top-down regulation is the control of a population by predation, such as the control of rabbits by their predators, coyotes, or the control of deer by mountain lions (Figure 4\u20135a) . In bottom-up regulation, the most important control of a population is the availability of some resource, often food. For example, the bighorn sheep in Figure 4\u20135b are limited by the availability of grass, a form of bottom-up regulation. In natural ecosystems, the same species may experience top-down and bottom-up control at different times. Critical Number We\u2019ve discussed natural mechanisms that keep populations from growing indefinitely, but in nature, populations also decline. There is no guarantee that a population will recover from low numbers. Extinctions can and do occur. The survival and recovery of a population depend on a certain minimum population base, called the population\u2019s critical number. You can see a critical number at work in a pack of wolves, a flock of birds, or a school of fish. Often, the group is necessary to provide protection and support for its members. In some cases, the critical number is larger than a single pack or flock, because interactions between groups may be necessary as well. If a population is depleted below the critical number needed to provide such supporting interactions, the surviving members become more vulnerable, breeding fails, and extinction is almost inevitable. The loss of biodiversity is one of the most disturbing global environmental trends ( Chapter 1). Human activities are clearly responsible for the decline of many plants and animals. This is happening because many human impacts are not density dependent; they may even intensify as populations decline. Examples are alteration of habitats, introduction of alien species, pollution, hunting, and other forms of exploitation. In the United States, concern about the loss of species eventually led to the Endangered Species Act, which calls for the recovery of two categories of species. Species whose populations are declining rapidly are classified as threatened. If a population is near what scientists believe to be its critical number, the species may be classified as endangered. These definitions, when officially assigned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, set in motion a number of actions aimed at the recovery of the species in question (see Chapter 6). CONCEPT CHECK Herons limit the number of frogs in a pond. Is this a bottom-up or a top-down control? Is it a density-dependent or a density-independent control? \u2610\u2713 (b) (a) Figure 4\u20135 Top-down and bottom-up control. (a) Predators such as mountain lions control some deer populations, a form of top-down control. (b) The availability of grass controls the population of these bighorn sheep, a form of bottom-up control. 4.3 Community Interactions Now that we have described population growth as a dynamic interplay between biotic potential and environmental resistance, we can look at the ways populations of different species living together in a biotic community interact with one another.", "The relationships between two species may be helpful, or positive (1); harmful, or negative (2); or neutral (0) for each species. These relationships are depicted in Table 4\u20132. Some of these positive and negative effects stem from a kind of symbiosis\u2014a relationship in which the lives of two species are closely connected to each other. As we will see in several examples, symbionts have adaptations that make their relationship function. The name of each type of interaction is given in the table. For example, a relationship in which one member benefits and the other is harmed (12) is predation. Parasitism is a subset of predation, as is herbivory (animals eating plants). A (22) relationship is one in which both species are harmed. This would include competitive relationships where both species use a scarce resource. Competition occurs when two species or individuals rely on the same resource. In contrast, mutualism is a relationship between species in which both benefit (11). Commensalism occurs when one species is benefited and the other is not affected (1 0). The most important interactions are predation, competition, mutualism, and commensalism, but there are others. In amensalism, one species is unaffected and the other harmed (0 \u2013) through an accidental interaction, such as an elephant stepping on a flower or a plant making a poison as a part of its normal metabolism that harms another organism. Similarly, it is theoretically possible to have a (0 0) interaction, called neutralism, in which neither species is harmed or benefited. Presumably the interaction would be a weak one. Table 4\u20132 The Major Types of Interactions Between Two Species. Interactions can be defined by whether the impact on each species is positive, negative, or neutral. Interaction Effect on Effect on Name Species A Species B Example Predation 12 Wolves eat moose Competition 22 Two rabbit species eat the same grass Mutualism 11 Lichens (fungus/alga) Commensalism 1 0 Water buffalo/egret Amensalism 0 2 An elephant tramples a plant Neutralism 0 0 A fish in a stream and a sunflower in a valley Predation Now let\u2019s look in depth at predation, the most important interaction between species. In any relationship in which one organism feeds on another, the organism that does the feeding is called the predator and the organism that is fed on is called the prey. Predation is a conspicuous process in all ecosystems. Predation ranges from the predator-prey interactions between carnivores (meat eaters) and herbivores (plant eaters) to herbivores feeding on plants and parasites feeding on their hosts. Parasites: A Special Kind of Predator. Parasites are organisms\u2014either plants or animals\u2014that become intimately associated with their \u201cprey\u201d and feed on it over an extended period of time, usually without killing it. However, sometimes they weaken it so that it becomes more prone to being killed by predators or adverse conditions. The plant or animal that is fed on is called the host. Parasites include a range of species, such as tapeworms, microscopic disease-causing bacteria, viruses, protozoans, and fungi (Figure 4\u20136) . Parasites feed on their hosts in different ways. Tapeworms take energy from the intestine of a host animal, whereas parasitic plants tap into the sap of other plants. Parasitic organisms affect the populations of their host organisms in much the same way that predators affect their prey\u2014in a density-dependent manner. As the population density of the host increases, parasites and their vectors (agents that carry the parasites from one host to another, such as disease-carrying insects) have little trouble finding new hosts. Therefore, infection rates increase, causing higher mortality. Conversely, when the population density of the host is low, the transfer of infection is less efficient. This reduces the levels of infection and allows the host population to recover. A tremendous variety of organisms may be parasitic. Various worms are well-known examples, but certain protozoans, insects, and even mammals (vampire bats) and plants (dodder) are also parasites. Parasitic fungi cause many plant diseases and some animal diseases (such as athlete\u2019s foot, Figure 4\u20136d). Indeed, virtually every major group of organ isms has at least some members that are parasitic. Parasites may live inside or outside their hosts, as the examples shown in Figure 4\u20136 illustrate. In medicine, a distinction is generally made between bacteria and viruses that cause disease (known as pathogens) and parasites, which are usually larger organisms. Ecologically, however, there is no real distinction. Bacteria are foreign organisms, and viruses are organism-like entities feeding on, and multiplying in, their hosts over a period of time.", "Therefore, disease-causing bacteria and viruses can be considered highly specialized parasites. Regulation of Prey. Studies have shown that predators often regulate their herbivore prey; this is a type of top-down control. A well-documented example is the interaction between wolves and moose on Isle Royale, a 45-mile-long 4.3 Community Interactions 81 (a) (b) island in Lake Superior that is now a national park. During a hard winter around 1900, a small group of moose crossed lake ice to the island and stayed. In the absence of predators, their population grew considerably. Then, in 1949, a small pack of wolves also managed to reach the island. The isolation of the island provided an ideal opportunity to study a simple predator-prey system, and in 1958, wildlife biologists began carefully tracking the populations of the two species (Figure 4\u20137) . As the graph shows, a rise in the moose population is usually followed by a rise in the wolf population, followed by a decline in the moose population and then a decline in the wolf population. The data can be interpreted as follows: Fewer wolves represent low environmental resistance for the moose, so the moose population increases. Then the 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 Year Wolves (d) abundance of moose represents optimal conditions (low environmental resistance) for the wolves, and the wolf population increases. More wolves mean higher predation on the moose (high environmental resistance); again the moose population falls. The decline in the moose population is followed by a decline in the wolf population, because there are fewer prey (high environmental resistance) for the wolves. The dramatic fall in the moose population in 1996 cannot be attributed entirely to predation by the small number of wolves. That year deep snow (which makes it more difficult to get food) and an infestation of ticks caused substantial mortality. The sharp decline in the number of moose is thought to have been responsible for keeping the wolf population low, as there were few calves for them to catch. 2400 Figure 4\u20137 Predator-prey relationships. The fluctuations 2200 in the wolf and moose populations 2000 on Isle Royale are shown from 1800 1955 to 2014. 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 2000 2005 2010 2015 Moose Wolves are generally incapable of bringing down an adult moose in good physical condition. The animals they kill are the young and those weakened by another factor, such as sickness or old age. The observation that wolves are usually incapable of killing moose that are mature and in good physical condition is extremely significant. This is what often prevents predators from eliminating their prey. As the prey population is culled down to healthy individuals who can escape attack, their predators are limited by the availability of their crucial food resource. The predator population will decline unless it can switch to other prey. Meanwhile, the individuals in the prey population are healthy and can readily produce the next generation. Thus, the regulation of populations in a predator-prey relationship is both top-down (on the prey) and bottom-up (on the predator). A parasite may work in conjunction with a larger predator to control a given herbivore population. When a parasitic infection breaks out in a dense population of herbivores, predators can more easily remove individuals weakened by infection, leaving a smaller but healthier population. Relationships between a prey population and several natural enemies are generally much more stable and less prone to wide fluctuations than are those that involve only a single predator or parasite, because different predators and parasites come into play at different population densities. Plant-Herbivore Dynamics. Herbivores prey on plants. Just as too many wolves can bring the moose population dangerously low, too many herbivores can do the same to their plant food. In turn, when herbivore populations are low, their food plants encounter low environmental resistance and can overshoot their carrying capacity. These imbalances can lead to problems in the surrounding ecosystem. Overgrazing. If herbivores eat plants faster than they can grow, the plants will eventually be depleted, and animals that eat the plants will suffer. A classic example is the case of reindeer on St. Matthew Island, a 128-square-mile island in the Bering Sea. In 1944, a herd of 29 reindeer was brought to the island, where they had no predators.", "By 1963, this lack of predation had allowed the herd to increase to 6,000 individuals, although their food had nearly disappeared and most of the reindeer were malnourished. During the winter of 1963\u20131964, nearly the entire herd died of starvation; there were only 42 surviving animals in 1966. Overgrazing can often occur in agricultural systems ( Figure 4\u20138). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated that the world\u2019s cattle population increased from 720 million to 1.5 billion between 1950 and 2013; domestic sheep have also increased. These increases have caused overgrazing of more than 20% of rangeland. Overgrazing demonstrates that no population can escape ultimate limitation by environmental resistance, although the form of environmental resistance and the consequences may differ. If an herbivore population is not held in check, it may explode, overgraze, and then crash as a result of starvation (exhibiting a J-curve and subsequent drop). Figure 4\u20138 Plant-herbivore interaction: Overgrazing. Domestic animals such as these goats can overgraze land. Predator Removal. Eliminating predators or other natural enemies of herbivores upsets plant-herbivore relationships, just as introducing an animal without natural enemies disrupts normal population controls on the introduced species. In much of the United States, for example, wolves, mountain lions, and bears originally controlled white-tailed deer populations. Many of these predators were killed because they were believed to be a threat to livestock and humans. At present, deer populations in many areas would increase to the point of overgrazing if humans didn\u2019t hunt them in place of their natural predators. Indeed, population explosions do occur where hunting is prevented. Keystone Species. Sometimes the removal of a single species affects far more than just the other species with which it primarily interacts. For example, in the West Coast kelp forests, the sea otter (Enhydra lutris) eats sea urchins, which in turn eat kelp (Figure 4\u20139a) . Because sea otters control the sea urchin population, hundreds of other species, including the young of many fish, are able to survive in the kelp forests. By the early 20th century, overhunting of sea otters had broken this food chain, leaving the sea urchin population unchecked. Sea urchins ate kelp down to the sea floor, creating areas called \u201curchin barrens\u201d (Figure 4\u20139b) . Subsequent protection of the otters has allowed them to return, and they are again protecting the entire habitat. Scientists refer to the sea otter as a keystone species, in recognition of its crucial role in maintaining ecosystem biotic structure (in architecture, the keystone is a fundamental part of the support and structure of a building). The presence of the keystone species moderates other species that would otherwise take over the area (the sea urchin) or eat the most important species in the habitat (the kelp). Keystone species allow less-competitive species to flourish, thereby increasing overall diversity. Keystone species are such an integral part of their ecosystems that their removal can cause the collapse of the whole ecosystem. The sea otters in the West Coast kelp forest are predators, but this is not always the case with keystone species. For example, prairie dogs are herbivores, but they serve as a keystone species by digging burrows that provide essential 4.3 Community Interactions 83 (a) (b) Figure 4\u20139 Keystone species. (a) The sea otter eats sea urchins, which eat kelp in the Pacific Ocean along the Northwest Coast. (b) Without sea otters, the number of sea urchins increases, allowing them to overgraze the kelp. The resulting bare areas are called \u201curchin barrens,\u201d as seen in the foreground. habitats for many other prairie species. Beavers, which are also herbivores, were once a dominant ecological force in eastern North America, creating openings in forests and wetlands that provided habitats for many other species. The trapping of beavers for the fur industry removed beavers from much of the North American landscape, to the detriment of species that rely on small wetland meadows for their survival. Competition Recall from Table 4\u20132 that there are species interactions in which both species are harmed. This result usually means that the species are competing for some scarce resource. We have discussed the concept of each species having a niche, the condi tions and resources under which a species can live (Chapter 3). Species are said to have overlapping ecological niches when they compete with each other. Competition can also occur between members of the same species. Whether between species or between members of the same species, competition harms both participants.", "It lowers their fitness and their ability to produce offspring. In both types of competition, between and within species, you might expect that, over time, there would be a pressure to lower the overlap and have less negative interaction. Indeed, this is the case. Intraspecific Competition. Competition among members of the same species is called intraspecific competition. This type of competition can occur over different types of resources. Impact on the Species. In the short term, intraspecific competition can lead to the density-dependent regulation of a species\u2019 population through factors such as territoriality and self-thinning, a phenomenon whereby crowded organisms such as trees become less numerous as they grow bigger. Intraspecific competition can also lead to long-term changes as the species adapts to its environment. The observation that individuals compete for scarce resources led Charles Darwin to identify the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d as one of the forces in nature leading to evolutionary change in species. In any group of competing organisms, the individuals that are able to survive and reproduce, while others are not, demonstrate superior fitness to the environment. Indeed, every factor of environmental resistance is a selective pressure resulting in the survival and reproduction of those individuals with a genetic endowment that enables them to better cope with their surroundings. Those better able to compete are the ones who survive and reproduce, and their superior traits are passed on to successive generations. This is the essence of natural selection, which is discussed in Section 4.4. Territoriality. In many species, some members defend a territory, or limited space. Because territoriality is competition for space with resources, a lack of suitable territories is a density-dependent limitation on a population\u2014the larger the population grows, the more intense the competition for space becomes. The males of many species of songbirds claim a territory and defend it vigorously at the time of nesting. Their song warns other males to keep away ( Figure 4\u201310) . Figure 4\u201310 Territoriality. This male red-winged blackbird sings to defend his territory. The males of many carnivorous mammals, including dogs, stake out a territory by marking it with urine; the smell warns others to stay away. If other males do encroach, there may be a fight, but in most species, a large part of the battle is intimidation\u2014an actual fight rarely results in serious physical harm. While territoriality is usually associated with animals, some scientists consider plants, fungi, and other organisms to have territories under certain conditions. Territoriality may seem negative, but in many cases, it ensures that some members of the population will get enough resources to survive. What if the population had no territories? If so, when resources were scarce, every encounter with another member of the species could end in a potentially lethal fight. Instead of some members getting enough resources to raise the next generation, it might be possible for all members to get only a portion of what they need, and a large percentage\u2014or all\u2014of the population would die. Even so, most species do not show territoriality. They may have other adaptations to lessen negative interactions with others of the same species, such as increased rates of dispersal. Interspecific Competition. Now we turn to the effects of interspecific competition, the competition between members of different species. Consider a natural ecosystem that contains hundreds of species of plants, all competing for water, nutrients, and light. What prevents one plant species from driving out others? How do species survive competition? The most obvious answer is that sometimes they do not. If two species compete directly for the same resources, as sometimes occurs when a species is introduced from another continent, one of the two species generally perishes in Figure 4\u201311 Resource partition-60 ing. Five species of North American warblers experience less competition than it might first appear because they feed at different heights and in different parts of trees. 40 Blackburnian warbler 20 Bay-breasted warbler Foraging height (ft) the competition. This is the competitive exclusion principle. For example, the introduction of the European rabbit to Australia has led to the decline and disappearance of several small marsupial animal species due to direct competition for food and burrows. In fact, competitive exclusion would be expected to be the norm in circumstances where a habitat is very simple and species require the same resources. However, in nature, we often see similar species occupying the same habitats without becoming extinct. This unexpectedly high biodiversity has intrigued scientists.", "G. E. Hutchinson, a famous limnologist (a scientist who studies freshwater systems), once wrote a paper asking about this phenomenon: \u201cHomage to Santa Rosalia or Why Are There So Many Kinds of Animals?\u201d 1 Hutchinson suggested, and further work has supported, that the answer lies in variability over space and time. Differences in topography, type of soil, and other factors mean that the landscape is far from uniform, even within a single ecosystem. Instead, it is composed of numerous microclimates or microhabitats. The specific abiotic conditions such as moisture, temperature, and light differ from location to location and through the course of time. This is true even in lakes, where tiny pockets of water may have different temperatures, chemistry, or light conditions. Often just when one competitor begins to get the upper hand, the seasons change and a different species benefits. Thus, the adaptation of a species to particular conditions enables it to thrive and overcome its competitors in one location or time, but not in another. 1The American Naturalist, vol. XCIII, no. 870, May\u2013June 1959, 145\u2013159. Cape May warbler Black-throated green warbler Yellow-rumped warbler 0 4.3 Community Interactions 85 These examples simply mean that ecosystems are heterogeneous (variable) enough to support species with many different niches. Similarly, changes over time can allow multiple species to live in the same place. For example, many wildflowers of temperate deciduous forests (lady slippers, hepatica, trillium) sprout from perennial roots or bulbs in the early part of spring. While they would not be able to outcompete trees for light during the summer, these plants take advantage of the light that reaches the forest floor before the trees grow leaves. Species that seem to be in competition can coexist in the same habitat, but have separate niches. Competition is minimized because potential competitors are using different resources. For example, woodpeckers, which feed on insects in deadwood, do not compete with birds that feed on seeds. Bats and swallows both feed on flying insects, but they do not compete because bats feed on night-flying insects and swallows feed during the day. Sometimes the \u201cresource\u201d can be the space used by different species as they forage for food. This is illustrated in Figure 4\u201311 , which shows five species of warblers that coexist in the spruce forests of Maine. The birds feed at different levels in the trees and on different parts of the trees. This division is called resource partitioning\u2014the division of a resource and specialization in different parts of it. Subsequent study of these warblers has shown that when competition is more intense, they separate themselves even more. All of these examples show that species can live in the same habitat because their adaptations, including behavior, limit competition. By limiting competitive interactions, each species can put more energy into reproduction. However, the reason that many species can share a habitat is not simply because their niches prevent them from competing. Instead, when species live in the same place, their characteristics (physical as well as behavioral) may eventually change so that they use only a portion of their potential niche (which they could have used all of when living alone).

(b) These lichens are made up of fungi and algae living in mutualistic relationships. Mutualism In contrast to competition, mutualism is a relationship between two species from which both benefit. There are many mutualistic relationships. For example, the relationship between pollinators (such as bees, which receive nutrition from flowers) and the plants they pollinate (which receive pollination) is an example of mutualism (Figure 4\u201313a) . Some scientists estimate that 70% of plant species have mutualistic relationships with fungi connected to their roots.", "The fungi benefit from the food produced by the plants; in exchange, the fungi make it easier for the plants to take in nitrogen and other nutrients from the soil. Lichens are a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and an alga (Figure 4\u201313b) . One example of a mutualism between two animals is the relationship of the anemone fish and the sea anemone. The fish protects the anemone from predation by the butterfly fish, and in turn, the anemone\u2019s stinging tentacles (to which the anemone fish is immune) protect the fish from other predators. Commensalism Commensalism is more rare. It occurs when two species interact and one is benefited while the other is unaffected. The relationship between water buffalo and cattle egrets is an example: the grazer stirs up insect prey, and the birds follow it and eat the insects (Figure 4\u201314) . Commensalism also includes organisms that hitch rides on other species or grow on them for support without harming them. Many orchids grow on the branches and trunks of large trees, but do not feed on them as parasitic plants do. In contrast to commensalism is amensalism, where one species is harmed while the other is unaffected. Usually, this is accomplished by the natural chemical compounds produced by an organism, which are harmless to itself but harmful to other organisms around it. An example is the black walnut tree, which secretes a chemical compound from its roots that can harm or kill other plants in the area. In summary, the relationships between two species or between two members of one species can be described by the positive, negative, or neutral effects on the individuals. Ecologists study these potential outcomes. Relationships such as predation, competition, mutualism, and commensalism affect individuals, but are also part of the constant pressure that causes species to adapt to environmental change. CONCEPT CHECK How might the removal of a predator harm a community of a species? How might the removal of a competitor affect the community? \u2610\u2713 Figure 4\u201314 Commensalism. A cattle egret eats insects stirred up by a grazing water buffalo, which is neither harmed nor benefited by the egret\u2019s presence. 4.3 Community Interactions 87 SOUND SCIENCE How do scientists know what happened to species in the past? For the most part, they look at what happens today. They look for physical patterns and mechanisms and at DNA and other parts of cells to see patterns that suggest relationships. Darwin himself first observed evidence of past speciation. In 1835, during his famous voyage on the HMS Beagle, Darwin collected a number of finches from different islands of the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. Later, in consultation with ornithologist John Gould, Darwin speculated that differences in size and beak structure of the finches could have occurred after subpopulations of an original parental species were isolated from one another on separate islands. Although Darwin himself did not work out the details of how the different Gal\u00e1pagos finches evolved, modern scientists have found what looks to be the most likely Peter and Rosemary Grant Camarhynchus psittacula Geospiza difficilis Geospiza fulginosa seed crushers Camarhynchus parvulus Finchlike Warblerlike insect eaters insect eaters Ancestral South American finch Some of Darwin\u2019s finches. The similarities among these birds attest to their common ancestor. Selective pressures to feed on different foods have caused modification and speciation in subpopulations. (Source: From Biology: Life on Earth, 4th ed., by Teresa Audesirk and Gerald Audesirk, copyright \u00a9 1994 by Prentice Hall, Inc., reprinted by permission of Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458.) explanation. It is probable that at some time in the past, a few finches from the South American mainland were blown westward by a strong storm and became the first terrestrial birds to inhabit the relatively new (10,000-year-old) volcanic islands of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Later, some birds dispersed to nearby islands, where they were separated from the main population. These subpopulations encountered different selective pressures and became specialized for feeding on different resources, such as cactus fruit, insects, and seeds. In time, when the changed populations dispersed back to their original islands, they were different enough from the parent species that interbreeding among them did not occur, and the changed populations were distinguishable as new species. Peter and Rosemary Grant have studied the Gal\u00e1pagos finches for decades. They have investigated the fact that when the finch Geospiza magnirostris arrived on the same island as the similar species Geospiza fortis, the two species competed heavily for food seeds. Over 25 years of study", ", the scientists showed that the beak sizes of both species changed and competition was reduced as the finches began to eat slightly different-sized seeds. In populations where each species was alone, the beaks remained in a middle size. This is called character displacement, a physical change that lessens competition when two species co-occur (see Figure 4\u201312). The Grants have spent six months of every year in the Gal\u00e1pagos since 1973 and have studied the fates of hundreds of birds, taking blood samples and measurements. This type of careful study is useful in understanding how evolution occurs. 4.4 Evolution as a Force for Change Predation and competition are two mechanisms that keep natural populations under control. They also favor the survival of individuals with qualities that lower the impacts of negative interactions. Predators and prey become well adapted to each other\u2019s presence. Predators are rarely able to eliminate their prey species, largely because the prey has various defenses against its predators. Intraspecific competition is also a powerful force that can lead to improved adaptations of a species to its environment. Interspecific competition, by contrast, promotes adaptations that allow competing species to specialize in exploiting a resource. This specialization can lead to resource partitioning, which allows many potential competitors to share a basic resource\u2014such as water in the soil. For example, different species of prairie plants have various kinds of roots, such as long tap roots or short fibrous roots, that allow them to use water in different areas of the soil, as depicted in Figure 4\u201315. In this section, we discuss how these various adaptations have come about. Selective Pressure Most young plants and animals in nature do not survive, instead falling victim to various environmental resistance factors. These factors\u2014such as predators, parasites, drought, lack of food, and temperature extremes\u2014are known as selective pressures. Selective pressures affect which individuals survive and reproduce and which are eliminated. For example, animals 8\u00b4 2 3 6\u00b4 9 47 10 Feet 4\u00b4 8 1 6 5 2\u00b4 2\u00b4 4\u00b4 6\u00b4 8\u00b4 10\u00b4 Figure 4\u201315 Resource partitioning in plants. Some species of prairie plants have short fibrous roots and others have long taproots. These differences allow the different species to make use of water in different areas of the soil. Researchers found greater plant diversity with greater soil depth because new niches open up for plants with longer taproots. Figure 4\u201316 Cryptic coloration. The color and shape of this Indonesian green leaf insect help protect it from predation. with traits that allow them to escape from their predators (such as speed or coloration that blends in with the background) tend to survive and reproduce (Figure 4\u201316) . Those without such traits tend to become the predator\u2019s dinner. Any individual with a genetic trait that slows it down or makes it conspicuous will tend to be eaten. Thus, predators function as a selective pressure, favoring the survival of traits that enhance the prey\u2019s ability to escape or protect itself and causing the elimination of any traits handicapping the organism\u2019s escape. The need for food can also be seen as a selective pressure acting on the predator. Characteristics that enhance survival, such as keen eyesight and swift speed, benefit survival and reproduction. Sometimes predators use the ability to blend in as an advantage, too. The process of specific traits favoring the survival of certain individuals is known as natural selection. Discovered independently by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace, these concepts were first presented in detail by Darwin in his book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859). The modification of the gene pool of a species by natural selection over many generations is the substance of biological evolution. Darwin and Wallace deserve tremendous credit for constructing their theory purely from their own observations, without any knowledge of genetics. The role of genetic information wasn\u2019t discovered until several decades later. Our modern understanding of DNA, mutations, and genetics supports the theory of evolution by natural selection. Adaptations to the Environment The selective pressures exerted by environmental resistance continually test the gene pool of a population. Indeed, virtually all traits of an organism can be seen as features that adapt the organism for survival and reproduction, or, in Darwinian terms, fitness. Such characteristics of organisms include the adaptations needed for coping with climatic and other abiotic factors; obtaining nutrients, energy, and water; defending against predation and disease-causing or parasitic organisms; finding or attracting mates (or pollinating and setting seed); and migrating and dispersing.", "These categories of adaptations are summarized in Figure 4\u201317. 4.4 Evolution as a Force for Change 89 EXAMPLES OF ADAPTATIONS Animals Plants Figure 4\u201317 Adaptation for survival and reproduction. The five general features listed in the left column are essential for the continuation of every species. Each feature is found in each species as particular adaptations that enable the species to survive or reproduce. Across the various species, a multitude of adaptations will accomplish the same function. Thus, a tremendous diversity of species exists, with each species adapted in its own special way. The fundamental question about any trait is this: Does it increase survival and reproduction of the organism? If the answer is yes, the trait is likely to be maintained through natural selection. Consequently, various organisms have evolved different traits that accomplish the same function. For example, the ability to run fast, to fly, or to burrow, and protective features such as quills, thorns, or an obnoxious taste, all help reduce predation and can be found in various organisms. The Limits of Change. The savanna elephant is facing tremendous loss of habitat and pressure from poaching. With any change in its environment, a species may experience one of three outcomes: The critical question is: What factors determine whether a species will be able to adapt to new conditions instead of becoming extinct? Recall that adaptation occurs as a result of selective pressures that eliminate those individuals that cannot tolerate the new condition. For adaptation to occur, there must be some individuals with traits (alleles\u2014variations of genes or new combinations of genes) that enable them to survive and reproduce under the new conditions. There must also be enough survivors to maintain a viable breeding population. If a breeding population is maintained, the process of natural selection should lead to increased adaptation over successive generations. If a viable population is not maintained at any stage, extinction results. For example, by the early 1980s the California condor (a very large scavenger) had declined to about 20 birds because of deaths from poaching, lead poisoning, and habitat destruction. Only nine condors were left in the wild. To save the species from extinction, wildlife biologists captured the remaining wild condors and initiated a breeding program. As of August 2014, there were 434 condors, 202 of which were in captivity. This is still not a viable breeding population, but the wild condors are now forming pairs and nesting. Keys to Survival. Four key factors affect whether or not a viable population of individuals is likely to survive new conditions: (1) geographical distribution, (2) specialization to a given habitat or food supply, (3) genetic variation within the gene pool of the species, and (4) the reproductive rate relative to the rate of environmental change. Consider how these factors work. It is unlikely that any change will affect all locations equally. Therefore, a species such as the housefly\u2014which is present over most of Earth, has no requirements for a specialized habitat or food supply, and possesses a high degree of genetic variation\u2014is likely to survive almost any conceivable alteration in Earth\u2019s environment. The California condor, on the other hand, requires an extensive habitat of mountains and ravines, and the carcasses of large animals to eat, but has little genetic variation in its population. The less vulnerable species are likely to be r-strategists (described in Section 4.1). In fact, r-strategists move more easily, reproduce more quickly, and are generally more likely to become pest species (Chapter 13 ) or invasive. The more vulnerable species are likely to be K-strategists. The factors affecting survival of these two species types are summarized in Figure 4\u201318. However, many species fall somewhere in between these extremes. In some cases, even very rapidly reproducing species can be vulnerable if there is enough environmental change. Factors affecting survival of a species variation Figure 4\u201318 Vulnerable and highly adaptive species. Species differ broadly in their vulnerability to environmental changes. When confronted with rapid change in the environment, a housefly population is likely to explode and a condor population is likely to decline. 4.4 Evolution as a Force for Change 91 Genetic Change. Assuming the survival of a viable population, how fast can that population evolve further adaptations to enable it to better cope with new or changing conditions? Over the lifetime of the individual, there is no genetic change\u2014and hence no genetic adaptation.", "In the population, genetic variation is brought about over generations by a number of mechanisms, including hybridization, mutation, and crossover (a process by which sections of chromosomes are swapped). Bacteria, for example, readily exchange small bits of genetic material with other bacteria, and recent studies have shown that microbes sometimes insert their genetic material into other organisms, including mammals, bringing new DNA variations into the genome. Genetic variation is the norm in living things. The Evolution of Species. The newest estimates are that there are about 8.7 (1/2 1.3) million species of plants, animals, and microbes currently in existence, all living and functioning in ecosystems and all contributing to an amazing biodiversity. This estimate changes with new information because, of course, we haven\u2019t discovered most of the organisms that exist on Earth. However, biodiversity is diminishing because present species are becoming extinct faster than new species are appearing. In order to understand why, we need to understand how new species appear. The infusion of new variations from mutations and the pressures of natural selection serve to adapt a species to the biotic community and the environment in which it exists. Over time, in this process of adaptation, the final \u201cproduct\u201d\u2014 giraffe, anteater, or redwood tree\u2014may be so different from the population that started the process that it is considered a different species. This is one aspect of the process of speciation. Two Species from One. The same process also may result in two or more species developing from one original species. There are only two prerequisites. The first is that the original population must separate into smaller populations that do not interbreed with one another. This reproductive isolation is crucial because if the subpopulations continue to interbreed, all the genes will continue to mix through the entire population, keeping it as one species. The second prerequisite is that separated subpopulations must be exposed to different selective pressures. As the separated populations adapt to these pressures, they may gradually become so different that they no longer belong to the same species. Thus, they are unable to interbreed with one another, even if they come together again later. Consider the example of the arctic and gray foxes (Figure 4\u201319) . Long ago, they may have been part of a single ancestral population that was eventually separated by glaciation. In the Arctic, selective pressures favor individuals that have heavier fur (which protects them from the cold); shorter tails, legs, ears, and noses (the shortness helps conserve body heat); and white fur (which helps the animals hide in the snow). In the southern regions, selective pressures favor individuals with thinner fur, which dissipates excessive body heat, and coloring that blends in with darker surroundings. Over many generations, the geographic isolation of the two subpopulations made it possible for one ancestral fox population to develop into two separate species. New Species from Hybridization. As you might expect, we also see new species arise in real time today, and we have examples of species forming rapidly. The saltmarsh cordgrass, Spartina angelica, is one such species. It developed as a hybrid of two other related species: Spartina alterniflora, a native of North America, and Spartina maritima, a native of England. The two do not usually interbreed. Spartina alterniflora, accidentally introduced to England\u2019s mud flats, did not thrive there, but when it bred with Spartina maritima, the hybrid daughter species (S. angelica) spread rapidly. It has a different number of chromosomes from either parent and does not interbreed successfully with either parent species. Now, where there were two similar species, there are three, and the daughter species has a different set of characteristics and can live in a slightly different niche than either parent species. Descent with Modification. In sum, new species are not formed from scratch; they are formed only by the modification of existing species. Different selective pressures act on the constant variation of genetic material that naturally occurs. Combined with isolation and other processes (such as the unusual hybridization that occurred in the genus Spartina), new adaptations can arise. This concept is consistent with the observation that groups of closely related species are generally found in nature, instead of distinct species without close relatives. Patterns among larger groups suggest the same thing\u2014 that organisms can be grouped into large, closely related groups differentiated by older or newer characteristics.", "Although it can be difficult to imagine, overwhelming evidence from today and patterns from the past inform us that the present array of plants, animals, and microbes has developed through evolution over long periods of time and in every geographic area on Earth. This process is the source of our current biodiversity. Drifting Continents The geographic isolation of populations is the foundation of the process of speciation. The slow movement of Earth\u2019s continents has allowed the isolation of broad groups of organisms. Using evidence from geology, German scientist Alfred Wegener proposed in 1915 that about 225 million years ago the continents were connected into a giant landmass called Pangaea. (A modern map of Pangaea is shown in Figure 4\u201320a.) This is part of a theory that the continents have been in motion since Earth formed. Wegener\u2019s theory was hotly debated for decades until, by the mid-20th century, the evidence for drifting continents became irrefutable. His theory has blossomed into a grand theory known as plate tectonics. This theory helps us to understand earthquakes and volcanic activity and is key to understanding the geographic distribution of present-day biota. Moving Plates. Much of the interior of Earth is molten rock, kept hot by the radioactive decay of unstable isotopes remaining from the time when the solar system was formed (about 5 billion years ago). Earth\u2019s crust, the lithosphere\u2014which includes the bottoms of oceans as well as the continents\u2014is a relatively thin layer (ranging from 10 to 250 kilometers, or 16 to 160 miles) that can be visualized as huge slabs of rock floating on an elastic layer beneath. This is much like crackers floating next to each other in a bowl of soup. These slabs of rock are called tectonic plates. Some 14 major plates and a few minor ones make up the lithosphere (Figure 4\u201320b) . Within Earth\u2019s molten interior, hot material rises toward the surface and spreads out at some locations, while cooler material sinks toward the interior at other locations. Riding atop these convection currents, the plates move slowly, but inexorably, with respect to one another. The spreading process of the past 225 million years has broken up the original mass of Pangaea and brought the continents to their present positions. It also accounts for the other interactions between tectonic plates, such as volcanoes and earthquakes. The average rate of a plate\u2019s movement is about 6 centimeters (2.4 inches) per year, but over 100 million years, this adds up to almost 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) in the fastest-moving segments. The plate boundaries are locked by friction and hence are regions of major disturbances. Adjacent tectonic plates move with respect to each other by separating (as in mid-ocean ridges), sliding past each other (at fault lines like the San Andreas Fault in California), or colliding. These plate movements have large environmental effects. A catastrophic earthquake off the Pacific coast of To\u00af hoku, Japan, on March 11, 2011, resulted from the Pacific plate sliding under the North American plate, forming a rift under the sea floor 300 kilometers (186 miles) long, pulling eastern Japan closer to North America by 4 meters (13 feet) and even slightly changing Earth\u2019s axis. The sudden uplift triggered a powerful tsunami (tidal wave) that displaced an enormous quantity of seawater and sent waves up to 10 kilometers (6 miles) inland in the Sendai area of Japan. The tsunami triggered a number of nuclear accidents at the Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant (see Chapter 15). The earthquake and tsunami resulted in more than 15,845 deaths, with thousands more missing or injured. Collisions and Geologic Features. The movements of tectonic plates shape our world. Over geologic time, plate collisions produce volcanic mountain chains and uplift regions into mountain ranges similar to the way the hoods of colliding cars crumple. An example of mountains caused by this type of movement is the Himalayas. The fact that volcanic eruptions and earthquakes continue to occur is evidence that tectonic plates are continuing to move today, as they have over millions of years. In fact, volcanoes and earthquakes mark the boundaries between the plates and have provided some of the best evidence for the plate tectonic theory. Climate Shifts. In addition to the periodic catastrophic destruction that may be caused in localized regions by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, tectonic movement may gradually lead to major shifts in climate. This can occur in three ways. First, as continents gradually move to different positions on the globe, their climates change accordingly.", "Second, the movement of continents alters the direction and flow of ocean currents, which in turn have an effect on climate. Third, the uplifting of mountains alters the movement of air currents, which also affects climate. (For example, see the rain-shadow effect in Figure 10\u20137.) Increases in Diversity.

Christopherson, copyright \u00a9 2005 by Prentice Hall, Inc., reprinted by permission of Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458.) diversity. As continents moved to their present position, they isolated organisms into broad regions. Sometimes scientists divide the world into six zoogeographic regions\u2014areas of Earth\u2019s surface with distinctive animal groups. Australia, for example, is part of the Australasian region and is home to almost all of the world\u2019s marsupials\u2014animals with pouches. Australia is located on the Indo-Australian tectonic plate. Its separation from other continents appears to be very ancient, which explains why so many species in the Australasian region are unique: They have had millions of years to evolve separately from the species on other continental plates. Sometimes the place where several tectonic plates meet will have an unusual mix of species. For example, the country of Indonesia, which consists of about 17,000 islands, is located on the junction of three tectonic plates\u2014the Pacific, Eurasian, and Indo-Australian plates. The island of New Guinea (half of which belongs to Indonesia and half to the country of Papua New Guinea) is part of the Indo-Australian plate and has plants and animals similar to those in Australia. Other islands in the region have biota more like those in parts of Asia. The island of Sulawesi lies right on a boundary between plates and has been formed by islands being pushed together. It is home to an odd combination of animals and plants with relatives in far distant parts of the world. Because they have been isolated on islands, many Indonesian species have changed over time, developing adap tations not seen in their Asian or Australian relatives. Both Australia, long separated from other continents, and Indonesia have a high number of species that occur nowhere else in the world. Australia and Indonesia serve as examples of how long-term, large-scale changes, such as the movement of continents and the rise of islands, can increase the diversity of organisms. CONCEPT CHECK Would you expect evolutionary change to be more rapid on an island chain or on a large, flat continent? Why? \u2610\u2713 4.5 Implications for Management by Humans Ecologists study populations and communities for a number of reasons. One is simply to further our understanding of the world. Another is to better manage natural resources by protecting declining species such as the African elephant and the California condor and by controlling pest species such as the Sodom apple and spotted knapweed. It is also important for us to study our own impacts on populations, as many of the causes of explosive growth or decline in populations stem from human actions, such as the removal of an important species or the introduction of non-native species (pests will be covered in Chapter 13 and biodiver sity in Chapter 6) . Figure 4\u201321 Invasive animals. (a) Rodents such as this house mouse often overrun oceanic islands when they are introduced by ships.", "Invasive rodents are one of the chief causes of decline for sea birds. (b) This albatross chick is very vulnerable to rodent predators. Throughout this book, we will see many examples of species in decline. In later chapters we will discuss ways of conserving them, especially through captive breeding programs, habitat protection, and the prevention of the problems that cause them to decline. One such problem is introduced species. Introduced Species The Sodom apple described earlier is an \u201cencroacher,\u201d a native species that can increase rapidly and take over ecosystems when some environmental factor changes. In the savanna, overgrazing by domestic animals and the loss of browsers such as elephants have opened up areas where the toxic plant thrives. This demonstrates how populations of certain species that have been limited by interactions in their niche expand rapidly when those limits are removed. Humans have also altered population equilibria by introducing species from foreign ecosystems. These introductions alter community and population ecology relationships such as competition and predation. Over the past 500 years, and especially now that there is vast global commerce, thousands of species of plants, animals, and microbes have been accidentally or deliberately introduced onto new continents and islands. Most of the important insect pests we try to control\u2014Japanese beetles, fire ants, apple snails, and gypsy moths, for example\u2014are species introduced from other continents. A recent attempt to quantify the economic losses due to introduced species in the United States estimated the total cost to be in excess of $138 billion per year. Invading Organisms. In 2008, researchers on Gough Island in the South Atlantic were shocked to discover one of the biggest reasons for the decline of nesting sea birds: predation by mice (Figure 4\u201321) . Mice and rats have been introduced to thousands of oceanic islands by ships. Often, the descendants (a) (b) 4.5 Implications for Management by Humans 95 of those first immigrants grow to be much larger than ordinary members of the species. Researchers knew there were many rodents on sea bird colonies; however, they did not understand the impact of the rodents until they used infrared cameras to capture night images of nesting birds. There they saw the mice directly preying on much larger baby birds. Restoration of sea bird populations requires removal of these mice; such removal has been found to be effective in trial cases. While most people do not consider domestic cats to be pests, they are effective predators that have decimated small animal populations in places where they have been allowed to roam free. Indeed, cats are responsible for greatly diminished songbird populations in urban and suburban areas, including parks (Chapter 6) . Introduced plants can also cause ecological damage. One famous example is kudzu, a vigorous vine introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876. Initially used for animal fodder and erosion control, the quick-growing plant soon invaded forests. Today it occupies more than 3 million hectares (7 million acres) of the Deep South ( Figure 4\u201322) . Invasive fungi and other microbes can wreak havoc in new environments. Prior to 1900, the dominant tree in the eastern deciduous forests of the United States was the American chestnut, which was highly valued for its high-quality wood and its prolific production of chestnuts, eaten by wildlife and people alike. In 1904, however, a fungal disease called the chestnut blight was accidentally introduced into New York. The fungus spread through the forests, killing nearly every American chestnut tree by 1950. Exporting Problems. Invasive organisms may be exported as well as imported. In 1982, several species of jellyfish-like animals known as ctenophores were transported from the East Coast of the United States to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov in Eastern Europe. In the Sea of Azov, the ctenophores shut down fisheries by killing larval fish and depriving larger fish of food (Figure 4\u201323) . The ctenophores have also moved into the Mediterranean and Caspian Seas, along the Atlantic Coast of Europe, and have just begun to move into the North Sea. Most invasive species are not problems in their native lands. In a new setting, however, their impact is quite different. Over long periods of time, the species within each ecosystem have developed adaptations to the other organisms within their own ecosystem, but these adaptations do not prepare them to interact with species that have developed in other ecosystems. Figure 4\u201323 Introduced species.", "Ctenophores, originating along the Atlantic Coast in the southern United States and introduced into Europe, have destroyed fishing in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Remedies. Invasive species are such a concern for the health of ecosystems that there are state and federal agencies working to slow their entry and spread. The National Invasive Species Information Center, for example, acts as a clearinghouse of information on invasive species in the United States. The United States has a number of regulations about invasive species, including the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 and the National Invasive Species Act of 1996. Another solution to the takeover by an invasive species is to introduce a natural enemy. Indeed, this approach has been used in a number of cases, including in that of spotted knapweed (see Sound Science, The Biological Detective: The Case of Spotted Knapweed; other approaches are discussed in Chapter 13). Unfortunately, the natural enemy that is introduced may become an invasive pest itself. In short, to prevent doing more harm than good, a great deal of research needs to be done before a natural enemy is introduced. SOUND SCIENCE Ecological Lessons The regulation of populations is a matter of complex interactions among the members of the biotic community, and these relationships are specific to the organisms in each particular ecosystem. Therefore, when a species is transported over a physical barrier from one ecosystem to another, it is unlikely to fit into the framework of relationships in the new biotic community. In most cases, it finds the environmental resistance of the new system too severe and dies out. No harm is then done. In a small percentage of cases, the transported species becomes invasive. (Invasive species will be discussed again in Chapters 6, 7, and 13 .) Scientists use the lessons of population and community ecology to conserve species headed for extinction; they also use them to manage the species we harvest from wild populations.

Ecosystems: Energy, Patterns, and Disturbance Clouds of smoke and ash accompanied rumblings of the Earth as Iceland\u2019s volcano at Eyjafjallajull (\u201cEY-ya-fyat-lah-YOH-kuht\u201d) belched awake on April 14, 2010. The trembling that had affected the area over the previous month increased, and a billowing cloud of ash erupted into a plume that rose 9 kilometers (30,000 feet) into the air. The ash spread across Western Europe, clouding the sky and closing down all air travel for days; the largest air traffic disruption since World War II. Thousands of travelers were stranded as the volcano spewed particles and gases into the atmosphere. Ash fell on the ground for miles, making the grasses unfit for consumption by cattle and horses and making driving impossible. Even so, Eyjafjallajull was a moderate volcano, without the massive lava flows and mudslides that accompany many volcanic eruptions. People were relatively safe and, except for the cessation of air travel, life returned to normal quickly. Preparation. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo on June 15, 1991, in the Philippines was larger and had more-serious global effects. The eruption of this volcano, with no recorded history of eruptions, blew the top of the densely forested mountain into the air. This was the beginning of a process that spilled between 6 and 16 cubic kilometers of ash into the atmosphere, along with 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide and 10 billion metric tons of magma. Small particles known as aerosols were thrown into the air and traveled around the globe, blocking sunlight and lowering the global temperature by 0.5\u00b0C (0.9\u00b0F). More aerosols were produced by this volcanic eruption than any since Krakatoa in 1883. The sulfur found in the aerosols combined with water to form sulfuric acid, a component of acid rain.", "Fortunately, even though the volcano had not erupted in years prior to the event, scientists were able to predict that it would, and were able to prompt the largely successful evacuation of 60,000 people.

Chapter 5 Learning Objectives 5.1 Characteristics of Ecosystems: Describe how matter and energy flow through ecosystems by moving from one trophic level to another. 5.2 The Flow of Energy Through the Food Web: Explain three main ideas relating trophic pyramids with the relative numbers and biomasses of different levels in a food chain. 5.3 From Ecosystems to Global Biomes: Define and recognize characteristics of major broad regions called biomes, major aquatic regions, and factors that determine their placement on the globe. 5.4 Ecosystem Responses to Disturbance: Explain the effects of ecological disturbances, such as a fire or volcanic eruption, that are normal in ecosystems and can even be beneficial. 5.5 Human Values and Ecosystem Sustainability: Describe ways that humans alter ecosystem services, and explain why we need to manage ecosystems to protect their components from overuse. Unfortunately, people did die in the aftermath, when typhoon rains and wet ash caused roofs to collapse, and crowded emergency housing allowed diseases to spread. Today, years after the eruption, parts of Mount Pinatubo still lie denuded as periodic landslides move material down the hillside. Rebuilding. Volcanoes, triggered by the movements of tectonic plates, relieve pressure building under Earth\u2019s crust and spread minerals into the soil. The materials released by volcanoes are important parts of nutrient cycles. Volcanoes may build new lands altogether by causing islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands, to rise out of the ocean. Often, volcanic eruptions kill many of the organisms living in their immediate vicinity, but such organisms return and recolonize in a process of succession. In this chapter, we will look at ecosystems and how they function, including the processes that occur after a disturbance such as a wild fire, large flood, volcano, or retreat of a glacier. These processes offer us a chance to better understand the workings of an ecosystem. Earlier, the focus was on the components of ecosystems (Chapters 3 and 4). We considered the environmental conditions and resources required by living things, the basic movement of energy and nutrients that sustain living things, and how populations work and relate to populations of other species. In this chapter, we will look at how basic processes 5.1 Characteristics of Ecosystems Mt. Pinatubo is located on the island of Luzon in the Philippines, an area with one of the largest forests in the country. Luzon is also home to some of the few remaining individuals of the highly endangered Philippine eagle. We will look at this area to better understand the characteristics of ecosystems. The forest around Mt. Pinatubo, like all ecosystems, contains communities of interacting species and their abiotic factors. However, the species living in this ecosystem, or any other ecosystem, may function on very different scales, which makes it difficult to delineate a fixed boundary for ecosystems. For example, the lowland rain-forest ecosystem contains migratory birds that live there only seasonally. Some species inhabiting the ecosystem may also have little to no interaction with each other, such as the orchids high on branches of trees and organisms that live in leaf litter on the forest floor. The rain forest around Mt. Pinatubo contrasts sharply with the treeless spaces of Iceland, where Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull sent ash into the air. As we will see later in the chapter, what lives in an ecosystem is a function not only of characteristics of the regional climate, but of the landscape\u2019s history\u2014 including the actions of humans. Even so, there are predictable patterns to the distribution of ecosystems around the globe. Ecosystems that have a similar type of vegetation and similar climactic conditions are grouped into broader areas called biomes, such as the tropical rain-forest biome. (We will look at biomes in more depth in Section 5.4.) such as photosynthesis and respiration in individuals play out in complex systems and how energy moves from one part of the community to another. We will see how concepts such as ranges of tolerance and limiting factors, which we applied to individuals, apply to large groups and control their distributions over large portions of Earth. We will also look at how ecosystems change over time as a result of disturbances such as volcanoes. It is a popular belief that nature will be in balance if left alone.", "You will learn in this chapter, however, that an ecosystem is a dynamic system in which changes are constantly occurring. The notion of a balanced ecosystem, then, must be carefully defined. We will ask questions about balance, or equilibrium, in ecosystems: What does it mean for an ecosystem to be \u201cin balance\u201d? Are populations normally in a state of equilibrium? What happens when a major disturbance interrupts the \u201cbalance\u201d in an ecosystem? Our objective in this chapter is to examine more of the basic mechanisms that underlie the sustainability of all ecosystems, including those heavily influenced by human use. We will look at the values, goods, and services of ecosystems and their importance to humans. The chapter concludes with some perspectives on the challenge of managing ecosystems and a summary of ecosystem sustainability issues. The study of ecosystems allows us to understand concepts that cannot be predicted by understanding community interactions alone. For example, community relationships such as predation and parasitism (discussed in Chapter 4) provide the mechanisms for the flow of energy\u2014as well as the flow of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus\u2014through the natural world (discussed in Chapter 3 ). But these community relationships may not tell us about ecosystem properties, such as how much photosynthesis occurs in all plants or how much water can be absorbed by all of the plants at once. In this chapter, we will pull together the concepts presented in the previous two chapters, abiotic forces and biotic interactions, to look at characteristics of ecosystems\u2014specifically, trophic levels, productivity, and consumption. Trophic Levels, Food Chains, and Food Webs Imagine a grassy meadow containing a variety of plants. As discussed in previous chapters, plants use energy from the Sun through the process of photosynthesis to produce complex chemical chains from more-simple molecules such as carbon dioxide and water. These plants can then be eaten by their predators, such as rabbits, mice, or even cattle (remember that herbivory is a subset of predation). In turn, the mouse could be eaten by one of its predators, a hawk or a fox; the squirrel eaten by a snake; and the cattle eaten by a human. Energy in the form of chemical bonds and nutrients in the form of molecules in the bodies 5.1 Characteristics of Ecosystems 101 of the prey are then used by the next trophic level (feeding level)\u2014the predators\u2014for energy and other physiological needs. This breakdown of chemical bonds to release energy is called cellular respiration. Recall that plants need to respire, too. You can imagine two things from this. First, organisms can be linked into feeding chains\u2014the grass to the mouse, to the snake, to the hawk, for example. Such food chains describe where the energy and nutrients go as they move from one organism to another. We usually refer to this as energy moving \u201cup\u201d the food chain. Second, you can imagine that the energy and nutrients are not all passed up the chain from one level to the next. Because of the energy laws we discussed, there is inefficiency every time one organism eats another (Chapter 3). In natural ecosystems, food chains seldom exist as isolated entities. Mice feed on several kinds of plants, are preyed on by several kinds of animals, and so on. Some organisms, including humans, eat at more than one level in the food chain. Consequently, virtually all food chains are interconnected and form a complex web of feeding relationships\u2014the food web ( Figure 5\u20131) . Rather than simply asking what predators are eating snakes and how they affect the snake population or what mice are eating and how food availability affects mice, we ask different types of questions in ecosystem ecology\u2014those that focus on trophic levels in general, in order to study bigger trends in the movement of energy and materials. Examples of these questions include the following: How much of the Sun\u2019s energy do the plants in the meadow trap? How much do they use, and how much is available to plant eaters? How many predators can the ecosystem support? In order to answer these questions, ecologists divide members in the food web into categories. Trophic Categories All organisms can be categorized as either autotrophs or heterotrophs, depending on whether they produce the organic compounds they need to survive and grow. Green plants, photosynthetic single-celled organisms, and chemosynthetic bacteria are autotrophs (auto = self; troph = feeding) because they produce their own organic material from inorganic constituents in their environment through the use of an external energy source.", "They are also referred to as producers. Organisms that must consume organic material to obtain energy are heterotrophs (hetero = other; troph = feeding). Heterotrophs may be divided into numerous categories, the two major ones being consumers, which eat living prey, and decomposers, which break down dead organic material. Together, producers, consumers, and decomposers produce food, pass it along food chains, and return the starting materials to the abiotic environment. Figure 5\u20132 (on the following page) defines the major trophic categories. Decomposers: Producers Consumers organisms that feed on dead organic material Figure 5\u20132 Trophic categories. A summary of how living organisms are ecologically categorized according to how they get their energy. Producers. As we have seen, producers are organisms that capture energy from the Sun or from chemical reactions to convert carbon dioxide (CO2 ) to organic matter (Chapter 3). On land, most producers are green plants. Through the process of photosynthesis, plants use light energy to convert CO2 and water to organic compounds such as glucose (a sugar) and then release oxygen as a by-product. Plants use a variety of molecules to capture light energy in photosynthesis. The most predominant of these is chlorophyll, the green pigment that gives photosynthetic plants their color. In some producers, additional red or brown photosynthetic pigments may mask the green, as in red and brown algae. Producers range in size from microscopic organisms that are not plants such as photosynthetic bacteria and single-celled algae, through medium-sized plants such as grass, daisies, and cacti, to gigantic trees. Every major ecosystem, both aquatic and terrestrial, has its particular producers that are actively engaged in photosynthesis. While plants are the best known producers, researchers are finding that more photosynthesis is done by microbes than had been realized. In the ocean, there are tiny producers called microplankton, nanoplankton, and the even smaller picophytoplankton (Figure 5\u20133) . These autotrophs are eaten by tiny predators in a microscopic food chain. While they are small, their vast numbers make such tiny producers an important part of the ocean food web (Figure 5\u20134) . Figure 5\u20133 Picophytoplankton. These Prochlorococcus cyano-bacteria are extremely small, photosynthetic microbes that live in tropi-cal and subtropical oceans. In some locations there are as many as 100,000 cells per milliliter of sea water, making them possibly the most abundant photosynthetic organisms on Earth.

This simplified food web shows some of the relationships among organisms in the Beaufort Sea (north of Alaska and Canada) in spring. Zooplankton and phytoplankton are groups that include many species. Not all producers use the Sun\u2019s energy as the basis of their activities. Certain bacteria, including some that live in deep-sea communities, are able to use the energy in certain inorganic chemicals to form organic matter from CO2 and water. This process is called chemosynthesis, and the organisms using it are producers, too. Producers are absolutely essential to every ecosystem. The photosynthesis and growth of producers such as green plants constitute the primary production of organic matter, which sustains all other organisms in the ecosystem. Consumers. All consumers obtain their energy by feeding on organic matter. Consumers encompass a wide variety of organisms, ranging in size from plankton to blue whales. Among consumers are such diverse groups as protozoans, worms, fish, shellfish, insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals (including humans). Consumers can be divided into various subgroups according to their food source. Animals\u2014as large as elephants or as small as mites\u2014that feed directly on producers are called first-order consumers or herbivores (herb = grass). Animals that feed on first-order consumers are called second-order consumers. Thus, mice, which feed on vegetation, are first-order consumers, whereas snakes that feed on mice are second-order consumers (Figure 5\u20135) . There may also be third-order, fourth-order, or even higher levels of consumers. Many Third-order consumer Second-order consumer First-order consumer Producers Figure 5\u20135 Trophic levels in a grassland. A grassland community showing the producers (plants) and the first-, second-, and third-order consumers (mouse, snake, and hawk, respectively). animals occupy more than one position on the consumer scale.", "For instance, humans are first-order consumers when they eat vegetables, second-order consumers when they eat beef, and third-order consumers when they eat fish that feed on smaller fish that feed on algae. Second-order and higher-order consumers are also known as carnivores (carni = meat). Consumers that feed on both plants and animals are called omnivores (omni = all). Decomposers. A very large proportion of the primary producer trophic level is not consumed in the grazing food web. As this material dies (leaves drop, grasses wither, and so on), it is joined by the fecal wastes and dead bodies from higher trophic levels and is referred to as detritus. This represents the starting point for a separate food web. In many cases, most of the energy in an ecosystem flows through the detritus food web (Figure 5\u20136) . Detritus is composed largely of cellulose because it consists mostly of dead leaves, the woody parts of plants, and animal fecal wastes. Nevertheless, it is still organic and high in potential energy for those organisms that can digest it\u2014 namely, decomposers. Scavengers, such as vultures, help break down large pieces of organic matter; detritus feeders, such as earthworms, eat partially decomposing organic matter; and chemical decomposers (various species of fungi and bacteria as well as a few other microbes) break down dead material on the molecular scale. Decomposers act as any other consumer does, using the organic matter as a source of both energy and nutrients. Some, such as termites, can digest woody material because they maintain decomposer microorganisms in their guts in a mutualistic, symbiotic relationship. The termite (a detritus feeder) provides a cozy home for microbes (chemical decomposers) and takes in cellulose, which the microbes digest for both their own and the termites\u2019 benefit. The decomposers, breaking down detritus, serve as the primary consumers in this food chain. The detritus is similar to the \u201cproducer\u201d trophic level, and the decomposers have their own predators that form higher trophic levels. Most decomposers use oxygen for cellular respiration, which breaks detritus down into carbon dioxide, water, and mineral nutrients. However, some decomposers (certain bacteria and yeasts) meet their energy needs through the partial breakdown of glucose, which can occur in the absence of oxygen. This modified form of cellular respiration, called fermentation, results in end products such as ethyl alcohol, methane gas, and acetic acid. In nature, anaerobic, or oxygen-free, environments commonly exist in the sediments of lakes, marshes, and swamps and in the guts of animals, where oxygen does not penetrate readily. Methane gas is commonly produced in these locations. A number of large grazing animals, including cattle, maintain fermenting bacteria in their digestive systems in a mutualistic, symbiotic relationship similar to that just described for termites. As a result, both cattle and termites release methane. As decomposers digest detritus, they break the bonds in large organic molecules, releasing chemical energy, which they use to live and grow. They also break the bonds holding carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and other elements in the organic molecules, thereby releasing nutrients to their surroundings. The release of nutrients by decomposers is vitally important to primary consumers because it is the major source of nutrients in most ecosystems. Protozoans Pseudoscorpion Mite Springtail Soil, fungi Figure 5\u20136 Detritus food web. Several types of decomposers work to break up large, small, and tiny bits of dead organic matter. These organisms in turn are eaten by other, higher-level consumers. In the detritus food web, the role of the producer is played by dead plant and animal matter. 5.1 Characteristics of Ecosystems 105 Decomposers occur in the ocean as well as on land. Most of the decomposition in the ocean is carried out by picoheterotrophs\u2014tiny, single-celled eukaryotes, bacteria, or members of Archaea, a primitive group of bacteria-like organisms. While it is difficult to estimate their abundance, picoheterotrophs are common in the deep ocean from the tropics to the poles. Because they occur throughout such a large volume of water, their impact on nutrient recycling, particularly the carbon cycle, is substantial. 1 Limits on Trophic Levels How many trophic levels are there? Usually, there are no more than three or four in terrestrial ecosystems and some times five in marine systems (Figure 5\u20134). This answer comes from straightforward observations. If you were to capture all of the organisms on each trophic level over a particular area or volume, dry them, and weigh them, you would find 1E. Sclaechter, \u201cPico Who? Small Things Considered\u201d (2008): http://schaechter .asmblog.org/schaechter/2008/07/pico-who.html.", "a pattern: The biomass, or total combined (net dry) weight, would typically be about 90% less at each higher trophic level for a terrestrial ecosystem. For example, if you dried and weighed all of the grass and other producers in an acre of grassland, you might have 907 kilograms (1 ton or 2,000 lb.) per acre. If you could capture, dry, and weigh all of the herbivores (everything from grasshoppers to rabbits) in the same acre, you would find the biomass of herbivores would be about 90.7 kilograms (200 lb.) per acre. Following that pattern, the same acre would yield about 9.7 kilograms (20 lb.) of second-order consumers (animals living on grasshoppers and rabbits) if you captured, dried, and weighed them. At this rate, you can\u2019t go through very many trophic levels before the biomass approaches zero. If you graphed the different levels of producer and consumer mass, you would have a biomass pyramid similar to the one shown in Figure 5\u20137 . We\u2019ll see the reason for this pattern as we look at where energy and nutrients go. CONCEPT CHECK What is the trophic level of a shrew eating a grasshopper? Can you figure out the trophic level of a shrew eating an earthworm? What might make that difficult? \u2610\u2713 Segments of pyramid show relative biomass at each trophic level Figure 5\u20137 A biomass pyramid. A graphical representation of the biomass (the total combined mass of organisms) at successive trophic levels has the form of a pyramid, with about 10% of the energy contained in one trophic level being incorporated into the bodies of the next trophic level, giving each level a smaller biomass. UNDERSTANDING THE DATA 5.2 The Flow of Energy Through the Food Web In most ecosystems, sunlight (or solar energy) is the initial source of energy absorbed by producers through the process of photosynthesis. The only exceptions are rare ecosystems, such as those near the ocean floor, where the producers are chemosynthetic bacteria. Primary production\u2014the production of organic molecules from the Sun\u2019s energy through photosynthesis\u2014captures only about 2%, at most, of incoming solar energy. Even though this seems like a small fraction, the resulting terrestrial net production\u2014estimated at some 120 gigatons (billion metric tons, 1.1 billion U.S. tons) of organic matter per year\u2014is enough to fuel all of the life in a biome. In a given ecosystem, the actual biomass of primary producers at any given time is referred to as the standing-crop biomass. Both biomass and primary production vary greatly in different ecosystems. For example, a forested ecosystem maintains a very large biomass compared with tropical grassland because so much carbon is captured in the wood of trees. However, the rate of primary production could be higher in the grassland; grazing animals might simply eat the produced organic matter. Consequently, standing biomass is not always a good measure of productivity. The Fate of Food Whereas 60\u201390% of the food that consumers eat, digest, and absorb is oxidized (burned) for energy, the remaining 10\u201340%, which is converted to the body tissues of the consumer, is no less important. This is the fraction that enables a body to grow, maintain, and repair itself. A portion of what is ingested by consumers is not digested, but simply passes through the digestive system and out as fecal wastes. For consumers that eat plants, this waste is largely cellulose, the material of plant cell walls. It is often referred to as fiber, bulk, or roughage, and some of it is a necessary part of the diet. The intestines need to push some fiber through them so that they can stay clean and open. Waste products can also include compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, and any other elements present, in addition to the usual carbon dioxide and water. These by-products are excreted in the urine (or as similar waste in other kinds of animals) and returned to the environment. This process was illustrated previously (Chapter 3, Figure 3\u201317). Energy Flow and Efficiency As the biomass pyramid suggests, when energy flows from one trophic level to the next, only a small fraction is actually passed on. This is due to three things: (1) Much of the preceding trophic level is biomass that is not consumed by herbivores, (2) much of what is consumed is used as energy to fuel the heterotroph\u2019s cells and tissues, and (3) some of what is consumed is undigested and passes through the organism as waste (e.g., feces).", "Thus, there is a tremendous inefficiency at each trophic level, and energy is lost to the food web. In an ecosystem, therefore, only the portion of food that becomes the body tissue of the consumer can become food for the next organism in the food chain. Incorporating matter and energy from a lower trophic level into the body of a consumer is often referred to as secondary production, and like primary production, it can be expressed as a rate (the amount of growth of the consumer, or consumer trophic level) over time. The inefficiency of trophic levels means two things. First, individuals at higher levels in the biomass pyramid represent a greater amount of the Sun\u2019s energy for the same amount of body tissue. For example, it requires a great deal more photosynthesis to create a pound of hamburger than to create a pound of soybeans. This may be counterintuitive, because we just saw that there is less energy at each trophic level, but it requires a great deal more energy to produce a top-order consumer than a mid-level consumer and, likewise, more energy to produce a mid-level consumer than a producer of the same body weight. It usually also takes a longer time to produce a top-order consumer than a mid-level consumer or a producer. The top-order consumer also requires more water and other resources for a unit of body weight. In later chapters, as we look at food production in a crowded world, we will see why this matters. Second, some materials are difficult to get rid of (such as chemicals that dissolve in fat) and therefore bioaccumulate, or build up in an organism\u2019s tissues, remaining in its body throughout its life. These chemicals remain in the bodies of predators at higher rates than in their prey and thus biomagnify (become more concentrated) as you go up the food chain. This is the reason, as we will see later, that some toxins build up in the tissues of higher-order consumers such as eagles and tuna. Aquatic Systems For simplicity, the focus of this chapter has been on terrestrial ecosystems. Keep in mind, though, that the same processes occur in aquatic ecosystems. As aquatic plants and algae absorb dissolved carbon dioxide and mineral nutrients from the water, they use photosynthesis to produce food and dissolved oxygen that sustain consumers and other heterotrophs. Likewise, aquatic heterotrophs return carbon dioxide and mineral nutrients to the aquatic environment. There are two differences between aquatic and terrestrial systems in this regard, however. First, the transfer of energy is often more efficient in an aquatic system. There are also more cold-blooded animals here, and less energy is required to run the bodies of cold-blooded creatures than warmblooded creatures. It also takes less energy to support body weight in water than on land or in the air. Consequently, when less energy is used at each level, more energy is available to the next level, and food chains can be longer. Second, aquatic systems do not always have the same kind of biomass pyramid as terrestrial systems. If you could capture all of the organisms in part of an ocean ecosystem and dry and weigh them, you might sometimes find an inverse biomass pyramid, especially if you lumped some levels together (Figure 5\u20138) . The most widely supported explanation for this generally inverted pyramid is the relatively short life cycles of the organisms at the bottom of the food chain. Unlike the trees and other perennial plants that dominate most terrestrial Biomass of large fish Biomass of small fish Biomass of zooplankton (consumers) Biomass of phytoplankton (producers) Figure 5\u20138 Reverse pyramid in aquatic systems. At certain times, some aquatic ecosystems have a small amount of algae and a much greater biomass of large fish. This is because the turnover is very high and life spans are so short at the lower trophic levels. ecosystems, the producers in aquatic ecosystems are usually short-lived algae, while the animals at the top of the food chain, such as sharks and tuna, live far longer. The rapid growth and turnover of the algae allows them to produce a great deal of biomass. However, at any one moment, the biomass of the producers may sometimes be less than that of upper trophic levels. CONCEPT CHECK Which is more energy efficient\u2014feeding people with hamburgers or soyburgers? Why? \u2610\u2713 5.3 From Ecosystems to Biomes We have just seen how photosynthesis and basic energy laws translate into broad patterns in food chain lengths.", "Similarly, broad patterns in ecosystems translate into a pattern we see all over the globe: There is a predictable set of organisms that live under particular conditions, such as deserts occurring in dry areas and rain forests occurring in very wet areas. We can now use the concepts of optimums and limiting factors and the concepts of differences in light and productivity to gain a better understanding of why different regions may have distinct biotic communities, creating an amazing variety of ecosystems, landscapes, and biomes. A biome can be defined as a large geographical biotic community, controlled by climate. Biomes are usually named after the dominant type of vegetation, such as deciduous forest or grassland. The area around Yellowstone National Park is typically called the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Chapter 7). This ecosystem is contained within a vast geographical region, 5.3 From Ecosystems to Biomes 107 or biome, called the northern temperate forest. Like ecosystems, biomes have fuzzy edges. Aquatic areas such as the tidal zone and the open ocean can also be characterized by temperature and light and divided into categories. These are not always called biomes, but function similarly. The Role of Climate The climate of a given region is a description of the average temperature and precipitation\u2014the weather\u2014that may be expected on each day throughout the entire year. Climates in different parts of the world vary widely. Equatorial regions are continuously warm, with little seasonal change in temperature. Above and below the equator, temperatures become increasingly seasonal (characterized by warm or hot summers and cool or cold winters); the farther we go toward the poles, the longer and colder the winters become, until at the poles it is perpetually cold. Likewise, colder temperatures are found at higher elevations, so that there are even snowcapped mountains on or near the equator ( Figure 5\u20139). Annual precipitation in an area also may vary greatly, from virtually zero to well over 250 centimeters (100 in.) per year. Precipitation may be evenly distributed throughout the year or concentrated in certain months, dividing the year into wet and dry seasons. A given climate will support only those species that find the temperature and precipitation levels within their ranges of tolerance. Population densities will be greatest where conditions are optimal and will decrease as any condition departs from the optimum (Chapter 3, Figure 3\u20137). A species will be excluded from a region (or local areas) where any condition is beyond its limit of tolerance. How will this variation affect the biotic community? Ice and snow Increasing altitude from sea level Tundra Coniferous forest Temperate deciduous forest Tropical rain forest Increasing latitude from the equator Figure 5\u20139 Effects of latitude and altitude. Decreasing temperatures, which result in the biome shifts depicted, occur with both increasing latitude (distance from the equator) and increasing altitude. (Source: Redrawn from Geosystems, 5th ed., by Robert W. Christopherson. Copyright \u00a9 2005 by Pearson Prentice Hall, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458.) Terrestrial Biomes. Individual ranges of tolerance, particularly those for temperature and precipitation, determine where dominant species can live. In turn, the distribution of these species describes the placement of the biomes. To illustrate, let us consider some of the major types of biomes and their global distribution. Table 5\u20131 describes these terrestrial biomes and their major characteristics, and Figure 5\u201310 shows the distribution of the biomes as they occur globally. Scientists estimate that a lack of water limits plant growth on 40% of Earth\u2019s land, temperature limits plant growth on 33% of the land, and a lack of sunlight limits growth on the remaining 27%. 2 Within the temperate zone (between 30\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 of latitude), the amount of rainfall is the key limiting factor. The temperate deciduous forest biome is found where annual precipitation is 75\u2013200 centimeters (30\u201380 in.); temperate rain forests occur in a few areas where the rainfall is even higher. Where rainfall tapers off or is highly seasonal (25\u2013150 cm or 10\u201360 in. per year), the grassland and prairie biomes are found; savannas are tropical grasslands with a few trees or shrubs. Regions receiving an average of less than 25 centimeters (10 in.) per year are occupied by a desert biome. 2 R. Lindsay, \"Global Garden Gets Greener,\" Earth Observatory (2003): http:// earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalGarden/8/20/2014 The effect of temperature, the other dominant parameter of climate, is largely superimposed on that of rainfall.", "That is, 75 centimeters (30 in.) or more of rainfall per year will usually support a forest, and generally temperature will determine the type of forest that grows there. For example, broad-leaved evergreen species, which are extremely vigorous and fast growing but cannot tolerate freezing temperatures, predominate in the tropical rain forest. By dropping their leaves and becoming dormant each autumn, deciduous trees are well adapted to freezing temperatures. Therefore, wherever rainfall is sufficient, deciduous forests predominate in temperate latitudes. Most deciduous trees, however, cannot tolerate the extremely harsh winters and short summers that occur at higher latitudes and higher elevations. These northern regions and high elevations are occupied by the coniferous forest biome, because conifers are better adapted to those conditions. Temperature by itself limits forests only when it becomes low enough to cause permafrost (permanently frozen subsoil). Permafrost prevents the growth of trees, because roots cannot penetrate deeply enough in these conditions to provide adequate support. However, a number of grasses, clovers, and other small flowering plants can grow in the topsoil above permafrost. Consequently, where permafrost sets in, the coniferous forest biome gives way to the tundra biome (Table 5\u20131). At still colder temperatures, the tundra gives way to permanent snow and ice cover. 5.3 From Ecosystems to Biomes 109 Hot Temperature Cold Dry Precipitation Wet Figure 5\u201311 Climate and major biomes. Moisture is generally the overriding factor determining the type of biome that may be supported in a region. Given adequate moisture, an area will likely support a forest. Temperature, however, determines the kind of forest. The situation is similar for grasslands and deserts. At cooler temperatures, there is a shift toward less precipitation because lower temperatures reduce evaporative water loss. Temperature becomes the overriding factor only when it is low enough to sustain permafrost. (Source: Redrawn from Geosystems, 5th ed., by Robert W. Christopherson. Copyright \u00a9 2005 by Pearson Prentice Hall, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458.) Any region receiving less than 25 centimeters (10 in.) of rain per year will be a desert, but the unique plant and animal species found in hot deserts are different from those found in cold deserts. A summary of the relationship between biomes and temperature and rainfall conditions is given in Figure 5\u201311 . The average temperature for a region varies with both latitude (distance from equator) and altitude (distance from sea level), as shown in Figure 5\u20139. Examples of Aquatic Systems. There are major categories of aquatic and wetland ecosystems that are similar to terrestrial biomes. Aquatic systems are determined primarily by the depth, salinity, and permanence of water in them. Among these ecosystems are lakes, marshes, streams, rivers, estuaries, bays, and ocean systems. As units of study, these aquatic systems may be viewed as ecosystems, as parts of landscapes, or as major biome-like features such as seas or oceans. Table 5\u20132 lists several major aquatic systems and their primary characteristics. Microclimate and Other Abiotic Factors A specific site may have temperature and moisture conditions that are significantly different from the overall climate of the region in which it is located. For example, a south-facing slope, which receives more direct sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere, will be relatively warmer and hence drier than a north-facing slope. Similarly, the temperature range in a sheltered ravine will be narrower than that in a more exposed location, and so on. The conditions found in a specific localized area are referred to as the microclimate of that location. Conditions also change with elevation. If you hike up a mountain located in a grassland, you may pass through forests, and, above the tree line, you may find areas of permafrost. This pattern of changing habitat with elevation means that the tops of mountains function ecologically as if they were more polar than their actual latitude (Figure 5\u20139). 5.3 From Ecosystems to Biomes 111 Floodplain Continuously wet Figure 5\u201312 Microclimates. Abiotic factors such as terrain, wind, and type of soil create different microclimates by influencing temperature and moisture in localized areas. Soil type and topography contribute to the diversity found in a biome, because these two factors affect the availability of moisture. In the eastern United States, for example, oaks and hickories generally predominate on rocky, sandy soils and on hilltops, which retain little moisture, whereas beeches and maples grow on richer soils, which hold more moisture, and red maples and cedars inhabit low, swampy areas. Figure 5\u201312 illustrates several factors that influence microclimate.", "In the transitional region between desert and grassland, with 25\u201350 centimeters (10\u201320 in.) of rainfall per year, a soil capable of holding water will support grass, but a sandy soil with little ability to hold water will support only desert species. Biome Productivity All biomes have varying levels of primary productivity. Those that have high productivity may help support organisms from other biomes. For example, many seabirds migrate through salt marshes and live off the vast productivity there before traveling to other places. Highly productive biomes, like rain forests, also remove carbon dioxide from the atmo sphere and trap it (Chapter 18) . Biomes with high productivity aren\u2019t better than others, though. Low-productivity biomes can have other important roles, such as habitat for rare species. Why are some biomes or types of ecosystems more productive than others? Figure 5\u201313 presents (a) the average annual net primary productivity, (b) the percentage of different ecosystems over Earth\u2019s surface, and (c) the percentage of global net primary productivity attributed to 19 of the most important ecosystems. Some key relationships between abiotic factors and specific ecosystems can be seen in the data. Tropical rain forests both are highly productive and contribute considerably to global productivity; they cover a large area of the land and are characterized by ideal climatic conditions for photosynthesis\u2014warm temperatures and abundant rainfall. The open oceans cover 65% of Earth\u2019s surface, so they account for a large portion of global productivity, yet their actual rate of production is low enough that they are veritable biological deserts. Primary production in the oceans is limited by the scarcity of nutrients\u2014a good lesson in the significance of limiting factors. The seasonal effects of differences in latitude can also be seen by comparing productivity in tropical, temperate, and boreal (coniferous) forests. The biosphere consists of a great variety of environments, both aquatic and terrestrial. In each environment, plant, animal, and microbial species are adapted to all the abiotic factors. In addition, they are adapted to each other, in various feeding and nonfeeding relationships. Every ecosystem is tied to others through exchanges of air, water, and minerals common to the whole planet. CONCEPT CHECK A single species of prickly pear cactus grows in Arizona, in the plains of Montana, and along the coast of Rhode Island. Are these three places in the same biome? If not, why do you think this cactus is able to grow in all of them? \u2610\u2713 5.4 Ecosystem Responses to Disturbance 113 Algal beds and reefs Tropical rain forest Swamp and marsh Tropical seasonal forest Temperate evergreen forest Estuary Temperate deciduous forest Savanna Coniferous forest (taiga) Woodland and shrubland Cultivated land Temperate grassland Upwelling zones Continental shelf Lake and stream Tundra Open Ocean Desert and semidesert scrub Extreme desert, rock, sand, ice stands.

Driving succession plants grow from the soil, new trees sprout, and eventually forward by improving conditions for subsequent species is the original forest stands are replaced by new and different known as facilitation. The succession of species does not go on indefinitely. A stage of development is eventually reached in which there appears to be a dynamic balance between all of the species and the physical environment. In the past, this final state was called a climax ecosystem because the assemblage of species continues on in space and time. The term climax ecosystem is still used, but many ecologists are moving away from its use because they believe it implies more stability than actually occurs in nature. In the real world, even climax communities experience change. Also, within the area of a climax ecosystem there may be patches of disturbance that open spaces for new growth. Some parts of the ecosystem may be in an earlier stage of succession; sometimes there are several \u201cfinal\u201d stages, with adjoining ecosystems in the same environment at different stages. Three classic examples of succession are presented next: primary and secondary succession on land and succession in aquatic ecosystems. Primary Succession. If an area lacks plants and soil\u2014 such as might occur after volcanic eruption or the recession of a glacier\u2014the process of initial invasion and progression from one biotic community to the next is called primary succession. An example is the gradual invasion of a bare rock or gravel surface by what eventually becomes a climax forest ecosystem. Bare rock is an inhospitable environment. It has few places for seeds to lodge and germinate or for seedlings to survive. However, certain species, such as some mosses, are able to exploit this environment. Their tiny spores (specialized cells that function reproductively) can lodge and germinate in minute cracks, and moss can withstand severe drying simply by becoming dormant. With each bit of moisture, moss grows and gradually forms a mat that acts as a sieve, catching and holding soil particles as they are broken from the rock or as they blow or wash by. Thus, a layer of soil gradually accumulates, held in place by the moss (Figure 5\u201314) . The mat of moss and soil provides a suitable place for seeds of larger plants to lodge. The larger plants in turn collect and build additional soil, and eventually there is enough soil to support shrubs and trees. In the process, the fallen leaves and other litter from the larger plants smother and eliminate the moss and most of the smaller plants that initiated the process. Thus, there is a gradual succession from moss through small plants and, finally, to trees or whatever the regional climate supports, yielding the biomes typical of different climatic regions. Secondary Succession. When an area has been cleared by fire, human activity, or flooding and then left alone, plants and animals from the surrounding ecosystem may gradually reinvade the area\u2014through a series of distinct stages called secondary succession. The major difference between primary and secondary succession is that secondary succession starts with preexisting soil. Thus, the early, prolonged stages of soil building are bypassed. Hence, the process of reinvasion begins with different species. The steps leading from abandoned agricultural fields in the eastern United States back to deciduous forests provide a classic example of secondary succession (Figure 5\u201315) . Crab grass 0\u20131 year Tall grass-herbaceous plants 1\u20133 years Pines come in 3\u201310 years Pine forest 10\u201330 years Hard woods come in 30\u201370 years Hard wood forest climax 70+ years Figure 5\u201314 Primary succession on bare rock. Moss and lichens Figure 5\u201315 Secondary succession. When an agricultural field invade bare rock and act as collectors, accumulating a layer of soil in the eastern United States is abandoned, the communities of plants sufficient for complex plants to become established. that invade the field typically follow these stages. Figure 5\u201316 Aquatic succession. In this photograph, thick aquatic vegetation is filling in a shallow pond. Eventually, soil and dead plant matter may support terrestrial vegetation. Aquatic Succession. Natural succession also takes place in lakes or ponds. Succession occurs because soil particles inevitably erode from the land and settle out in ponds or lakes, gradually filling them.", "Aquatic vegetation produces detritus that also contributes to the filling process. As the buildup occurs, terrestrial species from the surrounding ecosystem can advance in the ecotone and aquatic species must move farther out into the lake. In time, the shoreline advances toward the center of the lake until, finally, the lake disappears altogether (Figure 5\u201316) . Here the climax ecosystem may be a bog or a forest. Disturbances such as droughts, floods, and erosion can send aquatic succession back to an earlier stage. Disturbance and Resilience In order for natural succession to occur, the spores and seeds of various invading plants and the breeding populations of various invading animals must already be present in the vicinity. Ecological succession is not a matter of new species developing or even old species adapting to new conditions; it is a matter of populations of existing species taking advantage of a new area as conditions become favorable. Where do these early-stage species come from if their usual fate is to be replaced by late-stage or climax species? They come from surrounding ecosystems in the early stages of succession. Similarly, the late-stage species are recruited from ecosystems in the later stages of succession. In any given landscape, therefore, all stages of succession are likely to be represented in the ecosystems. This is the case because disturbances constantly create gaps or patches in the landscape. When a variety of successional stages is present in a landscape, as opposed to one single climax stage, a greater diversity of 5.4 Ecosystem Responses to Disturbance 115 species can be expected; in other words, biodiversity is enhanced by disturbance. Fire and Succession. Fire is an abiotic factor that has particular relevance to succession. It is a major form of disturbance common to terrestrial ecosystems. About 80 years ago, forest managers interpreted the potential destructiveness of fire to mean that all fire was bad, whereupon they embarked on fire prevention programs that eliminated fires from many areas. Unexpectedly, fire prevention did not preserve all ecosystems in their existing state. In pine forests of the southeastern United States, for instance, economically worthless scrub oaks and other broad-leaved species began to displace the more valuable pines. Grasslands were gradually taken over by scrubby, woody species that hindered grazing. Pine forests of the western United States that were once clear and open became cluttered with the trunks and branches of trees that had died in the normal aging process. This deadwood became the breeding ground for wood-boring insects that proceeded to attack live trees. In California, the regeneration of redwood seedlings began to be blocked by the proliferation of broad-leaved species. Scientists now recognize that fire, which is often started by lightning, is a natural and important abiotic factor. As with all abiotic factors, different species have different degrees of tolerance to fire. In particular, the growing buds of grasses and pines are located deep among the leaves or needles, where they are protected from most fires. By contrast, the buds of broad-leaved species, such as oaks, are exposed, so they are sensitive to damage from fire. Consequently, in regions where these species coexist and compete, periodic fires tip the balance in favor of pines, grasses, or redwood trees. In relatively dry ecosystems, where natural decomposition is slow, fire may also help release nutrients from dead organic matter. Some plant species even depend on fire. The cones of lodgepole pine, for example, will not release their seeds until they have been scorched by fire (Figure 5\u201317) . Figure 5\u201317 Ground fire. Periodic ground fires are necessary to preserve the balance of pine forests. Such fires remove excessive fuel and kill competing species. Ecosystems that depend on the recurrence of fire to maintain their existence are referred to as fire climax ecosystems. The category includes various grasslands and pine forests. Fire is being increasingly used as a tool in the management of such ecosystems. In pine forests, if ground fires occur every few years, relatively little deadwood accumulates. With only small amounts of fuel, fires usually just burn along the ground, harming neither pines nor wildlife significantly. In the summer of 1988, fierce fires swept across Yellowstone National Park, burning thousands of acres and millions of trees. Drought and deadwood, which had accumulated during decades of fire suppression, combined to trigger a conflagration that was unprecedented in the history of the Park Service. Thousands of firefighters were involved in trying to stem the fires that swept across the landscape.", "These fires included fires on the ground and crown fires, which burn to the tops of canopy trees. Crown fires sometimes occur naturally because not every area is burned on a regular basis. In fact, exceedingly dry conditions can make a forest vulnerable to crown fires even when no large amounts of deadwood are present. Even crown fires, however, serve to clear deadwood and sickly trees, release nutrients, and provide for a fresh ecological start. Burned areas soon become productive meadows as secondary succession starts anew. Thus, periodic crown fires create a patchwork of meadows and forests at different stages of succession that lead to a more-varied, healthier habitat that supports a greater diversity of wildlife than does a uniform, aging conifer forest. Resilience. The ability of an ecosystem to return to normal functioning after a disturbance, such as a fire or flood, is called its resilience. Fire can appear to be a highly destructive disturbance to a forested landscape. Nevertheless, fire releases nutrients that nourish a new crop of plants, and in a short time, the burned area is repopulated with trees and is indistinguishable from the surrounding area. The processes of replenishment of nutrients, dispersion by surrounding plants and animals, rapid regrowth of plant cover, and succession to a forest can all be thought of as resilience mechanisms (Figure 5\u201318) . Resilience helps maintain the sustainability of ecosystems. A good example is the rapid recovery of the forests around Mount St. Helens after its 1980 eruption (Figure 5\u201319 ). Tipping Points. Ecosystem resilience has its limits, however. If certain species have been eliminated, natural succession may be blocked or modified. For example, Iceland was colonized by the Norse in the 11th century, and, as a result, trees were cut. By 1850, not a tree was left standing. Iceland had become a barren, tundra-like habitat (Figure 5\u201320) . Succession was unable to proceed naturally, and Iceland has remained treeless. As in Iceland, some disturbances are so profound that they overcome normal resilience mechanisms and create an entirely new and far less productive ecosystem. This new ecosystem Deforested area, used as pasture Disturbances Clearing & overgrazing Fire Resilience mechanisms Nutrient release to soil Regrowth by remnant roots and seeds Invasions from neighboring ecosystems Rapid restoration of energy flow and nutrient cycling Successional dynamics Mature forest (climax) Stage 2 Succession over time Stage 3 Stage 4 Resilience overcome by nature and severity of disturbances Stage 1 Figure 5\u201318 Resilience in ecosystems. Disturbances in ecosystems are usually ameliorated by a number of resilience mechanisms that restore normal ecosystem function in a short time. 5.4 Ecosystem Responses to Disturbance 117 Figure 5\u201319 Resilience after a volcanic eruption. The 1980 erup-tion of Mount St. Helens in Washington State killed most of the forest trees around it. By 1986, noble firs and other trees were returning to a slope on the mountain. Figure 5\u201320 Iceland. Forests that originally covered much of this island nation were totally stripped for fuel in the 18th and 19th centuries. With natural succession impossible, Iceland has remained barren and tundra-like, as seen here. can also have its own resilience mechanisms, which may resist any restoration to the original state. We can view this as a \u201ctipping point\u201d\u2014a situation in an ecosystem where a small action catalyzes a major change in the state of the system. Tipping points act as levers that can change a system to be better able\u2014or less able\u2014to function as an ecosystem. They stimulate the action of feedback loops, where system dynamics influence a system in ways that amplify (positive loop) or dampen (negative loop) the behavior of the system. For example, predator-prey cycles function as negative feedback loops that keep both populations from exploding in terms of numbers and then crashing. Removal of predators (to favor the prey species) would be a tipping point that could allow the positive feedback of prey reproduction to bring devastation to their plant food supply. You might wonder why it matters if an ecosystem such as the forests of Iceland moves into an alternative state, such as an Iceland with no trees, and stays there. After all, don\u2019t treeless, cold places exist? As we will see below, ecosystems provide a number of services valuable to humans and other species. These include large-scale effects such as lowering flood surges, maintaining soil, maintaining even ground temperatures, and taking up carbon dioxide. If just a few parts of the planet moved from one type of ecosystem to another, it really wouldn\u2019t matter.", "The problem is one of frequency. Large-scale human actions tend to lower ecosystem services such as flood control, wind-erosion control, and carbon dioxide storage. They tend to produce ecosystems either with very low productivity or with high primary productivity but low food chain length (such as a lake with too many nutrients). Such ecosystems tend to have less physical complexity and lower biological diversity. We will see this more when we discuss the problem of desertification (Chapter 11). Long-Term Ecosystem Studies. A great deal of our understanding of ecosystem changes comes from studies of changes in fields after fires, on mountain slopes after volcanoes, and near retreating glaciers. However, as human-caused changes to the environment have become global in scope, our studies have had to become longer and cover wider areas. Two ongoing research efforts of note help us to better understand ecosystems. The first is a system of ecosystems designated as Long-Term Ecological Research sites, funded by the National Science Foundation. These 26 sites are part of the largest ecological research network in the United States. They represent different types of ecosystems and different levels of human disturbance. Research projects at these sites focus on five core areas: Some of these sites, such as the Hubbard Brook Experimental Station, which was critical to the discovery of the problem of acid rain, have been studied for decades. The second ecosystem study initiative, funded by the National Science Foundation, is the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a network operating in the United States and Puerto Rico. It is a system for collecting data about ecosystems and climate, pulling them together, and making them available for scientists to study. The data will be available to the public as well. NEON enables researchers to understand the impacts of climate change, land-use change and invasive species the scale of a continent, by providing the infrastructure for large, long term studies. Planned for years, construction on NEON infrastructure was begun in 2011; eventually 106 sites will be part of the NEON network. CONCEPT CHECK What would you expect a landscape to look like if deforestation had reached a tipping point? Give an example where this has occurred. \u2610\u2713 5.5 Human Values and Ecosystem Sustainability Ecosystems have existed for millions of years, maintaining natural populations of biota and the processes that these carry out (which in turn sustain the ecosystems). One of the reasons for studying natural ecosystems is that they are models of sustainability. In this chapter, we started with trophic levels and then examined the flow of energy and nutrients in an ecosystem. These discussions have focused on how natural ecosystems work in theory. In reality, however, we depend on Earth\u2019s ecosystems for goods and services, also known as ecosystem capital. Is our use of natural and managed ecosystems a serious threat to their long-term sustainability? Many ecosystem scientists believe that it is. Appropriation of Energy Flow As we have seen, it is the Sun that energizes the processes of energy flow and nutrient cycling. Humans make heavy use of the energy that starts with sunlight and flows through natural and agricultural ecosystems. Agriculture, for example, provides most of our food. To produce food, we have converted almost 11% of Earth\u2019s land area from forest and grassland biomes to agricultural ecosystems. Grasslands sustain our domestic animals for labor, meat, wool, leather, and milk. Forest biomes provide us with 3.4 billion cubic meters (120 billion cubic feet) of wood annually for fuel, building material, and paper. Finally, some 12% of the world\u2019s energy consumption is derived directly from plant material, such as firewood and peat. Calculations of the total annual global net primary production of land ecosystems range around 120 petagrams 5.5 Human Values and Ecosystem Sustainability 119 (1 petagram = 1 billion metric tons) of dry matter, including agricultural as well as the more natural ecosystems ( Figure 5\u201321) . In 1986, researchers calculated that humans appropriate around 30% of this total production for agriculture, grazing, forestry, and human-occupied lands. 3 More-recent calculations have fine-tuned this figure. 4 These estimates indicate that humans are using a large fraction of the whole. Further, because humans convert many natural and agricultural lands to urban and suburban housing, highways, dumps, factories, and the like, we cancel out an additional 8% of potential primary production. Thus, we appropriate about 40% of the land\u2019s primary production to support human needs.", "In using this much, we have become the dominant biological force on Earth, despite representing about 5% of the biomass. Human use of land has become more efficient. An index called the human appropriation of net primary productivity (HANPP) is used to track human effects on ecosystems. Between 1910 and 2005, the human population quadrupled and economic activity increased 17-fold, but HANPP only doubled.5 However, these measurements 3 Peter Vitousek, Paul R. Ehrlich, Anne H. Ehrlich, and Pamela Matson, \u201cHuman Appropriation of the Products of Photosynthesis,\u201d BioScience 36, No. 6. (June 1986): 368\u2013373. 4 N. Ramankutty, A. T. Evan, C. Monfreda, and J. A.

Even so, the HANPP provides a useful way of picturing the global impact of human activities. Involvement in Nutrient Cycling Nutrients are replenished in ecosystems through the breakdown of organic compounds and the release of the chemicals that make them up\u2014processes we have described as biogeochemical cycles. This maintains the sustainability of ecosystems indefinitely. However, human intrusion into these natural cycles is substantial, and it is bound to increase. As we have seen, our alterations of the nutrient cycles have long-term consequences (Chapter 3 ). Climate change is one consequence of these alterations. In China, for example, dramatic changes have caused the nitrogen cycle to reach a tipping point. In ground-breaking research, scientists found that the use of nitrogen fertilizer was no longer increasing crop yields, but was instead increasing the release of a greenhouse gas that drives climate change (Chapter 18). Currently, global climate change is one of the most serious environmental issues facing society. The burning of fossil fuels has increased the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to the point where, by the mid\u201321st century, it will have doubled since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Methane is also released from the drying and decomposition of areas that used to be permafrost and Figure 5\u201321 Net primary productivity on land. Primary productivity varies greatly from biome to biome. NPP act represents the the amount of production left after the plants in a region use the energy they need to live, or the net primaryproduction of the actual vegetation. The total global NPP is 120 billion metric tons per year (1 billion metric tons = 1 petagram). (Source: H. Haberl et al. \u201cQuantifying and mapping the global human appropriation of net primary production in Earth\u2019s terrestrial ecosystem,\u201d PNAS. 104: (2007) 12942\u201312947.) from cattle. Because both carbon dioxide and methane are powerful greenhouse gases, a general warming of the atmosphere is occurring, leading to many other effects on Earth\u2019s climate (Chapter 20 ). Numerous ecosystems are being affected by the changes, and it is questionable whether they can function sustainably in the face of such rapid changes. The threat of disturbance on such an enormous scale is a major reason why many nations of the world have begun to take steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Value of Ecosystem Capital How much are natural ecosystems worth to us? To the poor in many developing countries, the products of natural ecosystems keep life going and may enable them to make economic gains that can lift them from deep poverty. Theirs is a direct and absolute dependence. For example, 1.6 billion people, many of them the world\u2019s poorest, depend on forests for much of their sustenance (in the form of fuel-wood, construction wood, wild fruits, herbs, animal fodder, and bush meat). Their access to these ecosystem goods is often uncertain. Those of us in the developed world, however, are susceptible to a very different perspective: We often assign little value to natural ecosystems and are unconcerned about (and insulated from) human impacts on natural ecosystems. This perspective can have dangerous consequences. Recall that we defined the goods and services we derive from natural systems as ecosystem capital (Chapter 1). In a first-ever attempt of its kind, a team of 13 natural scientists and economists collaborated in 1997 to produce a report titled \u201cThe Value of the World\u2019s Ecosystem Services and Natural Capital.\u201d", "6 Their reason for making such an effort was that the goods and services provided by natural ecosystems are not easily seen in the market (meaning the market economy that normally allows us to place value on things) or may not be in the market at all. Thus, clean air to breathe, the formation of soil, the breakdown of pollutants, and similar items never pass through and thus are not given a value by the market economy. People are often not even aware of their importance. Because of this, these things are undervalued or not valued at all. The major ecosystem services identified by the team, as well as the ecosystem functions that provide vital support to humans, are shown in Figure 5\u201322. The team made the point that it is useless to consider human welfare without these ecosystem services; thus in one sense, their value as a whole is infinite. However, the incremental value of each type of service can be calculated. That is, changes in the quantity or quality of a service may influence human welfare, and an economic value can be placed on that relationship. For example, removing a forest will affect the ability of the forest to provide lumber in the future, as well as to perform other services, such as soil formation and promotion of the hydro-logic cycle. The total economic value of these changes is the incremental cost of removing the forest. Later attempts to determine the value of the world\u2019s ecosystem capital have been based on the same concepts. In 2014 the same authors recalculated ecosystem goods and services to be worth $125 trillion per year (in 2011 dollars) and estimated that changes in land use had caused global economy losses of $4.3 to $20.2 trillion per year. 7 Using Ecosystem Value in Decision Making. The real power of the team\u2019s analysis lies in its use for making local decisions. For instance, the value of wetlands cannot be represented solely by the amount of soybeans that could be grown on the land if it were drained. Instead, wetlands provide other vital ecosystem services, and these should be balanced against the value of the soybeans in calculating the costs and benefits of a proposed change in land use. The bottom line of their analysis is, in their words, \u201cthat ecosystem services provide an important portion of the total contribution to human welfare on this planet.\u201d For this reason, the ecosystem capital stock (the ecosystems and the populations in them, including the lakes and wetlands) must be given adequate weight in public-policy decisions involving changes to that stock. Despite the great value of ecosystem services, because they are outside the market and uncertain, they are too often ignored or undervalued, and the net result is human changes to natural systems whose social costs far outweigh their benefits. For example, coastal mangrove forests in Thailand are often converted to shrimp farms, yet an analysis showed that the economic value of the forests (for timber, charcoal, storm protection, and fisheries support) exceeded the value of the shrimp farms by 70%. The Cost of Altering Ecosystems. In 2002, a new team looked at the 1997 team\u2019s calculation of value and examined the benefit-cost consequences of converting ecosystems to more-direct human uses (e.g., converting a wetland to a soybean field). 8 In every case, the net balance of value was a loss\u2014that is, services lost outweighed services gained. The team examined five different biomes and found consistent losses in ecosystem capital, running at \u20131.2% per year, representing an annual loss of $250 billion through habitat conversion alone. If the losses from conversion are so great, the authors asked, why is this conversion still happening? They suggested that the benefits of conversion were often exaggerated through various government subsidies, seriously distorting the market analysis. Thus, the market does not adequately measure many of the benefits from natural ecosystems, nor 7Robert Costanza et al., \u201cChanges in the Global Value of Ecosystem Services,\u201d Global Environmental Change 26 (2014): 152\u2013158. 6Robert Costanza et al., \u201cThe Value of the World\u2019s Ecosystem Services and 8Andrew Balmford et al., \u201cEconomic Reasons for Conserving Wild Nature,\u201d Natural Capital,\u201d Nature 387 (1997): 253\u2013260.

Can Ecosystems Be Restored? The human capacity for destroying ecosystems is well established. To some degree, however, we also have the capacity to restore them. In many cases, restoration simply involves stopping the abuse. For example, after pollution is curtailed, water quality often improves, and fish and shellfish gradually return to previously polluted lakes, rivers, and bays. Similarly, forests may gradually be restored to areas that have been cleared. Humans can speed up the process by seeding and planting seedling trees and by reintroducing populations of fish and animals that have been eliminated. In some cases, ecosystems have been destroyed or disturbed to such an extent that they require the efforts of a new breed of scientist: the restoration ecologist. Unfortunately, sometimes the ecosystem is too greatly disturbed for scientists to repair. In a prairie, for example, lack of grazing by native herbivores, overgrazing by cattle or sheep, and suppression of regular fires can lead to much woody vegetation. Exotic species may abound, and there may be no remnants of the original prairie grasses and herbs on the site. Such sites may take intensive efforts to bring back any native species or may continue in an alternative ecosystem. Why should we restore ecosystems? Restoration ecologists Steven Apfelbaum and Kim Chapman cite several important reasons. 9 First, we should do so for aesthetic reasons. Natural ecosystems are often beautiful, and the 9Steven I. Apfelbaum and Kim Alan Chapman, \u201cEcological Restoration: A Practical Approach,\u201d in Ecosystem Management: Applications for Sustainable Forest and Wildlife Resources, ed. Mark S. Boyce and Alan Haney (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1997). restoration of something beautiful and pleasing to the eye is a worthy project that can be uplifting to many people. Second, we should do so for the benefit of human use. The ecosystem services of a restored wetland, for example, can be enjoyed by present and future generations. The degradation of ecosystems robs them of their ecosystem capital, and restoring them returns their value. Finally, we should do so for the benefit of the species and ecosystems themselves. It can be argued that nature has value separate from human use and that people should act to preserve and restore ecosystems and species in order to preserve that value. Managing Ecosystems Virtually no ecosystem can escape human impact. We depend on ecosystems for vital goods and services\u2014and by using ecosystems, we are in fact managing them. Forests are a good example. Management can be a matter of fire suppression (or, more recently, controlled burns), clear-cutting, or selective harvesting. The objective of management can be to maximize profit from logging or to maintain the forest as a sustainable and diverse ecosystem that yields multiple products and services. Good ecosystem management is based on understanding how ecosystems function, how they respond to disturbances, and what goods and services they can best provide to the human societies living in or around them. Since 1992, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. National Park Service, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have all officially adopted ecosystem management as their management paradigm. What, then, is ecosystem management? Ecosystem management is composed of several main principles. First, it looks at ecosystems on both small and large scales. For example, the impact of logging on a single river and the impact of that logging on the entire watershed are both considered in managing the ecosystem. Good management preserves the range of possible landscapes in an ecosystem instead of allowing one type to take over the area. In addition, management is not static\u2014managers are given the opportunity to learn from experiments and to employ new knowledge from forestry and landscape science in their practice. Such \u201cmanagers\u201d can be volunteer land stewards or neighborhood groups, not just government agencies. As part of adapting to changing circumstances, management must also look at the human element of these ecosystems. The valuable goods and services of ecosystems are recognized, and through active involvement in monitoring and management, all stakeholders (all people with a stake in the ecosystem\u2019s health) are included as important elements in stewardship of the resources (see Stewardship, Local Control Helps Restore Woodlands). Above all, the paradigm incorporates the objective of ecological sustainability.", "The U.S. Forest Service is responsible for managing some 192 million acres (77.7 million hectares) of national forests and is a key player in overseeing public natural resources. A decade ago, the Forest Service convened an interdisciplinary committee of scientists for research-based recommendations on managing national lands. According to the committee\u2019s report, \u201cthe first priority for management is to retain and restore the ecological sustainability of watersheds, forests, and rangelands for present and future generations. The Committee believes that the policy of sustainability should be the guiding star for stewardship of the national forests and grasslands to assure the continuation of this array of benefits\u201d (referring to the goods and services provided by the national lands). 10 Internationally, the governing board of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment process examined the findings of the more than 1,350 experts who produced the many reports of the assessment and issued its own statement of the key messages to be derived from the process. The title of this work is significant: Living Beyond Our Means: Natural Assets and Human Well-Being. 11 In it, the authors emphasized that all of us depend on nature and ecosystem services for our very survival. As stated in the first few lines of this document: \u201cAt the heart of this assessment is a stark warning. Human activity is putting such strain on the natural functions of Earth that the ability of the planet\u2019s ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer be taken for granted.\u201d The following are some of the messages from the governing board: The Future As the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment described, the future growth of the human population and its rising consumption levels will severely challenge ecosystem sustainability. By 2050, the world\u2019s population is expected to increase by about 2 billion people (see Chapter 8). The needs and demands of this expanded human population will create unprecedented pressures on the ability of Earth\u2019s systems to provide goods and services. Demands on agriculture will likely require at least 15% more agricultural land; irrigated land area is expected to 10Committee of Scientists, Department of Agriculture, Sustaining the People\u2019s Lands: Recommendations for Stewardship of the National Forests and Grasslands into the Next Century (1999).

Available at www.millenniumassessment.org/en/Products.BoardStatement.aspx. 5.5 Human Values and Ecosystem Sustainability 123 increase to about 60% of all land that has irrigation potential, greatly stressing an already strained hydrologic cycle. Such growing demands cannot be met without facing serious trade-offs between different goods and services. More agricultural land means more food, but less forest\u2014and, therefore, less of the important services forests perform. More water for irrigation means more rivers will be diverted, so less water will be available for domestic use and for sustaining the riverine ecosystems. If we clearly understand the consequences of simply continuing present practices, we may choose other alternatives. We need to understand how essential natural and managed ecosystems are for human well-being and to bring to bear the wisdom and political will necessary to promote their sustainability. What are two things managers can do to better care for ecosystems?

Chapter 6 Learning Objectives 6.1 The Value of Wild Species and Biodiversity: Define and give examples of both the instrumental and intrinsic value of wild species.", "6.2 Biodiversity and Its Decline: Explain the causes, extent, relation to human activities, and impacts of the tremendous loss of species occurring today. 6.3 Saving Wild Species: Explain how cutting-edge science, policies for protection, and changes in the way people think can be used to protect wild species. 6.4 Protecting Biodiversity Internationally: Describe at least three international efforts to protect wild species. Wild Species and Biodiversity A brown river winds slowly past mangroves filled with flocking birds, carrying with it plankton, crustaceans, and young fish that will support a vast food chain. A fisherman in a boat casts a net to the side. The place is the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world. The long nose of a Ganges River dolphin breaks the water surface in the early morning mist. This endangered cetacean swims past mangrove roots and edges past a fishing net, its body narrowly avoiding entanglement. Threatened. This area of the Bay of Bengal, near the crowded coast of Bangladesh, is home to populations of two endangered cetaceans: the Ganges River dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica) and a related subspecies, the Indus River dolphin (Platanista gangetica minor). These rare beasts are nearly blind and swim sideways to get hints of sunlight through the water as they find their prey by echolocation. Freshwater dolphins, like their saltwater cousins, live on fish. Because they live in rivers instead of oceans, they are in some of the most populous areas of the world. These rivers may be highly polluted, heavily divided by dams, and crowded with fishers. River dolphins are among the most threatened large vertebrates in the world. In fact, another species of river dolphin, the Baiji, in China, was recently declared extinct, to the great sorrow of conservationists worldwide. The Baiji, nicknamed \u201cthe goddess of the Yangtze,\u201d declined because of loss of habitat, pollution, crowding, and injury from contact with fishing vessels, as well as overharvesting. The species, once spread throughout several large rivers in China, became rarer and rarer. In 2006, an extensive 45-day search by experts using sonar and other equipment failed to find any in the last areas the Baiji was known to inhabit, and it was declared extinct. The highly endangered Indus river dolphin lives in the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans, Bangladesh. Areas of Importance. Recently, to protect the Ganges and Indus river dolphins from the same fate, Bangladesh has identified dolphin hot spots, or areas of importance, within the sprawling Sundarbans mangrove forest. Three of these areas are being set aside as breeding and feeding areas for dolphins. Intensive multicountry protections are needed to keep these unique animals from further decline. In an area already crowded with people, protecting species may seem impossible, but it is important. The effort of the Bangladeshi government is a hopeful move in the right direction. 6.1 The Value of Wild Species and Biodiversity Recall that ecosystem capital is the sum of all the goods and services provided to human enterprises by natural systems (Chapter 1). This capital is enormously valuable to human kind. Robert Constanza and his coauthors estimated that the mean ecosystem capital in 1997 was $46.7 trillion (adjusted for 2009 dollars). In 2014, the same authors recalculated ecosystem goods and services at $125 trillion per year (in 2011 dollars). 1 (See Chapter 5.) The basis of much of our natural capital is ecosystems, and the basis of ecosystems is the plants, animals, and microbes\u2014the wild species\u2014that make them work. To maintain the sustainability of these ecosystems, their integrity must be preserved; this means maintaining their resilience, natural processes, and biodiversity, among other things. The protection of wild species and the ecosystems in which they live is therefore crucial. Even those who agree on the need to protect wild species, however, may disagree on the kind of protection that should be afforded to them. Some want wildlife protected so as to provide recreational hunting. Others feel strongly that hunting for sport should be banned. Many have a deeper concern for the ecological survival of wild species, and they view the ongoing loss of biodiversity as an impending tragedy. In the developing world, however, many collect or kill wild species in order to eat or make money, so their personal survival is at stake. All of these attitudes stem from the values we place on wild species. Can the differing values be reconciled in a way that leads to sustainable management of these important natural resources?", "Biological Wealth The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment states that about 2 million species of plants, animals, and microbes have been examined, named, and classified, but many more species have not yet been found or cataloged. Estimates of the total number of species on Earth range widely, from 5 to 30 million. One recent estimate is around 8.7 million (1/2 1.3 million), 1Robert Costanza et al., \u201cChanges in the Global Value of Ecosystem Services,\u201d Global Environmental Change 26(2014): 152\u2013158. 6.1 The Value of Wild Species and Biodiversity 127 The focus in this chapter is wild species. The world is experiencing a dramatic decline in wild organisms. This is such a concern that the United Nations has designated 2011\u2013 2020 the United Nations Decade of Biodiversity. While scientists can study individual species such as the Ganges River dolphin, they can also work on species decline in the context of biodiversity\u2014the variety of life on Earth. In this chapter, we consider the importance of biodiversity as a whole, as well as that of individual species, and look at the public policies that seek to protect wild species and biodiversity. although there is still little agreement about the total. About 15,000 new species are described each year. Between 2010 and 2013, 441 new species were discovered in the Amazon, an area rich in new species. In 2013, a carnivore called the olinguito (Bassaricyon neblina) was described in the remote cloud forests of Ecuador; the olinguito was identified after scientists realized it was different from similar, closely related species (Figure 6\u20131) . These natural species of living things, collectively referred to as biota, are responsible for the structure and maintenance of all ecosystems. They, and the ecosystems that they form, represent the biological wealth that makes up most of the ecosystem capital that sustains human life and economic activity with goods and services. From this perspective, the biota found in each country can represent a major component of the country\u2019s total wealth. More broadly, this richness of living species constitutes Earth\u2019s biodiversity. Humans have always depended on Earth\u2019s wild species for food and materials. Approximately 12,000 years ago, however, our ancestors began to select certain plant and animal species from the natural biota and propagate them, and the natural world has never been the same. Forests, savannas, and plains were converted to fields and pastures as the human population grew and human culture developed. In time, many living species were exploited to extinction, and others disappeared as their habitats were destroyed. The Center for Biological Diversity has reported that 631 species and subspecies went extinct in North America between 1642 and 2001. A recent report said that global biodiversity loss costs as much as $4.5 trillion a year. 2 We have been drawing down our biological wealth, with unknown consequences. One root source of this problem is the way we regard and value wild nature. Figure 6\u20131 Discovering new species. First identified in 2013, the olinguito (Bassaricyon neblina) from Ecuador was the first new carnivore to be described in the Western Hemisphere in 35 years. Two Kinds of Value In the 19th century, hunters on horseback could ride out to the vast herds of bison roaming the North American prairies and shoot them by the thousands, often taking only the tongues for markets back in the east. Plume hunters decimated the populations of egrets and other shorebirds to satisfy the demands of fashion in the late 1800s. Appalled at this wanton destruction, 19th-century naturalists called for an end to the slaughter, and the U.S. public became sensitized to the losses. People began to see natural species as worthy of preservation, and naturalists began to look for ways to justify their calls to conserve nature. Thus, there was an emerging sense that species should not be hunted to extinction. But why not? Their problem then, and ours now, is to establish the thesis that wild species have some value that makes it essential to preserve them. If we can identify that value, then we will be able to assess what our moral duties are in relation to wild species. Instrumental Value. Philosophers who have addressed this problem identify two kinds of value that should be considered. The first is instrumental value. A species or individual organism has instrumental value if its existence or use benefits some other entity (by providing food, shelter, or a source of income). This kind of value is usually anthropocentric; that is, the beneficiaries are human beings.", "Many species of plants and animals have instrumental value to humans and will tend to be preserved (conserved, that is) so that we can continue to enjoy the benefits derived from them. Intrinsic Value. The second kind of value that must be considered is intrinsic value. Something has intrinsic value when it has value for its own sake; that is, it does not have to be useful to us to possess value. How do we know that something has intrinsic value? This is a philosophical question and comes down to a matter of moral reasoning. People often disagree about intrinsic value, as illustrated by the controversies about the rights of animals. Some people argue that animals have certain rights and should be protected 2 Pavan Sukhdev, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (Interim Report funded by the German Ministry for Environment and the European Commission on the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity). Presented at the UN\u2019s Convention on Biological Diversity, November 2008. from being used for food, fur and hides, or experimentation. On the other side, some people hold that animals are simply property and have no rights at all. Others, probably the majority, hold an intermediate position: They agree that cruelty to animals is wrong, but they do not believe that animals should be given rights approaching those afforded to humans (Figure 6\u20132) . Many people believe that no species on Earth except Homo sapiens has any intrinsic value. Accordingly, they find it difficult to justify preserving species that are apparently insignificant. Still, in spite of the problems of establishing intrinsic value for species, there is growing support for preserving species that may appear useless to humans, even those that may never be seen by anyone except a few naturalists or taxonomists (biologists who classify organisms). The value of natural species can be categorized as follows: Sources for Food and Raw Materials Most of our food comes from agriculture, rather than being collected directly from wild populations, so it is tempting to falsely believe that food is independent of natural biota. In nature, both plants and animals are continuously subjected to the rigors of natural selection. Only the fittest survive. Consequently, wild populations have numerous traits for competitiveness, resistance to parasites, tolerance to adverse conditions, and other aspects of vigor. In contrast, populations grown for many generations under the \u201cpampered\u201d conditions of agriculture tend to lose these traits because they are selected for production, not resilience. For example, a high-producing plant that lacks resistance to drought is irrigated, and the resistance to Figure 6\u20132 Intrinsic value. Do species like this Blandings turtle have value separate from their value to humans? The question of intrinsic value is one of debate amongst philosophers. 6.1 The Value of Wild Species and Biodiversity 129 drought is ignored. Also, in the process of breeding plants for maximum production, virtually all genetic variation is eliminated. Indeed, the cultivated population is commonly called a cultivar (for cultivated variety), indicating that it is a highly selected strain of the original species, with a minimum of genetic variation. When provided with optimal water and fertilizer, cultivars produce outstanding yields under the specific climatic conditions to which they are adapted. With their minimum genetic variation, however, they have virtually no capacity to adapt to any other conditions. For example, winter wheat varieties with high yields may be less winter hardy or more prone to pests and disease. Wild Genes. To maintain vigor in cultivars and to adapt them to different climatic conditions, plant breeders comb wild populations of related species for the desired traits. When found, these traits are introduced into the cultivar through crossbreeding or, more recently, biotechnology (Chapter 12). For example, in the 1970s, the U.S. corn crop was saved from blight by genes from a related wild population of maize\u2014that is, from natural biota. There are also tremendous opportunities for controlling pests by increasing genetic resistance with genes from wild biota (Chapter 13 ). If wild populations are lost, the options for continued improvements in food plants will be greatly reduced. New Food Plants. The potential for developing new agricultural cultivars would also be lost if wild populations were destroyed. From the hundreds of thousands of plant species existing in nature, humans have used perhaps 7,000 in all, and modern agriculture has tended to focus on only about 30. Of these, three species\u2014wheat, maize (corn), and rice\u2014fulfill about 50% of global food demands.", "This limited diversity in agriculture makes modern plants ill suited to production under many different environmental conditions. For example, arid regions are generally considered to be unproductive without irrigation, but there are wild plants, including many wild species of the bean family, that produce abundantly under dry conditions. Scientists estimate that 30,000 plant species with edible parts could be brought into cultivation. Many of these could increase production in environments that are less than ideal. For example, every part of the winged bean, a native of New Guinea, is edible: pods, flowers, stems, roots, and leaves. Recently introduced into many developing countries, this legume has already contributed significantly to improving nutrition. Loss of biological diversity undercuts similar future opportunities. Woods and Other Raw Materials. Because species are selected from nature for animal husbandry, forestry, and aquaculture, essentially all the same arguments apply to those important enterprises, too. For example, nearly 3 billion people rely on wood for fuel for heating and cooking. Wood products rank behind only oil and natural gas as commodities on the world market. Demand for wood is increasing so rapidly that scientists are predicting a \u201ctimber famine\u201d or \u201cfuelwood crisis\u201d in the next decade. Products such as rubber, oils, nuts, fruits, spices, and gums also come from forests (Figure 6\u20133) . All of these products are part of the value of wild species for humans, and forests are only one example of ecosystems that provide wild and natural living resources. Figure 6\u20133 Forest products. These are all nonwood forest products developed to increase income in African forested areas. Such products are part of the instrumental value of tropical forests. (Source: FAO.) Banking Genes. Living organisms can be thought of as a bank in which the gene pools of all the species involved are deposited. Thus, biota is frequently referred to as a genetic bank. Because of concerns about agriculture, many scientists suggest that wild relatives of cultivated crops be conserved. In Kew, England, the Royal Botanic Gardens house the Millennium Seed Bank Partnership. Its goal is to house the seeds of 25% of the world\u2019s plants, some 75,000 species, by 2020. There is also the massive Svalbard Global Seed Vault, built into the permafrost deep in a mountain on a remote arctic island in Norway. This ultimate seed bank holds seeds that will act as a backup for the more than 1,000 seed banks around the world. In a similar way, zoos act as a genetic bank for animals, and many zoos are active in conservation and captive breeding. In the United Kingdom, the Frozen Ark Project is collecting cells and DNA from species likely to go extinct in the near future. This collaborative effort with organizations around the world is designed to preserve genetic diversity while we try to stabilize species and slow currently high extinction rates. Sources for Medicine Earth\u2019s genetic bank is also important for the field of medicine. For thousands of years, the indigenous people of the island of Madagascar used an obscure plant, the rosy periwinkle, in their folk medicine. If this plant, which grows only on Madagascar, had become extinct before 1960, hardly anyone outside Madagascar would have cared. In the 1960s, however, scientists extracted two chemicals with medicinal properties\u2014vincristine and vinblastine\u2014from the plant (Figure 6\u20134) . These chemicals have revolutionized the treatment of childhood leukemia and Hodgkin\u2019s disease. Before their discovery, leukemia was almost always fatal in children; today, with vincristine treatment, there is a 99% chance of remission. Figure 6\u20134 Medicinal plants. The rosy periwinkle, native to Madagascar, is a source of two anticancer agents that are highly successful in treating childhood leukemia and Hodgkin\u2019s disease. The story of the rosy periwinkle is just one of hundreds. Chinese star anise, a tree in the magnolia family, yields star-shaped fruits that are harvested and processed to produce shikimic acid, the raw material for making Tamiflu\u00ae, an effective treatment against influenza viruses. Paclitaxel (trade name Taxol\u00ae), an extract from the bark of the Pacific yew, has proven valuable for treating ovarian, breast, and small-cell cancers. For a time, this use threatened to decimate the Pacific yew because six trees were required to treat one patient for a year. Now, the substance can be extracted from the leaves of the English yew tree, or synthesized in a form that is easier for some patients to use. Stories like these have created a new appreciation for the field of ethnobotany, the study of the relationships between plants and people.", "To date, more than 3,000 plants have been identified as having anticancer properties. Drug companies have been financing field studies of the medicinal use of plants by indigenous peoples (called bioprospecting) for years. The search for beneficial drugs in the tropics has led to the creation of parks and reserves to promote the preservation of natural ecosystems that are home to both the indigenous people and the plants they use in traditional healing. In Surinam, for example, a consortium made up of drug companies, the U.S. government, and several conservationist and educational groups has created the Central Surinam Reserve, a 4-million-acre (1.64-million-hectare) protected area. Table 6\u20131 lists a number of well-established drugs that were discovered as a result of analyzing the chemical properties of plants used by traditional healers. Who knows what other medicinal cures are out there? Recreational, Aesthetic, and Scientific Value The species in natural ecosystems also provide the foundation for numerous recreational and aesthetic interests, ranging from sportfishing and hunting to hiking, camping, bird-watching, photography, and more (Figure 6\u20135) . These activities involve a great number of people and represent a huge economic enterprise. One nonprofit, the Outdoor Foundation, produces an annual report on 6.1 The Value of Wild Species and Biodiversity 131 Figure 6\u20135 Recreational, aesthetic, and scientific uses. Natural biota provides numerous values, a few of which are depicted here. outdoor recreation. In 2012, it reported that almost 150 million Americans (nearly half of the population) participated in outdoor recreation. This translated into nearly 12.4 billion outdoor excursions, with the most popular being jogging and trail running. Very likely, much of the public support for preserving wild species and habitats stems from the aesthetic and recreational enjoyment people derive from them. Recreational and aesthetic values constitute a very important source of support for maintaining wild species, because activities inspired by these values also support commercial interests. Ecotourism\u2014whereby tourists visit a place in order to observe wild species or unique ecological sites\u2014 represents the largest foreign-exchange-generating enterprise in many developing countries. Because some percentage of recreational dollars will be spent on activities related to the natural environment, any degradation of that environment affects commercial interests. Scientific value comes from our need to have living things available so we can learn basic laws of nature, the way ecosystems function, and the way the world works generally. Societies have long held that such \u201cpure science\u201d is valuable. Many scientists are engaged in this endeavor by sheer curiosity about the world, including about the functioning of individual types of organisms. Realistically, though, most of the science done with these species aims for more pragmatic goals\u2014new medicines, protection from gene loss in agriculture and forestry, and other outcomes already discussed. A Cautionary Note. The use of wild species and biodiversity for instrumental value can raise some problems of justice as we navigate the needs of people with competing claims. For example, while the rosy periwinkle was a success story because of its effectiveness in combating cancer, little of the money returned to Madagascar, a very poor country. In other cases, such as the case of turmeric (a spice commonly used in India), ancient herbal remedies have been patented by large companies. While the patent on turmeric was eventually overturned, the patent on the rosy periwinkle was not, and money from the rosy periwinkle came to Madagascar only when the patent ran out. The indigenous people in the areas where biodiversity is highest may not be the ones to benefit from their resources. The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing is a recent international treaty designed to protect the interests of indigenous peoples as products are discovered in wild sources (Section 6\u20134). Similarly, ecotourism may bring money to poor areas of the world, but such tourism can also increase pollution, directly harm wildlife, or alter local societies in negative ways. For example, whale-watching boats on the St. Lawrence River disrupt the feeding of whales. Tourist boats on Mexican lakes frighten flocks of flamingoes and reduce their feeding time. Popular bird song apps for smart phones can distract birds so much that chicks may not get enough food from their parents. Ecotourism can marginalize indigenous people as part of the scenery, or they can remain poor while tourism operators gain wealth. Nonetheless, there is sustainable tourism, and people intending to travel in the hopes of promoting conservation can find tourism that is done well. The Loss of Instrumental Value.", "Overall, a loss of biodiversity has a tremendous negative effect on the world in real, practical ways. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) report, released in May 2008, was the first international report to detail the economic and life-quality effects of biodiversity loss. Researchers have shown that the costs of the loss of biodiversity are higher for the world\u2019s poorest people. In fact, continued loss of biological diversity could halve the income of the poorest billion and a half people. One example of this loss of income occurred after a massive coral bleaching event in the Indian Ocean in 1998. It is estimated that the loss of food, jobs, tourism, and coastal protection will cost a total of $8 billion by 2018. Because the people who benefit most from the rapid use of resources are not the people who are most harmed by the loss of those resources, many ethicists believe such an outcome to be morally wrong. Thus, even the instrumental values of Earth\u2019s resources have an ethical component. Value for Their Own Sake The usefulness (instrumental value) of many wild species is apparent. But instrumental value alone may not be a compelling reason to protect many wild species. What about the species that have no obvious value to anyone\u2014including many plant and animal species? Another strategy for preserving all wild species is to emphasize the intrinsic value of species rather than their unknown or uncertain ecological and economic values. From this viewpoint, the extinction of any species is an irretrievable loss of something valuable. Environmental ethicists argue that the long-established existence of species means they have a right to continued existence. Living things have ends and interests of their own, and the freedom to pursue them is often frustrated by human actions. Do humans have the right to terminate a species that has existed for thousands or millions of years? Environmental philosopher Holmes Rolston III puts it this way: \u201cDestroying species is like tearing pages out of an unread book, written in a language humans hardly know how to read, about the place where they live.\u201d 3 Some support this view by arguing that there is value in every living thing and that one kind of living thing (e.g., humans) has no greater value than any other. This argument, however, can lead to some difficulties, such as having to defend the rights of pathogens and parasites. A more common viewpoint held by ethicists is that, because humans have the ability to make moral judgments, they also have a special responsibility toward the natural world, and that this responsibility includes concern for other species. Religious Support. Many ethicists find their basis for intrinsic value in religious thought. For example, in the Jewish and Christian scriptures, the book of Genesis expresses God\u2019s concern for wild species when he created them. Judeo-Christian scholars maintain that by declaring his creation good and giving it his blessing, God was saying that all wild things have intrinsic value and, therefore, deserve moral consideration and stewardship. In the story of Noah, described in the Hebrew Bible, God makes a covenant not only with humans, but also with all creatures, \u201cevery living thing.\u201d Similarly, in the Islamic tradition, the Quran (Koran) proclaims that the environment is the creation of Allah and should be protected because its protection praises the Creator. Many Native American religions have a strong environmental ethic (a system of moral values or beliefs); for example, the Lakota hold that humans and other forms of life should interact like members of a large, healthy family. Drawing on Hindu philosophy, the Chipko movement of northern India represents a strong grassroots environmentalism. Ethical concern for wild species underlies several religious traditions and represents a potentially powerful force for preserving biodiversity. Even if species have no demonstrable use to humans, it can still be argued that they have a value and a right to exist and that humans thus have a responsibility to protect them from harm that results from human actions. 3Holmes Rolston III, Environmental Ethics: Duties to and Values in the Natural World (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1988), 129. The Land Ethic. Further, there is an ethic about the preservation of the ecosystems in which species live. This view of nature was most famously described by conservationist Aldo Leopold in an essay published in 1949 entitled \u201cThe Land Ethic.\u201d Leopold is known for being one of the first scientists to understand the importance of both fire and predators in maintaining ecosystem health.", "He advocated for protection of wild places\u2014wilderness\u2014as well as for better care of agricultural and other human-dominated land. \u201cThe Land Ethic,\u201d which was published in the collection A Sand County Almanac, was instrumental in generating interest in the protection of wilderness. In it, Leopold describes his viewpoint: \u201cA thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.\u201d 4 CONCEPT CHECK If you want to protect panda bears because they are cute and the world would be a lesser place without them (not bad reasons!), what types of values are you expressing? \u2610\u2713 6.2 Biodiversity and Its Decline In the introduction to this chapter, biodiversity was described as the variety of life on Earth. We can be more specific than that. The dimensions of biodiversity include the genetic diversity within a species and the variety of species as well as the range of communities and ecosystems. When scientists use the term biodiversity, however, sometimes they mean a characteristic that they can calculate and compare between habitats. In this definition, scientists use two measures to calculate biodiversity\u2014the number of species and a measure of how \u201ceven\u201d the species are. A habitat has low biodiversity if it is dominated by only one species, with few members of other species, because those few might easily leave or die out. Given the same number of species, diversity is considered to be higher in habitats where the dominance by any single species is low. In this chapter, our main focus is the diversity of species. Recall that over long periods of time, natural selection leads to speciation (the creation of new species) as well as extinction (the disappearance of species) (Chapter 4) . Now, we are interested in how humans interact with wild species and impact biodiversity over a relatively short time. How Many Species? Almost 2 million species have been discovered and described, and certainly many more than that exist. Most people are completely unaware of the great diversity of species that occurs within any given taxonomic category. Groups especially rich in species are the flowering plants (about 224,000 species) and the insects (about 950,000 species), but even less-diverse groups, such as birds or ferns, are rich with species that are unknown to most people (Table 6\u20132) . Groups that 4Aldo Leopold, \u201cThe Land Ethic,\u201d in A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 1949).

Taxonomists are aware that their work in finding and describing new species is incomplete. Estimates of unknown species keep rising as taxonomists explore more ecosystems. Whatever the number of species, the planet\u2019s biodiversity represents an amazing and diverse storehouse of biological wealth. The Decline of Biodiversity Biodiversity is declining in the United States as well as around the world. Because U.S. ecosystems are well studied, the trends that show themselves here (including the decline of many plant and animal species) may represent larger global trends. Endemic species (those found in only one habitat and nowhere else) are especially at risk. Some areas of the country and of the world are particularly vulnerable to species loss. These areas are often the focus of special conservation efforts. North America. The biota of the United States is as well known as any.", "Even so, not much is known about most of the 200,000-plus species of plants, animals, and microbes estimated to live in the nation. At least 500 species native to the United States, including at least 100 vertebrates, are known to have gone extinct (or have \u201cgone missing\u201d and are believed to have gone extinct) since the early days of colonization. An inventory of 20,897 wild plant and animal species in the 50 states, carried out in the late 1990s by a team of biologists from the Nature Conservancy and the National Heritage Network concluded that one-third are vulnerable (threatened), imperiled (endangered), or already extinct. In the United States, mussels, crayfish, fishes, and amphibians\u2014all species that depend on freshwater habitats\u2014are at greatest risk. In part, this potential for loss stems from the high number of endemic aquatic species in the American Southeast. For example, there are close to 200 species of freshwater mussels and clams in North America, giving these bivalves the greatest species diversity of any freshwater bivalve group in the world. Flowering plants are also of great concern, with one-third of their numbers in decline in North America. Species populations are a more important element of biodiversity than even the species\u2019 existence. Populations of species that occupy different habitats and ranges contribute to biological wealth, as they provide goods and services important in ecosystems. Across North America, even populations of well-studied species are in decline. Commercial landings of many species of fish are down, puzzling reductions in amphibian populations are occurring all over the world, and many North American songbird species (such as the cerulean warbler, wood thrush, and scarlet tanager) are declining and have disappeared entirely from some locations. These birds are neotropical migrants; that is, they winter in the neotropics of Central and South America and breed in temperate North America. Other migratory groups have also suffered declines. By 2014, the precipitous 90% decline of monarch butterflies had made them world news, as they struggled to survive loss of habitat and exposure to chemicals. Global Outlook. Worldwide, the loss of biodiversity is even more disturbing. One thorough analysis of biodiversity is the Global Biodiversity Outlook, published by the United Nations. Figure 6\u20136, from their 2010 assessment, shows groups from a comprehensive survey of more than 47,000 species, categorized by level of risk of extinction. The 2014 Global Biodiversity Assessment 4 did not include the same analyses, but the trends were the same. Estimates of extinction rates in the past show alarming increases in loss of species. For mammals, the background (past) extinction rate was less than one extinction every thousand years, although rates were higher during five great extinction events. (Scientists estimate the background extinction rate from the fossil record of marine animals and from rates of change in DNA.) This rate can be compared with known extinctions of the past several hundred years (for mammals and birds, EXTINCTION RISK CATEGORIES Birds Amphibians Mammals Reptiles Dragonflies Freshwater crabs Corals Freshwater fish Conifers Cycads 20 to 25 species per hundred years and, for all groups, 850 species over about 500 years), indicating that the current rate of extinction is 100 to 1,000 times higher than past rates. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) keeps a running list of threatened species. In 2014, approximately 32% (2,030) of amphibian species, 22% (1,199) of mammal species, and 13% (1,373) of bird species were globally threatened. 5 The status of other groups of organisms is much less well known. The majority of threatened species are concentrated in the tropics, where biodiversity is so rich as to be almost unimaginable. Biologist Edward O. Wilson identified 43 species of ants on a single tree in a Peruvian rain forest, a level of diversity equal to the entire ant fauna of the British Isles. 6 Other scientists found 300 species of trees in a 1-hectare (2.5-acre) plot and almost 1,000 species of beetles on 19 specimens of a species of tree 5Red List Category summary for all animal classes and orders, IUCN Red List version 2011.2: Table 4a, accessed March 3, 2012, http://www.iucnredlist.org/ documents/summarystatistics/2011_2_RL_Stats_Table4a.pdf. 6Edward O.

(Source: Global Biodiversity Outlook 3.) in Panama.", "7 Unfortunately, the same tropical forests that hold such high biodiversity are also experiencing the highest rate of deforestation. Because the inventory of species in these ecosystems is so incomplete, it is virtually impossible to assess extinction rates in such forests. This uncertainty may contain a kernel of good news. Some scientists believe that we are overestimating the total number of species, and as a result, overestimating extinction rates in the areas where most habitat is being lost. 8 No one knows exactly how many species are becoming extinct, but the loss is real, and species loss represents a continuing depletion of the biodiversity of our planet. Reasons for the Decline The most famous extinction in American history was that of the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), once the most common bird in North America ( Figure 6\u20137) . In the early and mid-1800s, the population of this bird was estimated at 3-5 million, but market hunting caused a rapid decline. By the end of that century, the wild population was gone; the last know wild bird was shot in 1900. The last passenger pigeon in captivity died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914. How could such a widespread creature go extinct so quickly? In the distant past, extinctions were largely the result of processes such as climate change, plate tectonics, and even asteroid impacts. Current threats to biodiversity are sometimes described with the acronym HIPPO, which refers to five factors: habitat destruction, invasive species, pollution, population, and overexploitation. Many declining species experience combinations of several or all of these factors. Indeed, global climate change in particular increases the effects of some of these factors. Future losses will be greatest in the developing world, where biodiversity is greatest 7T. L. Erwin, \u201cThe Tropical Forest Canopy: The Heart of Biotic Diversity,\u201d in Biodiversity, ed. E. O. Wilson (National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 1988), 123\u2013129. 8M. J. Costello, R. M. May, and N. E. Stork, \u201cCan We Name Earth\u2019s Species Before They Go Extinct?\u201d Science 339, no. 6118 (2013): 413. 6.2 Biodiversity and Its Decline 135 and human population growth is highest. Africa and Asia have lost almost two-thirds of their original natural habitat. People\u2019s desire for a better way of life, the desperate poverty of rural populations, and the global market for timber and other natural resources are powerful forces that will continue to draw down biological wealth on those continents. One key to slowing the loss of biodiversity lies in bringing human population growth down (Chapter 8). If the human population increases to 10 billion, as some demographers believe that it will, the consequences for the natural world may be frightening. Another key is to pull individual consumption down to sustainable levels in parts of the world with high consumption of energy and materials. These two concepts will be vital to solving several environmental issues and will be further discussed throughout the rest of the book. We will now consider the five current threats to biodiversity that make up the acronym HIPPO. Habitat Destruction. By far the greatest threat to biodiversity is the physical alteration of habitats through the processes of conversion, fragmentation, simplification, and intrusion. Habitat destruction has already been responsible for 36% of the known extinctions and is the key factor in the currently observed population declines. Natural species are adapted to specific habitats, so if the habitat changes or is eliminated, the species go with it. Conversion. Natural areas are commonly converted to farms, housing subdivisions, shopping malls, marinas, and industrial centers. When a forest is cleared, for example, destruction of the trees is not the only result; every other plant or animal that occupied the destroyed ecosystem, either permanently or temporarily (e.g., migrating birds), also suffers. Global forest cover has been reduced by 40% already, and the decline continues. For example, the decline in North American songbird populations has been traced to the loss of winter forest habitat in Central and South America and the increasing fragmentation of summer forest habitat in North America. Agriculture already occupies 38% of land on Earth; croplands that replace natural habitats are quite inhospitable to all but a few species that tend to be well Figure 6\u20137 The decline of the passenger pigeon. (a) In the early 1800s, some flocks of passenger pigeons were so large that they darkened the sky as they passed overhead. Market hunting lead to their rapid decline. (b) The last passenger pigeon, a bird named Martha, lived at the Cincinnati Zoo.", "When she died in 1914, the species was extinct. (a) (b) Figure 6\u20138 The border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Severe deforestation in Haiti, on the left, leads to habitat loss for many species. The forested area on the right is the Dominican Republic. adapted to the new managed landscapes. Haiti provides one extreme example of habitat loss. Figure 6\u20138 shows the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with Haiti on the left. Land use in Haiti has resulted in a tremendous loss of forests, something important not only in the context of loss of species, but also as a driver of soil erosion and water quality problems (as we will see in later chapters). In the Dominican Republic, social trends such as greater stability and democratization have helped the country avoid political unrest and environmental destruction. Fragmentation. Natural landscapes generally have large patches of habitat that are well connected to other similar patches. Human-dominated landscapes, however, consist of a mosaic of different land uses, resulting in small, often geometrically configured patches that frequently contrast highly with neighboring patches (Figure 6\u20139) . Small fragments of habitat can support only small numbers and populations of species, making them vulnerable to extermination. Species that require large areas are the first to go; those that grow slowly or have naturally unstable populations are also vulnerable. Reducing the size of a habitat creates a greater proportion of edges\u2014breaks between habitats that expose species to predators. Increased edge favors some species but may be detrimental to others. For example, the Kirtland\u2019s warbler is an endangered species that is highly dependent on large patches of second-growth jack pines in Michigan. The species is endangered because its habitat has been greatly fragmented, creating edges that favor the brown-headed cowbird, a nest parasite that can invade the forest and lay its eggs in the nest of the rare warbler. Edges also favor species that prey on nests, such as crows, magpies, and jays. These predators are thought to be partly responsible for declines in many neotropical bird populations. Roadways offer particular dangers to wildlife. The number of animals killed on roadways now far exceeds the number killed by hunters. As rural areas are developed, the increasing numbers of animals found on roadways are a serious hazard to motorists. With 4.1 million miles (6.6 million km) of paved roadways in the United States, more than a million animals a day become roadkill. Overpasses and tunnels are increasingly being built to provide wildlife with safe corridors. A 2008 study at Purdue University identified amphibians as especially affected by road mortality. 9 More than 95% of the roadkill that researchers identified over 11 months along a stretch of road in the Midwest were amphibians. Simplification. Human use of habitats often simplifies them. Removing fallen logs and dead trees from woodlands for firewood, for example, diminishes an important micro-habitat on which species ranging from woodpeckers to germinating forest trees depend. When a forest is managed for the production of one (or a few) species of tree, tree diversity declines, and as a result, so does the diversity of the plant and animal species that depend on the less favored trees. Streams are sometimes channelized\u2014their beds are cleared of fallen trees and stony riffle areas (places with more rapidly 9D. J. Glista, T. L. DeVault, and J. A. DeWoody, \u201cVertebrate Road Mortality and Its Impact on Amphibians,\u201d Herpetological Conservation and Biology 3 (2008): 77\u201387. 6.2 Biodiversity and Its Decline 137 Figure 6\u20139 Fragmentation. Development usually leads to the breaking up of natural areas, resulting in a mosaic of habitats that may not support local populations of species. moving water), and sometimes the stream is straightened out by dredging the bottom. Such alterations inevitably reduce the diversity of fish and invertebrates that live in the stream. Intrusion. Birds use the air as a highway, especially as they migrate north and south in the spring and fall. The clear surfaces of windows are one of the greatest dangers for birds, especially when the windows are lit from behind and birds are flying at night. Ornithologist Daniel Klem estimated that between 100 million and 1 billion birds die every year from crashing into glass windows. Recently, telecommunications towers have presented a new hazard to birds. Although television towers have been around for decades, new towers are sprouting up on hilltops and in countrysides in profusion. Cell phone signal towers are also common.", "The lights often placed on these towers can attract birds, which usually migrate at night, and the birds simply collide with the towers and supporting wires. In 2000, a study estimated that the towers kill somewhere between 5 and 50 million birds a year. 10 Three organizations petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to incorporate bird mortality in its decisions about new towers in 2002, but nothing was done. In 2008, a federal appeals court finally ruled that the FCC did in fact have to come up with a plan to protect birds. A 2011 federal policy provided hope that there would be an agreement to make towers more bird friendly. 10 G. Shire, New Report Documents Hundreds of Thousands of Birds Killed at Communications Towers (2000). Available from the American Bird Conservancy at www.abcbirds.org/newsandreports/releases/000629.html. Birds are just one example of organisms harmed by the intrusion of structures into habitats. Any solution to wild species\u2019 decline must include creative ways to lower the impact of human structures on other organisms. Invasive Species. An exotic, or alien, species is one that is introduced into an area from somewhere else, often a different continent (see Chapter 4, where they were covered extensively). Because the species is not native to the new area, it is frequently unsuccessful in establishing a viable population and quietly disappears. Such is the fate of many pet birds, reptiles, and fish that escape or are deliberately released. Some exotic species establish populations that remain at low levels without becoming pests. Occasionally, however, an alien species finds the new environment to be very favorable, and it becomes an invasive species thriving, spreading out, and perhaps eliminating native species by predation or competition for space or food. Most of the insect pests and plant parasites that plague agricultural production were accidentally introduced ( Chapter 13). Invasive species are major agents in driving native species to extinction and are responsible for an estimated 39% of all animal extinctions since 1600. Accidental Introductions. As humans traveled around the globe in the days of sailing ships and exploration, they brought with them more than curiosity and dreams of exotic lands. They brought rats and mice to ports all over the world. As a result, rats are the most invasive mammal worldwide. The two most common invasive rat species are the black rat (Rattus rattus, called the ship rat) and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus, called the Norway rat). In the Middle Ages, fleas infesting black rats carried the bubonic plague bacterium to Europe, eventually killing a third of Europe\u2019s human population. Rats also eat crops, destroy property, and cause other harm to humans, but their effect on other species is profound. In terms of species loss, the arrival of rats is especially deadly to birds. According to one report, rats have been found preying on nearly one-quarter of seabird species. Thirty percent of seabirds are threatened with extinction, and rats are the biggest single cause. Rats are only one example of accidental introduction of non-native species. Figure 6\u201310 shows another: the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), which arrived in Mobile, Alabama, from South America, possibly in shipments of wood. The fire ant is a major pest across the southern United States, inflicting damage to crops and domestic animals. It also contributes to the decline of wild species. In Texas, it is estimated that fire ants kill a fifth of songbird babies before they leave the nest. May I Introduce . . . Deliberate introductions sanctioned by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (in the interest of \u201creclaiming\u201d eroded or degraded lands) have brought us kudzu and other runaway plants, such as the autumn olive and multiflora rose (Chapter 4). Salt cedar was introduced in the American Southwest for erosion control and has taken over riverbanks there. Many other exotic plants are introduced as horticultural desirables. Fallopia japonica, Japanese knotweed, is a good example. Tall, with attractive flowers, it originated in Asia and is now found in North America and Europe. It forms dense patches and outcompetes native plants. Unfortunately, its strong underground stem (rhizome) and root system cause the plant to spread even when it does not produce seeds. There are specific instances of both deliberate and accidental introductions in aquaculture\u2014the farming of shellfish, seaweed, and fish\u2014which produces one-third of all seafood consumed worldwide.", "Parasites, seaweeds, invertebrates, and pathogens have been introduced together with the desired aquaculture species, often escaping from the pens or ponds and entering the sea or nearby river system. Sometimes the aquaculture species itself is a problem. Atlantic salmon, for example, are now raised along the Pacific Coast, and many have escaped from the pens and have been breeding in some West Coast rivers, where they compete with native species and spread diseases. Over Time. The transplantation of species by humans has occurred throughout history, to the point where most people are unable to distinguish between the native and exotic species living in their lands. European colonists brought hundreds of weeds and plants to the Americas, and now most of the common field, lawn, and roadside plant species in eastern North America are exotics. For example, almost one-third of the plants in Massachusetts are alien or introduced\u2014about 725 species, of which 66 have been specifically identified as invasive or likely to become so. In Europe, there are about 11,000 alien species, 15% of which harm biodiversity. In North America, two invasive animals of particular concern are the Burmese python and the wild boar. Burmese pythons have been released into the wild by pet owners who no longer like them once they become large. There are now breeding populations of these snakes in the Florida Everglades, where they eat the native wildlife and are dangerous to humans (Figure 6\u201311) . Wild boar were introduced by people who wanted to hunt and eat them. Today there are an estimated 4 million feral boar in the United States (Figure 6\u201312) . They are dangerous and tear up soil, rooting up plants. One of the most destructive exotics is the house cat: Studies in the 1990s showed that the millions of domestic and feral cats in the United States kill an estimated 1 billion small mammals (chipmunks, deer mice, and ground squirrels, as well as rats) and hundreds of millions of birds Figure 6\u201310 The red imported fire ant. This ant, Solenopsis invicta, has invaded the southern United States, where it kills other animals and sometimes starves them by eating their prey. Figure 6\u201311 Burmese pythons invade the Florida Everglades. These predators were introduced by the pet trade and former pet owners. They are changing the ecology of the Everglades. 6.2 Biodiversity and Its Decline 139 annually. One report calculates the annual cost of invasive species in the United States to be $137 billion. 11 Species originating in the Americas can cause havoc in other places, too. For example, the North American gray squirrel is invasive in Europe, where it outcompetes the native red squirrels and may be infecting them with a fatal virus. The gray squirrel is one of the 100 most invasive species worldwide. Invasive Species and Trophic Levels. Plants provide food for herbivores that in turn provide food for carnivores. Non-native plants may be difficult for herbivores to eat and thus may keep energy and materials from passing up the food chain, even if a species has been in a new ecosystem for a long time. For example, the Norway maple was introduced to North America in 1756, but in spite of being in the United States for more than 250 years, these maples provide much less food for herbivores (like caterpillars) and their predators (like songbirds) than native trees do. Pollution. Another factor that decreases biodiversity is pollution, which can directly kill many kinds of plants and animals, seriously reducing their populations. For example, nutrients (such as phosphorus and nitrogen) that travel down the Mississippi River from the agricultural heartland of the United States have created a fluctuating \u201cdead zone\u201d in the Gulf of Mexico, an area of more than 5,052 square miles (in 2014) where oxygen completely disappears from depths below 20 meters every summer 12 (see Chapter 20). Shrimp, fish, crabs, and other commercially valuable sea life are either killed or forced to migrate away from this huge area along the Mississippi and Louisiana coastline. Pollution destroys or alters habitats, with consequences just as severe as those caused by deliberate conversions. Every oil spill kills seabirds and often sea mammals, sometimes by the thousands (water pollution is discussed further in Chapter 20). Some pollutants, such as the pesticide DDT, 11D. Pimental, L. Lach, R. Zuniga, and D. Morrison, \u201cEnvironmental and Economic Costs of Nonindigenous Species in the United States,\u201d BioScience 50 (2000): 53\u201365. 12D. Conners, \u201c2011 Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone Smaller Than Scientists Predicted.", "EarthSky (2011): http://earthsky.org/earth/2011-gulf-of-mexico-dead-zone-smaller than-scientists-predicted. can travel up food chains and become more concentrated in higher consumers ( Chapter 5) . Acid deposition and air pollution kill forest trees; sediments and large amounts of nutrients kill species in lakes, rivers, and bays; and global climate change, brought on by greenhouse gas emissions, is already affecting many species. Climate change is likely to accelerate in the next 50 years (see Chapter 18) . Pollution can spread disease. Human wastes can spread pathogenic microorganisms to wild species, a threat called pathogen pollution. For example, the manatee (an endangered aquatic mammal) has been infected by human papillomavirus, cryptosporidium, and microsporidium, with fatal outcomes. Pollution can also disrupt hormones and other body functions. Fish exposed to polluted river water may develop tumors or deformed organs. Sometimes they develop both male and female tissues, a condition called \u201cintersex\u201d (Figure 6\u201313 ). The recent and rapid rise in the incidence of these deformities has been traced to habitats that have been altered by human use, specifically run-off, industry, and sewage in populated areas. Figure 6\u201313 Intersex fish. Up to 80% of male fish in some rivers are found to have a condition where they also have female tissues, such as eggs developing in their testes. This appears to result from pollution. Population. Human population growth puts pressure on wild species through several mechanisms\u2014through direct use of wild species, through conversion of habitat into agriculture or other use, through pollution, and through having to compete for resources with growing human populations (human population trends will be described in depth in Chapters 8 and 9). Overconsumption is tied to overpopula tion and to the concept of overexploitation\u2014the last letter in the HIPPO acronym\u2014which will be discussed next. Even if each person using a resource used a modest amount, large numbers of people might still use too much, leading to a total overconsumption. Thus, overpopulation is a problem even if individuals use few resources. However, a small group of people can also overuse resources. Indirectly, overconsumption can drive pollution, conversion of habitat, and other effects that harm wildlife. In a world in which some individuals own literally billions of times the money and resources that others own, people with the most consumptive lifestyles have a disproportionate effect on the environment. Differences in level of consumption and in sheer numbers of people drive some of the tensions among the high-, middle-, and low-income countries (see Chapter 8). Overexploitation. The overharvest of a particular species is known as overexploitation. Removing whales, fish, or trees faster than they can reproduce will lead to their ultimate extinction. The extinction of the passenger pigeon is one compelling example. In addition, overuse of individual species harms ecosystems. Overexploitation is estimated to have caused 23% of recent extinctions (past 500 years) and is often driven by a combination of greed, ignorance, and desperation. Poor resource management often leads to a loss of biodiversity. Forests and woodlands are overcut for firewood, grasslands are overgrazed, game species are overhunted , fisheries are overexploited, and croplands are overcultivated. These practices set into motion a cycle of erosion and desertification, with effects far beyond the exploited area (this problem is explored in depth in Chapter 7). Trade in Wild Products. One prominent form of overuse is the trafficking in wildlife and in products derived from wild species. Much of this \u201ctrade\u201d is illegal. Worldwide, the U.N. Environmental Programme estimates that it generates $7 to $23 billion a year, making it among the most lucrative illicit sources of income, after narcotics, counterfeiting, and human trafficking. This illegal activity flourishes because some consumers are willing to pay exorbitant prices for furniture made from tropical hardwoods (like teak), exotic pets, furs from wild animals, traditional medicines from animal parts, and innumerable other \u201cluxuries,\u201d including polar-bear rugs, ivory-handled knives, and reptile-skin handbags. For example, a panda-skin rug can sell for up to $25,000 in the United States. The plight of various species of rhinoceros demonstrates the harm caused by the illegal trade in wildlife products. In 2011, the West African rhino was declared extinct. In October 2011, the Javan rhino was declared extinct in mainland Asia, surviving in only a small population in Indonesia. Rhino species are all very rare because of the high value placed on their horns; poachers kill rhinos to remove their horns, which are prized in Asian medicine and used for ornamental knife handles in the Middle East.", "Even preemptive removal of the rhinos\u2019 horns by wildlife managers does not protect the animals, because poachers kill them for the remaining bases of their horns. In addition, the dehorned animals do not survive well in the wild. Wildlife officials post guards around the rarest animals ( Figure 6\u201314) or move them to safer locations. One South African Group, the Rhino Rescue Project, attempts to make poaching less appealing by de-valuing horns. Veterinarians drill small holes into the horns of sedated rhinos and put in a substance toxic to humans that will make the horn impossible to use in alternative medicine. Microchips are added and sometimes dye. Another solution is aggressive advertising against wild animal parts. An advertising campaign in Vietnam saw demand for rhino horn drop a third between 2013 and 2014. Protecting rhinos, like many other creatures, will take coordinated approaches. (b) (a) Figure 6\u201314 Black rhino horn and white rhino. (a) Rhino horn is prized in traditional Asian medicine and as ornamentation. (b) Only five northern white rhinos still exist in the world. This one in Kenya is guarded by armed rangers to protect it from poachers. 6.2 Biodiversity and Its Decline 141 Trade in Exotic Pets and Plants. The fad for exotic pets and houseplants is a growing problem. In many cases, these plants and animals are taken from the wild; only a small fraction of them survive the transition. When animals and plants are removed from their natural breeding populations, these individuals are no better than dead when it comes to maintaining the species. At least 40 of the world\u2019s 330 known species of parrots are threatened because of this fad. Trade in wild animals can be very profitable, with some Indonesian and South American parrots selling for up to $10,000 in the United States. Many pet stores carry imported species. Not purchasing wild-caught species is one way individuals can help preserve biodiversity. In 1992, the United States, the largest importer of exotic birds, adopted the Wild Bird Conservation Act, a law designed to stop the wild capture of declining birds, uphold international treaties in wildlife trade, and support sustainable breeding programs. In 2004, more than 200 nongovernmental organizations signed the European Union Wild Bird Declaration, a call for wild bird protection in the European Union (EU). In a huge step forward in bird conservation, in 2007 the EU decided unanimously to prohibit the import of wild birds. A Double Whammy\u2014Combining Effects. The HIPPO acronym is generally helpful, but the decline of many species is the result of a combination of factors. Climate change, for example, can overlay many other problems, forcing species to leave their ranges or stressing them so they struggle with other issues. One good example of combined effects is colony collapse disorder, the sudden death of honeybee colonies, which has wiped out up to 90% of the hives owned by some beekeepers. The cause of this disorder is still a mystery, but is thought to be related to stress from pesticides overlaying a set of other problems, including mites, a parasitic fly, fungal and viral infections, and malnutrition from being exposed to monocultured plants. An EPA task force and scientists around the globe are trying to figure it out. Consequences of Losing Biodiversity Why is the loss of biodiversity a concern? The answer goes back to the values of wild species. Their intrinsic value is self-explanatory: Species are valuable regardless of human benefit. We humans also need biodiversity; this is instrumental value. We use wild species for food, fiber, fuel, and as a source of medicines; we value them aesthetically and want recreation in natural habitats. We need biodiversity to maintain healthy ecosystems, which bring a great deal of economic benefit. The complexity of ecosystems means that the loss of diversity may cause them to break down. Sometimes the loss of a species affects ecosystems\u2019 functions that we take for granted. One example is the loss of vultures in India. In the 1980s, India\u2019s nine species of vultures were the most numerous raptors in the world, with a combined population of about 40 million. Vultures ate the carcasses of dead animals, including cattle. The use of the drug Diclofenac on cattle nearly wiped out the vultures. In just a couple of decades, the vulture populations declined precipitously, with some losing more than 99% of their members. Without vultures, the carcasses of dead animals accumulated, polluting the water, spreading disease, and attracting wild dogs.", "In 2006, India banned the use of Diclofenac in cattle. Although all the species of Indian vultures are now endangered, their populations may be slowly increasing. Can ecosystems lose some species and still retain their functional integrity? Research indicates that the extinction of some species will not lead to ecosystem decline. This has risks, however, because it is possible to lose keystone species\u2014species whose role is absolutely vital to the survival of many other species in an ecosystem (see Chapter 4) . For example, by felling trees and building dams, beavers make wetland habitats that undergo succession as beavers move throughout the landscape, increasing ecosystem diversity in a region. Many declining species are K-strategists\u2014large, long-lived organisms that are relatively old at first reproduction and provide a high degree of parental care for their offspring (Chapter 4) . Thus, they are vulnerable to rapid changes in the environment. Often they have the greatest demands for unspoiled habitat. Thus, wolves, elephants, tigers, moose, and other large animals are considered \u201cumbrella\u201d species for whole ecosystems. Figure 6\u201315 Captive breeding with new techniques. Captive breeders are now able to use frozen semen to produce black-footed ferrets, an extremely rare animal. Those species least likely to be harmed by human actions include widely distributed species with small size, rapid reproduction, short generation time, low parental care of offspring, and an ability to migrate (characteristics of r-strategists). Such species (roaches, houseflies, and others) are most likely to become pest species. Thus, the overarching effect of human disturbance of the environment is not only to decrease species that we may like, but also to increase a number that will become major pests. Moving Forward We do not really know what we are losing when species become extinct. One thing is certain: The natural world is less beautiful and less interesting as a result. We might be inclined to feel overwhelmed by the significant decline in species and in the abundance of organisms. But there are glimmers of hope. Sometimes species we thought were extinct are found not to be. Two of these are the Beck\u2019s petrel, not seen for 80 years before being found by an ornithologist in 2008, and the New Guinea big-eared bat, not seen for 120 years and thought extinct but found in Papua New Guinea in 2012. Sometimes new populations of very rare species are discovered, as happened in the case of the highly threatened greybreasted parakeet. Only about 300 of these birds are known to live in the wild, all in northeastern Brazil. Like these parakeets, most rediscovered species remain on the brink of extinction, but every piece of good news is welcomed. As we saw in Stewardship, Lake Erie\u2019s Island Snake Lady, sometimes the hard work of scientists and conservation volunteers pays off in the recovery of a rare and declining species. Once in a while, conservationists catch a break, as they did in 2008, when a rare Vietnamese turtle, one of the last four of its species in the world, was swept from a lake by a flood and caught by a fisherman who was going to sell the reptile to a restaurant for soup. Conservationists were able to purchase the 68-kilogram (150-lb.) turtle and return it to the lake. While success in protecting species begins with the courage and determination of individuals, conservation requires coordinated efforts over regional, national, and international scales, involving the work of both scientists and policy makers. Sometimes new protections emerge from a change in policy. Ironically, the conservation of birds was enhanced in the EU when concern over avian flu made it possible to pass regulations limiting the import of wild birds. Sometimes scientific accomplishments make conservation doable. For example, 2008 saw the first live rhinoceros birth from frozen semen, and black-footed ferrets, an extremely rare weasel-like animal, have been born from sperm stored from fathers who had died eight years before (Figure 6\u201315) . These breakthroughs in captive breeding may save species. In the next section, we will see more of the efforts scientists and others are putting into saving wild species. CONCEPT CHECK What are the five main causes of the loss of biodiversity? Which of these caused the extinction of the passenger pigeon? \u2610\u2713 6.3 Saving Wild Species Current efforts to save wild species and preserve biodiversity involve basic science, individuals, corporations, public policy, and decisions at the local, national, and international levels ( Table 6\u20133) .", "Scientists are on the front lines of biodiversity protection, as they often have a better knowledge of what is out there in the world and whether or not it is declining. However, scientists cannot stop biodiversity loss by themselves. That requires laws, as well as the enforcement of those laws. Protection of biodiversity also requires stepping back to look at the big picture, seeing how people relate to the rest of the natural world, and examining how we can do so in more sustainable ways. The Science of Conservation The scientific projects that have been used to save the Lake Erie water snake, rhinos, and black-footed ferrets are just a few of many research activities in conservation biology, the branch of science that is most focused on the protection of populations and species. Conservation biologists use techniques such as captive breeding, telemetry (transmitting data through remote communication), and tracking devices in order to learn more about the natural history of particular species and to protect those that are vanishing. Getting accurate population counts can be extremely difficult. Scientists study the relationships among species and between biodiversity as a whole and ecosystem functions. There is another critical element in the science of protecting species\u2014taxonomy. Taxonomy is the cataloging of 6.3 Saving Wild Species 143 species and the naming of new ones. It allows us to understand what species are out there and to identify those in the most trouble. The number of taxonomists in developed countries has been declining, a trend that makes understanding biodiversity more difficult. At the same time, more taxonomists are being trained in developing countries, a positive trend that should help future research. Nonprofit Efforts One way individuals contribute to conservation of biodiversity is through the funding of nonprofit organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund, Audubon Society, and many others. With some fundraising campaigns, people are able to \u201csponsor\u201d individual whales, tigers, polar bears, and other creatures considered \u201ccharismatic\u201d\u2014that is, widely appealing. The efforts to protect these species, which often require large areas of habitat, protect other species as well. Land conservation is used to protect multiple species at the same time (discussed in more detail in Chapter 7) . The oldest regional land conservancy in the United States is the Trustees of Reservations in Massachusetts. Zoos have a special role in biodiversity conservation. Not everyone believes it is a good thing for animals to be kept in zoos, away from their natural habitat. However, in many cases, zoos have a two-fold role in protecting species. First, they actively educate the public so people care about species protection. Second, many are involved in research and in captive breeding programs. For some species, the breeding done at zoos and other captive breeding facilities is the difference between survival and extinction. Botanical gardens can have the same role for plants. Of course, breeding many species solely in captivity is not a sustainable longterm solution for species loss, but it may bridge the gap while humans figure out how to live more sustainably. Individuals and Corporations Individuals can directly support conservation by being careful in their consumption of resources, use of chemicals, and driving habits, by not purchasing exotic species or products made from endangered species, and through other personal choices. However, many of the actions individuals take are through support of nonprofits, pushing for policy actions, and pushing corporations to work in ways that are more biodiversity-friendly. For example, consumers are insisting on more organic foods and certification of wild-caught fish or forest products as sustainable (some of these approaches are discussed in Chapter 7). Consumers also encourage businesses to care about species. Many businesses are beginning to realize that biodiversity loss could harm their profits. Biodiversity-friendly investing is on the rise as well. A survey in 2009 of global CEOs found that 27% expressed concern about the impacts of biodiversity loss on their business prospects. Individuals can act as \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d and take part in massive information-gathering efforts such as the Great Sunflower project, which monitors pollinators (Figure 6\u201316) , the Firefly Project (which tracks firefly abundance), the annual Audubon Society Christmas Bird count (in which volunteers count birds), Project Budburst (a project that tracks when plants change seasonally), and others. Governments: Local, State, and National Policies Public policies, as well as the agencies that make and support them, are necessary for the protection of species. Figure 6\u201316 Citizen science.", "The Great Sunflower Project is one of many that use network of amateur scientists to collect data on wild species. In this case, they study pollinators, which are in decline. Governments from local to international are involved in monitoring, conserving, and protecting biodiversity. If we want to save wild species, we first need to ask who owns wildlife. In the United States, property owners do not own the wildlife living on their lands; wildlife resources are public resources, protected under the Public Trust Doctrine. The government holds these resources in trust for all its people and is obliged to provide protection for these resources. This protective role is usually exercised by state fisheries and wildlife agencies. Sometimes the law mandates federal jurisdiction, as in the case of endangered species. Game animals were some of the first animals people recognized as having the potential to be overharvested; consequently, they are a group that receives special oversight, even if they are not currently rare. Game Animals in the United States. Game animals are those animals traditionally hunted for sport, meat, or pelts. In the early days of the United States, there were no restrictions on hunting, and a number of species were hunted to extinction (the great auk, heath hen, and passenger pigeon) or near extinction (the bison and wild turkey). As game animals became scarce in the face of unrestrained hunting, regulations were enacted. State governments, backed up by the federal government, enacted laws establishing hunting seasons and bag limits and hired wardens to enforce the laws. Some species were given complete protection in order to allow their populations to build up to numbers that would once again allow hunting. The wild turkey, for example, was hunted to the brink of extinction. It made a slow comeback by the 1930s as a result of hunting restrictions and returned strongly after reintroduction into areas it had once inhabited. The turkey is now found in 49 states. Unfortunately, the turkey was also introduced to western states, where it was not native, and it is now a pest in those areas. Ideally, in the future it would be protected in states where it is native and removed from states where it is invasive. Hunting and Conservation. Using hunting and trapping fees as a source of revenue, state wildlife managers enhance the habitats that support important game species. In spite of what seems on the surface to be destruction of wildlife, hunting has many positive aspects. Besides the fees hunters pay, many hunters belong to organizations dedicated to the game they are interested in hunting. Organizations such as Ducks Unlimited raise funds that are used for the restoration and maintenance of natural ecosystems vital to the game they are interested in hunting. Defenders of hunting and trapping argue that their prey are often animals that lack natural predators and would increase to the point of destroying their own habitat, something that frequently happens in the United States with larger animals such as deer and elk. For example, there are so many deer in Pennsylvania that, in 2004, they were estimated to be at three times the natural carrying capacity; the large number of deer damage the ecosystems they inhabit as well as the other organisms living there. 6.3 Saving Wild Species 145 Many people feel that encouraging hunting because of a lack of other predators may not be getting at the fundamental problems with species loss. They argue for the return of predators such as grizzly bears, mountain lions, and wolves in order to restore more natural checks and balances to ecosystems. Because humans do not always get along well with top predators, such reintroductions are unlikely to occur on a large scale (Figure 6\u201317) . Interactions Between Humans and Wildlife. Because wild animals are in the public trust, their numbers are managed by government agencies. Now that many populations are increasing, the government sometimes has to limit them. Many nuisance animals are thriving in highly urbanized areas, creating various health hazards. Opossums, skunks, bears, and deer are attracted to suburban and urban areas by opportunities for food; unsecured garbage cans and pet food left outside will ensure visits from raccoons. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 6,162 cases of rabid animals in the United States, 59% of which were raccoons and bats. 13 One highly controversial effort to control unwanted animals is carried out by the Wildlife Services agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.", "At the request of livestock owners, farmers, homeowners, and others, Wildlife Services routinely uses poisons, traps, and other devices to remove nuisance wildlife. This usually means killing them; 4 million animals were killed in 2014. Of these, most are native species such as raccoons or skunks, but others, such as wild hogs and starlings, are exotic invasive species. Wildlife 13J. D. Blanton et al., Rabies Surveillance in the United States During 2012. Available at http://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/pdf/10.2460/javma.243.6.805. Figure 6\u201317 Wild cougar. As humans encroach on wild habitat, animals come into human areas. This cougar was on a suburban roof in California. It was shot with a tranquilizer. Returning big predators to ecosystems is not likely to happen in human-inhabited areas. Services plays the important role of keeping both invasive species and native species from overtaking human areas and limiting negative human\u2013wildlife interactions. Protecting Endangered Species In colonial days, huge flocks of snowy egrets inhabited the coastal wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States. In the 1800s, when fashion dictated fancy hats adorned with feathers, egrets and other birds were hunted for their plumage. By the late 1800s, egrets were almost extinct. Concerned about the loss of birds, some people began to form state Audubon societies. Conservationists such as Harriet Hemenway and Minna Hall, two prominent Boston socialites, began a campaign to shame \u201cfeather wearers\u201d and end the practice. The campaign caught on, and gradually attitudes changed; new laws followed. Government policies that protect animals from overharvesting are essential to keep species from the brink of extinction. Since the 1800s, several important laws have been passed to protect a wide variety of species. Lacey Act. Florida and Texas were the first states to pass laws protecting plumed birds. Then, in 1900, Congress passed the Lacey Act, forbidding interstate commerce in illegally killed wildlife, making it more difficult for hunters to sell their kill. Since then, numerous wildlife refuges have been established to protect the egrets\u2019 breeding and migratory habitats. With millions of people visiting these refuges and seeing the birds in their natural locales, attitudes have changed significantly. Today, the thought of hunting these birds would be abhorrent to most of us, even if official protection were removed. Thus protected, egret populations were able to recover substantially. In the meantime, the Lacey Act and its amendments have become the most important piece of legislation protecting any wildlife from illegal killing or smuggling. Under the act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) can bring federal charges against anyone violating a number of wildlife laws. There have been a number of amendments to the Lacey Act, including those that have broadened it to include plants. The act is also used to prohibit the movement of \u201cinjurious\u201d species, including invasive species. In 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service banned the importation and interstate transportation of four species of snakes, including the Burmese python, because of their negative impact on the Florida Everglades. 14 Table 6\u20134 summarizes the Lacey Act and some of the other federal and international regulations that are now used to protect wildlife. For examples of the work of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: In 2011, special agents worked on more than 13,565 violations of the Lacey Act and other wildlife-related laws. Their efforts resulted in fines of more than $8 million and a total of 87 years of jail time for those convicted. In one case, commercial fishermen in Virginia were convicted of illegally harvesting and selling 65,000 pounds of striped bass taken from the Potomac River. As wildlife smuggling increases and budgets tighten, USFWS agents work harder to catch people harming the rarest species. Endangered Species Act. Congress took another major step when it passed a series of acts to protect endangered species. The most comprehensive and recent of these acts is the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (reauthorized in 1988). Recall that an endangered species is a species that has been reduced to the point where it is in imminent danger of becoming extinct if protection is not provided (Figure 6\u201318) . Genetically distinct populations (subspecies) such as the Florida panther and the 14U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement, FY 2012 Annual Report (2014). Available at http://www.fws.gov/le/aboutle/annual.htm. peninsular bighorn sheep may also be protected. Further, the act provides for the protection of threatened species, which are judged to be in jeopardy but not on the brink of extinction.", "When a species is officially recognized as being either endangered or threatened, the law specifies substantial fines for killing, trapping, uprooting (in the case of plants), modifying significant habitat of, or engaging in commerce in the species or its parts. The legislation forbidding commerce includes wildlife threatened with extinction anywhere in the world. The Endangered Species Act is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for terrestrial and freshwater species (and a few marine mammals) and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Service for marine and anadromous species (those that migrate into freshwater). There are three crucial elements in the process of designating a species as endangered or threatened: As of August 2014, 1,552 U.S. species were listed for protection under the act; recovery plans are in place for 1,146 of them. In addition, 142 candidate species are waiting to be listed. 6.3 Saving Wild Species 147 (a) Pine Barrens Tree Frog (Hyla andersonii) (b) Haleakala Silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense) (c) Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Leuconotopicus borealis) (d) Karner Blue Butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) (e) Swamp Pink (Helonias bullata) (f) Spix\u2019s Macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii) (g) Devil\u2019s Hole Pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) (h) Arabian (White) Oryx (Oryx leucoryx) (i) Sunda Pangolin (Manis javanica) Figure 6\u201318 Endangered species. Shown are some examples of endangered species\u2014species whose populations in nature have dropped so low that they are in imminent danger of becoming extinct unless protection is provided. The Arabian oryx (h) was recently delisted as an endangered species, but wild populations are still only 1,000 individuals. Conflicting Values. Since its enactment, the Endangered Species Act has been a political lightning rod. It was scheduled for reauthorization in 1992, but because of political battles, it has been operating on year-to-year budget extensions. Opposition to the act comes from development, timber, recreational, and mineral interests, as well as other groups. Organizations such as the American Land Rights Association and the American Forest Resource Council continually lobby for weakening or abolishing the act because they believe it limits the rights of landowners to log, construct buildings, and carry out other activities. Proponents and opponents of the act view its success rate very differently. Some critics claim that the Endangered Species Act has been a failure because only a few of the 1,500 listed species ( Table 6\u20135) have recovered and been taken off the list (33 species had been recovered by 2014). In response, proponents state that the two main causes of extinction\u2014habitat loss and invasive species\u2014are on the increase. Furthermore, species are listed only when they have already reached a dangerously low population, which means that they almost certainly would have gone extinct without protection; the populations of some 41% of the species on the list have stabilized or increased since being listed. We could also look at the number that have not gone extinct, when all of the evidence suggested they would. Then the success rate of the act would be 99%. Other critics of the Endangered Species Act believe that it does not go far enough. A major shortcoming is that protection is not provided until a species is officially listed as endangered or threatened and a recovery plan is established. For half of the protected vertebrate species, fewer than 1,000 individuals remained in each population at the time of listing; for half of the listed plant species, fewer than 120 individuals remained. Currently, the list\u2019s backlog includes some 142 candidate species, all of which are acknowledged to be in need of listing. In the first 20 years following the passage of the Endangered Species Act, 114 U.S. species went extinct or missing, which means that they haven\u2019t been seen despite at least 10 years of survey. The majority of these never made it to the list and became extinct during a delay in listing procedures. Some opponents believe that the critical habitat designation puts unwanted burdens on property owners and has little merit in conserving species. One proposed alternative law, for example, would have completely eliminated critical habitat protections, replacing them with a statement that recovery plans must identify areas of \u201cspecial value\u201d to the protection of the species; nothing in this designation would be mandatory. However, science suggests that critical habitat matters. Species whose critical habitat has been protected have been twice as likely to be on the road to recovery as those whose habitat has not been protected. In fact, the current approach is to protect the critical habitat of multiple species at once, an ecosystem approach. Powerful Protection.", "In the final analysis, the Endangered Species Act is a formal recognition of the importance of preserving wild species, regardless of whether they are economically important. Species listed as endangered or threatened have legal rights to protection. The act is something of a last resort for wild species, but it embodies an encouraging attitude toward nature that has now become public policy. Many consider it to be the most powerful law in the United States for the protection of species. Seeing Success Efforts to protect species\u2014such as the Lacey Act, the Marine Mammals Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and many other laws designed to keep our biotic heritage from going extinct\u2014have resulted in some successes. The Lake Erie water snake is one such example. Another example of a species restored to parts of its former range because of these protection and recovery efforts is the gray wolf. Other species have also benefited significantly from these laws. Birds of Prey. Both bald eagles and peregrine falcons have been removed from the Endangered Species List because their numbers have recovered significantly (Figure 6\u201319) . Both are large raptors\u2014predatory birds at the top of the food chain\u2014that were driven to extremely low numbers because of the use of the pesticide DDT from the 1940s through the 1960s. Carried up to these predators through the food chain, DDT caused a serious thinning of the birds\u2019 6.3 Saving Wild Species 149 eggshells that led to nesting failures (see Chapter 1) . In the early 1970s, DDT use was banned in both the United States and Canada, and the stage was set for the birds to recover. Although both raptors are now delisted, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act still protects them, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act protects the eagle. Fly Away Home. A few species have gained exceptional public attention, and heroic efforts have been mounted to save them. Efforts to save the whooping crane, for example, include virtually full-time monitoring and protection of the migratory wild flock; from a low of 14 cranes in 1939, the population had increased to 304 in the spring of 2014. Scientists have used creative approaches to helping these wild birds survive, in some cases teaching them to migrate (Figure 6\u201320) . Non-migratory flocks have been reintroduced in central Florida and Louisiana. Although each of these flocks is extremely vulnerable to environmental changes, conservationists remain hopeful. Another success is the first delisted fish, the Oregon chub (Oregonichthys crameri), a small minnow that lives exclusively in Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley. As a result of non-native predators and wetland drainage, its population had dwindled to fewer than 1,000 fish in eight locations. The fish was listed as endangered in 1993. Comprehensive efforts to protect the fish, involving private landowners, state and federal agencies, university researchers, and conservation groups have been critical to its recovery. Bald eagles, peregrine falcons, whooping cranes, and the Oregon chub are examples of successful conservation. Although these species still need help, their numbers are clearly increasing. These examples show that current laws and the hard work of many can make a difference in slowing the rate of extinction. Compare the roles of the Lacey Act and the Endangered Species Act in the protection of species. CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 Figure 6\u201319 The American bald eagle.

A pilot in an ultra-light aircraft leads a flock of whooping cranes in their migration from Wisconsin to Florida. 6.4 Protecting Biodiversity Internationally Serious efforts are being made to preserve biodiversity around the world, especially in the tropics, where so much of the world\u2019s biodiversity exists. These protective efforts require an immense amount of coordination among local, state, and federal authorities. The National Biological Information Infrastructure is a collaborative program that makes protecting species easier for agencies in the United States, but the United States also has to coordinate with the rest of the world. These partnerships not only create treaties, but also monitor species, share scientific advances, and find solutions to the needs of people who are clashing with wild species. International Developments There are numerous international developments for the protection of species. Some, like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, formerly called the World Conservation Union), are organizations that monitor the successes and failures of our conservation efforts.", "Others are organizations that help coordinate scientists or policy makers around the globe. For example, the Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) is a part of the Species Survival Commission of IUCN. The ISSG is made up of invited world experts who act as advisors and maintain a global invasive species database. The policy and treaty makers have to hammer out documents like the Convention on Biological Diversity. Finally, there has to be funding for species protection, some of which is provided by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund and other foundations. The Red List. The IUCN maintains a \u201cRed List\u201d of threatened species. Similar to the U.S. Endangered Species List, the Red List uses a set of criteria to evaluate the risk of extinction for thousands of species throughout the world. The list is updated frequently, and there were 22,176 species of plants and animals on it in 2014. Once published in book form, the Red List is now available in searchable electronic format on the Internet. Each species on the list is given its proper classification, and its distribution, documentation, habitat, ecology, conservation measures, and data sources are described. The IUCN is not actively engaged in preserving endangered species in the field, but its findings are often the basis of conservation activities throughout the world, and it provides crucial leadership to the world community on issues involving biodiversity. One of its efforts was to help establish the Trade Records Analysis for Flora and Fauna in International Commerce (TRAFFIC) network, which monitors wildlife trade and helps to implement the decisions and provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). CITES. Endangered species outside the United States are only tangentially addressed by the Endangered Species Act. However, under the leadership of the United States, CITES was established in the early 1970s. CITES is not specifically a device to protect rare species\u2014instead, it is an international agreement (signed by 169 nation-states) that focuses on trade in wildlife and wildlife parts. The treaty recognizes three levels of vulnerability of species\u2014 the highest being species threatened with extinction\u2014and covers 5,000 animals and 28,000 plants, fungi, and other species. Restrictive trade permits and agreements between exporting and importing countries are applied to those species, sometimes resulting in a complete ban on trade if the nations agree. Every two or three years, the signatory countries meet at a Conference of the Parties. The latest such conference was held in 2013 in Bangkok, Thailand. Perhaps the best-known act of CITES was to ban the international trade in ivory in 1989 in order to stop the rapid decline of the African elephant (from 2.5 million animals in 1950 to about 609,000 in 1989 and around 470,000 in 2008). To combat the illegal trade in ivory, officials are using DNA testing to determine the origin of ivory (see Sound Science, Using DNA to Catch Wildlife Criminals). A report released in 2014 declared that African elephants had reached a tipping point. Each year, 35,000 elephants are killed. Fewer are born than die, a formula for disaster. Any plan to protect African elephants needs to enable people in Africa to manage wildlife without overexploitation, persuade others to stop using ivory, and use science to stop ivory crime. These changes require a world outcry against ivory collection. Convention on Biological Diversity. Although CITES provides some protection for species that might be involved in international trade, it is inadequate to address broader issues pertaining to the loss of biodiversity. With the support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), an ad hoc working group proposed an international treaty that would move to conserve biological diversity worldwide. After several years of negotiation, the Convention on Biological Diversity was drafted and became one of the pillars of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The Biodiversity Treaty, as the convention is called, was ratified in December 1993 and is now in force. One hundred ninety-two states and the European Union are treaty members. As originally organized, the treaty addresses three complementary objectives: (1) the conservation of biodiversity, (2) the sustainable use of biodiversity services, and (3) the equitable sharing of the use of genetic resources found in a country. The treaty establishes a secretariat and designates the Conference of the Parties (the treaty members) as the governing body. The Conference of the Parties has established programs to guide international work in major biomes, including agricultural, dry-land, coastal, marine, and island ecosystems.", "At the 2010 meeting of the convention held in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, world governments developed a set of global goals, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. These five strategic goals and 20 targets form the basis of a plan to help nations better protect biodiversity by 2020. The 6.4 Protecting Biodiversity Internationally 151 SOUND SCIENCE first of the strategic goals is \u201cto address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society.\u201d 15 After the joint international meeting, individual countries agreed to form national biodiversity strategies and action plans within two years. National reports on those strategies and plans were first submitted in 2014. Some examples of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets are: The secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the UNEP jointly published the report Global Biodiversity Outlook 1, 2, 3, and 4 in 2001, 2006, 2010, and 2014, respectively. Global Biodiversity Outlook 4 summarizes the state of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets midway to the 2020 end point. Some positive findings were that scientific knowledge is increasing and certification programs for aquaculture are improving. One target (11) is likely to be met: At least 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas have been conserved. However, coral reef 15 http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/ degradation, nutrient pollution, and habitat fragmentation are getting worse. The U.S. and the Convention on Biological Diversity. President Clinton signed the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1993, but it was not ratified by the U.S Senate, leaving U.S. involvement in a state of limbo. However, many of the provisions of the treaty are being carried out by different U.S. agencies. The National Biological Service, for example, is working on several of the treaty\u2019s provisions. The United States continues to send delegations to the Conference of the Parties and participates in other related meetings, such as those dealing with genetically modified organisms. The Nagoya Protocol. During the 2010 meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Nagoya, Japan, the international community agreed to a new treaty, the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization, usually called the Nagoya Protocol. The purpose of this treaty was to support one of the major goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity\u2014to protect biodiversity in a fair way. The treaty states that companies from wealthy nations cannot mine the genetic resources of other countries and then patent products that indigenous people have used for millennia. The protocol recognizes the value of traditional knowledge and includes incentives for the protection of biodiversity. Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund emerged in August 2000. Jointly sponsored by the World Bank, Conservation International, the government of Japan, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Global Environment Facility, the fund provides grants to NGOs and community-based groups for conservation activities in biodiversity hot spots\u201434 regions, making up just 2.3% of Earth\u2019s land surface (Figure 6\u201321) , in which 75% of the most threatened mammals, birds, and amphibians are located. While many scientists agree that focusing protection on the most biodiverse areas is a good way to protect species, there is concern that areas that have fewer species but are highly productive (such as salt marshes) or are otherwise very valuable to conservation may be ignored. Some argue for protection of these \u201ccold spots\u201d as well.16 Stewardship Concerns What we do about wild species and biodiversity reflects on our wisdom and our values. Wisdom dictates that we take steps to protect the biological wealth that sustains so many of our needs and economic activities. Our values come from our view of species and their instrumental and intrinsic worth. Our values also reflect what we think about the importance of justice\u2014whether we believe, for example, that the people who most benefit economically from the use of 16P. Karieva and M. Marvier, \u201cConserving Biodiversity Coldspots,\u201d American Scientist 91, no. 4 (2003): 344. an ecosystem should be the same people who bear the risks of its decline, or whether we value maintaining choices and options for future generations. Wisdom. The scientific team that put together the UN Global Biodiversity Assessment focused on four themes in its recommendations: Irano-Mountains of Caucasus Anatolian Central Asia Himalaya Polynesia-Micronesia 6.4 Protecting Biodiversity Internationally 153 migratory birds, summer and winter ranges and flyways between them must be considered. 4. Promoting research on biodiversity. Far too little is known about how to manage diverse ecosystems and landscapes, and much remains to be learned about the species within the boundaries of different countries.", "Toward that end, a new field called biodiversity informatics has been established. Its goal is to put taxonomic data and other information on species online. 17 Values and Economics. Our values also are demonstrated by our approach to wild species. To protect their value, we need to make the conservation of species a part of the economy. We have seen the costs involved with invasive species and the loss of commercially important species. Yet it also costs money to conserve species. Usually the expenditures to protect species must take place now, while the money we will save by protecting them becomes available later. In addition, the present costs are obvious, while the later savings are less obvious. In 2012, scientists estimated that it would cost $76 billion annually to reach the Aichi targets and protect species. Although that is a great 17F. A. Bisby, \u201cThe Quiet Revolution: Biodiversity Informatics and the Internet,\u201d Science 89, 5488 (2000): 2309\u20132312. deal of money, it is much less than the estimated costs of losing those species and the ecosystems they maintain. To put this in perspective, the cost of this investment in natural capital would be about one fifth of what the world spends on soft drinks annually. At the start of the chapter, we learned about breeding reserves for river dolphins in Bangladesh, developed through the efforts of conservation biologists. The success of other conservation efforts shows us that we can indeed stem the tide of species declines with hard work. Thomas Jefferson once said, \u201cFor if one link in nature\u2019s chain might be lost, another might be lost, until the whole of things will vanish by piecemeal.\u201d 18 As this quote suggests, loss of wild species and their associated genetic and ecosystem diversity could lead to a breakdown in the natural functioning of ecosystems. For this reason, strategies to address the loss of biodiversity must focus on protecting whole ecosystems, as we will see in a later chapter (Chapter 7). Compare the main objectives of the CITES Treaty and the Convention on Biological Diversity.

The Value, Use, and Restoration of Ecosystems Bright sunlight filters through shallow water, revealing the colors of a tropical reef. Fish flit by the branching arms of a coral. A parrotfish grazes a piece of seaweed, and a lobster hides at the base of a craggy rock. As the Sun warms the clear water, divers swim by. An endangered Nassau grouper floats in an eddy, eyeing a smaller fish. A non-native lionfish snaps out, catching prey. It\u2019s another day in a tropical paradise. Suddenly, a SCUBA diver snatches the venomous lionfish and heads for the surface with the catch. Today is the Lionfish Derby, held in the Florida Keys and run by the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF). In the Derby, teams compete for cash and prizes to capture these invasive fish and remove them from this critical habitat. Researchers will use data from the captured fish to better understand their biology and ecology. Lionfish lack predators in the Caribbean and eat the young of other fish. The capture removes some of the invaders from a habitat that is important to many other species. In 2013, the Florida Keys Lionfish Derby teams netted 12,012 fish! While lionfish derbies will not remove this invasive predator entirely, scientists believe that continually removing as many as possible will keep populations low enough to avoid reef damage. Citizen Scientists. On a similar day elsewhere in the Caribbean, SCUBA divers move methodically through the water, recording the fish they see. They note the condition of coral reefs and record the presence of fish species, both herbivorous and carnivorous. This is also a REEF initiative: the Volunteer Survey Project. The SCUBA divers, trained volunteers in a network of \u201ccitizen scientists,\u201d will submit the information they collect, to be used by scientists who track what is happening with coral reef fish. Using these data, scientists have already been able to figure A diver observes an invasive lionfish in a Caribbean coral reef.", "Chapter 7 Learning Objectives 7.1 Ecosystem Capital and Services: List ways natural ecosystems have economic value as they provide goods and services vital to human well-being. 7.2 Types of Ecosystem Uses: Compare the consumptive and productive uses of ecosystems. 7.3 Terrestrial Ecosystems Under Pressure: Describe the value of forest and grassland ecosystems; identify the main threats to these ecosystems and solutions to these problems. 7.4 Ocean Ecosystems Under Pressure: Describe the value of ocean ecosystems; identify the main threats to these ecosystems and solutions to these problems. 7.5 Protection and Restoration: Explain how the public and private management of lands is key to protecting habitats and keeping them productive, and describe examples of ecosystem restoration projects. out a few things: Fish are declining, which affects the health of the coral reef. As herbivorous fish decline, algae and water plants can grow over the corals. Some of these produce toxic chemicals and kill the coral. As carnivorous fish decline, coral-eating sea stars are free to take over. The invasive lionfish can oust other native reef fish. Researcher Christopher Stallings of the Florida State University Coastal and Marine Lab is one of the scientists working with REEF. His work with the large database on fish in the Caribbean showed that some large-bodied fish such as the Nassau grouper have completely disappeared in certain highly populated areas. 1 Critical Ecosystems. Around the world, coral reefs are critical ecosystems. They act as nurseries for marine fish and as an early warning system for habitat degradation. Because they 1C. Stallings, \u201cFishery-Independent Data Reveal Negative Effect of Human Population Density on Caribbean Predatory Fish Communities,\u201d PLoS ONE 4(5) (2009): [e5333]. need clean, clear water and grow relatively slowly, corals show us when marine systems are in decline. Physical breakage, pollution, heat, and invasive species combine to kill off these colonial animals and their algal symbionts. A coral reef is a good example of an ecosystem that provides humans with goods and services and that needs monitoring, protection, and sometimes restoration. The dive teams competing in the Lionfish Derby and the SCUBA divers recording species while they dive are ways that ordinary people can be involved in the care of an ecosystem. One key to saving wild species, and protecting the human well-being that depends on them, is to preserve their habitats\u2014the ecosystems in which they are found (Chapter 6). The focus of this chapter is on the natural ecosystems that directly sustain human life and economies. We will pay special attention to those ecosystems that are in the deepest trouble. These ecosystems, the species in them, and the goods and services they generate are identified as ecosystem capital, a major component of the natural capital wealth of nations (Chapters 1, 2 ). 7.1 Ecosystem Capital and Services Earth\u2019s ecosystems vary greatly in the makeup of their species, but exhibit common functions, such as energy flow and the cycling of matter. The major types of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems\u2014the biomes\u2014reflect the response of plants, animals, and microbes to different climatic conditions. For the purposes of this chapter, Earth\u2019s land area can be divided into five broad categories: forests and woodlands, grasslands and savannas, croplands, wetlands, and deserts and tundra (Figure 7\u20131a ). The oceanic ecosystems can be categorized as coastal ocean and bays, coral reefs, and open ocean (Figure 7\u20131b) . These eight terrestrial and aquatic systems provide all of our food; much of our fuel; wood for lumber and paper; fibers\u2014leather, furs, and raw materials for fabrics; oils and alcohols; and much more. The world economy and human well-being directly depend on the exploitation of the natural goods that can be extracted from ecosystems; the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment team refers to this function of ecosystems as their provisioning service. Ecosystems also perform a number of other valuable services as they process energy and circulate matter in the normal course of their functioning (see Figure 5\u201322). Regulating services are benefits derived from the regulation of ecosystem processes, such as flood control or climate moderation. Cultural services comprise nonmaterial benefits people gain from ecosystems, including spiritual enrichment, knowledge, and aesthetic enjoyment. Finally, ecosystems provide services that maintain themselves, such as photosynthesis. These are called supporting services. Forests and woodlands (31.7%) Grasslands and savannas (20.2%) Coastal ocean and bays (4.9%) Croplands (10.7%) Coral reefs (0.1%) Wetlands (3.5%) Open ocean (95.0%) Deserts and tundra (34.0%) (a) Terrestrial Ecosystems (b) Ocean Ecosystems Figure 7\u20131 Relative areas of terrestrial and ocean ecosystems.", "(a) Forests, which are the most productive ecosystems on land, occupy almost as much area as the least productive ecosystems, deserts and tundra. (b) In the oceans, the low-productivity open ocean dominates. Coral reefs represent only 0.1% of the whole, yet they are ecologically and economically important. Table 7\u20131 shows combinations of services provided to societies by a spectrum of ecosystems. In their normal functioning, all natural and altered ecosystems perform some or all of these natural services, year after year. A team of natural scientists and economists calculated the total value of a year\u2019s global ecosystem goods and services to be $41 trillion (Chapter 5) , but we receive them free of charge. Ecosystems as Natural Resources If the natural services performed by ecosystems are so valuable, why are we still draining wetlands and removing 7.1 Ecosystem Capital and Services 157 forests? The answer is clear: A natural area will receive protection only if the value a society assigns to the services it provides in its natural state is higher than the value the society assigns to converting it to a more direct human use. Natural ecosystems and the organisms in them are commonly referred to as natural resources. As resources, they are expected to produce something of value, and the most commonly understood value is economic value. By referring to natural systems as resources, we are placing them in an economic setting, so it becomes easy to lose sight of their ecological value. To avoid making this mistake, we use the concept of ecosystem capital instead of natural resources. Valuing Natural Capital. Markets provide the mechanism for assessing economic value, but do poorly at placing monetary values on ecosystem services. People and institutions may express their preferences for different ecosystem services via the market, an instrumental value ( Chapter 6) . Instrumental valuation works fairly well for the provisioning services provided by ecosystems (goods such as timber, fish, and crops). It is far more difficult to put prices on many of the regulating, cultural, and supporting services provided by natural ecosystems. These services are public goods, things that are not depleted as people use them and that cannot be effectively limited in order to charge money; for example, fresh air is a public good. Public goods are not usually provided by markets but contribute greatly to people\u2019s well-being. In fact, they are absolutely essential. Regulating and cultural services provide benefits that are experienced over a large area; the loss of these services is also experienced regionally. For example, a large forested area modifies the climate in a region and absorbs and holds water. A small forest can be cut and the timber sold, providing income to the owners with no noticeable impact on the climate. Cutting a larger area of forest will provide an immediate economic benefit to the owners but will also cause a long-term loss of regulating and supporting services, affecting the well-being of people in the formerly forested area and well beyond. In this case, short-term profits are made at the long-term expense of many. Some natural ecosystems are maintained in a natural or semi-natural state because that is how they provide the greatest economic value for their owners. For example, most of the state of Maine is owned by private corporations that exploit the forests for lumber and paper manufacturing; however, if Maine experienced a population explosion and corporations could sell their land to developers for more money than could be gained from harvesting timber, forested lands would quickly become house lots. Figure 7\u20132 shows a common scene, a forest converted to a housing development. Similar conversions can be pictured: tropical forests to grasslands for grazing, agricultural fields to suburbs, and wetlands to vacation developments. Figure 7\u20132 Conversion of forest to suburban development. Trees are cut to build housing developments such as this one in Loudoun County, Virginia. Similar conversions occur on grasslands and coastal wetlands. Some natural ecosystems are publicly owned (state and federal lands) or cannot be owned at all (ocean ecosystems). These ecosystems are still considered natural resources and may be subject to economically motivated exploitation. Sustainable exploitation of such systems will maintain the natural services they perform. Future Pressures. As the human population continues to rise, pressures on ecosystems to provide resources will increase: more food, more wood, more water, and more fisheries products will be needed. The sustainable exploitation of ecosystem capital will become more difficult.", "The main objective of the thorough work of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment was to evaluate the health of the services that people derive from the natural world. The assessment team found that 15 of the 24 services they evaluated were in decline worldwide, 5 were in a stable state, and 4 were increasing at the expense of other services (Chapter 1). Fortunately, ecosystems can sustain con tinued exploitation and also be restored from destructive uses that have degraded them. CONCEPT CHECK List at least three ecosystems services that forests provide and three that urban parks provide. How are the services provided by these ecosystems similar? \u2610\u2713 7.2 Types of Ecosystem Uses An ecosystem\u2019s remarkable natural capacity to regenerate makes it (and its biota) a renewable resource. In other words, an ecosystem has the capacity to replenish itself despite certain quantities of organisms being taken from it. This renewal can go on indefinitely\u2014it is sustainable. Recall that every species has the biotic potential to increase its numbers and that, in a balanced population, the excess numbers fall prey to parasites, predators, and other factors of environ mental resistance (Chapter 4) . It is difficult to find fault with activities that effectively put some of this excess population to human use. The trouble occurs when users such as hunters, fishers, or loggers take more than the excess and deplete the breeding population. Conservation Versus Preservation Conservation of natural biota and ecosystems does not imply no use by humans whatsoever, although this may sometimes be temporarily expedient in a management program to allow a certain species to recover its numbers. Rather, the aim of conservation is to manage or regulate use so that it does not exceed the capacity of the species or system to renew itself. Conservation is capable of being carried out sustainably, and when sustainability is adopted as a principle, conservation has a well-defined goal. Preservation is often confused with conservation. The objective of preservation is to ensure the continuity of species and ecosystems, regardless of their potential utility. Effective preservation often precludes making use of the species or ecosystems in question. For example, it is impossible to maintain old-growth forests and at the same time harvest the trees. Thus, a second-growth forest can be conserved (trees can be cut, but at a rate that allows the forest to recover), but an old-growth forest must be preserved (it must not be cut down at all). Patterns of Human Use of Natural Ecosystems Before examining the specific biomes and ecosystems that are under the highest pressure from human use, we need to consider a few general patterns of how people use natural resources. Consumptive Use. People in rural areas make use of natural lands or aquatic systems that are in close proximity to them. When people harvest natural resources in order to provide themselves with food, shelter, tools, fuel, and clothing, they are engaged in consumptive use. Thus, people hunt for game ( Figure 7\u20133) and fish and gather fruits and nuts in order to meet their food needs; they also collect natural products such as firewood, as well as wood or palm leaves to construct shelters. People may barter or sell such goods in exchange for other goods or services in local markets, but most consumptive use involves family members engaged in hunting and gathering to meet their own needs. This kind of exploitation usually does not appear in the calculations of the market economy of a country. Even so, this form of \u201cwild income\u201d is highly important to the poor; some 1.2\u20131.4 billion people, many of them poor, depend on forests for some of their income. Dependence on consumptive use is most commonly associated with the developing world, but it also exists in the more rural areas of the developed world, where people depend on wood for fuel or wild game for food. Approximately 2.4 billion people rely on wood for heating fuel, some 40% of the population of less developed countries, and many use wood to boil water or cook food. Their well-being would be diminished if they were denied access to these \u201cfree\u201d resources. In many parts of Africa, wild game, or \u201cbush meat,\u201d provides a large proportion of the protein needs of people. This can represent 80% of the fat and protein in the diet 7.2 Types of Ecosystem Uses 159 of rural Africans. 2 Without these resources, people\u2019s living standard would decline and their very existence could be threatened.", "Unfortunately, this is a largely unregulated practice and often involves poaching in wildlife parks. According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), poaching has contributed to the decline of 30 endangered species. Making matters worse, commercial hunters have recently turned what was once a matter of local people using wildlife for food into an unsustainable industry that supplies cities with tons of \u201cfashionable\u201d meat. For example, primate meat (e.g., chimpanzee) has been found in markets in New York, London, Paris, and other cities. Productive Use. In contrast to the consumptive use of resources, productive use is the exploitation of ecosystem resources for economic gain, as when products like timber 2R. Nasi et al., Conservation and Use of Wildlife-Based Resources: The Bushmeat Crisis [PDF] (Montreal, Canada: Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity; Bogor, Indonesia: Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), 2007), Technical Series no. 33. Figure 7\u20133 Consumptive use. Wild game is an important food source for millions. This young hunter of the Xingu tribe of the Amazon Basin in Brazil has captured a monkey, which he and his family will eat. and fish are harvested and sold for national or international markets ( Figure 7\u20134). Productive use is an enormously important source of revenue and employment for people in every country. The global fisheries catch in 2012, which reached 93 million metric tons (102 million tons), was valued at $130 billion. More than 1.2 billion hectares of forests are managed for wood production. Nearly half of the wood removed, however, is used for fuel, so a great deal of the value of forests occurs on the consumptive, noneconomic side. Planted forests are on the increase, shifting timber harvest from natural to planted forests and making conservation of some natural forests easier. Another productive use is the collection of wild species of plants and animals for cultivation or domestication. Wild species may provide the initial breeding stock for commercial plantations or ranches; they may also be used as sources of genes to be introduced into existing crop plants or animals to add desirable genetic traits, such as resistance to disease. Wild species also continue to provide sources of new medi cines (Chapter 6). Property Rights. Consumptive and productive uses of natural ecosystem resources are the consequence of the rights of tenure, or property rights, over the land and water holding those resources. There are four kinds of tenure: (1) private ownership, which restricts access to natural resources; (2) communal ownership, which permits use of natural resources by members of the community; (3) state ownership of natural resources, which implies regulated use; and (4) open access, in which natural resources can be used by anyone. In all of these forms of tenure there is the potential for either sustainable or unsustainable use of the resource. The concepts of private and communal land ownership often come into conflict in developing countries where indigenous people, who may have lived in areas for millennia, cannot document their ownership of the land. Who owns the ecosystem products and services that outsiders want to develop? In 2014, the World Bank proposed changes to its funding process that make it easier for governments to ignore the rights of indigenous people. For example, governments can override the rights of hunter-gatherer tribes to allow others to log on their ancestral lands or can force evictions of indigenous people for the conservation of watersheds. As a result of these tensions, the perspective of combining stewardship with protecting the rights of others is vital. Are public policies that encourage stewardship, sustainability, and respect for human rights in place? Is the local or national government presence weak or corrupt? Are sound scientific principles employed in management strategies? Keep these questions in mind as we next examine two patterns that are commonly seen when people exploit natural resources. Maximum Sustainable Yield. The central question in managing a renewable natural resource is this: How much use can be sustained without undercutting the capacity of the species or system to renew itself? A scientific model employed to describe this amount of use is the maximum sustainable yield (MSY): the highest possible rate of use that the system can match with its own rate of replacement or maintenance. MSY is often used to describe the harvesting of natural resources such as fish and forest products. The concept of MSY can also apply to the maintenance of parks, air quality, water quality and quantity, and soils\u2014indeed, the entire biosphere.", "Use can refer to the cutting of timber, hunting, fishing, park visitations, the discharge of pollutants into air or water, and so on. Natural systems can withstand a certain amount of use (or abuse, in terms of pollution) and still remain viable. However, a point exists at which increasing use begins to 7.2 Types of Ecosystem Uses 161 destroy the system\u2019s regenerative capacity. Just short of that point is the MSY. Optimal Population. Imagine trying to harvest the fish in a pond. To calculate the MSY of the fish population, you need to know the carrying capacity of the ecosystem\u2014the maximum population the ecosystem can support on a sustainable basis. If the number of fish in your pond is well below carrying capacity, you won\u2019t be able to remove very many, because the population is low and there aren\u2019t many there to reproduce (Figure 7\u20135a) . Allowing the population to grow will increase the number of reproductive individuals and thus the yield that can be harvested. However, as the population approaches the carrying capacity of the ecosystem, new individuals must compete with older individuals for food and living space. As a result, recruitment (survival of new individuals in the population) will fall drastically (Figure 7\u20135b) . You will not be able to harvest many fish if you have many small individuals who are competing with each other for food. When a population is at or near the ecosystem\u2019s carrying capacity, production\u2014and hence sustainable yield\u2014can be increased by thinning the population so that competition is reduced and optimal growth and reproductive rates are achieved. Theoretically, the optimal population for harvesting the MSY is just halfway to the carrying capacity. The practical use of the logistic model of growth is complicated by the fact that the carrying capacity may be unknown or may vary over long periods of time. Replacement of harvested individuals may also vary from year to year, because some years are particularly favorable to reproduction and recruitment, while others are not. Human impacts, such as pollution and other alterations of habitats, adversely affect reproductive rates, recruitment, carrying capacity, and, consequently, sustainable yields. For these reasons, managing natural populations to achieve the MSY is fraught with difficulties. Furthermore, accurate estimates of the size of the population and the recruitment Carrying capacity High Time Rate of recruitment to population rate must be made continually, and these data are hard to come by for many species. Precautionary Principle. The conventional approach to managing harvests has been to use the estimated MSY to set a fixed quota. In the management of fisheries, this quota is called the total allowable catch (TAC). But if the data on population and recruitment are inaccurate, it is easy to overestimate the TAC, especially when there are pressures from fishers (and the politicians who represent them) to maintain a high harvest quota. In the face of such uncertainties, and also in response to repeated cases of overuse and depletion of resources, resource managers have been turning to the precautionary principle. That is, where there is uncertainty, resource managers must favor the protection of the living resource. Thus, exploitation limits must be set well enough below the MSY to allow for uncertainties. Those using the resource ordinarily want to push the limits higher, however, so the result is frequent conflicts between users and managers. These conflicts are considered in greater detail in the discussion of fisheries later in this section. Using the Commons. A resource that is owned by a group of people in common, or by no one (open access), is known as a common-pool resource, or commons. Strictly speaking, a commons is an open-access resource that can be used by someone without subtracting from its use by others; for example, knowledge is a commons. Examples of natural common-pool resources include U.S. federal grasslands, on which private ranchers graze their livestock; coastal and open-ocean fisheries used by commercial fishers; groundwater drawn for farms; and the atmosphere, which everyone breathes and which is polluted by everyone who drives motor vehicles. Sustainability implies that common-pool resources will be maintained so as to continue to yield benefits not just for the present, but also for future users. Figure 7\u20135 Maximum sustainable High Relative population size Low Relative population size Low yield. The maximum sustainable yield occurs when the population is at the optimal level, meaning the rate of population increase is at a maximum. Historically, the population of a particular fish species hovered at 100,000 individuals. The population is now 10,000.", "How much would the population have to change to be at its most productive level? (a) (b) SUSTAINABILITY Figure 7\u20136 Common pasture. These cattle are grazing in Dartmoor National Park, in Devon, England. If the use of common land is unregu-lated, it will tend to be overgrazed. Tragedy of the Commons. The exploitation of common-pool resources can present serious problems and may lead to the eventual ruin of the resource\u2014a phenomenon called the \u201ctragedy of the commons,\u201d taken from the title of a 1968 essay by the biologist Garrett Hardin. 3 As described by Hardin, the original commons were pastures around villages in England ( Figure 7\u20136). The king provided these pastures without charge to anyone who wished to graze cattle. Herders were quick to realize that whoever grazed the most cattle stood to benefit the most. Even if they realized that a particular commons was being overgrazed, those who withdrew their cattle simply sacrificed personal profits without guaranteeing the conservation of the resource, while others went on using that pasture until it was damaged. One herder\u2019s sacrifice became another\u2019s 3Garrett Hardin, \u201cThe Tragedy of the Commons,\u201d Science 162 (1968): 1243\u20131247. 7.2 Types of Ecosystem Uses 163 gain, so when individuals made a cost-benefit analysis they chose to use the pasture. Consequently, herders would add to their herds until the commons was totally destroyed. The lesson of this story is that where there is no management of the commons, the outcome is inevitable\u2014 the pursuit of individuals\u2019 own interests will lead to a tragedy for all. Hardin\u2019s essay applies to a limited, but significant set of problems that arise when there is open access to a common-pool resource but no regulating authority (or the regulating authority is ineffective) and no functioning community. Exploitation of the resource then becomes a free-for-all in which profit is the only motive. One example of the tragedy of the commons was the extinction of the passenger pigeon, caused by the unregulated hunting of wild flocks of birds ( Chapter 6). Coastal and offshore fisheries have consistently demonstrated the reality of the tragedy of the commons, with stocks of desirable fish declining all over the world. The tragedy can be avoided only by limiting freedom of access. Limiting Access. One arrangement that can mitigate the tragedy is private ownership. When a renewable natural resource is privately owned, access to it is restricted and, in theory, it will be exploited in a manner that guarantees a continuing harvest for its owner(s). This theory does not hold, however, when an owner maximizes immediate profit and then moves on. Modern corporations lend themselves to this strategy: For example, a timber company may take over a natural resource and clear-cut the forest in order to pay off debts incurred in the process of the takeover. Other owners, though, will be in for the long run and manage the resources more responsibly because it is in their best interests to do so. Where private ownership is unworkable or lacking, the alternative is to regulate access to the commons. Regulation should allow for: (1) protection, so that the benefits derived from the commons can be sustained; (2) fairness in access rights; and (3) mutual consent of the regulated. Such regulation can be the responsibility of the state, but it does not have to be. In fact, the most sustainable approach to maintaining the commons may be local community control, wherein the power to manage the commons resides with those who directly benefit from its use. Because unregulated commons tend to be degraded, some have argued for the privatization of most resources. Others have argued for the concept of \u201cthe common heritage of human kind.\u201d 4 In this view, some resources belong to all of us and to future generations and have to be regulated accordingly. There is a much controversy about which approach will lead to the most sustainable use of resources. Public Policies. To achieve the objectives of conservation when harvesting living resources, it is important to consider the concept and limitations of the MSY, as well as the social and economic factors causing the overuse and degradation that diminish the sustainable yield. After reviewing these factors, public policies that effectively protect natural resources can be established and enforced. Some principles that should be embodied in these policies are presented in Table 7\u20132. When policies based on principles like these are in place, it is possible for people to continue to put natural resources to sustainable consumptive and productive uses.", "CONCEPT CHECK When factories, businesses, vehicles, and homes in a city contribute to smog, what is the common resource? In what way is the situation a \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d? \u2610\u2713 4 UNESCO, Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generations Toward Future Generations, accessed January 20, 2015, http://portal.unesco.org/ en/ev.php-URL_ID=13178&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html. 7.3Terrestrial Ecosystems Under Pressure Today human domination of the landscape is pervasive, and ecosystems have been converted or domesticated in vast areas of the planet. Even where systems appear natural, it is likely that humans have killed larger animals, suppressed wildfires, controlled rivers, introduced exotic species, and harvested wood. Elsewhere we have converted grasslands and forests into grazing lands and crop cultivation, so that almost half the land surface is now used in the production of crops and animal products. To be sure, domesticated ecosystems still provide provisioning and regulating and cultural services, and may do so sustainably, but they do so at our consent and largely for our benefit. Although human activities affect virtually all biomes and ecosystems, some are under more pressure than others. This section looks at forests and grasslands, the most important biomes in terms of economic significance and the potential for active human management. Forest Ecosystems Forests are lands where trees are the dominant life form and produce a canopy with more than 10% cover. They are the normal ecosystems in regions with year-round rainfall that is adequate to sustain tree growth. Figure 7\u20137 shows the locations of the world\u2019s four major forest biomes. To evaluate trends in forested areas, the UN\u2019s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) conducts periodic assessments of forest resources and compares the data with previous information, a giant undertaking. In 2005, the world\u2019s forest cover was 3.8 billion hectares (9.4 billion acres), or 30% of total land area. 5 An additional 1.4 billion hectares (3.5 billion acres) were classified as \u201cother wooded land,\u201d or \u201cwoodlands,\u201d where the tree cover is less than 10% or the trees and shrubs grow no taller than 5 meters. Forest Goods and Ecosystem Services. Forests are the most productive ecosystems on land, accounting for 50% of terrestrial plant productivity. They also provide a number of valuable goods, including lumber, wood for making paper, fodder for domestic animals, fibers, gums, latex, fruit, berries, nuts, and fuel for cooking and heating. In fact, forests provide fuel, food, medicine, and income for more than 1.6 billion people, mostly in the developing countries. In many rural areas, wood is the primary source of energy; 2.4 billion people use wood as the fuel for cooking. About 30% of the world\u2019s forests are managed for the production of forest products. The most important forest product is wood for industrial use. Approximately 3.4 billion cubic meters (4.4 billion square yards) of wood are harvested annually from the world\u2019s forests for fuel, wood, and paper (Figure 7\u20138) . The formal forestry sector employs 13.2 million people directly, but other forest-related jobs are estimated to support more than 41 million people around the globe. Because forests are already so heavily used, an increased need for forest products cannot safely be met solely by increased cutting of forests. Instead we need greater efficiency, less waste, and more recycling of forest products. 5E. J. Lindquist et al., \u201cGlobal Forest Land-Use Change, 1990\u20132005,\u201d FAO Forestry Paper No. 169 (Rome, Italy: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and European Commission Joint Research Centre, 2012). Boreal Temperate Subtropical Tropical Figure 7\u20137 World forest biomes. The FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000 produced this map showing the locations of the world\u2019s major forests. 7.3 Terrestrial Ecosystems Under Pressure 165 Forests and woodlands perform a number of vital natural services. Among other things, they conserve biodiversity, prevent erosion, moderate flooding, store nutrients, moderate regional climates, and provide recreational opportunities. They also store carbon, which slows climate change (Chapter 18). In fact, the world\u2019s forests are estimated to absorb about 2 pentagrams of carbon per year, 30% of the carbon emissions caused by humans annually; this is approximately as much as the oceans absorb! In spite of their enormous value, forest ecosystems are under threat. Threats to Forest Ecosystems. Even though forests are highly productive ecosystems, it has always been difficult for humans to exploit them for food. Consequently, forestlands are often converted into pastures or replaced with cultivated plants that are used directly for food. Indeed, when European colonists came to the Western Hemisphere, their first task was to clear the forests so they could raise crops on agricultural land.", "Once the forests were cleared, continual grazing or plowing effectively prevented the trees from re-growing. In addition to the removal of trees, forests can be threatened by pollution, climate change, and invasive species. Deforestation. The largest threat to forests is the process of deforestation, the removal of forest and its replacement by another land use. Forests are being cut down at an unsustainable rate. A 2014 report on deforestation in the largest tracts of forest landscape found that over 100 million hectares (247 million acres, an area the size of Germany) had been degraded since 2000. Such forest loss is uneven, with most deforestation occurring in developing countries. Forest cover in the developed countries has remained stable recently, in part because developed countries import forest products. One study showed that a third of the deforestation in eight rapidly deforesting countries was due to the production of four commodities\u2014beef, soybeans, palm oil, and wood products\u2014and largely driven by export markets. 6 The cultivation of palm oil is the largest driver of Indonesian deforestation; this deforestation includes vast forest fires that produce smog and greenhouse gases. The annual net changes in forest area in major world regions are shown in Figure 7\u20139 . 6M. Persson, S. Henders, and T. Kastner, Trading Forests: Quantifying the Contribution of Global Commodity Markets to Emissions from Tropical Deforestation - Working Paper 384 (Center for Global Development, 2014), http://www.cgdev.org/publication/trading-forests-quantifying-contribution-global commodity-markets-emissions-tropical. CHANGE IN FOREST AREA BY REGION, 1990\u20132010 \u22124\u22123\u22122\u22121 0 1 2 3 Millions of hectares Net loss 2000\u20132010 Net gain 2000\u20132010 Net loss 1990\u20132000 Net gain 1990\u20132000 Figure 7\u20139 Annual net changes in forest area from 2000 to 2010. In some regions, the amount of forested land increased, but other regions lost forests. Virtually all of the losses occurred in the tropical forests of South America and Africa. (Source: Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] of the United Nations, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010, xvi.) Clearing a forest has huge consequences for the land and its people. In the short term, the land may yield crops or support livestock, more people may be fed, and more profit may accrue to the owners, but these effects do not last. When deforested, the overall productivity of the area is reduced. Local people lose their livelihood because the land no longer yields forest products. The loss of trees and leaf litter reduces the standing stock of nutrients and biomass. The soil begins to dry and erode. The hydrologic cycle is changed as water drains off the land instead of being released by transpiration through the leaves of trees or percolating into groundwater. These changes can alter the regional climate, making it drier and hotter. In dry regions, the result of deforestation may be desertification, the spread of deserts (Chapter 11). On a global scale, removed forests no longer act as a carbon sink for the removal of CO2 from the air. Finally, biodiversity is greatly diminished. Loss of forest health. Cutting forests is not the only way that humans adversely affect forests. Air pollution and climate change stress trees, while invasive species decrease biodiversity. Insect pests, disease, and fires cause significant damage. For example, in the United States and Canada, the mountain pine beetle has killed more than 11 million acres of forest since the 1990s. While temperate forests such as those in North America show signs of degradation, the most troubling changes have been seen in the tropics. Case Study: Tropical Forests. Tropical forests are a storehouse of biodiversity, providing habitat for millions of plant and animal species. They are also crucial in maintaining Earth\u2019s climate, serving as a major sink for carbon and restraining the buildup of global carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, the removal of tropical forests continues at a rapid rate. Between 1960 and 1990, 20% of the tropical forests (over 445 million hectares, or 1.1 billion acres) were converted to other uses; this is equivalent to two-fifths of the land area of the United States. The current rate of deforestation is lower than in the 1990s, but it is still a major cause for concern. Several factors contribute to the ongoing loss of tropical forests. The clearing of forests for subsistence agriculture is especially intense in Africa, where population growth is unrelenting. Cattle production is the largest cause of deforestation in the Amazon region. In Brazil, 200 million cattle live on 200 million hectares (about 494 million acres), an area about a quarter the size of the continental United States.", "Many governments in the developing world promote deforestation by encouraging the colonization of forested lands. Indonesia, which has the highest rate of deforestation in the world, has embarked on a program of resettlement and intends to convert 14 million hectares of forest into agricultural land between 2010 and 2020. International companies are logging millions of acres of tropical forest in smaller countries such as Belize, Suriname, and Papua New Guinea, where regulation is weak and corruption is widespread. Tropical forests offer a cautionary tale of how not to care for an important ecosystem. Yet it is unreasonable to expect the countries of the world\u2014especially the developing countries\u2014to forego making use of their forests. Solutions to Forest Problems. Despite the numerous threats to forests, there are also many positive trends. In the United States, where we have cut all but 5% of the forests that were here when the colonists first arrived, second-growth forests have regenerated wherever forestlands have been protected from conversion to croplands or house lots. There are more trees in the United States today than there were in 1920. In the East, some second-growth forests have aged to the point where they look almost as they did before their first cutting, except for the absence of the American chestnut and elm, two once-dominant trees that have largely died out because of invasive diseases (Chapter 4) . Now scientists are trying to breed disease-resistant American chestnuts and elms in order to restore these forests further. Improving forest management is part of the solution to pressures on forests. In addition to the careful use of forest resources, forest management may include protecting some forests from use. If forests are not cleared and converted to other uses, and if they are protected from stressors such as pollution and disease, they can be managed to yield a harvest of wood for fuel, paper, and building materials indefinitely. Even so, forest-management practices vary greatly in their impact on the forest itself and on surrounding ecosystems. Silviculture. The practice of forest management with the objective of producing a specific crop (hardwood, softwood, pulp, wood chips) is called silviculture. Several practices are employed, with quite different impacts on the total forest ecosystem involved. Because trees take from 25 to 100 years to mature to harvestable size, the normal process of management is a rotation, which is a cycle of decisions about a particular stand of trees from its early growth to the point of harvest. Two options are open to the forester: even-aged management and uneven-aged management. In even-aged management, trees of a fairly uniform age are managed until large enough to harvest, at which point they are cut down, and the area is replanted, with the objective of continuing the cycle in a dependable sequence. Fast-growing but economically valuable trees such as Douglas fir are favored for this kind of management. Harvesting is often accomplished by clear-cutting\u2014removing an entire stand at one time. Even-aged management creates a fragmented landscape and has serious effects on biodiversity and adjacent ecosystems. Uneven-aged management of a stand of trees results in a more diverse forest and lends itself to different harvesting strategies. One harvesting strategy is selective cutting, in which mature trees are removed in small groups or singly, leaving behind trees that can reseed themselves. Selective cutting allows the forest to maintain its biodiversity and normal ecosystem functions. Another strategy is shelter-wood cutting, which involves cutting groups of mature trees over longer periods (10 or 20 years), so at any time there are enough trees to provide seeds and to give shelter to growing seedlings. Like selective cutting, this method requires active management and skill, but unlike clear-cutting, it leaves a functional ecosystem standing. In effect, it should lead to a sustainable forest. Sustainable Forestry. A common objective of forestry management is sustained yield, which means that the production of wood is the primary goal and the forest is 7.3 Terrestrial Ecosystems Under Pressure 167 managed to harvest wood continuously without being destroyed. The concept of sustained yield is similar to MSY in that its objective is to maximize harvest rates, but it ignores the ecosystem properties of forests. Sustainable forest management, by contrast, considers the functions of the entire ecosystem.", "The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) of 1992 described sustainable forest management this way: \u201cForests are to be managed as ecosystems, with the objectives of maintaining the biodiversity and integrity of the ecosystem, but also to meet the social, economic, cultural and spiritual needs of present and future generations.\u201d Certification. The certification of forest products makes it possible for consumers to choose wood products that have been harvested sustainably. One certification program is run by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), an independent nonprofit organization that grew out of an alliance of industry representatives, forest scientists, and environmental organizations such as the National Wildlife Federation and the World Wide Fund for Nature. The mission of the FSC is to promote sustainable\u2014or, as they call it, \u201cresponsible\u201d\u2014 forestry. By 2014, more than 183 million hectares (452 million acres) of forest in 80 countries had been certified as using sustainable practices. Managing Public Forests. About 80% of the world\u2019s forests are publicly owned; some are managed locally and others by national governments. Overall, governments spend more on forestry than they collect in revenue. 7 On average, governments spend about $7.50 per hectare to manage timber and build and maintain logging roads, and collect about $4.50 per hectare. This amounts to a massive subsidy of logging. However, some forests are managed to conserve biodiversity or to protect other ecosystem services (Figure 7\u201310) . Worldwide, 13.5% of forests are in legally established protected areas. This proportion represents an increase, an acknowledgment by many countries of the important non-timber services of forests. China in particular has increased its protection of forests in order to slow the spread of deserts and soil loss (Chapter 11 ). 7FAO, Global Forest Resources Assessments, Key Findings 2010, 9, accessed January 20, 2015, http://www.pefc.org/images/stories/documents/external/KeyFindings-en.pdf. DESIGNATED FUNCTIONS OF FORESTS, 2010 Figure 7\u201310 Designated uses of forests. Forests are managed for different ecosystem services. (Source: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010, xxvi.) Many nations are preserving forests and putting them to use as tourist attractions. This practice can often generate much more income than logging. Putting forests under the control of indigenous villagers is an important part of forest protection. Where this practice has been implemented, forests have fared better than where they have been placed under state control. Sometimes such indigenous use occurs in areas called extractive reserves that yield non-timber goods. Some 12.3 million hectares (30.4 million acres) of the Brazilian Amazon have been set aside as extractive reserves. Forests in Developing Nations. There are encouraging trends in forest management in the developing world\u2014 trends that indicate that those in power are paying more attention to the importance of forest goods and services (other than just wood) and the needs of indigenous people. These actions include practicing sustainable forest management, designating forest areas for conservation, and establishing more-sustainable plantations of trees for wood or other products, such as cacao and rubber (Figure 7\u201311) . The widespread practice of converting tropical forests into palm oil plantations has led to the destruction of rain forests, including the critical habitat of the Sumatran orangutan. Protests of the companies that invest in or use palm oil has forced the largest palm oil producer to promise to stop its destructive practices, although it has not yet halted them. In some cases, the value of ecosystem services such as climate regulation justifies forest protection. For example, the United Nations has a program to protect forests in order to absorb carbon emissions. This program creates a financial value for the carbon stored in forests, providing an incentive to reduce emissions from forested lands; in this way, developing nations do not have to bear the burden of protecting forests on their own. Figure 7\u201311 A rubber tree plantation in Vietnam. The under-story of plantation forests is less complex than that of natural forests and supports less biodiversity. Grassland Ecosystems Although forests are heavily used, another group of of ecosystems is even more heavily affected by human activity\u2014the grasslands. Indeed, grassland ecosystems may be the most over-exploited ecosystems on the planet. Grasslands are found in regions with moderate rainfall and are usually characterized by well-developed soils. Grasslands that occur in temperate regions are called prairie, veldt, steppe, or pampas. In the tropics, grasslands with scattered trees are called savannas (Chapter 5) . The moderate rainfall and deep soils of grasslands provide excellent conditions for agriculture, particularly for the growth of grains such as wheat and corn.", "Unlike forests, grasslands have short food chains in which plants support large herbivores. Because they can support herds of grazing animals, grasslands are often used as pasture for cattle and other domestic animals that provide meat and other products. In the United States, 80% of the native grasslands have been converted to agriculture and other purposes. This conversion has had negative effects on grassland natives such as antelope, elk, bison, and grassland birds. It has also increased erosion, lowered carbon storage, and lowered ground water recharge. Plowing, overgrazing, and over-irrigation cause erosion and salinization (Chapter 11). Grasslands around the world have experienced similar degradation. Because the rainfall in grasslands is usually less than that in forests, grasslands are particularly susceptible to the process of desertification. (These issues are described in Chapters 10 , 11, and 12. ) CONCEPT CHECK The primary degradation of forests is caused by overlogging. What is another cause of forest degradation? \u2610\u2713 7.4 Ocean Ecosystems Under Pressure Like forests and grasslands, ocean ecosystems are essential to human thriving and the health of the biosphere. Oceans cover 75% of Earth\u2019s surface and contain 1.3 billion cubic kilometers of water in a giant set of connected systems. Ocean and coastal ecosystems provide priceless goods and services that enable commerce and enhance human wellbeing. From ancient times, people living in coastal regions have relied on oceans and estuaries as a source of fish and other foods, as a means of transportation and shipping, and for a great variety of ecosystem services. Coasts are centers of recreation and tourism. In general, population densities are higher along the coast than inland; it is estimated that 23% of the world\u2019s population lives close to a coast (within 100 kilometers) and also close to sea level (at elevations less than 100 meters). Today, 22 of the largest 32 cities are located on estuaries. As vast as the oceans are, human activities have impacted them, often severely ( Figure 7\u201312) . Several recent reports have highlighted the plight of oceans and the current worldwide effort to protect ocean ecosystems. 8 Let\u2019s look at the extent and value of ocean goods and services, threats to ocean ecosystems, and possible solutions to those threats. 8FAO, State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture: Opportunities and challenges, 2014 (Rome: FAO-UN, 2015), http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3720e.pdf Jan.20; and IPSO, State of the Ocean Report, 2013, accessed January 20, 2015, http://www .stateoftheocean.org/research.cfm.

The global fish catch plus aquaculture equals the world total. Note that aquaculture has provided all of the increase since 1995. (Source: Data from FAO. The State of the World\u2019s Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2010.) Ocean Goods and Ecosystem Services Oceans provide a huge range of products that humans use, fish in particular. The world\u2019s fisheries provide employment for at least 200 million people and account for more than 15% of the total protein consumed by humans. The term fishery can refer to either a particular aquatic area or to a group of fish or shellfish being exploited. The total recorded harvest from marine fisheries and fish farming is reported annually by the FAO. The harvest has increased remarkably since 1950, when it was just 20 million metric tons (Figure 7\u201313) . Marine ecosystems provide us with numerous vital ecosystem services as well. The ocean is important in the regulation of energy movement and nutrient cycling. An estimated 70\u201380% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the photosynthetic efforts of tiny marine algae. These organisms are an important part of the carbon cycle. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also absorbed directly into the water. The proximity of huge water bodies moderates the temperature along coasts, and brings water to land in places where ocean breezes pass.", "The vast conveyor belts of the deep ocean pull cold waters toward the equator, while surface currents carry warm water northward, moderating the climate as they pass continents. The warmth of the jet stream, for example, makes the beaches of New Jersey such good swimming areas. Coastal habitats such as mangrove forests, sea grass beds, and salt marshes protect coasts from large storms and surges. Threats to Ocean Ecosystems The oceans are in trouble. Some of the major threats to them are the overharvest of fish, the loss of coastal habitats and coral reefs, and localized pollution such as trash, oil, and sediment. Global changes such as climate change, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation (from nutrient pollution) make it hard for ocean creatures to survive. Finally, lack of governance and regulation has allowed criminal activity. Let\u2019s briefly look at several of these ecosystem stressors. Overfishing. Recent reports suggest that approximately half of the world\u2019s fish stocks are being fished at their maximum sustainable level. About one third are being fished beyond that level, some to commercial extinction. The basic problem of the fisheries is that there are too many boats chasing too few fish. The high technology of modern fishing fleets gives fish little chance to escape. Equipped with sophisticated electronic equipment that can find fish at great depths and trawlers with 200-foot-wide openings that scoop up everything on and close to the bottom, the fishing industry has become too efficient (Figure 7\u201314) . Such trawling can destroy coral reefs and other critical ocean habitats. Figure 7\u201314 Trawling destroys bottom habitats. Bottom trawling is often used to harvest ground fish. Because it degrades the ocean bottom, this method of harvest has been compared to clear-cutting forests. (a) A ship drags a trawling net across the ocean floor. The steel trawl doors weigh up to 5 tons, and the distance between the doors is as much as 200 feet. (b) A Malaysian coral reef that has not been exposed to trawling. (c) After trawling, a once vibrant coral reef has become a pile of rubble that supports little biodiversity. For years, parts of the oceans that were more than 12 nautical miles from a nation\u2019s coast were considered an international commons. By the end of the 1960s, however, international fishing fleets equipped with modern fish-finding technology were overfishing and seriously depleting fisheries in numerous regions of the sea. In the mid-1970s, as a result of agreements forged at a series of UN Conferences on the Law of the Sea, nations extended their limits of jurisdiction to 200 miles offshore. Since many prime fishing grounds are located between 12 and 200 miles from shore, this action effectively removed most fisheries from the international commons and placed them under the authority of particular nations. To manage fisheries within the 200-mile limit, the U.S. Congress passed the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Management and Conservation Act of 1976. This legislation established eight regional management councils made up of government officials and industry representatives. The councils are responsible for creating management plans for their regions, while the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) provides advice and scientifically based information on assessing stocks; NMFS can reject elements of the plans submitted to it by the councils. The Magnuson-Stevens Act was amended in 1996 and again in 2006 to promote more sustainable fishing, including calling for better protection of habitat and promoting catch and release fishing. Despite these measures, the situation of overfishing in U.S. waters remains dire. Globally, the world fish catch may appear stable, but many species and areas are overfished. The FAO has concluded that 52% of fish stocks are at their maximum sustainable yield, 16% are overexploited and will likely decline further, and 8% are depleted and are much less productive than they once were. Much of the catch (one-third) is of such low commercial value that it is used only for fishmeal and oil production. In addition to direct fishing pressure, many ocean species are in decline because people fishing for another species accidentally catch them. This bycatch can sometimes be larger than the intended catch, and wastes the lives of billions of organisms annually. The FAO has also concluded that the capture fisheries are at their upper limit, as indicated by the long-term catch data. Restoration of fisheries is critical both to target species and to the ocean food web. Fisheries scientists reason that if overexploited and depleted fisheries were restored, the catch could increase by at least 10 million metric tons.", "That could happen, however, only if fishing for many species were temporarily eliminated or greatly reduced and the fisheries were managed on a more sustainable basis.

For hundreds of years, cod, haddock, and flounder (called ground fish because they feed on or near the bottom and are caught by bottom trawling) were the mainstay of the fishing industry in the northeast Atlantic, particularly on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland and Georges Bank off New England. Recent events in both fisheries illustrate the tragedy of the commons and the impacts of modern fishing woes. The Grand Banks were once the richest fishing grounds in the world. Unfortunately, however, the cod there were overexploited until the number of cod dropped so low that the fishery had to be closed. The biggest reason was an increase in fishing pressure, particularly after World War II, as technology allowed larger vessels to capture more fish and allowed fish to be found more easily. Industrial-sized factory ships from Russia, Japan, and other countries captured cod right outside of Canadian waters. At the same time, more and more fish were caught by Canadian fishing vessels. In addition, cod fishing contributed to the accidental catch of other fish, including capelin, an important cod food source. Changes in the food chain contributed to the precipitous decline of a once abundant resource. By 1991, the cod population had dropped to one one-hundredth of its former size. In 1992, the fishery was closed, costing the jobs of 35,000 fishers. So far, the cod population has not rebounded. Events on Georges Bank, New England\u2019s richest fishing ground, parallel those of their neighbor to the north (Figure 7\u201315) . In the early 1960s, ground fish accounted for two-thirds of the fish population on the bank. Since that time, ground fish in this fishery have plummeted to historically low levels. How did this occur? After the passage of the Magnuson-Stevens Act in 1976, fishing on Georges Bank increased in intensity, in part because the law encouraged the increased use of the fish resource. Increased fishing pressure resulted in a decline in the desirable species. The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) set Total Allowable Catch (TAC) quotas, but fishers claimed that the TAC quotas were set too low and successfully argued for an indirect approach that employed mesh with openings of a size that allowed smaller fish to escape. In less than 10 years, the number of boats fishing Georges Bank doubled; the results were disastrous, as indicated by the cod landing data. In response to this rapid decline, NEFMC discarded the mesh-size approach and initiated a number of regulations designed to take some pressure off the Georges Bank cod. These regulations restricted the number of days that vessels could spend at sea, closed areas of the bank to fishing, and set TAC quotas at levels designed to reduce the harvest. In addition, the NEFMC bought back fishing permits and paid fishers to scrap their boats. In spite of these measures, cod landing consistently exceeded the TAC quotas by 150\u2013200%. In 2004\u20132005, when the stock had plummeted to its lowest level ever, restrictions finally led to a much-reduced harvest. Despite these restrictions, the cod failed to rebound. In 2013 the cod harvest was reduced even further because fish stocks were not recovering. The outlook for North Atlantic cod as an economic resource is not good. Ecosystem Changes. One of the effects of overfishing is the removal of large fish from ocean food webs. Because large and slow-growing fish take longer to replace, ocean fish are changing to smaller individuals and those that reproduce more rapidly. As fishers capture too many of one species, they move on to the next. First, they overfish the top predators\u2014such as tuna, marlin, and swordfish\u2014then they take fish that are smaller and lower on the food chain. This process of moving from species to species as each type is depleted is known as \u201cfishing down the food chain.\u201d It means that commercial fishing has made long-lasting changes to basic ecological processes in marine ecosystems. 7.4 Ocean Ecosystems Under Pressure 171 Cod landings from Georges Bank (metric tons) 0 1982 '83 '84 '85 '86 '87 '88 '89 '90 '91 '92 '93 '94 '95 '96 '97 '98 '99 '00 '01 '02 '03 '04 '05 '06 '07 '08 '09 '10 '11 '12 '13 Year Figure 7\u201315 Fishery in distress. Data showing cod landings from Georges Bank, 1982\u20132013. (Source: NOAA, 2014.) Loss of Coastal Habitats.", "Coastal zones protect the land from the impacts of storm surges and tides. They also support some of the most productive ecosystems on the planet and produce a great deal of food harvested by humans. Over the years, human development of the coastal zone has resulted in the degradation and loss of large portions of these valuable ecosystems. Salt marshes and mangrove swamps are particularly vulnerable. About half of the world\u2019s salt marshes have been lost, although they are highly productive fish habitat, important for waterfowl, and protect coasts from erosion. Since 1983, half of the world\u2019s 18 million hectares (45 million acres) of mangroves have been cut down. Mangrove trees grow in warm coastal regions around the world. Mangroves have the unique ability to take root and grow in shallow marine sediments. There they protect the coasts from erosion and storm damage and provide a refuge and nursery for many marine fish, habitat for wildlife, fuel wood for people, and food for small livestock. Despite these benefits, mangroves are under assault from coastal development, logging, and shrimp aquaculture. In Southeast Asia, large swaths of mangroves have been replaced with shrimp farms ( Figure 7\u201316) . The benefit is local, short term, and specific to the shrimp farmer, who is likely to be from outside the community, while the loss of services is more regional, long term, and diffuse to all those living near the coast. Recently the conversion of mangrove forests to shrimp farms has largely stopped because construction costs are high and the farms do not do well in the long term; most shrimp farms operate for only three to five years before they are abandoned because of diseases in the water. But mangrove loss from conversion to rice agriculture, fuel, wood pulp, and other uses has continued. The vast mangrove forests of the Sundarbans (Chapter 6) are declining rapidly. Many areas of Southeast Asia hit by the 2004 tsunami had been deprived of their protective mangrove forests; areas without mangroves were more heavily damaged than those with intact mangroves. In one study on mangroves in Tanzania, scientists found that the Saadani National Park, which offered the protection of a mangrove environment along the coast, improved the local economy. Although people using mangroves for wood suffered a short-term loss, in the long term the presence of the mangroves increased the quantity of fish and native shrimp available to the community. 9 Local and international pressure to stop the destruction of mangroves is growing. Developing nations that once 9C. G. McNally, E. Uchida, and A. J. Gold, \u201cBiodiversity Conservation and Poverty Traps Special Feature: The Effect of a Protected Area on the Tradeoffs Between Short-Run and Long-Run Benefits from Mangrove Ecosystems,\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2011 108 (34): 13945. Figure 7\u201316 Shrimp farms in Thailand. Carved out of mangrove swamps, these shrimp farms provide only a fraction of the value of the services that were performed by the intact mangroves. considered mangroves to be useless swampland are now beginning to recognize the value of the natural services they perform. Like terrestrial forests, mangroves absorb carbon dioxide. Because mangroves are so carbon rich, restoring them would be a good way to combat climate change. Threats to Coral Reefs. In a band from 30\u00b0 north to 30\u00b0 south of the equator, coral reefs occupy shallow coastal areas and form atolls, or islands, in the ocean. Coral reefs (such as the Caribbean reefs discussed at the chapter\u2019s start) are among the most diverse and biologically productive ecosystems in the world. The reef-building coral animals live in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae; because these algae need adequate sunlight, corals are found only in water shallower than 75 meters (245 feet). Coral reefs provide many benefits to local people. As ocean waves travel toward land, they first strike the coral reefs, which lessens the power of the waves and protects the land shoreward of the reefs. The great variety of fish and shellfish that live on reefs are important sources of food and trade for local people. Coral reefs also attract tourists who enjoy the warm shallow waters and the wildlife on the reefs, generating an estimated $30 billion per year in tourism and fishing revenues. In recent years, coral reefs in areas close to human population centers have shown signs of deterioration. It is estimated that 20% of coral reefs have been destroyed by human activities. The threats are both global and local.", "Islanders and coastal people in the tropics often scour the reefs for fish, shellfish, and other edible sea life, sometimes using dynamite or cyanide to flush out fish, both very dangerous practices. Bottom trawling is also very destructive. Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are causing ocean water to become acidified. Ocean acidification occurs as seawater near the surface of the ocean takes up the increasing amount of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere by humans; as seawater becomes more acidic, the concentration of carbonate ions in the water is reduced. This, in turn, makes it more difficult for coral animals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons. Scientists point out that persistent high summer temperatures and the gradual acidification of the oceans could permanently wipe out coral reefs over vast areas of the shallow tropical oceans\u2014an enormous loss of biodiversity and economic value. The widespread loss of corals due to bleaching ( Figure 7\u201317) appears to come from a loss of the algal symbionts in corals as a result of a number of stressors, including heat. Ocean Pollution. The ocean is the great repository of human effluent, plastic bags, oil, and sediment from farms, all of which make their way to the sea. Nutrient runoff from land is causing the loss of oxygen in vast areas of ocean. These dead zones cannot support most life (see Chapter 20). Plastics in the ocean are wreaking havoc on ocean food webs (discussed in both Chapters 20 and 21). The biggest changes in the ocean, though, relate to global changes in the water itself. Climate change is warming water, changing currents, melting ice, and causing sea levels to rise. It is also causing animals to change their ranges. Figure 7\u201317 Bleached coral. This coral in the Red Sea shows the effects of excessively warm temperature. Lawlessness on the High Seas. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea set the high seas (outside of the jurisdiction of individual countries) as a common resource for all nations. Since it was too difficult to fish there, the high seas acted as a large marine reserve. However, the lack of governance on the high seas has led to problems of lawlessness. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing fleets abound. These fleets are often involved in criminal activities, such as black markets in regulated fisheries, trafficking of people, modern slavery, terrorism, and the smuggling of drugs and weapons. One study showed that 20\u201332% of wild-caught seafood imported into the United States comes from illegal, unregulated, or unreported fishing. 10 Part of the problem is that laws have not kept up with technology. Today extensive fishing and even deep-sea mining occur in international waters. We need new agreements to protect the biodiversity of the high seas and manage the human activities there. Aquaculture: A Mixed Bag A worldwide increase in aquaculture, the farming of aquatic organisms, is helping fill in the gaps left by limited wild fisheries. Modern aquaculture includes species ranging from seaweed to bivalve mollusks, such as clams and oysters, to freshwater and marine fish. The extent of aquaculture has increased dramatically in the past 20 years. The growth of aquaculture in developing countries is helping to alleviate poverty and improve the well-being of rural people. In the case of species such as oysters, aquaculture is helping to restore ecosystem functions that were lost when wild populations were overharvested. Despite its benefits, aquaculture also causes some threats to ocean ecosystems. For example, shrimp farming in many 10Pramod, Ganapathiraju, Katrina Nakamura, Tony J. Pitcher, and Leslie Delagran, \u201cEstimates of Illegal and Unreported Fish in Seafood Imports to the U.S.A.,\u201d Marine Policy 48, (2014), 102\u2013113. 7.4 Ocean Ecosystems Under Pressure 173 tropical areas destroys mangrove habitats and accelerates the decline of fish species that depend on the mangroves for a part of their life cycle. In addition, carnivorous species such as shrimp and salmon are usually fed fish products from species such as whiting and herring. It is inefficient to feed one edible fish to another in order to feed humans. Indeed, salmon and shrimp farms consume several times as much fish protein as they produce! Other concerns about aquaculture include the spread of diseases from farmed to wild populations and the pollution caused by releasing nutrients into the ocean. As more and more coastal areas are developed, near-shore waters are becoming less and less available for aquaculture.", "One solution to this problem could be open-ocean aquaculture, which is the farming of coastal species in ocean waters several kilometers from the shoreline. This is a new practice in North America, but even in Europe and other areas where it has been long practiced, total production levels are far lower than they could be. Solutions to Ocean Problems Ocean problems are significant, but international efforts to solve them have been launched. At the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit, delegates agreed to establish a network of protected marine areas by 2012 and to restore depleted global fisheries to achieve an MSY \u201con an urgent basis\u201d by 2015. Scientists study the impact of marine reserves, organizations certify sustainable seafood, and the Global Ocean Commission has made a series of recommendations about protecting the resources of the high seas. Case Study: Blue Whales. Today the great whales are among the most endangered species in the oceans, partly as a result of their slow growth, low reproductive rate, and need for an extended period of parental care. Whales were once harvested for their oil; more recently they have been hunted for their meat, which is considered a delicacy in Japan and a few other countries. Until the late 1980s, these giants of coastal waters and the open ocean were heavily depleted by overfishing. In 1974, the International Whaling Commission (IWC), an organization of nations with whaling interests, decided to regulate whaling according to the principle of maximum sustainable yield. Whenever a whale species dropped below a minimum population size, the IWC banned the hunting of that species in order to allow its population to recover. At that time, three species\u2014the right whale, bowhead whale, and blue whale\u2014were at very low levels and were immediately protected. Because of difficulties in obtaining reliable data and enforcing catch limits, the IWC took more-drastic action and placed a moratorium on the harvesting of all whales beginning in 1986. The moratorium has never been lifted; however, some limited whaling by Japan, Iceland, and Norway continues, as does harvesting by indigenous people in Alaska, Russia, and Greenland. Despite these restrictions, the populations of some whales, such as the North Atlantic right whale, remain dangerously low. Since the 1970s, blue whales in the eastern Pacific appear to have recovered to 97% of their historical population ( Figure 7\u201318). With only 2,200 individuals, that population is not large; because blue whales are so large (larger than any other animal) the carrying capacity of their environment is not high. Although these whales remain vulnerable, their recovery demonstrates how effective management can result in positive change. Figure 7\u201318 Blue whale recovery. Blue whales, such as the one shown here, were hunted until they were in danger of extinction. Since hunting was banned, their population in the eastern Pacific Ocean has been increasing. Marine Reserves. The most direct path to the restoration of a fishery or a damaged habitat is likely to be the creation of a marine reserve, or marine protected area (MPA). Marine reserves are areas along coasts or in the open ocean that have been closed to all commercial fishing and mineral mining. These reserves often allow less-harmful activities, such as small-scale fishing, tourism, and recreational boating, although some prohibit all such activities. The benefits of MPAs include basic protection of these vital ecosystems, increased tourism, and the spillover of fish and larvae to surrounding fisheries. The number of MPAs is growing, now numbering more than 5,000 around the world. More than 27% of the world\u2019s coral reefs are in MPAs, although not all of them are rigorously managed. In 2014, President Obama announced plans for the Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument, which will be the largest protected area on the planet. Seafood Certification. Like forest product certification, seafood certification can help consumers select seafood products that have been harvested sustainably. Such certification makes the chains of ownership transparent, allowing buyers to evaluate the sources of foods. Consumers can make better choices and pressure can be brought to bear on companies. The Marine Stewardship Council is one of the better-known certifiers of seafood. A Coherent Global Plan for Oceans. The Global Ocean Commission, based at Somerville College, Oxford, UK, is an independent commission formed as an initiative of The Pew Charitable Trusts and supported by Adessium Foundation, Oceans 5, and The Swire Group Charitable Trust.", "In June 2014, the commission released a report entitled From Decline to Recovery: A Rescue Package for the Global Ocean, which outlined eight proposals for the recovery of oceans. 11 These proposals include: Illegal fishing has the potential to cause the extinction of species. Setting limits for extremely large fishing vessels is essential to ending overfishing. Ocean ecosystems are changing dramatically. Because many of these changes are negative, it might be easy to feel overwhelmed. Yet at the same time, many people are working for change, including the famous marine scientist and explorer Sylvia Earle. Earle founded the organization Mission Blue in order to establish marine protected areas, called \u201chope spots,\u201d saying, \u201cI wish you would use all means at your disposal . . . to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas, hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet.\u201d CONCEPT CHECK What are two major ways oceans are degraded? \u2610\u2713 11Global Ocean Commission, Decline to Recovery: A Rescue Package for the Global Ocean, 2014. 7.5 Protection and Restoration The time has passed when the loss of ecosystems could be excused on the grounds that there are suitable substitute habitats just over the hill. With the rising human population, industrial expansion, and pressure to convert natural resources to economic gain, there will always be reasons to exploit natural ecosystems. The last resort for many species and ecosystems is protection by law in the form of national parks, wildlife refuges, and reserves. The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) for 2010 recognizes 161,000 \u201cprotected areas,\u201d sites whose management is aimed at achieving specific conservation objectives, in accordance with policies of the Convention on Biological Diversity. These sites, representing 13% of Earth\u2019s land area, cover a spectrum of protection from strict nature preserves to managed resource use. However, the establishment of a protected area is not always followed by effective management. Public and Private Lands in the United States The United States is unique among the countries of the world in having set aside a major proportion of its landmass for public ownership. Nearly 40% of the country\u2019s land is publicly owned; this land is managed by state or federal agencies for a variety of purposes, excluding development. The distribution of federal lands, shown in Figure 7\u201319 , is greatly skewed toward the western states, a consequence of historical settlement and land distribution policies. Although most of the lands in the East and Midwest are in private hands, forests and other natural ecosystems still function all across these regions. One of the first people to champion the preservation of natural areas in the United States was John Muir (1838\u20131914). A naturalist and writer, Muir spent a great deal of time in the mountains of California and founded the Sierra Club, now one of the country\u2019s largest conservation organizations. Muir wrote movingly about the aesthetic and spiritual values of nature, helping to persuade President Theodore Roosevelt and others to protect wild places. Muir\u2019s efforts led to the establishment of two national parks\u2014 Yosemite and Sequoia. Today Muir is often called \u201cthe father of the national parks.\u201d At the beginning of the 20th century, President Theodore Roosevelt saw the destruction of prairies, bison, and birds in the western expanses. He created the national parks, wildlife refuges, and other federal land protection categories, eventually protecting approximately 230 million acres of public land. Other parks and public lands were added throughout the 20th century. In March 2009, President Obama signed the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act into law. This sweeping legislation protected an additional 2.1 million acres of wilderness, increased the wild and scenic river system by 50%, and established new national parks and monuments. It also established a new federal land system, the National Landscape 7.5 Protection and Restoration 175 settled first, federally owned lands are concentrated in the West and Alaska. (Source: Council on Environmental Quality, Environmental Trends, 1989.) Conservation System, under the control of the Bureau of Land Management. This 27-million-acre system ties together 887 areas of high ecological and cultural value, some of the \u201ccrown jewels\u201d of national lands. Some of these sites had already been designated as national monuments, historic trails, conservation areas, or wilderness. Wilderness. Land given the greatest protection is designated as wilderness. Authorized by the Wilderness Act of 1964, this classification includes 110 million acres in more than 700 locations\u2014more than 4% of the land area of the United States.", "The act provides for the permanent protection of these undeveloped and unexploited areas so that natural ecological processes can operate freely. Permanent structures, roads, motor vehicles, and other mechanized transport are prohibited. Timber harvesting is excluded. Some livestock grazing and mineral development are allowed where such use existed previously; hiking and similar activities are also allowed. Areas in any of the federally owned lands can be designated as wilderness; the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Forest Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service all manage wilderness lands. National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. The national parks, administered by the National Park Service, and the national wildlife refuges, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, provide the next level of protection to 84 million and 150 million acres, respectively. Here the intent is to protect areas of great scenic or unique ecological significance, protect important wildlife species, and provide public access for recreation and other uses. The dual goals of protecting and providing public access often conflict with each other. Parks and refuges draw so many visitors (more than 310 million visits a year) that the protection of natural sites can be threatened. At a number of the most popular parks, auto traffic has been replaced by shuttle vehicles because of the problems of pollution and habitat destruction accompanying the use of motor vehicles within the parks. All of the federal agencies involved are trying to cope with the rising tide of recreational vehicles such as snowmobiles and off-road vehicles used on most federal lands. Increasingly, agencies, environmental groups, and private individuals are working together to manage natural sites as part of larger ecosystems. For example, the Greater Yellowstone Coalition has been formed to conserve the ecosystem that surrounds Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks form the core of the ecosystem, to which seven national forests, three wildlife refuges, and private lands are added to form the greater ecosystem of 18 million acres (Figure 7\u201320). The coalition acts to restrain forces threatening the ecosystem. Thus, it has challenged the Forest Service\u2019s logging activities, addressed residential sprawl and road building on private lands, and curtailed the shooting of bison that wander off the parklands. Figure 7\u201320 Yellowstone National Park. Famous for its boiling pools, geysers, and wildlife such as the bison shown here, Yellowstone National Park is part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. This cooperative approach is important for the continued maintenance of biodiversity because so much of the nation\u2019s natural lands remain outside of protected areas. Cooperation may also help restrict development up to the borders of the parks and refuges, keeping them from becoming fairly small natural islands in a sea of developed landscape. National Forests. Forests in the United States represent an enormously important natural resource, providing habitat for countless wild species as well as supplying natural services and products. These forests range over 740 million acres, of which about two-thirds are managed for commercial timber harvest. Almost three-fourths of the managed commercial forestland is in the East and privately owned; most of the remainder is in the West and is administered by a number of government agencies, primarily the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The Forest Service is responsible for managing Figure 7\u201321 National forest timber sales. Timber 12 sales over the years reflect changes in resource needs and political philosophy. 10 (Source: U.S. Forest Service. FY 1905\u20132013 National Summary 8 Cut and Sold Data and Graph. Accessed October 22, 2014, available from http://www.fs.fed.us/forestmanagement/ 6 documents/sold-harvest/reports/2013/2013_Q1-Q4_CandS_ SW.pdf.) 4 2 0 1905 Billions of board feet sold 193 million acres of national forests. The Bureau of Land Management oversees 258 million acres that are a great mixture of prairies, deserts, forests, mountains, wetlands, and tundra, as well as 16 national monuments. Most federal timber production comes from the national forest lands. Multiple Use. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Forest Service\u2019s management principle was multiple use, which allowed for a combination of extracting resources (grazing, logging, and mining), using the forest for recreation, and protecting watersheds and wildlife. This principle came from the first head of the Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot, who believed that the management of public lands should allow human use. The intent was to achieve a balance among these uses, but in practice multiple use emphasized extractive uses, allowing the ongoing exploitation of public lands by private interest groups such as ranchers, miners, and especially the timber industry.", "To harvest timber, government foresters select tracts of forest they judge ready for harvesting and then lease the tracts to private companies, which log and sell the timber. The timber harvest from national forests has been a controversial issue. Historic data on timber sales (Figure 7\u201321) reflect major shifts in logging. Note the rapid rise following World War II to satisfy the housing boom, and later periods of rise and fall related to the level of environmental concern of the time. A forest-management strategy called new forestry was adopted by the Forest Service in the 1990s. This practice is directed more toward protecting the ecological health and diversity of forests than toward producing a maximum harvest of logs. New forestry involves cutting trees less frequently (at 350-year intervals instead of every 60 to 80 years), leaving wider buffer zones along streams to reduce erosion and protect fish habitats, leaving dead logs and debris in the forests to replenish the soil, and protecting broad landscapes. According to a recent Forest Service analysis, growth of forests has exceeded harvests for several decades in both national and private forests. The Roadless Controversy. Logging roads contribute to the destruction of forests and streams. The Roadless Area Conservation Rule of 2001 was designed to increase the protection of the wildest places by placing a moratorium on new logging roads in some areas. Many people objected to the moratorium. They believed that it would halt timber harvests and prevent access by off-road vehicles in 1925 1935 1945 Year 1955 1965 1975 1985 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 roadless areas (they were right!). Some 58 million acres of forestland were affected by the moratorium. In the years 2005\u20132011, there were several reversals and reinstatements of the rule, until a 2011 decision made the roadless rule the law of the land, although there have already been court challenges. Currently, this rule protects 58 million acres of forests. Fires. The years 2006 and 2007 set new records for forest fires, with 9.9 million acres burning the former year and 9.3 million acres the latter. With a decade of drought in the western states (2014 was one of the worst on record for California) and serious drought in the South, it is no surprise that forest fires have become more extensive. A hot debate has focused on why so much forestland bears fuel loads\u2014dead trees and dense understories of trees and other vegetation\u2014 and what to do about it. Most observers believe that a combination of fire suppression and logging practices are responsible for the high fuel loads. Ecologists remind us that wildfires can also be seen as natural disturbances, rather than ecological disasters\u2014a confirmation of the dynamic nonequilibrium of ecosystems (Chapter 5). Protecting Nonfederal Lands. From 1961 to 2014, voters in New Jersey protected 1.2 million acres of open space through public funding. A Massachusetts report showed that for every dollar the state invested in land conservation, four dollars were returned to the economy in natural goods and services. 12 These examples show that Americans are willing to spend money to protect nonfederal lands and that they gain a good deal from such conservation. Often, landowners and townspeople want to protect natural areas from development but are wary of turning the land over to a government authority. One creative option is the private land trust, a nonprofit organization that will accept either outright gifts of land or easements\u2014 arrangements in which the landowner gives up development rights into the future but retains ownership of the parcel. The land trust may also purchase land to protect it from development. The land trust movement is growing considerably: There were 429 land trusts in the United States in 1980 and more than 1,723 in 2012, as reported by the Land Trust Alliance, an umbrella organization in Washington, DC, serving local and regional trusts. These trusts protect almost 47 million acres of land. The Nature Conservancy, a national and international land trust, conserves 15 million acres in the United States and also protects 102 million acres in other countries. International Ecosystem Protection Around the world, governments, private citizens, and nonprofit organizations are working to save ecosystems. There are also international treaties to protect ecosystems. The UNESCO World Heritage sites include coral reefs, forests, and other ecosystems that are considered to be of 12The Trust for Public Land, The Return on Investment in Parks and Open Space in Massachusetts, 2013, 50. 7.5 Protection and Restoration 177 world-class importance.", "These sites often receive greater protection by the countries in which they are found than they would otherwise. Areas that are designated Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance are often centers for ecotourism. Ecosystem Restoration In recent years, the need for the restoration of damaged ecosystems has become clear, and a new subdiscipline with that objective\u2014called restoration ecology\u2014has been developed. The intent of ecosystem restoration is to repair damage to specific lands and waters so that normal ecosystem integrity, resilience, and productivity return. The ecological problems that can be mended by restoration include those resulting from soil erosion, surface strip mining, draining of wetlands, hurricane damage, agricultural use, deforestation, overgrazing, desertification, and the eutrophication of lakes. Because of the complexity of natural ecosystems, the practical task of restoration is often difficult. A thorough knowledge of ecosystem and species ecology is essential to the success of restoration efforts. A great increase in restoration activity has occurred during the past 30 years, spurred on by federal and state programs. Most restoration projects are small and local, while the destruction of ecosystems occurs on a wider scale. However, there are some large-scale restoration. One of these is the largest wetland restoration in the world\u2014the restoration of the Florida Everglades. Freshwater Wetland: The Florida Everglades. The Florida Everglades, sometimes called a \u201criver of grass,\u201d is America\u2019s largest subtropical wilderness ( Figure 7\u201322) . This network of wetland landscapes once occupied the southern half of Florida. Although development and the draining of wetlands have reduced the Everglades to half its original size, it is still an amazing and unique ecosystem, harboring a great diversity of wildlife. It is home to 16 wildlife refuges and four national parks, the crown jewel being Everglades National Park. Figure 7\u201322 The Florida Everglades. This aerial view shows the meandering waterways that are necessary to functioning of the Everglades ecosystem. This ecosystem was degraded by the channelization of rivers and streams, the excessive withdrawal of water, and pollution. The ongoing restoration of the Everglades is the largest wetland restoration project in the world. Water flows south from Lake Okeechobee by way of a 40-mile-wide, 100-mile-long shallow wetland leading to Florida Bay. During the 1900s, Floridians controlled water flow with a system of 1,000 miles of canals, 720 miles of levees, and hundreds of water control structures (locks, dams, and spillways), bounded on the east by a string of cities and their suburbs. In its center, 550,000 acres of croplands were created, forming a lucrative sugarcane industry. Now, water shortages in the winter leave too little for the natural ecosystems; in the summer rainy season, too much water is diverted to the Everglades, causing it to fill with pollutants. Sea level rise erodes the southern marshes. In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), a plan to restore the South Florida Everglades ecosystem. CERP is the largest hydrologic restoration project ever undertaken in the United States and will require $10.5 billion and more than 35 years to complete. CERP is being managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency that was originally responsible for creating much of the system of water control that made the restoration necessary. To restore the Everglades, 240 miles of levees and canals will be removed and a system of reservoirs and underground wells will be created to capture water for release during the dry season. The new flowage is designed to restore the river of grass, thereby restoring the 2.4 million acres of Everglades\u2014not to its original state, but at least to a healthy system. Estuary: The Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay, surrounded by Maryland and Virginia, is a large estuary in a heavily populated area. Once producing a bounty of shrimp, 7.5 Protection and Restoration 179 Figure 7\u201323 Restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. The drainage basin of the Chesapeake Bay covers parts of six states. Pollution in runoff has killed fish and shellfish in the bay, but restoration efforts are begin-ning to yield results. These students from Ohio University are working on a restoration project at Poplar Island, Maryland. Figure 7\u201324 Restoration of the Rio Grande. Overconsumption of water from the Rio Grande causes stretches of the river to periodically run dry. Recently the coordinated efforts of nonprofits and government agencies in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas have been helping to restore water flows and riverbank vegetation.", "oyster reefs, fish, crab, and water birds, the bay has been badly degraded by coastal development and runoff pollution from upstream watershed areas. The vast oyster reefs that once filtered and cleaned the bay water are largely gone. Fish and crab have declined. In 2014 a hot summer and late rains that washed pollutants into the bay caused a dead zone (Chapter 20) of low oxygen a cubic mile in volume. Nonetheless, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation has worked on a massive restoration effort involving pollution prevention programs, replanting of sea grasses, restoring wetlands, planting forest buffers, recreating passage for fishes, restoring oyster reefs, and managing crab and fish industries (Figure 7\u201323) . River: The Rio Grande. The Rio Grande in the southern United States is widely recognized as an endangered river (Figure 7\u201324) . The nearly 2,000-mile long river has lost the large native sturgeon, eel, and red horse fish that used to inhabit it, along with at least four small native fish. Whooping cranes, which used to frequent the river, have not been present since 1998. In some dry spells, stretches of the river go dry. These problems result from dams and the excessive removal of river water as it wends through arid lands from the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of Mexico. Fortunately, a variety of restoration efforts are helping the Rio Grande to function as a healthier river system. One part of the restoration involves altering water management at dams to allow a more natural water flow beneath them. In the headwaters, locals are working to prevent stream bank erosion, remove ineffective water diversion dams, and restore wildlife habitat. Further down the river in New Mexico, the Army Corps of Engineers is conducting the Middle Rio Grande Ecosystem Restoration project to restore a more natural flow to a section of river. It is removing exotic vegetation, jetties, and other impediments, and reestablishing natural water forms such as oxbow lakes. Tropical Forest: Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Coastal Forest. The Atlantic Coastal Forest of South America stretches from Brazil to northern Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay (Figure 7\u201325) . This region has some of the highest animal and plant diversity in the world, with 2,200 species of birds as well as an abundance of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, and 20,000 species of plants\u20148% of all the plants on Earth. The region also has 200 endemic birds and 21 endemic primates. Because of logging, invasive species, and conversion for development and agriculture, only 7\u201310% of the forest remains, and what remains is highly fragmented. The nonprofit Instituto Terra has been working since 1999 to restore 630 hectares (1,556 acres) of forest, establishing local forest plantings, a native plant nursery, and educational facilities, since ecological restoration in Brazil is in its infancy. Figure 7\u201325 Restoration of Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Coastal Forest. Originally an area of extreme biodiversity, less than 7% of this ecosystem remains. Much of the forest was cut and replaced with sugar cane plantations. Restoration efforts such as this tree planting are help-ing to reestablish some of the native vegetation. Figure 7\u201326 Restoration in the White Carpathians. The White Carpathians region in Central Europe has diverse grasslands and woodlands. This Protected Landscape Area is in the White Carpathian Mountains, Zitkova, Czech Republic. Figure 7\u201327 Coral reef restoration. The restoration of this coral reef near Pulau Badi, Indonesia, is being funded by Mars, Incorporated. Grasslands: White Carpathians, Czech Republic. Grasslands receive less attention than many other ecosystems, but they provide essential habitats for many plants, birds, and roving herbivores. The White Carpathians Protected Landscape Area (Figure 7\u201326) is a biosphere reserve in the Czech Republic that is especially known for its plant diversity, featuring forests interspersed with flowery meadows. It has a high diversity of native plants, including the greatest number of orchid species in Central Europe. Before restoration, much of grasslands in this region had been degraded. In one restoration, an area around 500 hectares (1,235 acres) was reseeded with a high diversity of native seeds and then mown regularly. The protection and restoration of degraded sections of this ecosystem is important to the biodiversity of Central Europe. Coral Reefs: Mars Pulau Badi Project. The Coral Triangle encompasses a roughly triangular area of the oceans surrounding Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Timor Leste. This region includes 5.7 million square kilometers of ocean and helps sustain 120 million people.", "The region is known for its high biodiversity, with more than 500 species of corals and many creatures that depend on them, including 3,000 fish species. However, 95% of the coral reefs in the Coral Triangle have been damaged or destroyed, largely by destructive fishing, coastal development, and climate change. Since 2007, Mars, Incorporated, has sponsored the largest coral reef restoration in the world off the island of Pulau Badi in Indonesia. The ongoing project involves reseeding the reef with structures on which coral fragments grow, establishing a marine protected area, and creating jobs by starting seahorse and abalone farming. Figure 7\u201327 shows a diver placing corals on the reef. The multifaceted approach and attention to the needs of locals has made this restoration a success. Final Thoughts Ecosystems everywhere are being exploited for human needs and profit. It is certain that greater pressures will be put on natural ecosystems as the human population continues to rise. These pressures must be met with increasingly effective protective measures if we want to continue to enjoy the goods and services provided by ecosystems. The problems are most difficult in the developing world, where poverty forces people to take from nature in order to survive. If natural areas are to be preserved, the needs of people must be met in ways that do not involve destroying ecosystems. People must be provided with alternatives to overexploitation, a situation requiring both wise leadership and effective international aid. In April 2000, when he was UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan included in his millennium report to the General Assembly a stern warning that far too little concern was being given to the sustainability of our planet: \u201cIf I could sum it up in one sentence, I should say that we are plundering our children\u2019s heritage to pay for our present unsustainable practices. . . . We must preserve our forests, fisheries, and the diversity of living species, all of which are close to collapsing under the pressure of human consumption and destruction . . . in short, we need a new ethic of stewardship.\u201d The Billion Tree Campaign demonstrates such a stewardship ethic. Begun under UN sponsorship in 2006, the campaign to plant one billion trees overran its goal in 18 months, then becoming the Seven Billion Tree Campaign. In 2011, the campaign was turned over to the Plant for the Planet Foundation, and today more than 12 billion trees have been planted. From individuals to heads of states, people in 155 countries are planting trees, acting as stewards for the climate and for peoples\u2019 needs.

The Human Population Sweden. The cold winter wind cuts through the streets of stockholm, sweden, as anje, a 19-year-old university student, hurries home to the warmth of her apartment, where she will settle in for an evening at her computer and books, studying for a degree in banking. she will stop for a fast-food meal on the way.", "like many in the european union (eu), anje gets a free university education. she plans to travel extensively when her studies are over and then work for an international firm. anje works hard because jobs will be scarce and she wants to be established someday. although she is dating, anje has no plans to marry in the near future. she is likely to marry late, if she does, and have children later than many people in the world. When she is ready to have children, anje is likely to have good benefits, with medical care and maternity leave. Because she lives in a society in which the number of elderly people is increasing, anje is likely to care for her elderly parents, but good social and medical services will keep them active long into their 70s or even their 80s. Indonesia. a world away, in the heat of bustling Jakarta, indonesia, 19-yearold atin rides a motorcycle home with her brother. They will stop at a market for chicken and noodles and come home to the small house they share with their parents and three younger siblings. atin and her family have a few luxuries, such as a cell phone and a small television. a medical emergency could set them back, though, and atin is worried about her father\u2019s coughing. like millions of indonesian men, he smokes local clove and tobacco cigarettes. atin\u2019s family has struggled through financial insecurity. her father lost a stable job and took a series of temporary jobs, and their mother began to work part time. atin dropped out of high school to help her family. now atin and her brother are working to help support the family. atin hopes to marry a young man her family knows, if they can get enough money together. like many indonesians, she will most likely have a smaller family than her parents did. 8.1 Humans and Population Ecology 185 Burkina Faso. in the dry season, Burkina Faso (in West africa) is a place of dust and sun. awa, a 19-year-old married mother of two, walks with her children along a dusty road toward her home. she is carrying a large container of water on her head. awa\u2019s husband works on a farm in neighboring c\u00f4te d\u2019ivoire (ivory coast), where he makes a small amount of money and sends it home. neither awa nor her husband can read, and there is no nearby medical facility. she is worried because she is pregnant and has been feeling very ill. awa and her husband had another child who died shortly after birth, and awa is afraid that this coming baby will not survive either because she is sick and still nursing another child. her feet ache and she is very tired, but there is little to be done about it. she sometimes cares for her mother and for the children of her sister, who died of aids. her four surviving siblings have similar lives and live nearby. They all farm during the rainy season, growing cassava, yams, peanuts, and maize. a few members of her extended family work on a cotton farm or have other relatives working in the ivory coast. anje, atin, and awa are three of millions of young people living around the world. Their life circumstances give them different health concerns, access to education, and medical care. They are also likely to have different family sizes and to use natural resources differently. in the 20th century, the global human population experienced an unprecedented explosion, more than tripling its numbers. now, the rate of growth is slowing down, but the increase in absolute numbers continues to be substantial\u2014and in some parts of the world, there isn\u2019t much slowing. Remarkable changes in technology and substantial improvements in human well-being have accompanied this 8.1 Humans and Population Ecology Humans are part of the natural world, and human popu- The field of collecting, compiling, and presenting information about human populations like that presented in Figure 8\u20131 is called demography; the people engaged in this work are demographers. Demographers study population processes such as migration or changes in fertility and mortality. In environmental science, biological science quickly becomes intertwined with other fields, so social demographers often include economic, cultural, social, and biological factors in their analyses of populations. Consequently, we growth.", "in just the past 55 years (1960\u20132015), average income per capita has more than tripled, global economic output has risen more than tenfold (from $10 trillion to over $100 trillion), life expectancy has risen from 53 to 69 years, and infant mortality has been cut by nearly two-thirds (from 115 to 42 deaths per thousand live births). even so, anje, atin, and awa do not live in a world where people experience average conditions. The remarkable improvements in living conditions are not experienced equally. extreme poverty is still widespread. more than 1.2 billion people live on less than $1.25 per day, and the income gap between the richest and the poorest countries is enormous. humans are animals, and population ecologists can study human populations and ask many of the same questions they would if they were studying wolves or elk. But humans are also exceptional. They can make decisions about their own fertility, they have ethical systems that inform their decisions, and they can use technology to prolong life and increase food production. even more unusual, humans have cultural constructs, such as money. money and its economic institutions mean that survival is driven not only by evolutionary fitness, but also by the economic circumstances into which people are born. in this chapter, we will put the stories of people like anje, atin, and awa into the context of the dynamics of population growth and the related context of consumption and its social and environmental consequences. a continually growing population is unsustainable, as is a continually increasing consumption of natural resources, so the focus in this and the next chapter is population and consumption stability\u2014and what is required to get there. 14 13 12 11 2100 5 1987 lations are subject to processes such as birth and death. 10 2065 Figure 8\u20131 shows human population growth over the past 2,000 years. The long, slow incline is followed by a rapid rise, giving what looks like a J-shaped curve ( Chapter 4) . On closer inspection, however, the past few decades have shown decreasing rates of population growth.

Throughout most of history the human population grew slowly, but in modern times it has expanded greatly. (Sources: Basic plot from Joseph a. mcFalls, Jr., \u201cPopulation: a lively introduction,\u201d Population Bulletin 46, no. 2 (1991): 4; updated from un Population division, medium projection, 2012.) cannot discuss human population ecology without quickly discussing differences in wealth or health care. Demographers use a set of specialized terms, described in Table 8\u20131, which we will use throughout the chapter. r- or K-Strategists We have contrasted organisms such as cockroaches, which breed rapidly and have boom-and-bust populations, with organisms such as elephants, which maintain smaller but more stable population sizes (Chapter 4). Cockroaches are described as \u201cr-selected species,\u201d or \u201cr-strategists,\u201d because they have a high r, or reproductive potential. They are contrasted with \u201cK-selected species,\u201d or \u201cK-strategists,\u201d which remain close to K (carrying capacity) and are characterized by long life spans, older age at first reproduction, fewer offspring, and high parental care of offspring. These characteristics form a continuum, with some organisms not easily placed in either group. When we ask \u201cAre humans r-or K-strategists?\u201d it becomes clear that humans are like other organisms, but also significantly different. Just looking at the population growth curve of the past thousand years (Figure 8\u20131), we might be tempted to conclude that we are looking at a J-shaped curve representing the exponential growth typical of weedy species that move from place to place quickly but cannot out-compete other organisms over the long term (r-strategists). However, humans have characteristics such as high parental care and late reproduction that we would expect of the more stable K-strategists. How can humans have the rapid population growth curve of a weedy, explosive species but the life history of a slower-growing, equilibrial species (Chapter 4)? The answer lies in the fact that in some ways humans are critically different from other organisms. Even though we humans are a part of ecosystems, some human characteristics make our role in ecosystems different from that of other organisms.", "Remember that a population is an interbreeding group of a particular species in the same area. We do not typically talk about a widespread species as having a \u201cglobal population,\u201d because local populations rise and decline according to local conditions. Drought in one area might be offset by good conditions in another. In contrast, we do talk about the \u201chuman population\u201d and mean the whole global population. Prior to the modern era, human populations acted separately\u2014disease, plenty, and scarcity were local effects, and populations rose and fell with surrounding conditions. Several social and cultural changes have altered the way human populations interact; these changes have also altered the ecology of the human population. In the modern age, humans act both as local populations, with population characteristics such as family size and life expectancy, and as part of a global whole. We humans are unique in our ability to regulate our reproduction, use fire, store food for long times, and adapt our environment with technology so we can live in more places. Consequently, population ecology can be applied to humans, but not in exactly the same way it is applied to other organisms. Revolutions The changes that have allowed humans to become such a dominant part of the landscape are so extreme that they can be considered revolutionary. Here we will look at some of the revolutions that have brought humans from a number of isolated populations\u2014ruled primarily by local conditions\u2014to the global population of today. These include the development of agriculture, the Industrial Revolution, the development of modern medicine, the green agricultural revolution of the 1970s, and the current environmental revolution. In each case, we will see how new ways of doing things altered the effect of high populations. Neolithic Revolution. Natural ecosystems have existed on Earth for hundreds of millions of years, while humans are relative newcomers to the scene. Anatomically modern humans most likely arose in Africa around 200,000 years ago. The earliest fully modern humans in Europe appeared some 40,000 years ago, during the end of a period known as the Upper Paleolithic (around 50,000 to 10,000 years ago). Archaeological evidence suggests that Paleolithic humans lived in small tribes of hunter-gatherers, catching wildlife and collecting seeds, nuts, berries, roots, and other plant foods (Figure 8\u20132) . Settlements were small and groups moved Figure 8\u20132 Foraging for food. Before the advent of agriculture, all human societies had to forage for their food, as this resident of the sahel region in africa is doing; agriculture allowed people to settle in cities and to divide labor. 8.1 Humans and Population Ecology 187 on as resources were used up. Populations could not expand beyond the sizes that natural food sources supported, and deaths from predators, disease, and famine were common. About 12,000 years ago, humans in the Middle East began to develop animal husbandry and agriculture. The development of agriculture provided a more abundant and reliable food supply, but it was a turning point in human history for other reasons as well. Because of its profound effect, it is referred to as the Neolithic Revolution. Agriculture allowed long-term or permanent settlements and the specialization of labor. There was more incentive and potential for technological development, such as better tools and better means of transporting water and other materials. Trade with other settlements began, and commerce was born. In addition, living in settlements allowed a greater storage of food and the development of preservation techniques, so food stored from one year was available to help people in years with less food production, evening out the risk from year to year. The greater stability of food supplies supported population growth, which in turn supported expanding agriculture. In short, modern civilization and population growth had their origins in the invention of agriculture about 12,000 years ago. Industrial Revolution. For about another 11,000 years, the human population increased and spread out over the planet. Agriculture and natural ecosystems supported the growth of civilizations and cultures, which increased their knowledge and mastery over the natural world. With the birth of modern science and technology in the 17th and 18th centuries, the human population\u2014by 1800 almost a billion strong\u2014was on the threshold of another revolution: the Industrial Revolution (Figure 8\u20133) . The Industrial Revolution and its technological marvels were energized by fossil fuels\u2014first coal, then oil and gas. These fuels allowed people to use energy from the Sun that was trapped by plants a long time ago.", "This energy allowed humans to do work they could not have done if they had relied on human power\u2014or even on the power of domesticated animals. The harnessing of this extra energy allowed people to produce more food and numerous other products, but this increased production came with some unexpected costs. The burning of fossil fuels is similar to the process of cellular respiration: It breaks chemical bonds to release stored energy and releases water and carbon dioxide as waste. Fossil fuels contain other chemicals as well\u2014such as sulfur and nitrogen compounds, mercury, lead, and arsenic\u2014all of which can contribute to the pollution of land, air, and water. Figure 8\u20133 Industrial Revolution. during the industrial Revolution, coal and other fossil fuels were used to power machinery; economic growth and pollution were the consequences. This art of the 1890s shows a farmer using a steam-powered plow to prepare a field in the dakotas. Pollution and exploitation took on new dimensions as the industrial powers turned to the extraction of raw materials from all over the world. In time, every part of Earth was affected by this revolution. As a result, we now live in a time of population growth and economic expansion accompanied by environmental problems (Chapter 1) . Medical Revolution. One of the main reasons for the slow and fluctuating population growth prior to the early 1800s was the prevalence of infectious diseases that were often fatal, such as smallpox, diphtheria, measles, and scarlet fever. These diseases hit infants and children particularly hard, so it was not uncommon for a woman who had seven or eight live births to have only two or three children reach adulthood. In addition, epidemics of diseases such as typhus, cholera, and the black plague of the 14th century eliminated large numbers of adults. Prior to the 1800s, therefore, the human population was essentially in a dynamic balance with natural enemies\u2014 mainly diseases\u2014and other aspects of environmental resistance. High reproductive rates were largely balanced by high mortality, especially among infants and children, producing a low rate of population growth. In the late 1800s, scientists such as Louis Pasteur and others demonstrated that many diseases were caused by infectious agents (now identified as various bacteria, viruses, and parasites) and that these pathogens were often transmitted via water, food, insects, and rodents. Soon, vaccinations against different diseases were developed, and whole populations were immunized against such scourges as smallpox, diphtheria, and typhoid fever (Figure 8\u20134) . At the same time, cities and towns began treating their sewage and drinking water. Later, in the 1930s, the discovery of penicillin (the first in a long line of antibiotics) resulted in cures for often-fatal diseases such as pneumonia and blood poisoning. Improvements in nutrition began to be significant as well. In short, better sanitation, medicine, and nutrition brought about spectacular reductions in mortality\u2014especially among infants and children\u2014while birthrates remained high. From a biological point of view, the human population began growing almost exponentially, as does any natural population once it is freed from natural enemies and other environmental restraints. The Green Revolution. After the revolutions in industry and medicine, human populations increased dramatically. Concerns about whether we would be able to feed the rapidly burgeoning global population led to intense efforts to find new ways to increase agricultural efficiency. The development of chemical pesticides in World War II, along with an increase in irrigation and fertilizer use, dramatically increased crop yields. These trends were enhanced by the development of high-yield crops, which yielded more per acre than other crops. These advances in agriculture increased crop yields dramatically and allowed many countries to provide food for their rapidly growing populations (Figure 8\u20135) . Figure 8\u20134 Preventing the spread of infectious disease. This cartoon is from a British ministry of health public health campaign em-phasizes the importance of preventing the spread of germs. improved hygiene and other aspects of modern medicine prolonged lives and caused populations to increase. (Source: The national archives/ssPl/Getty images.) Unfortunately, the industrialized agriculture that allowed for such high yields came at significant costs, much as the Industrial Revolution had. Industrialized agriculture allowed people to use resources, particularly soil and underground water, more rapidly than they were replaced, leading to an increase in soil erosion, soil and water pollution, and the loss of native plant varieties. (These problems will be discussed in some detail when we talk about soil in Chapter 11, water in Chapter 10, and food production in Chapter 12. )", "In addition, the use of pesticides initially saved many human lives and protected crops. In the long term, however, the overuse of pesticides resulted in pesticide resistance, the ineffectiveness of a pesticide when the target organisms are no longer affected by it. A current worldwide interest in sustainable agriculture is an attempt to rectify some of these problems. However, as we will see in Section 8.3, population growth is pressuring us to increase, rather than decrease, high-yield agriculture. The Newest Revolution. In the past, humans experienced revolutions with new technological breakthroughs. Now, we have the Internet, computers, nanotechnology, robotics, and solar and other technologies. Many of these can be put to use in what some hope will be a real \u201cgreen\u201d revolution\u2014 an Environmental Revolution. More-efficient technologies, better urban and regional planning, policy and industrial changes, and the personal decisions of billions of people will be required to drive this revolution. 8.1 Humans and Population Ecology 189 Humans are part of natural ecosystems, but they are different enough from other organisms to make their population ecology global and to allow them to change their world extensively. They have characteristics of both r-and K-strategists. We see the J-shaped curve for human population growth because, at different times in history, we have increased the number of people the world can support by changing the way we do things. Our past growth might seem to suggest that natural laws do not apply to humans. In the next section, we will consider whether the concepts of carrying capacity and limits apply to human populations. Do Humans Have a Carrying Capacity? It is challenging to determine a carrying capacity for humans, a fact that makes it difficult to predict the impact of the growing human population on the environment and human wellbeing. If people were close to starving many years ago and yet today there are many more people, people live longer, and proportionately fewer are extremely poor, how can we talk about humans reaching a carrying capacity? In fact, some people claim that the whole idea of a carrying capacity does not apply to humans. Such people point out that every time in the past that it was thought humans had hit a carrying capacity, a problem has been solved to overcome it. The economist Julian Simon, for example, has argued that humans will overcome Earth\u2019s limits by colonizing space. 1 Most ecologists and demographers, however, would disagree. In their view, an escape into space is unlikely to solve the world\u2019s problems for the vast majority of humans, and humans are subject to limits and natural laws of population growth. How then do we reconcile natural laws with the pattern of human population growth in the past 2,000 years? Throughout history, humans have improved their survival rate, increased their populations, and increased their life span by doing some things other organisms cannot Figure 8\u20135 Green Revolution. Farmers in Punjab, india, harvest wheat. Fertilizer, irrigation, pesticides, and new varieties of crops are all part of industrialized agriculture, which feeds growing populations but also leads to the pollution of soil and water. do (or cannot do on the scale we can). These improvements have essentially increased the carrying capacity for our species. For example, we were once limited by what we could capture or hunt in one season, but the development of agriculture and trade removed that limit. We were limited by our energy requirements, but the use of fossil fuels gave us a new resource. We were limited by child mortality, but medical breakthroughs lowered child mortality and populations exploded. This pattern of population growth is exactly what you would expect to see under the law of limiting factors\u2014each time a limit is removed, the population increases until there is another limiting factor. Simon represents a group that believes that humans will always be able to overcome limiting factors. However, in the past, increases have come at the expense of using up nonrenewable resource, such as fossil fuels. Increases in population have also come at the expense of creating another set of limits\u2014this time, pollutants. The limiting factors that humans face in the 21st century include pollution from our own activities, a limit on agricultural land, a limit on ocean fish, and trade-offs between using land and water for human activities or maintaining ecosystems that provide us with vital services such as photosynthesis and flood control. In addition, Simon\u2019s argument assumes that the natural world has no value except as resources for humans.", "That is, the rest of nature has no intrinsic value (Chapter 6). Because humans seem able to increase their carrying capacity in the short term\u2014while potentially making trade-offs that will be paid for in the long term\u2014determining a carrying capacity for the global human population is difficult. Demographer Joel Cohen explained the reason in his book How Many People Can the Earth Support? 2 Cohen said that there isn\u2019t a clear-cut answer to the question of human carrying capacity because part of the answer depends on what living standard we are willing to accept. For example, if we never ate 1Julian Simon, The Ultimate Resource (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1983). 2Joel Cohen, How Many People Can the Earth Support? (New York: Norton, 1995). meat, did not rely on wild organisms, and were willing to never travel, heat our homes, or use paper, Earth could support more people. On the other hand, if everyone on Earth wanted a 21stcentury American way of life, we would need multiple Earths to support the global population we already have. Because so much of the answer depends on standard of living expectations, Cohen argued, it is very difficult to determine an actual carrying capacity. We can\u2019t figure out a carrying capacity for humans in the same way we do for fish, ducks, or flies, because we have (and want) more choices. While it is difficult to reach agreement on a concrete number for the human carrying capacity, the world\u2019s scientific societies believe that there is some limit to human population growth. In 1993, representatives of the National Academies of Sciences from 58 countries met in New Delhi, India, to agree on and sign a statement about world population. They said, among other things, that \u201cthe earth is finite and that natural systems are being pushed ever closer to their limits.\u201d 3 Scientists also believe that it is important to try to estimate what the limits of carrying capacity might be from an ecosystem perspective. In 2004, two professors in the Department of Spatial Economics at the Free University in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, reported on their meta-analysis (an analysis of multiple other analyses) of 69 papers on world population and carrying capacity, looking to see if there were any central trends. They identified a number of factors that could limit human populations, including \u201cwater availability, energy, carbon, forest products, nonrenewable resources, heat removal, photosynthetic capacity, and the availability of land for food production.\u201d 4 They concluded that the best estimates for global human carrying capacity centered on 7.7 billion people. Such analyses are difficult to do. While regional carrying capacities have been calculated, a similar global calculation has not been made recently. However, other types of analyses have reached similar conclusions. Planetary Boundaries. In 2009, a team of 28 leading academics headed by Johan Rockstr, executive director of the Stockholm Environment Institute, proposed a way of thinking about what parameters would need to be in place for humans to survive what they called \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d for a \u201csafe operating space for humanity.\u201d The scientists claimed that there are a series of limits that act as tipping points; passing these limits would keep hu mans from surviving (Chapter 5 ). Within them is a \u201csafe space.\u201d 5 Both population growth and overconsumption could push us past our boundaries. Estimates suggest that of nine boundaries they outlined, three (climate change, 3Population Summit of the World\u2019s Scientific Academies, 1993.

To survive, we will have to find ways to meet human needs without pushing those boundaries, including the remaining six\u2014ocean acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, global freshwater use, land-system change, aerosol loading, and chemical pollution. (For more discussion, see Stewardship, Lessening Your Ecological Footprint.) Picking up the Population Pace. From the dawn of history until the beginning of the 1800s, the human population increased slowly and variably, with periodic setbacks. It was roughly 1830 before world population reached the 1 billion mark. By 1930, however, the population had doubled to 2 billion.", "It reached 3 billion in 1960, and by 1975 it had climbed to 4 billion. Thus, the population doubled in just 45 years, from 1930 to 1975. Then in 1987, just 12 years later, it crossed the 5 billion mark. In 1999, the world population passed 6 billion, and it hit 7 billion in late 2011. On the basis of current trends (which assume a continued decline in fertility rates), the UN Population Division (UNPD) medium projection predicts that the world population will pass 8 billion in 2025, 9 billion in 2040, 9.55 billion around 2050, and 10 billion around 2065 (Figure 8\u20131). Future growth and projec tions will be described in Section 8.4. One important result of the 2004 meta-analysis was that the best predictions of how large our human populations will get by 2050 are greater than the best estimates of our carrying capacity. Stabilizing population growth is part of establishing a sustainable society.

Although globalization is part of the modern world, people in wealthy, middle-income, and poor countries live in radically different economic and demographic conditions. In fact, even within a single country there can be tremendous disparities in wealth and in quality of life. Rich Nations, Middle-Income Nations, Poor Nations The World Bank, an arm of the United Nations, divides the countries of the world into three main economic categories, according to average per capita gross national income (Figure 8\u20136) : 1. High-income, highly developed, industrialized countries.

The population of various regions (in millions) is also shown by magenta lines and numbers.(Sources: World Bank country and lending Groups, accessed February 4, 2015, ht tp://data.world bank.or g/about/country-and-lend ing-gr oups#; World Population Data Sheet (Washington, dc: Population Reference Bureau, 2014).) countries of western Europe, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Israel, and several Arab states (2014 gross national income per capita $12,746 and above; average of $43,864). Sometimes the high-income nations are further divided into those belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an economic collaboration between primarily European countries, and non-OECD countries. Sweden, where Anje lives, is a high-income country in the OECD. The high-income nations are commonly referred to as developed countries, whereas the middle-and low-income countries (a much larger number) are often grouped together and referred to as developing countries.", "Of course, all countries are in the process of developing in some sense, but here the term refers to economic changes. The terms more developed countries, less developed countries, and third-world countries are being phased out, although you may still hear them used. Moving Up: Good News Some of the news about population is good. Worldwide, the low-income percent of the world\u2019s population has declined dramatically since 1998, falling from about 60% to less than 12%. This is a reduction of about 80% in only a few years. Until recently, living in a low-income country was the norm for humans, but now it is not. This change is part of the reason people talk about the \u201cenvironmentalist\u2019s paradox\u201d: Some measures of human development are increasing at the same time that serious problems are arising in the environment (Chapter 1). One of the improved measures is the movement of many countries from the lowest income status even as their populations are rapidly rising. The World Bank explains, \u201cDeveloping countries have increased their share of the SHARE OF WORLD GROSS NATIONAL INCOME, 2000\u20132013 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 0 20406080 Percentage High-income countries Low- & middle-income countries Figure 8\u20137 Between-country inequality. low- and middle-income countries are gaining some in the share of world gross national income, but their populations are increasing more rapidly than those of high-income countries. inequality between countries remains stark. (Source: World Bank, 2014, http://data.worldbank.org/news/2010-Gni-income- classifications. ) global economy by growing faster than rich countries, on average 6.8% per year compared to only 1.8% for high income economies over the 2000 to 2010 period.\u201d 6 The movement of millions of people from the extremely low-income to the middle-income category is very good news, and an increasing percentage of the world\u2019s wealth is held by those in low- and middle-income countries ( Figure 8\u20137) . Even so, the disparity in the distribution of wealth among the countries of the world is still mind-boggling. The disparity of wealth is difficult to understand just by looking at general income figures. The UN Development Program (UNDP) uses the Human Development Index as a measure of general well-being, based on life expectancy, education, and per capita income. The UNDP also uses the Human Poverty Index, based on additional information about literacy and living standards, to make a more direct measurement of poverty in both low- and high-income 6\u201cChanges in Country Classifications,\u201d 2011, http://data.worldbank.org/news/ 2010-GNI-income-classifications. 8.2 Population and Consumption\u2014Different Worlds 193 HUMAN POVERTY Land area Technical notes uses one Human Poverty Index for poorer territories and another for richer territories.

About 12% of the people in developed countries are unable to afford adequate food, shelter, or clothing, although these rates vary a good deal, between 6% and 21% in one study. 7 In contrast, about 50% of those in developing countries are unable to afford these necessities. 8 Anje, in Sweden, lives in a country with one of the lowest human poverty indexes, while Awa, in Burkina Faso, lives in a country with one of the highest. These data, available yearly in the UNDP Human Development Report, have been used to focus attention on the most deprived people in a country, to help countries develop appropriate policies, and to mark progress toward sustainable development. 7OECD, \u201cCrisis Squeezes Income and Puts Pressure on Inequality and Poverty, 2013, http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD2013-Inequality-and-Poverty-8p.pdf. 8 Pew Research, \u201cChapter 2: Personal Economic Conditions,\u201d Pew Research Global Attitudes Project, May 13, 2013, accessed October 28, 2014, http://www .pewglobal.org/2013/05/23/chapter-2-personal-economic-conditions/. Population Growth in Rich and Poor Nations One of the reasons we spend so much time looking at wealth distributions in a study of environmental science is because population growth is related to poverty, environmental degradation, and other development measures. If you compare population growth in developed and developing countries, you find a discrepancy that parallels the great difference in wealth between these groups of countries.", "According to the UNPD, high-income countries such as Anje\u2019s Sweden, with a combined population of 1.05 billion in 2014, are growing at a rate of 0.1% annually. These countries will add less than 1 million to the world\u2019s population in a year. The middle-income countries, such as Atin\u2019s Indonesia, and the low-income countries, such as Awa\u2019s Burkina Faso, together had a 2014 total population of 5.89 billion. The populations of the middle-income countries are increasing at a rate of 1.4% annually, while Figure 8\u20139 Population growth in different world regions. Because of larger populations and higher birthrates, developing countries represent an ever-growing share of the world\u2019s population. This trend is expected to continue. (Source: un Population division, World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision (new York: united nations, 2010).) those of the low-income countries are increasing at a rate of 2.4% annually, adding 81 million people per year. Consequently, more than 98% of world population growth is occurring in the developing (middle- and low-income) countries ( Figure 8\u20139). In fact, population growth is highest in the least developed countries. As a result, the increase in wealth in low- and middle-income countries does not lead to an increase in per capita wealth. 9 What lies behind this discrepancy? Population growth occurs when births outnumber deaths. In the absence of high mortality, the major determining factor for population growth is births, conventionally measured using the total fertility rate\u2014the average number of children each woman in a population has over her lifetime ( Figure 8\u201310). Theoretically, a total fertility rate of 2.0 will give a stable population, because two children per woman, on average, will replace two parents when they eventually die. A total fertility rate greater than 2.0 will result in a growing population, because each generation is replaced by a larger one. Barring immigration, a total fertility rate less than 2.0 will lead to a declining population, because each generation will eventually be replaced by a smaller one. Given that infant and childhood mortality is not, in fact, zero and that some women do not reproduce, replacement-level fertility\u2014the fertility rate that will just replace the population of parents\u2014is 2.1 for developed countries and slightly higher for developing countries, which have higher infant and childhood mortality. Total fertility rates have dropped all over the world, but most dramatically in the high-income countries. Total fertility rates in developed countries have declined over the past two centuries to the point where they now average 1.7, with 9Data Finder, 2014 World Population Data Sheet, http://www.prb.org/DataFinder/ Topic/Rankings.aspx?ind=16&loc=243,245.

Fertility rates around the world vary widely. The highest fertility rates occur in sub-saharan africa. (Source: un Population division, World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision (new York: united nations, 2008).) some as low as 1.1 (Table 8\u20132, Figure 8\u201310 ). The total fertility rate of the United States fell during the recent economic recession, but is higher than most developed countries (1.9 in 2014), and the U.S. population continues to increase because of immigration. When countries industrialize and have modern medicine, they typically undergo these changes, described as the demographic transition. This will be described in Section 8.4 when we discuss how demographers project future population trends. In developing countries, fertility rates have come down considerably in recent years, to an average of 2.5, although some developing countries have rates as high as 7 or more (Table 8\u20132). Thus, the populations of developing countries will continue growing, while the populations of developed countries will stabilize or decline, although immigration can change that. As a consequence, the percentage of the world\u2019s population living in developing countries\u2014already 85%\u2014is expected to climb to more than 90% by 2075 ( Figure 8\u20139). Nevertheless, it is not just the developing countries that have problems. Different Populations, Different Problems As we saw in the discussion of carrying capacity, both the number of people and their standards of living play a role in 8.2 Population and Consumption\u2014Different Worlds 195 whether we achieve sustainability or experience environmental degradation. Some time ago, ecologist Paul Ehrlich and physicist John Holdren proposed a formula to account for the human factors that contribute to environmental deterioration and the depletion of resources. They reasoned that human pressure on the environment was the outcome of three factors: population, affluence, and technology. They offered the following formula: I = P :", "A : T According to this equation, called the IPAT formula, environmental impact (I) is equal to the population (P), multiplied by affluence and consumption patterns (A), multiplied by the level of technology of the society (T). The IPAT formula fits well with the concept of carrying capacity. Given the high level of technology in the industrialized countries and the affluent lifestyle that accompanies it, a fairly small population can have a very large impact on the environment. Recently there have been attempts to improve the IPAT formula. The technology part of the equation has always been difficult to quantify. Some technologies improve environmental conditions and others harm it. For example, gasoline-powered automobiles pollute the atmosphere, while catalytic converters reduce the amount of air pollution. Many technologies do both. For example, manufacturing solar panels produces pollution, but the renewable energy they capture replaces the use of fossil fuels. Some economists have rewritten the IPAT formula to separate the effects of technology (T) into two components: consumption per unit of GDP (How much do you use as your economy increases?) and impact per unit of consumption (How inefficient or how negative is what you are doing?). They call this formula 10 ImPACT. Effect of Wealth. Sometimes people think that wealth will solve environmental problems\u2014that is, the rich can afford the luxury of caring for the environment. Wealthy countries, the thinking goes, can more easily afford the technologies to lower air pollution, clean water, and take care of sewage, for example (Chapter 2). Give the poor quick ways to improve their economies, and eventually they will also take care of the environment. It is true that the passage of many environmental laws has improved the environment in the United States and western Europe. It is also true that wealth is required to build technologies to deal with the needs of large groups of people with minimal environmental degradation. But the relationship between economic wealth and environmental health is not clear-cut for two reasons. First, although wealth can help solve problems such as infectious diseases in water, other problems, such as municipal waste, increase with wealth. Second, wealth allows people to care for the environment in their area, but doing so often pushes environmental problems to other, poorer places. The extraction of resources and the manufacture of goods in other countries for use in high-income countries have impacts in many other parts of the world. Ecological Footprint. Some people argue that because the places with the highest-density populations\u2014such as the Netherlands, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan\u2014have healthy, long-lived, wealthy human populations, overpopulation is not real. If they can be so crowded, why can\u2019t the whole world be like that? But densely populated, wealthy areas such as Singapore use resources and affect ecosystems over a much wider area. People living in densely populated areas have impacts in the far reaches of the land and seas. These effects can be illustrated with an ecological or environmental footprint. An environmental footprint is an estimate of the amount of land and ocean an individual or population requires to provide the resources it uses and to absorb the wastes it produces. The environmental footprint of Hong Kong, for example, is many times greater than the size of the metropolitan region (see Stewardship, Lessening Your Ecological Footprint.) Inequalities Within Countries. The developing countries, especially the low-income countries, do have a population problem, and it is making their progress toward sustainable development that much more difficult. Their needs are great: economic growth, more employment, wise leaders, effective public policies, fair treatment by other nations, and, especially, technological and financial help from the wealthy nations. Meeting these needs is a matter of justice, one of the key components of stewardship. Even this description is too simplistic because within each nation there is a tremendous difference in wealth and poverty levels and individual experiences. India, for example, has hundreds of millions of extremely wealthy people, while hundreds of millions more live in extreme poverty. Some middle-income countries have a rising middle class with consumption patterns similar to those in the United States, Japan, and Europe. This group is called \u201cthe consumer class.\u201d China and India have more than 20% of the world\u2019s total population with this increased standard of living, even though there are many extremely poor people in each of these two countries. In China alone, there are more than 300 million people in the rising middle- and upper-class groups.", "Africa, where several of the poorest countries are located, has a rising middle class of 123 million, which is expected to grow rapidly. The World Bank measures inequality in each country with the Gini index, a way of quantifying differences in wealth within countries. (Countries often calculate the Gini values during a census, so the values are not all from the same year, but they do not change rapidly, so comparison is still valuable.) Sweden has one of the lowest values (26 in 2008) and South Africa one of the highest (65 in 2011). Burkina Faso (39 in 2009) and Indonesia (36 in 2010) each have a Gini index in the middle; these countries have few ultra-rich citizens. The United States (Gini index 42), an extremely wealthy country, also has large disparities between groups in terms of health care and access to services. Because of these disparities, it ranks lowest among the developed countries in life expectancy, in spite of spending more per person on health care than any other country. The United States has more children in poverty and more people in prison than any other high-income country. Income inequality can cause social unrest. Between 1968 and 2010, the percent of wealth owned by the top 1% increased from 28% to 37%. 11 This change contributed to the countrywide protests from 2011 onward called the \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d movement. We have seen that simple statements about the life experiences of high-, middle-, and low-income countries may not apply to every person. The disparities between rich and poor within a country also matter. Differences between countries are not the only differences that justice requires us to address. 10Richard York, Eugene A. Rosa, and Thomas Dietz, \u201cSTIRPAT, IPAT, and 11Philip Vermeulen, \u201cWorking Paper Series: How Fat Is the Top Tail of the Wealth ImPACT: Analytic Tools for Unpacking the Driving Forces of Environmental Distribution?\u201d (July 2014): 25, accessed August 10, 2014, https://www.ecb Impacts,\u201d Ecological Economics 46 (2003): 351\u2013365. .europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1692.pdf. Enter Stewardship. Despite having fairly stable populations, the developed countries have their own problems with consumption, affluence, damaging technologies, and burgeoning wastes. These issues must be addressed to achieve sustainability, and this, too, requires wise leaders and effective public policies. It also requires willpower, both individually and as a society, and an ethical basis for caring for others and for the rest of the natural world. Fortunately, the environmental impacts of affluent lifestyles may be moderated somewhat by practicing environmental stewardship. For example, suitable attention to wildlife conservation, pollution control, energy conservation and efficiency, and recycling can lower the negative impact of a consumer lifestyle. Such changes alter the technology part of the ImPACT equation, lessening the effect of our use of resources. Some people argue that population growth is the main problem, others claim that our consumption-oriented lifestyle is chiefly to blame, and still others maintain that our inattention to stewardship is the prime shortcoming. In order to make the transition to a sustainable future, however, all three areas (and more) must be addressed. That is, the population must stabilize (a demographic transition), consumption must decrease (a resource and technology transition), and stewardship action must increase (a political and sociological transition). CONCEPT CHECK What is the difference between the IPAT and ImPACT summaries of environmental effect? If you install a solar panel to offset some of your use of energy, how would these indexes change? (Assume you live in an affluent society.) \u2610\u2713 STEWARDSHIP 8.3 Consequences of Population Growth and Affluence 197 8.3 Consequences of Population Growth and Affluence Expanding populations and increasing affluence\u2014it sounds like trouble for the environment, and it is. It also means trouble for people in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. In countries experiencing rapid population growth, people overuse land, and many flee to cities in the hopes that there will be new opportunities there. These hopes are not necessarily fulfilled. In high-income countries, increases in industrialization have resulted in huge amounts of wealth, but have also caused problems, including the transfer of environmental degradation to places where those most responsible for generating it do not have to experience its price. Consequences of Rapid Growth Prior to the Industrial Revolution, many humans survived through subsistence agriculture. Families lived on the land, raised livestock, and produced enough crops for their own consumption and perhaps some extra to barter for other essentials. Forests provided firewood and structural materials for housing. With small, isolated, and relatively stable populations, this system was generally sustainable.", "As the older generation passed away, the land and natural systems could still support the next generation. Indeed, many cultures sustained themselves in this way over thousands of years. After World War II, modern medicines\u2014chiefly vaccines and antibiotics\u2014were introduced into developing nations, whereupon death rates plummeted and populations grew rapidly. Today 75% of the world\u2019s poor in developing countries live in rural areas. Most are engaged in small-scale agriculture, but only 3.8% of official development assistance goes to agriculture. Rapid growth has negative consequences on a population that is largely engaged in farming a few acres or less of land ( Figure 8\u201311). When farms become too small to support the next generation, only a few basic options are possible, all of which are being played out to various degrees by people in these societies. They can reform the system of land ownership, intensify the cultivation of existing land to increase the production per unit area, and open up new land to farm. They may also engage in illicit activities for income, move to other countries (either legally or illegally), or move to the cities and seek employment. Each of these options has consequences. Figure 8\u201311 Small-scale agriculture. seventy percent of the world\u2019s poor live in rural areas and are heavily dependent on small-scale agricul-ture. With just 2.5 acres, this Kenyan man farms the way his grandparents did, but is struggling to do so. Changing Land Ownership. Two patterns of agricultural land ownership that have historically kept rural peoples in poverty are collectivization (the gathering of farmers into group farms) and ownership by the wealthy few. When China abandoned collective agriculture in 1978 and assigned most agricultural land to small-scale farmers, farm output grew more than 6% a year for the next 15 years. Ownership by the wealthy few was a common result of colonialism in the 19th and 20th centuries. At one point, 87% of South Africa\u2019s land was available only to whites or was owned by the government, leaving a much smaller amount of poor-quality land for use by people of color. Rising rural populations in developing countries has increased the need to reform the systems of land ownership. However, resolving these kinds of inequities can be difficult. Intensifying Cultivation. The introduction of highly productive varieties of food grains in the Green Revolution had a dramatic beneficial effect in supporting the growing population, but has also caused some problems (Chapter 12). For example, intensifying cultivation means working the land harder. Plots have been put into continuous production with no time off. The results have been a deterioration of the soil, decreased productivity (ironically), and erosion. Given the countertrends of rapidly increasing population and the deterioration of land from over-cultivation, food production per capita in Africa is currently decreasing and may decrease in China in the near future. Agriculture in Burkina Faso, Awa\u2019s country, is limited by drought and poor soil. Agriculture is often intensified in order to increase cash crops such as cotton and sugar cane\u2014changes that may or may not help local farmers. Opening Up New Lands. Opening up new lands for agriculture may sound like a good idea, but there is really no such thing as \u201cnew land.\u201d Most of the land that is useful for agriculture is already in production. Opening up new land means converting natural ecosystems to agricultural production, resulting in the loss of the goods and services those ecosystems contribute. Even then, converted land is often not well suited for agriculture. Figure 8\u201312 depicts an aerial view of small agricultural plots around the world. These landscape views enable us to see how intensive agriculture already is and how much land has been converted to its use. The use of steep hillsides, marginal lands, or cut forests for planting is not a long-term solution. Illegal Activities. Anyone who doesn\u2019t have a way to grow sufficient food must gain enough income to buy it. Sometimes desperate people get food by poaching wildlife. Others get money through illegal activities, such as raising drug-related crops (Chapter 6). In Indonesia, Atin\u2019s home, there is a great deal of poaching of wildlife, including sea turtles, parrots, and many other species. Migration. When food, water, or other resources are in short supply, people often migrate to new areas. Hundreds Figure 8\u201312 Conversion of land for agriculture.", "This is a set of six satellite and computer generated images of fields in minnesota (upper left), Kansas (upper middle)\u2014where center pivot irrigation is responsible for the round field patterns\u2014and northwest Germany (upper right). near santa cruz, Bolivia (lower left), the fields radiate from small communities. outside of Bangkok, Thailand (lower middle), rice paddies are skinny rectangular fields. in the cerrado in southern Brazil (lower right), inexpensive flat land has resulted in large field sizes. scale: covers an area of 10.5 \u00d7 12 km.

This urbanization is one of the biggest trends in population today. In 2008, the world passed a landmark\u2014 more than half of the population lived in cities. This trend is expected to continue, so that by 2050 urban dwellers will account for 70% of the global population. In 2014, there were 31 metro-regions that qualified as \u201cmegacities\u201d of 10 million or more\u2014the top 10 of which are shown in Figure 8\u201313\u2014but most urbanites live in cities of less than half a million. Most of the net growth of the next 50 years in the developing countries will be absorbed in urban areas. About one-third of that urban growth is expected to occur in China and India. Many people in poorer countries believe they can improve their well-being by migrating to a wealthier country. Each year, 3.5 million people move to more developed regions. But immigration has its problems, too. Immigrants are likely to live in poor housing and be subject to environmental degradation. Prejudice against foreigners is common, and there is difficulty accommodating rapid change in cultures, especially in countries with strong ethnic and cultural homogeneity. Much migration is not from a poor country to a wealthy one, but from one low- or middle-income country to another, especially in areas with civil strife. Many such migrants qualify as refugees, people who leave their country to escape war, persecution, or natural disasters. (Refugees who stay within their own countries are called internally displaced persons.) Refugees are often placed in temporary refugee camps, where diseases and hunger often take a terrible toll on human life. Sometimes landless poor people simply move into areas of forest, cutting the trees to make small farms. Current U.S. immigration laws officially admit around 675,000 permanent immigrants per year, with certain exceptions for close family members. This rate of immigration makes the United States the highest immigrant-receiving country in the world. More than a million people receive a green card, or permanent residence status, each year. 12 Refugee immigrants can be accepted in addition to the number of officially accepted immigrants; the president and Congress decide the number of such exceptional cases. The United States also has a high number of illegal immigrants, something that is extremely sensitive politically. Challenges to Governments. In many developing countries, population growth and migration to urban areas are outpacing economic growth and the provision of basic services. Pakistan\u2019s population, for example, increased almost fivefold between 1960 and 2010; those decades of 3.2% annual growth have kept the country from alleviating poverty. 13 It is difficult for Pakistan to provide for its growing numbers. 12C.

The most rapidly expanding cities, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, have fallen so far behind in providing basic services that they are getting worse, not better. Streets are potholed, sanitation and drinking water are poor, electricity and telephone service are erratic, and disease and crime are rampant. Many are forced to live in sprawling, wretched shantytowns and slums that do not even provide adequate water and sewers, much less other services. Although there are connections between rapid population growth in the developing world and environmental decline, the most pressing issue is the massive poverty that afflicts the low-income countries. Global climate change is making the people of these nations even more vulnerable. For example, Figure 8\u201314 shows villagers in Nepal who have had to move their entire village because of drought. The 2014 Human Development Report calls for collective action to increase resilience, the ability to bounce back from disasters, among the poor nations. A different set of issues connects population and environmental decline in the affluent countries. Consequences of Affluence The United States has the dubious distinction of leading the world in the consumption of many resources. We consume the largest per capita share of several major commodities including aluminum, coffee, copper, corn, lead, oil, oilseeds, natural gas, rubber, tin, and zinc. 14 We also have high per capita consumption of many other items, such as meat. The average American eats about twice the global average of meat, although per capita beef consumption in the United States has fallen by 36% since 1976 and 14P. Harrison, F. Pearce, and P. Raven, \u201cAtlas of Population and the Environment Part 2\u201d (AAAS 2001), accessed October 28, 2014, http://atlas.aaas.org/?part=2. worldwide meat consumption is rising rapidly. 15 We nearly lead the world in paper consumption, using 504 pounds (229 kg) per person per year. 16 According to the Greendex, a consumer tracking index that National Geographic calculates for different countries, Americans are more likely than those in comparison countries to have energy-saving dishwashers, to have insulation in their homes, and to buy used items, but less likely to use public transportation, to buy local food, to eat home-cooked food, to eat fruits and vegetables, or to use their own reusable grocery bags when shopping. 17 All of these factors and many more like them contribute to the unusually high environmental impact that those of us living in the United States make on the world. In addition, the United States continues to have a higher rate of population increase than most other developed countries; much of this growth is from immigration. Because of our high per capita resource use, population growth in the United States has a greater effect on global consumption and the environment than population growth in other places. During the 20th century, the United States tripled its population and increased its per capita use of raw materials 17 times. 18 Despite the adverse effects of affluence, increasing the average wealth of a population can affect the environment positively. An affluent country such as ours provides amenities like safe drinking water, sanitary sewage systems and sewage treatment, and the collection and disposal of refuse. Thus, many forms of pollution are held in check, and the environment improves with increasing affluence. If we can afford gas and electricity, we are not destroying our parks and woodlands to obtain firewood. In short, we can afford conservation and management, better agricultural practices, and pollution control, thereby improving our environment. Still, because the United States consumes so many resources, we also lead the world in the production of many pollutants. For example, by using such large quantities of fossil fuel (coal, oil, and natural gas) to heat and cool our homes, drive our cars, and generate electricity, the United States is responsible for a large share of the carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. Oil spills are a by-product of our appetite for energy. Similarly, emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that have degraded the ozone layer, emissions of chemicals that cause acid rain, and emissions of hazardous chemicals are all largely the by-products of affluent societies. High individual consumption places enormous demands on the environment. The world\u2019s wealthiest 20% of 15R.

As a consequence of 80 their high rate of consumption, most of the world\u2019s major fisheries are either fully exploited or overexploited and old 60 Number of persons added per year(millions) growth tropical forests are being clear-cut and turned into chips to make paper. Metals are mined, timber harvested, commodities grown, and oil extracted, all far from the industrialized countries where a disproportionate amount of these goods are used. Every one of these activities has a significant environmental impact. As increasing numbers of people strive for and achieve greater affluence, it seems 40 20 0 more than likely that such pressures will mount. Sustainable Consumption One way of generalizing the effect of affluence is to say that it enables the wealthy to clean up their immediate environment by transferring their wastes to more distant locations. It allows them to obtain resources from distant locations, so they neither see nor feel the impacts of getting those resources. However, affluence also provides people with opportunities to exercise lifestyle choices that are consistent with the concerns for stewardship and sustainability. Tracking consumption patterns and trying to achieve sustainable consumption levels need to be part of our cultural responses to environmental degradation. One way governments could curb consumption would be by eliminating subsidies for consumer products and activities, such as purchasing suburban homes or subsidizing mining, forestry, or grazing (Chapters 7 , 11). Some esti mates of these subsidies are as high as $1 trillion globally each year. 19 With this picture of population growth and its twin consumption and their impacts in view, the next section discusses future population trends, how demographers identify them, and the biggest population trend\u2014the demographic transition. Year Figure 8\u201315 World population growth rate and absolute growth. declining fertility rates in the past three decades have resulted in a decreasing rate of population growth, shown by the blue line. even so, absolute numbers, represented by the orange bars, are still increasing by more than 70 million persons per year. (Source: data from shiro horiuchi, \u201cWorld Population Growth Rate,\u201d Population Today (June 1993): 7, and (June/July 1996): 1; updated from un Population division, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision (new York: united nations, 2010).) until the growth rate fell low enough to offset the increase in reproducing people. The declines in both the population growth rate and the number of persons added per year are primarily a consequence of the decline in the total fertility rate\u2014the average number of babies born to a woman over her lifetime. In the 1960s, the total fertility rate was an average of 5.0 children per woman; it has since steadily declined to its present value of 2.6 children per woman. The age at which a woman first reproduces also affects how rapidly a population grows. A population in which women have children at a young age will grow more quickly than one in which women are slightly older when they reproduce, Compare the environmental outcomes even if women have the same number of children. That of adding 10 people to the populations of the United States, China, and Burkina Faso. \u2610\u2713 8.4 Projecting Future Populations During the 1960s, the world population growth rate peaked at 2.1% per year, after having risen steadily for decades. Following this peak, it began a steady decline ( Figure 8\u201315) . Twenty years later, the number of persons added per year peaked at 87 million. Why did the number of persons added to the population each year continue to increase after the rate of growth had begun to decline? The answer is that even though the population growth rate was in decline, there were increasing numbers of people who could reproduce. The total number of persons added every year did not go down 19World Watch Institute, \u201cState of Consumption Today,\u201d accessed October 28, 2014, http://www.worldwatch.org/node/810#1. is, there are more generations alive at the same time when women reproduce young. Thus, total fertility rate is the most important, but not the only, factor determining population growth. Population Profiles In studying population growth, demographers must consider more than just the increase in numbers, which is simply births minus deaths.", "They must also consider how the number of births ultimately affects the entire population over the longevity, or lifetimes, of the individuals. To determine patterns in population growth, demographers analyze the data collected through a census of the entire population, using a combination of household questionnaires and estimates for groups such as the homeless. In the United States and most other countries, a detailed census is taken every 10 years. Between censuses, the data may be adjusted using information regarding births, deaths, immigration, and the aging of the population. POPULATION BY AGE GROUPS AND SEX Demographers use the data for a population to con struct a population profile, a bar graph depicting the num 105 15105 0 51015 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Age group (a) United States of America: 1985 ber or proportion of people at each age; males and females are shown separately. Figure 8\u201316 shows examples of such graphs. A population profile shows the age structure of the population\u2014that is, the number of people in each age group at a given date. It is a snapshot of the population at a given time. Leaving out the complication of migration for the moment, each bar in a profile represents one cohort (group of the same age) of the population. Figure 8\u201316 shows population profiles of the United States for 1985 and 2014 and a projected profile for 2050. As you look from one graph to the next, you can see a particular group as it ages. In high-income countries such as the United States, the proportion of people who die before age 60 is relatively small. Therefore, the population profile below age 60 is an \u201cecho\u201d of past events that affected birthrates. Figure 8\u201316a shows, for example, that smaller numbers of people were born between 1931 and 1935 (ages rates during the Great Depression. The dramatic increase in people born in 1946 and for 14 years thereafter (ages 54\u201368 in 2014, Figure 8\u201316b) is a reflection of returning veterans and others starting families and choosing to have relatively large numbers of children following World War II\u2014the \u201cbaby boom.\u201d The large baby-boom generation is now in middle age and retirement. The general drop in numbers of people born from 1961 to 1976 (ages 38\u201353 in 2014) resulted from declining fertility rates\u2014the \u201cbaby bust.\u201d The rise in numbers of people born in more recent years (ages 24\u201333), termed the \u201cbaby-boom echo,\u201d is due to the large baby-boom generation producing children, even though the actual total fertility rate remained near 2.0. These changes in fertility are shown in Figure 8\u201317. 15105 0 51015 50\u201368 in 1985). This drop was a reflection of lower birth (b) United States of America: 2014 Predicting Populations 105 100 15105 0 51015 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Age group Population (in millions) (c) United States of America: 2050 Current population growth in a country is calculated from three vital statistics: births, deaths, and migration. Demographers used to make population forecasts. Most often, they took current birth and death rates, factored in expected immigration and emigration, and then extrapolated the data into the future. They were nearly always wrong. For example, in 1964, the total fertility rate in the United States was around 3.0, although it was trending downward. The U.S. Census Bureau assumed that the total fertility rate would stay between 2.5 and 3.5 until 2000. On the basis of that assumption, the agency forecast a 2000 population of 362 million\u201481 million more than the actual number. The agency totally missed the baby bust of the late sixties and seventies. Nowadays, demographers only make projections, and they cover their bases by making their assumptions about fertility, mortality, and migration very clear. Extrapolating the trend of lower fertility rates leads to the UN Population Division\u2019s projection that the global human population Figure 8\u201316 Population profiles of the United States. The age will reach 9.6 billion by 2050; it will not have leveled off structure of the u.s. population (a) in 1985, (b) in 2014, and (c) projected to 2050. at that time, but is likely to level off at some time in the (Source: u.s. census Bureau, international data Base.) 22nd century. This projection is the UN\u2019s medium scenario; 8.4 Projecting Future Populations 203 1911 '15 '19 '23 '27 '31 '35 '39 '43'47 '51'55 '59'63 '67'71 '75'79 '83'87 '91'95 '99 2003 '07 '11 '15 Year Figure 8\u201317 Total fertility rate in the United States, 1911\u20132012.", "The changes in fertility led to the baby boom and the baby bust in the united states. The rate now hovers slightly below the replacement level. (Source: 2012 World Population Data Sheet (Washington, dc: Population Reference Bureau, 2012).) other scenarios are based on different assumptions about fertility. Figure 8\u201318 depicts the UN Population Division\u2019s projections until 2050 under four different sets of assumptions. The assumption of declining fertility rates is crucial; if current fertility rates remain unchanged (constant in the figure), the 2050 population will be 11.1 billion. 20 To achieve the medium scenario, people in the high-fertility areas of the world will need to continue to purposefully lower their fertility rate. The projected leveling off over 10 billion raises serious concerns about whether Earth can sustain such numbers. Note that all of the UN\u2019s projections in Figure 8\u201318 assume fertility rates will fall. In fact, if the current rate of fertility is maintained, the human population will hit 28.6 billion by 2100. Instead, fertility rates in high-fertility countries are likely to fall, while those in extremely low-fertility 20United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision, Volume I: Comprehensive Tables (2011): ST/ESA/SER.A/313. countries are likely to rise slightly. The medium scenario assumes that world fertility will drop from 2.55 children per woman to slightly more than 2 children per woman well before 2050. The high-fertility scenario assumes a total fertility rate half a child above that of the medium scenario, and the low-fertility scenario assumes a total fertility rate half a child below it. The constant fertility line in Figure 8\u201318 (orange) shows what will happen if the fertil ity rates around the world do not change. Note how each fertility assumption generates profoundly different world populations. Also note that none of these projections, even the one based on a drop in total fertility to 1.5 children per woman, will lead to a 2050 population that is smaller than today\u2019s population. Population Projections for Developed Countries. In Sweden, a developed country in northern Europe, women have had a stable fertility rate for some time. This is reflected in the population profiles of Sweden in Figure 8\u201319, on the following page. Sweden has a boom group that will be getting older by 2050, but also has a stable production of new Figure 8\u201318 United Nations population projections. The most recent population projections show the outcomes of different fertility assumptions. The Constant projection assumes that fertility rates remain at their present level (2.6 children per woman). The 1950 '60 '70 '80 '90 2000 '10 '20 '30 '40 '50 '60 '70 '80 '90 2100 Population (billions) Medium projection assumes a gradual decline in fertility in the developing countries, where 85% drop below replacement-level fertility by 2050 and the world total fertility rate is 2.02 children per woman. This projection is given the highest probability by the un Population division. The High projection assumes fertility rates at 1/2 child greater than the Medium projection, and the Low projection assumes fertility rates at 1/2 child lower than the Medium projection. all of these projections include the impact of the aids epidemic on increasing mortality.

(Source: u.s. census Bureau, international data Base.) youth. In some countries, such as Italy (with a fertility rate of 1.3) or Japan, the number of workers for each dependent (child, elderly, disabled, or otherwise unable to work) will decline. In the case of these countries, it is because an aging population is not replaced by new babies. Graying of the Population.", "For the next 20 years, Italy and Japan\u2019s populations will be graying, a term used to indicate that the proportion of elderly people is increasing. In 2011, about one fifth of Italians were age 65 or older; by 2050, about one third are expected to be 65 or older. Overall, a net population decrease is expected to occur. Unless a smaller population is the goal, it might be wise to encourage, and to provide incentives for, Italian couples to bear more children. In fact, many European governments have policies to encourage women to have more children, with mixed results so far. The very low fertility rate and the expected declining population seen in Italy and Japan are typical of an increasing number of highly developed nations. Worldwide, the population of people older than 65 years is expected to rise from 531 million to 1.5 billion in 2050. The surge of older people retiring may overwhelm government pension systems; life expectancies near 80 and retirement around 60 mean decades of retirement income. A number of countries in the Eurozone experienced financial difficulties in 2011 when it became clear that the burden of their social programs, including pensions, was unsupportable. Japan is also struggling to figure out how to care for its elderly. The Effect of Immigration. Europe as a whole is on a trajectory of population decline if population change is considered without immigration. One obvious solution is to allow more immigration. However, allowing the declining numbers of Italian or Japanese people to be replaced by immigrant populations has implications for their culture and religion. Such changes are sometimes difficult for the host society. In fact, Europe is in the midst of a migration wave. More than 47.3 million immigrants were living and working in the countries of the European Union in 2010, many of whom did not have resident status. Population Projections for the United States. Projections of future populations in the United States are a function of what we know about fertility rate and immigration. On the basis of the lower fertility rate expected from the 1980s, the U.S. population had been projected to stabilize at between 290 million and 300 million toward the middle of the next century. However, fertility rates and immigration were higher than expected, so new estimates made in 2008 projected that the U.S. population would be 439 mil lion by 2050 (Figure 8\u201320 ). Adjustments in 2012 reflected a slightly lower fertility rate, projecting 400 million by 2050. These projections show how differences in the total fertility rate and immigration profoundly affect estimates of future population growth. In light of the concerns for sustainable development, the population policy of the United States (and scenarios that could lead to lower future growth) is under heavy debate. Population Projections for Developing Countries. Developing countries are in a situation that is vastly different from that of developed countries. Fertility rates in developing countries are generally declining, but they are still well above replacement level. The average total fertility rate in developing countries is currently 3.0, excluding China, where it is 1.6. Because of decades of high fertility rates, the population profiles of developing countries have a pyramidal shape. While highly developed countries are facing the problems of a graying population, the high fertility rates in developing countries maintain an exceedingly young population. 8.4 Projecting Future Populations 205 Population in millions 1990 2010 2030 2050 Year Figure 8\u201320 Population projections for the United States.

An \u201cideal\u201d population structure, with equal numbers of persons in each age group and a life expectancy of 75 years, would have one fifth (20%) of the population in each 15year age group. By comparison, in many developing countries, 40% to 50% of the population is below 15 years of age, whereas in most developed countries, less than 20% of the population is below the age of 15 ( Table 8\u20133) . 105 105 Age group 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 432101234 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 432101234 (a) Burkina Faso: 1950 (b) Burkina Faso: 2010 105 105", "Age group 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 432101234 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 432101234 (c) Burkina Faso: 2050 (d) Burkina Faso: 2100 105 105 Age group 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 105 0 510 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 105 0 510 (e) Indonesia: 1950 (f) Indonesia: 2010 105 105 100 105 0 510 100 105 0 510 90 90 80 80 70 70 60 60 50 50 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 10 0 0 Population (in millions) Population (in millions) Age group (g) Indonesia: 2050 (h) Indonesia: 2100 Figure 8\u201321 Projecting future populations: Indonesia and Burkina Faso.

The demographics of Burkina Faso, Awa\u2019s home country, are typical of the lowest-income countries. Figure 8\u201321a\u2013d shows a series of population profiles for Burkina Faso, which has a total fertility rate of 5.9. Even assuming that this high fertility rate will gradually decline by 2025, the population is likely to increase from 15.3 million (2010) to 23.4 million, yielding the profiles shown in Figure 8\u201321c and d. The country\u2019s high infant mortality rate (currently 91 per thousand) comes nowhere close to offsetting the high fertility rate. The impact of AIDS is also included in the UN projections. AIDS has increased child and young adult mortality and lowered average life spans in a number of countries. The pyramidal form of the profile is similar in 2010 and 2050, because, for many years, the rising generation of young adults produces an even larger generation of children. Thus, the pyramid gets wider and wider until the projected declining fertility rate begins to take effect. Figure 8\u201321e\u2013h depicts population profiles of Indonesia, Atin\u2019s home. While Indonesia is not well off, its population growth rate is lower than Burkina Faso\u2019s. Its large population may stabilize earlier. Growth Impacts. What do these differing population structures mean in terms of the need for new schools, housing units, hospitals, roads, sewage facilities, telephones, and other services? One of the things they mean is that if a country such as Burkina Faso is simply to maintain its current standard of living, food production and the amount of housing and all other facilities must be almost doubled in as little as 25 years. Unfortunately, the population growth of a developing country can easily overwhelm its efforts to get ahead economically. Enormous growth is in store for the developing world, even assuming that fertility rates continue their current downward trend. Even if it were possible to bring the fertility rates of developing countries down to 2.0 right now, population growth in those countries would not immediately stop because of population momentum. Population momentum refers to the effect of current age structures on future populations. In a young population, such as Burkina Faso\u2019s, momentum is positive because such a small portion of the population is in the upper age groups (where most deaths occur) and many young people are entering their reproductive years. Even if the rising generations have only two children per woman (replacement-level fertility), the number of births will far exceed the number of deaths. This imbalance will continue until the current children reach the Burkina Faso limits of life expectancy\u201450 to 60 years. In other words, only a population that has been at or below replacement-level fertility for decades will stop growing (achieve a stable population). Thus, the earlier the fertility rates are reduced, the greater the likelihood of ending population growth. Europe\u2019s population, on the other hand, will soon begin to experience negative population momentum as a consequence of the low fertility of the past three decades. Of course, immigration would offset this effect. The Demographic Transition The concept of a stable, non-growing global population based on people freely choosing to have smaller families can become a reality, because it is already happening in developed countries. Early demographers observed that the modernization of a nation brings about more than just a lower death rate resulting from better health care. A decline in the fertility rate also occurs as people choose to limit the size of their families.", "Thus, as economic development occurs, human societies move from a primitive population stability, in which high birthrates are offset by high infant and childhood mortality, to a modern population stability, in which low infant and childhood mortality are balanced by low birthrates. A gradual shift in birth and death rates from the primitive to the modern condition in the industrialized societies is called the demographic transition ( Figure 8\u201322, on the following page). The basic premise of the demographic transition is that there is a causal link between modernization and a decline in birth and death rates. Birth and Death Rates. To understand the demographic transition, you need to understand the crude birthrate (CBR) and the crude death rate (CDR). The CBR and the CDR are the number of births and deaths, respectively, per thousand of the population per year. By giving the data per thousand of the population, populations of different countries can be compared, regardless of their total size. The term crude is used because no consideration is given to what proportion of the population is old or young, male or female. Subtracting the CDR from the CBR gives the increase (or decrease) per thousand per year. Dividing this result by 10 then yields the percent increase (or decrease) of the population. Number of Number of Natural increase Percent increase births per deaths per (or decrease) (or decrease) 1,000 -1,000 = in population , 10 = in population per year per year per 1,000 per year (CBR) (CDR) per year A zero-growth population is achieved if, and only if, the CBR and CDR are equal and there is no net migration. Epidemiologic Transition. Throughout most of human history, crude death rates were high\u201440 or more per thousand for most societies. By the middle of the 19th century, however, the epidemics and other social conditions responsible for high death rates began to recede and death rates in Europe and North America declined. The decline was gradual in the now-developed countries, lasting for many decades and finally stabilizing at a CDR of about 10 per thousand ( Figure 8\u201321 ). At present, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other degenerative diseases account for most mortality, and many people survive to old age. This pattern of change in mortality factors has been called the epidemiologic transition and represents one element of the demographic transition. (Epidemiology is the study of diseases in human societies.) Fertility Transition. Another pattern of change over time can be seen in crude birthrates. In the now-developed countries, birthrates have declined from a high of 40 to 50 per thousand 1775 1825 1875 1900 1925 1955 1985 2000 1775 1825 1875 1900 1925 1955 1985 2000 Year Year (a) Developed countries (b) Developing countries Figure 8\u201322 Demographic transition in developed and developing countries. (a) in developed countries, the decrease in birthrates proceeded soon after, and along with, the decrease in death rates, so very rapid population growth never occurred. (b) in developing countries, both birth and death rates remained high until the mid-1900s. Then the sudden introduction of modern medicine caused a precipitous decline in death rates. Birthrates remained high, however, resulting in very rapid population growth. (Source: Redrawn with permission of Population Reference Bureau.) to 9 to 12 per thousand\u2014a fertility transition. As Figure 8\u201322 shows, this fertility transition did not happen at the same time as the epidemiologic transition; instead, it was delayed by decades or more. Because net growth is the difference between the CBR and the CDR, the time during which these two patterns are out of phase is a time of rapid population growth. The developed countries underwent such growth during the 19th and early 20th centuries and during the baby-boom years of the mid-20th century. Phases of the Demographic Transition. The demographic transition is typically presented as occurring in the four phases shown in Figure 8\u201323. Phase I reflects a primitive stability resulting from a high CBR offset by an equally high CDR. Phase II is marked by a declining CDR\u2014the epidemiologic transition. Because fertility and, hence, the CBR remain high, population growth accelerates during Phase II. The CBR declines during Phase III due to a declining fertility rate, but population growth is still significant. Finally, Phase IV is reached, in which modern stability is achieved by a continuing low CDR and an equally low CBR. Figure 8\u201323 also shows countries that typify each of the stages of the demographic transition.", "Developed countries have generally completed the demographic transition, so they are in Phase IV. Developing countries, by contrast, are still in Phases II and III. In most of these countries, death rates declined markedly as modern medicine and sanitation were introduced in the mid-20th century. Fertility and birthrates are declining but remain considerably above replacement levels. Therefore, populations in developing countries are still growing rapidly. In light of these circumstances, the key question is: What must happen in the developing countries so that they complete their demographic transition and reach Phase IV? In this chapter, we looked at three young people\u2014Anje in Sweden, Atin in Indonesia, and Awa in Burkina Faso. We saw that their life experiences were dramatically different from each other\u2014in part because of broad differences between countries in wealth, health care, and other goods and services. Those differences in life experiences drive differences in consumption patterns and fertility\u2014two parameters that need to be brought into line to have a sustainable world. Next, we will investigate the factors that influence birth and death rates, as well as the contributions of economic development and family planning in bringing about the fertility transition (Chapter 9). In the process, we can begin to picture what sustainable development might look like for the developing world and what it will take to get there.

Population and Development The sun shines on the surface of the Chao Phraya River in Thailand. The water glistens as it runs past the rich fields in the central Thai region. In the villages by the river, extended families live in wooden structures on stilts, with water buffaloes and chickens safely housed beneath. Anong and her husband, Somchai, are part of such a family. They live with their two children, a boy and a girl, and Anong\u2019s elderly parents. While Somchai is the head of the family in most matters, Anong is in charge of finances and the household. Both work outside the home and earn a modest income. Both are literate. Although they live in only one room, the family has access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Both parents were raised in large families: Anong had seven siblings and Somchai five. Today, their family with only two children is more typical of Thai families. Fertility Drop. Anong and Somchai\u2019s lives are typical of many in Thailand. Like the rest of their generation, they have experienced rapid change in their home country. Probably the biggest change is in family size. In a single generation, the country underwent one of the largest drops in fertility in world history. Between 1960 and 2014, the total fertility rate dropped from 6.4 children per woman to 1.6. At the same time, GNP per capita and life expectancy rose dramatically (from $1,059 to $7,274 and from 53 years to 69.9 years). This remarkable drop in population growth rate astonished the world. While the percentage of children in the population has declined, the percentage of elderly has increased. As a result, Anong and Somchai are juggling many demands, caring for both their children and Anong\u2019s parents.

This Thai house on stilts has pens for aquaculture beneath it. In 1960, when the Texas-sized country held 28 million people, demographers predicted that Thailand would fall into a poverty trap: Any increase in the economy would be eaten up by the needs of the growing population. Today, with population growth slowed and a population of about 70 million, the country has 25 million fewer people than demographers predicted in the 1970s. In fact, demographers predict that within a decade the population may begin to contract, a change that would bring other social changes. Social Changes. How did Thailand stop its runaway population growth? Much was done through direct efforts to lower fertility: Voluntary contraception was increased, public health and awareness campaigns were undertaken, and health care clinics were opened, even in rural areas. For example, the public health campaign of one nonprofit group made contraception a familiar and humorous topic of everyday life. But there were other factors as well. Modern Thai women now have higher freedom, equality, and literacy rates than Thai 9.1 Predicting the Demographic Transition The demographic transition describes the shift from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates that occurs in industrialized countries ( Chapter 8) . Figure 9\u20131 plots the current birth and death rates of the major regions of the world to show where they fall in the demographic transition. Regions to the right of the vertical dividing line on this graph are on a fast track to completing the demographic transition or have already done so. Regions to the left of the line are in the middle of the demographic transition. These regions (half of the world) are mostly in their fifth decade of rapid population increase. It is as if they are trapped there, with serious women of the past. In Thai culture, sons are not favored over daughters, so women are not under pressure to abort female fetuses or to have more children than they can support in order to produce sons. A nutrition program implemented by the government dramatically slashed child malnutrition. Contrary to some prevailing thought, the fertility transition Thailand experienced occurred even though the country was relatively poor, and even though most people remained rural. While the drop in population growth prevented disaster, some of the economic growth and the support for millions more Thai citizens came at the expense of ecosystems. Thailand now has to contend with water and air pollution and the loss of biodiversity brought on by its activities. On the plus side, the country\u2019s ability to solve ecological problems is more likely with lower population growth. In the future, Thais will have to figure out how to navigate increased urbanization and an aging population. This chapter follows up on the demographic information presented earlier (Chapter 8). We begin with a reassessment of the demographic transition. consequences. One of the key questions scientists who study populations ask is, \u201cWhat causes some countries to move through the demographic transition quickly and others to remain in the process indefinitely?\u201d Different Ways Forward All countries trapped in long-term rapid growth would like to experience the economic development that has brought Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, and other low-income nations into the middle- and even high-income nation groups. If they did so, it is likely that they would then move through the demographic transition. How did the now-developed nations come through the demographic transition without getting caught in the Figure 9\u20131 World regions in the process of 50 demographic transition. Crude birthrates (CBRs, orange) and crude death rates (CDRs, green) are shown for major regions of the world. A dividing line separates 40 countries at or well along in the demographic transition from those still in the middle of the transition. (Source: Data from 2014 World Population Data Sheet (Washington, DC: Population Reference Bureau, 2014).) 30 20 Crude birth or death rate 10 0 poverty-population trap? In these countries, the improvements in disease control that lowered death rates (the epidemiological transition) occurred gradually through the 1800s and early 1900s. Industrialization, which introduced factors that lowered fertility, occurred over the same period. Therefore, there was never a huge discrepancy between birth and death rates (see Figure 8\u201322 ).", "In contrast, modern medicine was introduced into the developing world relatively suddenly, bringing about a precipitous decline in death rates, while the fertility-lowering effects of development have been slow in coming. Figure 9\u20132 shows how extreme the differences in speed of the demographic transition can be. Demographers and economists try to determine which factors are most likely to predict changes in populations and why. What causes educated women to have fewer children? If the GNP of a whole nation goes up, but inequality is high, will population growth rates still fall? Should governments simply try to increase the family economy for the poorest and assume fertility rates will fall, or do people need specific programs for family planning? The answers to these questions may vary by country. Competing Ideas What do the developing countries need to do to fast-forward their way through the demographic transition? From early on, two basic conflicting theories offered answers to this question: Conferences on Population. These two schools of thought were reflected at two UN population conferences\u2014one in Bucharest, Romania, in 1974 and a second in Mexico City in 1984. A conference in 1994 in Cairo, Egypt, and another in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2014, reflected some shifts in thinking. There were several other conferences in between. Bucharest. At the Bucharest conference, the United States was a strong advocate of population control through family planning, while the developing nations argued that \u201cdevelopment was the best contraceptive.\u201d Their resistance to family planning was bolstered by feelings that the developed world\u2019s promotion of population control was another form of economic imperialism or even genocide. Mexico City. At the conference in Mexico City, the sides were somewhat reversed. Developing countries facing problems of excessive population growth were asking for more assistance with family planning. The United States, under pressure from anti-abortion advocates, took the position that development was the answer and terminated all contributions to international family-planning efforts, a policy that remained in effect until 1993. The other developed countries, however, remained convinced that family planning was essential and continued to support international efforts to help the developing countries implement policies designed to reduce fertility rates. 9.1 Predicting the Demographic Transition 213 Iran, Islamic Rep.

Countries experience very different rates of change in fertility. (Source: www.gapminder.org.) Cairo. At the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 1994, poverty, population growth, and development were clearly linked, and resources and environmental degradation were an important focus. The ideological split between developed and developing countries was a thing of the past\u2014all agreed that it was necessary to deal with population growth in order to make progress in reducing poverty and promoting economic development. The responsibility for bringing fertility rates down was placed firmly on the developing countries themselves, although the developed countries pledged to help with technology and other forms of aid. The participants also reached broad agreement on several main ideas. One of these was that development must be linked to a reduction in poverty. Another was that women\u2019s rights to health care, education, and employment were foundational to achieving slower population growth. Five-year anniversary reviews affirmed the universal commitment to the agreements forged at this conference. Stockholm. The Sixth International Parliamentarians\u2019 Conference on the Implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action (IPCI/ICPD) took place in Stockholm, Sweden, in April 2014, 20 years after the plan of action developed at Cairo. At that meeting, representatives of different countries set a new series of goals for a post-2015 world. These goals focused on improving the lives of women and girls and increasing access to reproductive services, as well as improving health and education for all. ICPD Programme members unanimously adopted the Stockholm Statement of Commitment, a document with specific goals for nations about population, development, and human rights. Large and Small Families The fertility transition is the key element in the demographic transition. Many studies have shown that high fertility and poverty are linked, including a correlation Total Fertility Rate 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Per Capita Income Figure 9\u20133 Fertility rate and income in selected developing countries (2011). There is a correlation between income (gross national income in purchasing power parity per capita) and lower total fertility.", "Factors that affect fertility more directly are health care, education for women, and the availability of contraception. (Source: World Data Sheet 2014 and the World Economic Outlook Database, September 2014.) between fertility rate and gross national income per capita, as shown in Figure 9\u20133. Countries on the far left side of this plot are all in the early or middle stages of the demographic transition; most are low-income economies. Those in the middle and to the right are middle-income economies that are moving through the transition. Thailand is somewhat of an exception to this pattern, because its fertility rate dropped while the country still had a relatively high level of poverty; in recent decades its economy has improved. Differences in fertility rates between countries with similar economies relate to differences in their societies and social supports. To the observer in a developed country, it may seem strange that so many poor families in developing countries have large numbers of children. From our perspective, it is obvious that more children spread a family\u2019s income more thinly and handicap efforts to get ahead economically. In the United States, large families are rare. In other countries, large families are more common, though in countries with poor sanitation and little access to health care, children may not live to adulthood. The decision-making process that leads parents to produce large families is different in low-income countries than in the United States because the sociocultural conditions are very different. Let\u2019s look at some examples. In western Uganda, most families are large and polygamous and make their living in agriculture. Because girls bring a bride price to their parents, both boy and girl children are valued. More than half of the women marry before the age of 18, and the average woman has about six children. 1 Children are an asset in the workforce. Many people see the immediate need for help in the fields as more important than their children\u2019s long-term options, so most children do not receive education, a common trade-off in many poor rural areas (Figure 9\u20134) . Afghanistan is another good example. In 1950, the population was 8 million; in 2013, it was 31 million; and estimates for 2030 range between 43 million and 50 million. About 42% of Afghans are under the age of 15, and another 22% are between the ages of 15 and 24. 2 A number of factors combine to make life difficult for Afghan families: war, poverty, lack of human rights, uncertainty about the future, and a lack of education. A typical Afghan woman (Figure 9\u20135) might marry a man a dozen years older than herself and bear children as soon as she is able to get pregnant. She will have few rights to her own decision making, little schooling, and heavy social pressure to bear sons. She may not know about contraception or may live in a culture that doesn\u2019t accept it. Because of harsh conditions, both mothers and infants die in the birth process at higher rates than those in most of the world. In spite of all of these difficulties, fertility in Afghanistan is currently declining, although it is still an average of 5.4 children per woman. Between 2003 and 2012, the use of contraceptives rose from 5% to 22% in some rural areas. 1The State of Uganda Population Report 2013.

In many developing countries, children perform adult work. This Peruvian child and adult are digging in a farm field. Figure 9\u20135 Young parenthood. Young parenthood contributes to high rates of population growth. Marriage by young girls is common in Afghanistan, where this mother and child live. Numerous studies reveal the following as primary reasons that the poor in developing countries have large families. Total fertility rate 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Percent using modern contraceptives Figure 9\u20136 Fertility rate and prevalence of contraception in selected countries (2011). More than any other single factor, lower fertility rates are correlated with the percentage of the population using contraceptives. (Source: Data from 2014 World Population Data Sheets (Washington, DC: Population Reference Bureau, 2014).) Fertility rates in developing countries remain high not because people in those countries are behaving irrationally or irresponsibly, but because the sociocultural climate in which they live has favored high fertility for years and because contraceptives are often unavailable.", "Sometimes the rise in population triggers a vicious cycle: poverty, environmental degradation, and high fertility drive one another forward ( Figure 9\u20137). Increasing population density leads to a greater depletion of rural resources such as firewood and water, which in turn encourages couples to have more children to help gather resources. They are in a poverty trap. Rapid population growth can increase inequality in a society because the abundance of labor lowers the price of labor. This feeds the cycle, as inequality also promotes poverty. The five factors supporting large families are common to pre-industrialized, agrarian societies. In contrast, Figure 9\u20138 The demographic window. 100 A s countries experience gradually decreasing fertility, dependency ratios decline and 90 opportunities for development increase. The graph compares several developing regions with some developed countries. 80 (Source: World Data Sheet 2011 and the World Economic Outlook Database, September 2011.) 70 60 50 South A sia compare to that in East A sia and the Pacific? 40 Dependency ratio 1960 1970 industrialization, urbanization, and development bring conditions conducive to having small families. These conditions include the relatively high cost of raising children, the existence of pensions and a social-security system, opportunities for women to make money, access to affordable contraceptives, adequate health care, educational opportunities, and an older age at marriage. Thus, it is not just economic development that leads to declining fertility rates. Rather, fertility rates decline insofar as development provides (1) security in one\u2019s old age apart from the help of children, (2) lower infant and childhood mortality, (3) universal education for children, (4) opportunities for education and careers for women, and (5) access to contraceptives and reproductive health services. These are all outcomes of public policies, and countries (such as Thailand) that have made them a high priority have moved into and through the demographic transition. Demographic Dividend As a country goes through the demographic transition, birthrates decline. As a result, the working-age population increases relative to the younger and older members of the population. This relationship is the dependency ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the nonworking population (under 15 and over 65) to the working-age population (Table 8\u20133 ). For a time, the society can spend less on new schools and more on factors that will alleviate poverty and generate economic growth\u2014a demographic dividend. This demographic window is open only once, however, as the numbers of younger children decrease, and stays open for only a few decades, until the numbers of older people increase. Graying populations then increase the dependency ratio (see Sustainability, Dealing with Graying Populations). If countries have succeeded in increasing their economy, they will then be in a better position to care for dependents (Chapter 8) . For countries well below replacement level, such as Japan, the fertility level may rebound slightly or immigration may increase to level the population out in the long term. Figure 9\u20138 shows how the dependency ratios in several world regions have changed over time and are likely to change 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 Year 9.1 Predicting the Demographic Transition 217 in the future. A number of East Asian and Latin American countries, such as South Korea, Brazil, and Mexico, have taken advantage of this window. They have put in place social and economic policies that are consistent with poverty reduction and economic expansion, and as a result, they have experienced rapid economic development. The countries of South Asia (for example, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh) are currently approaching this window of opportunity. Will they make the necessary investments in health, education, and economic opportunities to take full advantage of the demographic window? To do so, they must directly help the poorest people in their societies. Case Studies: China and India When a country has uncontrolled population growth, it isn\u2019t always obvious how to respond. Increasing modernization may help, but isn\u2019t guaranteed to work: a country may be headed into a poverty trap. If ignoring the problem isn\u2019t reasonable, and simply letting people die of starvation and disease is unethical (as most people would argue), then governments have to decide how strongly they will act to lower population growth. The most acceptable option\u2014the one that is the theme of this chapter\u2014is to create an economic and social climate in which people, of their own volition, will desire to have fewer children. Along with such a climate, society will provide the means to enable people to exercise that choice.", "Recent changes in China and India\u2014the two most populous countries in the world\u2014provide an instructive contrast. Both countries have experienced dramatic population growth and have rapidly expanding economies. Both countries also struggle to feed their populations, have more men than women, and suffer environmental degradation from activities designed to increase the economy. However, the social policies of these two countries are significantly different. China has a centralized government and a strong policy that allows only small families. Its fertility rate is low, its literacy rate is high, and its population is aging. India has a young population, higher fertility rates, and wide variation in family size. How have their policies caused their populations to change? China. Several decades ago, China was in an intolerable position. Under the Communist leader Mao Tse-tung, the government encouraged people to have large families; in just a few decades China\u2019s population increased from 550 million to 900 million people. During the \u201940s and \u201950s, the government pursued a series of unfortunate plans for industry and agriculture that, along with natural disasters, led to famine. Between 1958 and 1960, crop production dropped by 70%, causing the greatest level of starvation in human history; between 20 million and 43 million people died. By the early \u201970s, China\u2019s leaders began a voluntary family-planning program of clinics and education, with some success. Figure 9\u20139 China\u2019s one-child law. China\u2019s one-child policy caused the country\u2019s population growth to slow dramatically. Here you see parents with their only child. In 1979, China introduced a policy of allowing families to have only one child. About 40% of married couples were obligated to this policy; others were allowed two or sometimes more children. The one-child policy affected mostly urban families ( Figure 9\u20139). Exceptions were made for rural families, those who had daughters first, families in which both parents were only children, and ethnic minorities. To achieve its population goals, the government instituted an elaborate array of incentives and deterrents. Incentives included a single-child bonus (a monthly subsidy to one-child families), additional food rations, housing preferences for single-child families, better medical care, and job priority for only children. Disincentives for having an excessive number of children included taxes and repayment of the single-child bonus. As a result of these policies, China saw a precipitous drop in its total fertility rate, from about 4.5 in the mid1970s to 1.6 in 2014. Yet despite such controls, the population of China is still growing due to momentum and will continue to do so for some years. (China\u2019s current population is 1.4 billion, one-fifth of the world\u2019s people.) One disturbing consequence of China\u2019s policy is a skewed ratio of males to females. Males are preferred in Chinese families, so some parents try to make sure that their one child is a male, through such extreme measures as selective abortion and even infanticide of female children. Now China anticipates 30 million excess males coming into adulthood by 2020, leaving many young men with no prospect of forming a family. This skewed sex ratio and the country\u2019s aging population have caused China to reconsider aspects of its one-child policy. In 2014, China relaxed the policy, allowing more parents to have a second child. The one-child policy has been extremely controversial. Local governments in China, tasked with keeping population growth down, have carried out egregious human rights violations, such as razing the homes of people with multiple children and forced sterilizations and abortions. These actions have caused outrage in China and in the world community. China\u2019s government pursued policies with which many people are uncomfortable. China\u2019s population policy has been a case study for environmental ethicists and a topic of passion for human rights workers since its inception, but it is the exception. Most countries in the world believe people should be able to make individual choices about family size. India. In the nearly 70 years since India gained its independence from the United Kingdom, its population has more than tripled. With 1.25 billion people as of 2014 and a total fertility rate around 2.5, India is growing at a rate of 18 million per year and is expected to surpass China\u2019s population by 2025. In spite of many decades of family-planning programs, India\u2019s population has continued to grow, canceling out much of the country\u2019s gains in food production, health care, and literacy. Yet across India, especially in the south, fertility rates are dropping and poverty rates have fallen from 52% to almost 22% (Figure 9\u201310) .", "Figure 9\u201310 Rich and poor in India. A modern high-rise building towers above a poorer area of Gurgaon, on the southwest fringe of Delhi, highlighting India\u2019s huge contrast in wealth. At this point, almost half of India\u2019s children under the age of five are malnourished, and two-thirds of its population live on less than $2 a day. India has the largest illiterate population in the world at 287 million. 4 With a per capita gross national income of $5,350 per year, India has a very long way to go to achieve the kind of development that characterizes the industrialized countries. Population growth is quite different in the southern Indian state of Kerala. With a population of 33.8 million and an area about the size of Kentucky, Kerala is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. Like the rest of India, Kerala is crowded, per capita income is small, and food intake is low. However, people of Kerala have a life expectancy of 74 years, compared with 67 for all of India. Infant mortality and fertility rates are low and literacy is high. Access to education and health care is high and women are as well educated as men. Even though Kerala is a poor region, its people are well on the way to achieving a stable population, which is expected in 2021. Kerala\u2019s success in slowing population growth was a result of targeted development, not simply general economic growth. In Section 9.3, we will see some of the specific conditions under which a fertility transition is most likely for a low-income country. CONCEPT CHECK What were the major causes of population change in Thailand, China, and India? What other factors were involved? \u2610\u2713 9.2 Promoting Development The good news is that many developing countries have made remarkable economic progress. The gross national products of some countries have increased as much as fivefold, bringing them from low-income to medium-income status, and some medium-income nations have achieved high-income status. There is still a great gap between rich and poor countries in income, as well as technology. But in 4\u201cIndia tops adult illiteracy: U.N. report\u201d The Hindu, Jan 29, 2014, http://www .thehindu.com/features/education/issues/india-tops-in-adult-illiteracy-un-report/ article5629981.ece 9.2 Promoting Development 219 the two decades after 1990, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty\u2014those living on less than $1.25 per day\u2014dropped from 36% to 18% of the world\u2019s population. By 2015, the percentage had dropped even further. Tremendous social progress has been made in many developing countries, too. Since 1990, maternal mortality has dropped by 45%. Ninety percent of primary school-age children now attend school. Literacy rates, access to clean drinking water and sanitary sewers, and other indicators of development have generally improved. Furthermore, the fertility rates of most developing countries have declined, although they are still far above the replacement level ( Table 9\u20131) . Nonetheless, there is still a long way to go. About one seventh of the world\u2019s population (1 billion people) live on less than $1.25 a day, nearly 1 billion lack access to toilets and must defecate outdoors, 1 billion lack access to clean water, more than 860 million live in urban slums under deplorable conditions, and more than 800 million lack sufficient food. There are also great disparities in economic progress among developing countries. Income growth and technological progress are lowest in three regions with continued high population growth and poverty: sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. 5 Is the solution to these problems simply to facilitate economic growth and expect that the alleviation of poverty will follow? Not necessarily. As we have already seen, the wealth of a country may increase, but many people will remain in poverty if inequality is high. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) puts it the following way in State of World Population 2002: \u201cDevelopment has often bypassed the poorest people, and has even increased their disadvantages. The poor need direct action to bring them into the development process and create the conditions for them to escape from poverty.\u201d 6 The alleviation of poverty was the explicit objective of the Millennium Development Goals. 5Kavita Watsa, Technology & Development: Findings from a World Bank Report: Global Economic Prospects 2008: Technology Diffusion in the Developing World (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2008). 6UNFPA, State of World Population 2002: People, Poverty, and Possibilities: Making Development Work for the Poor, ed. Thoraya Ahmed Obaid (New York: UN Population Fund, 2002).", "The Millennium Development Goals In 1997, representatives from the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) met to formulate a set of goals for international development that would reduce the extreme poverty in many countries and its various impacts on human well-being by 2015. The goals were sharpened and then adopted as a global compact by all UN members at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000. Table 9\u20132 lists the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Table 9\u20132 Millennium Development Goals and Targets 17 targets; each goal also had indicators for measuring progress. The MDGs provided targets for developing countries working in partnership with developed countries and development agencies. An unprecedented amount of global attention was focused on the MDGs, including virtually every UN agency, the government agencies of many countries, and scores of NGOs. Despite their wide support, the MDGs also had critics. For example, the MDGs were criticized because they focused on what donor countries ought to do. Critics (Conditions in 1990 are compared with those in 2015, the year for reaching the targets) Goal 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. Goal 2. Achieve universal primary education. \u2022 Target 3: Ensure that all children, boys and girls alike, are enrolled in primary school. Not achieved, but reached 90%. Goal 3. Promote gender equality and empower women. \u2022 Target 4: Eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005 and in all levels of education by 2015. Gender parity achieved or close to being achieved in primary education. Goal 4. Reduce child mortality. \u2022 Target 5: Reduce mortality rates by two-thirds for all infants and children under five. Not achieved, but reduced by 50%. Goal 5. Improve maternal health. Goal 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. Goal 7. Ensure environmental sustainability. Goal 8. Forge a global partnership for development. Sources: United Nations, Millennium Development Goals Report 2014 (New York, United Nations, 2014). believed that the MDGs had been imposed on poorer communities, did not include the voices of the poorest people they were supposed to serve, and did not adequately address inequality. A recent summary of global and regional progress toward the MDGs is found in The Millennium Development Goals Report 2015, produced by statisticians from a host of UN agencies. Table 9-2 provides a short assessment of the world\u2019s progress toward achieving the goals and targets. Progress toward some goals was largely successful. Between 1990 and 2015, at least 1.6 billion people gained access to safe drinking water, making Target 7c of the MDGs one of the first to be attained. Great strides were also made toward lowering the number of people in extreme poverty and increasing access to primary education, especially among girls. In all but two regions, primary school enrollment is now 90% or more; sub-Saharan Africa, which consistently ranks among the lowest regions on many quality-of-life measures, increased primary school enrollment from 58% to 76% in only a decade. The number of deaths from measles fell dramatically; about 80% of children in developing countries are now immunized (Figure 9\u201311) . All regions of the world except for Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southern Asia saw drops in child mortality of 50% or more ( Figure 9\u201312) . In addition, many more women now have skilled attendants during childbirth and 81% of pregnant women have some prenatal care. In fact, the number of maternal deaths from childbirth was halved in less than 20 years. Progress toward other goals and targets was not as successful. Nourishment of children, lowering maternal mortality, and access to sanitation were among them. The goal with the greatest number of targets where outcomes became worse rather than improving was Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability. Freshwater resources, forests, and fish stocks all declined, while species extinctions and greenhouse gases increased. On the positive side, however, the use of Figure 9\u201311 Measles vaccination. One success of the Millennium Development Goals has been the dramatic drop in measles. This child in a primary school in Uganda is being vaccinated for measles; today more than 80% of children in the world are vaccinated. 9.2 Promoting Development 221 ozone-depleting CFCs declined, and many more people had access to safe drinking water. Not all of the MDGs were achieved during the period from 2000 to 2015. Yet it is impressive that many critical areas of life for the poorest improved at the same time that the world population rose from 6 to 7.2 billion.", "Unfortunately, the environment was often harmed in doing so. The Sustainable Development Goals In 2012, just 20 years after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit at which a global agenda for sustainable development was first described, the UN Conference on Sustainable Development was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At this Rio+20 meeting, world leaders, NGOs, and representatives of many stakeholder groups hashed out the goals described in a document called The Future We Want. 7 The participants agreed that whatever goals followed the end of the Millennium Development Goals had to focus on both development 7UN, The Future We Want, Outcomes Document, United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, Rio De Janiero, Brazil, June 20\u201322, 2012, https://rio20 .un.org/sites/rio20.un.org/files/a-conf.216l-1_english.pdf.pdf.

(Source: Millennium Development Goals Report 2014 (New York: United Nations, 2014).) and sustainability. How could they do that while honoring peoples\u2019 rights of self-determination? Part of the answer came from a multiyear process during which groups and individuals around the world had an opportunity to express their opinions. As a result of this input, the core drafting team developed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. A preliminary version of these goals is shown in Table 9\u20133. The SDGs then went through an approval process by the UN member countries. How do the SDGs differ from the MDGs? The SDGs are more numerous and complex than the MDGs; there were 8 MDGs, but there are 17 SDGs, each with numerous targets. The SDGs also have more parts focused on environmental sustainability. Goal 2 includes sustainable agriculture; Goal 6 includes clean water and sanitation; Goal 11 includes sustainable cities; Goal 12 addresses consumption; Goal 13 addresses climate change; Goal 14 is about protecting the oceans; and Goal 15 is about protecting terrestrial ecosystems. The inclusion of measures of environmental sustainability throughout goals on development demonstrates a recognition of the connection between environmental degradation and human poverty. Table 9\u20133 Sustainable Development Goals. Like the MDGs, the SDGs may be very difficult to achieve. While the MDGs aimed to cut poverty in half by 2015, the SDGs aim to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. One of the biggest lessons learned in planning the MDGs and SDGs is that countries cannot address global problems individually, especially when the land, atmosphere, and water are a heritage for all. World Agencies at Work Several international agencies coordinate development and help countries interact in an increasingly global economy. These include the World Bank and various UN agencies. The World Bank. In 1944, delegates from 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to conceive a vision of development for the countries ravaged by World War II. They established the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is now called the World Bank. The World Bank functions as a special agency under the UN umbrella, owned by the countries that provide its funds. As the more developed countries of Europe and Asia got back on These goals will be accepted by UN member states and be active for the years 2015\u20132030. Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere. Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all. Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries. Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Goal 14.", "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. Goal 15. Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. Goal 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. (Source: UN Report of Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals, 2014.) 9.2 Promoting Development 223 their feet, the World Bank directed its attention toward the developing countries. With deposits from governments and commercial banks in the developed world, the World Bank now lends money to governments of developing nations at interest rates somewhat below the going market rates. In effect, the World Bank helps governments borrow large sums of money for projects they otherwise could not afford. It provides loans for a wide range of development activities, including activities that support the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals. Annual loans from the World Bank have climbed steadily, from $1.3 billion in 1949 to $52.6 billion in 2013. Through its power to approve or disapprove loans and the amount of money it lends, the World Bank has become the major single agency providing aid to developing countries. Over the years, a number of projects funded by the World Bank have been destructive to the environment and to the poorer segments of society. Critics cite many examples wherein the bank\u2019s projects exacerbated the cycle of poverty and environmental decline. For example, from 1963 to 1985 the World Bank funneled $1.5 billion into Latin America to clear millions of acres of tropical forests. Most of the cleared land was handed over to large cattle operations that produced beef for export. At that time, the World Bank procedures considered environmental concerns as an add-on rather than as an integral component of its policies. In the 1990s, the World Bank pressured Bolivia to open its water sources to multinational purchasers. The thinking was that the local governments were corrupt and lacked the expertise to provide water, and that privatization would bring infrastructure and skills. The World Bank threatened to not renew a large loan unless water rights were privatized. This led to civil unrest when prices rose and poor people had limited access to water ( Figure 9\u201313) . In 2010, the World Bank loaned $3.75 billion to South Africa to build the world\u2019s fourth largest coal-fired power plant. The country had been in an electricity crisis, and major investments in electricity generation had not been made in decades. The plant will increase electricity production but greatly increase harmful environmental effects from coal use (Chapter 14 ). In recent years, there has been a sea change in how the World Bank does business with the developing world. The bank helped initiate the Millennium Development Goals. As evidence of a change in its policies, the World Bank adopted a new environmental strategy, Making Sustainable Commitments: An Environmental Strategy for the World Bank, in 2002. The strategy \u201crecognizes that sustainable development, which balances economic development, social cohesion, and environmental protection, is fundamental to the World Bank\u2019s core objective of lasting poverty alleviation.\u201d An analysis of more than 11,000 projects funded by the World Bank to address poverty reduction or biodiversity found that these goals were often mutually reinforcing. The analysis showed that, depending on the objectives, some 60% to 85% of all projects were rated as satisfactory or highly satisfactory. Figure 9\u201313 Bolivian water wars. This 2000 scene in Cochabamba, Bolivia, features people protesting the privatization of water. The sign says, \u201cWhat\u2019s ours is ours and it cannot be taken away.\u201d UN Agencies Involved in Development. To quote its mission statement, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is \u201cthe UN\u2019s global development network, advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life.\u201d 8 The agency has offices in 131 countries and works in 166. It helps developing countries attract and use development aid effectively. It also coordinates global and national efforts to reach the MDGs and the SDGs. The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are other important agencies whose work will be discussed in future chapters.", "Although the World Bank and UN agencies such as the UNDP and the FAO can be criticized, they are often on the front line of trying to improve the lives of billions who suffer from the effects of poverty. We turn now to the debt crisis. To some extent, this crisis is an outcome of World 8UNDP Washington Representation Office, July 5, 2012, http://www.us.undp.org/ WashingtonOffice/Mission.shtml. Bank policies, but it is also a consequence of development aid in general. The Debt Crisis The World Bank, many private lenders, and other nations lend money to developing countries. In fact, China alone lends as much as the World Bank. Theoretically, development projects should generate revenues that are sufficient for the recipients to pay back their development loans with interest. Unfortunately, a number of things can prevent this outcome, including corruption, mismanagement, and honest miscalculations. Interest obligations climb accordingly, and any failure to pay interest is added to the debt, increasing the interest owed\u2014the credit-debt trap. This cycle has caused developing countries to become increasingly indebted. Their total debt reached $4.8 trillion in 2012. 9 By 2014, developing nations were increasing their debt by $18.5 billion annually. Many countries have paid back in interest many times what they originally borrowed, yet the debt remains and they may never be able to repay their debts. Short-Term Measures. The debt situation is an economic, social, and ecological disaster for many developing countries. In order to keep up even partial interest payments, poor countries often rely on short-term \u201csolutions\u201d that cause long-term problems. Three such \u201csolutions\u201d are described below. Adopt austerity measures. Government expenditures are often reduced so that income can be used to pay interest on the debt. But what is cut? Usually, it is funds for schools, health clinics, police protection in poor areas, building and maintenance of roads in rural areas, and other goods and services that benefit not only the poor, but also the country as a whole. As a result of such actions, unemployment may rise (Figure 9\u201314) . 9The World Bank, 2014 International Debt Statistics, http://datatopics.worldbank .org/debt/ids/region/LMY. Figure 9\u201314 Unemployment. Austerity measures can worsen unem-ployment, keeping national debt down but making the lives of people hard. Romania has unemployment up to 80% in some areas, especially among ethnic minorities such as these Sinti. Focus agriculture on growing cash crops for exports. Governments may focus agriculture on growing cash crops for export rather than for feeding the local population. Indigenous people often bear the brunt of such policies; sometimes their land is taken and used to grow crops for export. Invite the rapid exploitation of natural resources for quick cash. Such exploitation may include logging forests or extracting minerals. With the emphasis on quick cash, few, if any, environmental restrictions are imposed. Thus, the debt crisis has meant disaster for the environment. In essence, these measures are all examples of liquidating ecosystem capital to raise cash for short-term needs. They do not represent sustainability. Debt Cancellation. The World Bank is addressing the problems of debt and poverty directly through two initiatives, one to provide small amounts of money to the poorest people and the other to relieve debt in the poorest counties. The Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest (CGAP) is designed to increase access to financial services for very poor households through microlending\u2014the lending of small amounts of money to people with very little. The Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative and its related program, Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), address the debt problem of the low-income developing countries, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa. To qualify, countries have to demonstrate a track record of carrying out economic and social reforms that lead to greater stability and alleviate poverty. By 2014, 36 countries had gone through the application process and, proving themselves stable, had received more than $75 billion in debt relief. 10 In most countries that received this debt relief, spending on education and health has risen substantially. Development Aid College students and their parents know all about the differences among scholarships, grants, and loans as they apply for financial aid. Paying back college loans is no picnic for the thousands of students who accept them in order to afford their education. It is all called \u201caid,\u201d but the best kind of aid is the grant or scholarship, which does not have to be repaid. Developing countries are well aware of the difference, too, and have been receiving grant-type aid from private and public donors that is essential to their continued development.", "How much aid have they been given? Official Development Assistance. The best records are for official development assistance (ODA) from donor countries. In 2013, the total amount of ODA was $138.4 billion; this total had been increasing for several years, following declining aid in the 1990s and early 2000s. Aid rises and falls with the needs of low-income countries and also with 10IMF, Debt Relief Under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative Factsheet, September 30, 2014, http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/hipc.htm. 9.2 Promoting Development 225 PUBLIC AID AND PRIVATE REMITTANCES TO HAITI (MILLION $, INFLATION-ADJUSTED) Figure 9\u201315 Haitian aid and remit tances. Haiti has many citizens who live abroad and send money home. Aid Remittances and remittances are compared here. The 3064 Aid spike in aid in 2010 reflects aid given after a large earthquake. (Source: World Bank DAC2, Center for Global Development 2014.) 17801710 1612 1551 1453 1369 1375 12751222 1170 1120 986 932 912 811 702 675 623 582 426 299 213 170 156 1.062 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 world events, conflicts, and donor interests. At the Rio Earth billion, the largest of any donor nation, but only 0.19% of our Summit of 1992, the aid target for donor countries was GNI. Norway, by contrast, gives the equivalent of 1.07% of 0.7% of GNI. However, by 1997 actual aid was only 0.22%. its GNI in development aid. However, many private institu-It then began to rise, but slowly. In 2005, representatives tions and individuals in the United States also provide support from donor countries pledged to raise their ODA to 0.35% to developing countries. As an example, Table 9\u20134 details the by 2010, well short of the 0.7% target, but a significant increase from what they were doing. By 2014, only six countries (Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) had exceeded this target. The average is only 0.3%. Some of the shortfall in aid is caused by donor fatigue, which occurs when high-income countries have tired of handing out money. They see themselves asked for multimilliondollar rescue packages, only to have a large percentage go to fill the pockets of corrupt leaders or to cover administrative costs. Steps have recently been taken to minimize this misdirection of funds. Allocation of aid is increasingly being tied to policy reform in the recipient countries. Migration and Remittances. Some 232 million people live outside the country of their birth, and many more second-generation immigrants maintain ties to their native countries. Most of these migrants left their home country looking for employment; wage levels in developed countries are five times those of the countries of origin of most migrants. Migrants typically send much of their money home as remittances. This is a surprisingly large flow of funds\u2014estimated at $436 billion in 2014 (just to developing countries) and more than double the amount of international aid flowing to those countries. There is no doubt that remittances alleviate the severity of poverty in the developing countries and can be thought of as a \u201cdo it yourself\u201d kind of development aid. Figure 9\u201315 shows how important remittances are to the economy of Haiti. Aid from the United States. How much aid does the United States give? In 2013, our ODA donations were $31.5 total U.S. contributions in fiscal year 2010\u20132011, including contributions from foundations, corporations, universities, religious groups, private organizations, and individuals in the United States. That year nongovernmental sources provided $39.0 billion in aid, outstripping our ODA. When remittances and private capital investments are added to these, the total economic contributions from the United States to developing countries amounted to $278.5 billion that year. Global Financial Crisis. Developing world economies experienced record economic growth during 2002\u20132007, a result of increased export earnings and substantial foreign investment. The collective GNI of developing countries grew more than 5% per year, peaking at 8% in 2006 and well outpacing the developed countries. However, in late 2007, the U.S. housing bubble burst, leading to a collapse of financial markets that spread to other developed countries. The United States fell into a severe recession, and the recession spread globally. The global crisis perturbed economies in developing countries in a number of ways, including results of less foreign investment in their markets and a reduction in their exports. These changes caused the growth of GNI in the developing countries to decline.", "Reduced aid from the developed countries, a decrease in remittances from for-eign-born workers in wealthier countries, and an increase in worldwide food prices also hurt poor people around the globe. Fragile States. Some of the world\u2019s poorest countries are designated fragile states. These conflict-prone countries lack a stable government that can protect its citizens and provide then with necessary services. For example, a country\u2019s government may be unable to protect its citizens from rogue groups during a war. In other situations, the government is corrupt or a military dictatorship. Fragile states are home to 43% of the people living on less than $1.25 a day, those in the most extreme poverty. Much of the aid such countries receive is humanitarian and disaster relief, but what they most need is to get to a point where they can build infrastructure and social capital. Somalia, which has been at war and lacked a central government for 20 years, is a good example of a fragile state. In the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is a fragile state. It is extremely difficult for aid agencies to work with fragile states because of the danger to aid workers. Such volatile situations are devastating for women and children. There are often floods of refugees, and rape and violence may be rife. Under such conditions, it may be nearly impossible to implement family planning or other long-term assistance programs. The greatest need is for basic, stable governance and security. When that is achieved other poverty issues may be tractable. CONCEPT CHECK What are two differences between the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals? \u2610\u2713 9.3 A New Direction: Social Modernization Even though foreign assistance is vital, the developing countries themselves must address the root causes of poverty. This usually means changes in public policy at more local levels. To illustrate, we will consider the relative roles played by development and family planning. As the case of Thailand demonstrates, the shift from high to low fertility rates in the poorer developing countries does not require the economic trappings of a developed country. Instead, what is needed are efforts within the country, made on behalf of the poor, with particular emphasis on improving education, especially literacy and the education of girls and women; lowering infant mortality and improving life expectancy; making family planning available and affordable; enhancing employment opportunities; and managing resources to maintain ecosystem sustainability. As may be obvious, most of these activities are well aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. That is, development targeted at alleviating the problems of the poorest people will also bring down population growth rates (Section 9.2). Similarly, the solutions to problems that contribute to population growth are the solutions to problems that cause people to have large families. A great deal of focus is on women, because they not only bear children, but are also the primary providers of nutrition, childcare, hygiene, and early education. When women have more education and some income of their own, they are more likely to spend money on education and health care for children and less likely to have large numbers of children. Next we will briefly consider each part of social modernization. Improving Education Investing in the education of children (and adults who lack schooling) is a key element of the public-policy options of a developing country, one that returns great dividends (Figure 9\u201316) . Providing education in developing countries Figure 9\u201316 Education in developing countries. These girls are Afghan refugees in Pakistan, attending an NGO-funded school. 9.3 A New Direction: Social Modernization 227 can be quite cost effective because any open space can suffice as a classroom and few materials are required. Evidence shows that providing secondary schooling for at least 50% of children pulls large segments of a poor country\u2019s population out of poverty and is an important factor in decreasing fertility and improving the health of children. In 1960, for example, Pakistan and South Korea had similar incomes and population growth rates (2.6%), but very different school enrollments\u201494% in South Korea versus 30% in Pakistan. Within 25 years, South Korea\u2019s economic growth was three times that of Pakistan\u2019s. Today the rate of population growth in South Korea has declined to 0.5% per year, while Pakistan\u2019s is still 2.2% per year. The lowest net enrollment of children in primary schools is in sub-Saharan Africa, where 33 million children are out of school, 56% of them girls. Improving Health", "The health care most needed by poor communities in the developing world is good nutrition and basic hygiene\u2014steps such as boiling water to avoid the spread of disease and properly treating infections and common ailments such as diarrhea. (In developing countries, diarrhea is a major killer of young children. It is easily treated by giving suitable liquids, a technique called oral rehydration therapy.) The discrepancy in infant mortality rates (infant deaths per 1,000 live births) between developed countries (6/1,000) and developing countries (46/1,000) speaks for itself. Life Expectancy. One universal indicator of health is human life expectancy. In 1955, average life expectancy globally was 48 years. Today, it is around 68 years for boys and 73 years for girls and rising. 11 This progress is the result of 11World Health Organization, World Health Statistics 2014, http://www.who.int/ mediacentre/news/releases/2014/world-health-statistics-2014/en/. social, medical, and economic advances in the latter half of the 20th century that have substantially increased the wellbeing of large segments of the human population. Recall that the epidemiologic transition is the trend of decreasing death rates that is seen in countries as they modernize ( Chapter 8). Recall also that as this transition occurred in the now-developed countries, it involved a shift from high mortality rates (due to infectious diseases) to the present low mortality rates (due primarily to diseases of aging, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases). Despite the progress indicated by the general rise in life expectancy, there is a large difference in life expectancy between developed and developing countries. Women typically have longer life expectancies than men. Women in Spain have a life expectancy of 85 years, and women in Japan a life expectancy of 87 years, the longest life expectancy. Chad and Afghanistan have female life expectancies as low as 52 years; male life expectancies are even lower. Sierra Leone has the lowest life expectancies: 38 years for males and 46 years for females. The discrepancy between the most developed and least developed countries can be seen quite clearly in the distribution of deaths by main causes, shown in Figure 9\u201317. Infectious diseases were responsible for 47% of mortality in the least developed countries, compared with only 6% in the developed countries. The solution is very evident: Primary health services need to be centered on people\u2019s needs, they must provide health security in the context of people\u2019s communities, and there must be universal access to primary health care. Disease prevention and the promotion of health are critical components of this primary health care. Health care in the developing world must emphasize maternal prenatal and postnatal care for mothers and children. Many government, charitable, and religious organizations are involved in providing basic health care; when this is extended to clinics in rural areas, it is one of the most effective ways of delivering primary health care to families. Developed countries Population: 991 million Total mortalities: 8.5 million Cardiovascular 43% Cancers 27% Other and unknown causes 17% Communicable diseases 6% Injuries 6% Least developed countries Population: 2.6 billion Total mortalities: 25.6 million Communicable diseases 47% Cardiovascular 27% Injuries 10% Other and unknown causes 9% Cancers 7% Figure 9\u201317 Leading causes of mortality in the most developed and least developed countries. Infectious diseases are predominant in the least developed countries, while cancer and diseases of the cardiovascular system predominate in the highly developed countries. (Source: Data from World Health Organization, Projections of Mortality and Burden of Disease, 2002\u20132030 (2008).) Reproductive Health. When women are better off, whole populations are improved. This is the focus of reproductive health, a fairly new concept in population matters. Reproductive health focuses on women and infants and, in some cases, on reproductive education and health for men. Key components include prenatal care, safe childbirth, postnatal care, information about birth-control options, prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and prevention and treatment of infertility. Promotion of reproductive health also involves protecting women from violence and coercion. For example, reproductive health requires the elimination of violence against women (coercive sex and rape), sexual trafficking, and female genital mutilation (a traditional practice in some African societies). Reproductive health care was strongly emphasized at the 1994 International Conference on Population Development held in Cairo, Egypt. It also underpins a number of the MDGs; Goal 5 (Improve maternal health) was expanded in 2005 to include reproductive health services. In the SDGs, Target 3.b of Goal 3 is similar (Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health for all). HIV/AIDS.", "One of the greatest challenges to health care in developing countries is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a sexually transmitted disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The global epidemic of AIDS is most severe in many of the poorest developing countries, which are least able to cope with the consequences. This disease devastates the economies of communities by killing people in the prime of their working lives, increasing the dependency ratio as children are left in the care of other children or the elderly. Most approaches to prevention involve getting people to change their sexual behavior\u2014to practice safe sex, limit their sexual partners, and avoid prostitution. That these things can be accomplished is proven by the case of Uganda, where a 70% decline in HIV prevalence has been registered in recent years, linked to a 60% reduction in casual sex. The Ugandan government has mounted a national AIDS control program that includes a major education campaign. Another effective preventive measure is male circumcision, which causes a 60% reduction in HIV risk in males involved in heterosexual relationships and protects more women than most other preventive strategies. The WHO strongly recommends that countries offer male circumcision as one of their anti-AIDS services. Thailand once had the highest HIV infection rate in South Asia, but public education campaigns in the 1990s pulled the rate down, although it rose again in the 2000s. After a change in government in 2006, the country reinvigorated its public health efforts to combat HIV infections. An increase in funding from the developed countries has helped Thailand and other countries to combat this disease. Major sources of funding are the World Bank; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief; and local country budgets. Figure 9\u201318 Family planning. Thailand reduced its high fertility in part through a humorous public education campaign. Cabbages and Condoms, shown here, is a restaurant chain whose profits fund the Population and Community Development Association, a Thai nonprofit. Family Planning Information on contraceptives, supplies of contraceptives, and treatments are the most direct ways to bring down high population growth. In poor nations, family planning is supported by agencies that in turn are supported by governments, international groups, and NGOs. The stated policy of family-planning agencies is to enable people to plan their own family size\u2014that is, to have children only if and when they want them. In addition to helping people avoid unwanted pregnancies, family planning often involves diagnosing and overcoming fertility problems for those couples who are having reproductive difficulties. Family planning is a critical component of reproductive health care ( Figure 9\u201318) . Those countries that have implemented effective family-planning programs have experienced the most rapid decline in fertility. In Thailand, for example, a vigorous family-planning program was initiated as part of a national population policy in 1971. Population growth subsequently declined from 3.1% per year to the present 0.5% per year. In addition to stabilizing populations, the availability of contraceptives allows people to avoid suffering. One study in Tanzania showed an increase in contraceptive use in rural households after crop loss. Householders were able to prevent pregnancies that would result in children likely to die of malnourishment. 12 This strategy prevents a great deal of hardship but only works if contraception is available and affordable. Women who lack access to contraception but want to postpone or prevent childbearing are said to have an unmet need. In developing countries, the unmet need for family planning ranges from 10% to 50% of women. Negotiating Disagreements. The major document resulting from the 1994 Cairo population conference (ICPD 12S. Alam, \u201cEconomic shock of crop loss increases contraceptive use among women of rural Tanzania,\u201d (2013) Population Resource Bureau, http://www.prb .org/Publications/Articles/2013/tanzania-crop-loss.aspx. Program of Action) states that family planning should focus on education and the provision of services directed at avoiding unwanted or high-risk pregnancies. It explicitly states that abortions should not be used as a means of family planning. This statement was neither aimed at eliminating abortion nor at supporting a right to abortion for women worldwide. Instead, it focused on maintaining support for family planning among stakeholders who disagreed about the controversial issue of abortion. Research shows that the rate of abortions is higher when family planning services such as contraception and education are unavailable than when they are available. It is hard to make policy on an international level because of social and individual disagreement about important issues.", "The ICPD Program of Action helped forge a middle ground between people with very disparate views and emphasized the importance of family planning services to women worldwide. Planned Parenthood, which operates clinics throughout the world, is probably the best-known family planning agency. Another significant player is the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries at their request. The emphasis of UNFPA is on combining family planning services with maternal and child health care and expanding the delivery of such services in rural and marginal urban areas. Support for UNFPA and other family planning agencies is a contentious subject in the United States because of the strong opinions surrounding abortion. U.S. Contributions to International Family Planning. In 1984 and again in 2001, a presidential order prohibited the U.S. government from giving aid to foreign family-planning agencies if they provide abortions, counsel women about abortion if they are dealing with an unwanted pregnancy, or advocate for abortion law reforms in their own country. Because the United States had been the largest international donor to family-planning programs, these prohibitions were a blow to efforts to increase the availability of contraceptive services in developing countries. At one point, the United States withdrew its support for the entire 1994 ICPD Program of Action because it uses terms such as reproductive services and reproductive health care. Critics of this move pointed out that the Cairo agreement was critical to the fight against HIV/AIDS and prevented the very unwanted pregnancies that could lead to abortions. U.S. funding for family planning varies with political changes. Employment and Income Any economic system is based on the exchange of goods and services. In a simple barter economy, people agree on direct exchanges of certain goods or services. Barter economies are still widespread in the developing world. The introduction of a cash economy facilitates the exchange of a wider variety of goods and service, and everyone may prosper, as they have a wider market for what they can provide and a wider choice of what they can get in return. 9.3 A New Direction: Social Modernization 229 In a poor community , people may have the potential to provide certain goods or services and may want other things in return, but there is no money to get the system off and running. In a growing economy, people who wish to start a new business generally begin by obtaining a bank loan to set up shop. In poor communities, however, it is very difficult to obtain bank loans. There are three main reasons why: Most banks consider the poor to be high credit risks; the poor often want smaller loans than commercial banks are willing to deal with; and many of the poor are women who are denied credit because of gender discrimination. Fortunately, this situation is changing. In 1976, Muhammad Yunus ( Figure 9\u201319) , an economics professor in Bangladesh, conceived of and created a new kind of bank (now known as the Grameen Bank) that would engage in microlending to the poor. As their name implies, microloans are small\u2014the cumulative average was $458 in 2015\u2014and short-term, usually just four to six months. Nevertheless, they provide such basic things as seed and fertilizer for a peasant farmer to start growing tomatoes, pans for a baker to start baking bread, a supply of yarn for a weaver, tools for an auto mechanic, or an inventory of goods to start a grocery store. By 2015, nearly 6.2 million small loans had been made. Yunus secured his loans by having the recipients form credit associations\u2014groups of several people who agreed to be responsible for each other\u2019s loans. With this arrangement, the Grameen Bank has experienced an exceptional rate of payback\u2014greater than 97%. Small-scale agriculture loans from the Grameen Bank have had outstanding results. In a rural area of Bangladesh, small loans, along with horticultural advice, are now enabling peasant farmers to raise tomatoes and other vegetables for sale to the cities. These people doubled their incomes in three years. Microlending has been found to have the greatest social benefits when it is focused on women. Figure 9\u201319 Muhammad Yunus. An economics professor in Bangladesh, Yunus created the Grameen Bank, which initiated the microlending movement. The Grameen Bank has loaned more than $6.6 billion over the past 35 years, and the microlending model has been duplicated in more than 40 countries. Yunus received the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of the global impact of his work.", "The unqualified success of microlending in stimulating economic activity and enhancing the incomes of people within poor communities has been so remarkable that the Grameen concept has been adopted in more than 40 countries around the world (including the United States), with various modifications. In 2014, there were 10,000 microfinance institutions around the world. These efforts may do more than anything else to meet the MDGs and SDGs, as they empower the poor to improve their own well-being. Resource Management The world\u2019s poor depend on local ecosystem capital resources\u2014particularly water, soil for growing food, and forests for firewood. Many lack access to enough land to provide an income and often depend on foraging in woodlands, forests, grasslands, and coastal ecosystems. This activity generates income and is vital to those in extreme poverty; 90% of the world\u2019s poorest people depend on forests for some of their sustenance (by extracting fuel wood, construction wood, wild fruits and herbs, fodder, or \u201cbush meat\u201d for both subsistence and cash). Forests, fisheries, reefs, grasslands, and waterways can all be common-pool resources for the poor (see Chapter 7). These can be a safety net, as well as an employment source. But if common-pool resources are not managed effectively, they are liable to be overused, especially when populations are increasing. Protecting forest resources and tackling land degradation are two sustainable steps that can be addressed by country policies. One approach that has worked in Nepal is empowering the poor to manage community- or state-owned lands ( Figure 9\u201320). There groups that use forests are given the right to own trees, but not the land. The groups develop forest-management plans, set timber sale prices, and manage the surplus income from the operations. There are now more than 14,000 user-groups managing 1.3 million hectares (3 million acres) of forest. Putting It All Together Each of the five components of social modernization\u2014 education, health, family planning, employment and income, and resource management\u2014depends on and supports the other components. For example, better health and nutrition support better economic productivity, better economic productivity supports obtaining a better education, and a better education leads to a delay in marriage and the desire to have fewer children. The availability of family-planning services is essential to realizing the desire of parents to have fewer children. All the components work together to improve lives. Conversely, the lack of any component undercuts the ability to achieve all the other components. Figure 9\u201320 Improving resource management. These Nepalese women are planting saplings in a community reforestation project that will increase the amount of wood available for harvest. Sustainable Development. Social modernization is entirely compatible with the MDGs and SDGs (Tables 9\u20132 and 9\u20133). As we move forward, we also need to protect valuable ecosystem services. Any form of modernization needs to be compatible with sustainable development, development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. 13 Globalization. In their progression toward economic development and social modernization, the developing countries must confront the realities of globalization. The accelerating interconnectedness of human activities, ideas, and cultures is profoundly changing many human enterprises, with significant economic impacts. A small number of developing countries (China, Malaysia, and Indonesia, for example) have successfully entered the global market. Their exports have paved the way for economic progress, and these countries are becoming more connected to the economic- and information-rich high-tech world. People in the poorest countries need to be included in a market economy. This requires jobs, and that often requires investment from outside agencies\u2014businesses and NGOs with the knowledge and capital needed. In addition, there must be some hope of marketing the products, which means entering the global market on a level playing field. But at present the playing field is far from level because developed countries protect their exports with subsidies, quotas, and tariffs; these trade barriers work against the developing countries ( Chapter 2). Goal 17 of the SDGs (Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development) calls for eliminating such barriers. 13World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), 27. Review Questions 231 Globalization can be harmful to the poor if it opens markets for agricultural products from the developed countries, which can ruin subsistence farming.", "Globalization can also widen the gap between the rich and poor within a society, as the wealthier members capitalize on the information flow and quick transfer of goods and services, leaving the poor farther behind. Aid can have a similar effect, undermining local economies. This is one reason that the 2005 Paris Declaration (an agreement on aid) emphasized that donor countries should buy local products where possible, rather than donating from abroad. Critics of globalization claim that it does not seem capable of promoting financial stability and social justice. It also has the potential to dilute or even destroy cultural norms and religious ideals when it is uncritically welcomed into developing countries. Whether helpful or harmful, globalization is taking place, making it essential that the developing countries confront it head on and adapt its connections to their needs and cultures. How does globalization make solutions to poverty more difficult? How does it make them easier?

Water: Hydrologic Cycle and Human Use Drought in the American Southwest. It\u2019s a tough time in America\u2019s almond-growing region\u2014a section of California\u2019s Central Valley that produces more than 80% of the world\u2019s almonds. For several years this region has languished in deep drought, threatening the survival of the almond orchards. Almonds are a water-needy crop\u2014it takes about 1.1 gallons of water to produce each nut. Indeed, almond trees require a great investment of water during all the years they are growing, including the first five years when they produce no nuts. The millions of gallons of water used to grow almonds cannot simply be turned off in a drought year. If farmers do not irrigate the almond trees, they will die, and the farmer will lose an investment of years. California contains one sixth of the irrigated land in the country. Much of the water used for this irrigation has been diverted from far-away rivers. Those diversions endanger the salmon in the rivers, which require more water than is left for them. Some of the water used for irrigation is pumped from new wells that tap into ancient reserves of water that percolated underground millions of years ago. That groundwater is being withdrawn faster than any rain could replace it, depleting an underground resource owned by all. Mega-Drought. California is not the only state in drought\u2014the drought encompasses much of the Southwest. The drought, which has been going on since 2000, is now being called a \u201cmega-drought.\u201d It is estimated to be the fifth most severe drought in that region since AD 1000. Stressed by the lack of water, trees in the forests are dying. The dry forests sit like tinder, waiting for a spark to set off a wildfire. The risk of wildfire is increased by the heavy load of unburned brush lying on the forest floor, the product of years of fire suppression.

Attempts to save water, dam rivers, pump water, and desalinate ocean water are all a part of the story of water in this region. Around the World. The American Southwest is a microcosm of the world. All over, people are trying to balance the water supply to meet the needs for agriculture, drinking water, and biodiversity. In 2010 and 2011, southwestern China had its worst drought in 60 years. During that drought, the Chinese people who lived in the dry, wheat-growing areas relied on drinking water brought to them on trucks.", "Parts of 10.1 Water: A Vital Resource Water is absolutely fundamental to life as we know it. Happily, Earth is virtually flooded with water. A total volume of some 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (325 million mi3) of water covers 75% of Earth\u2019s surface. About 97.5% of this volume is the saltwater of the oceans and seas. The remaining 2.5% is freshwater\u2014water with a salt content of less than 0.1% (1,000 ppm). This is the water on which most terrestrial biota, ecosystems, and humans depend. Of the 2.5%, though, two-thirds is bound up in the polar ice caps and glaciers. Thus, only 0.77% of all water is found in lakes, wetlands, rivers, groundwater, biota, soil, and the atmosphere (Figure 10\u20131). Nevertheless, evaporation from the oceans combines with precipitation to resupply that small percentage continually through the solar-powered hydrologic cycle, described in detail in Section 10.2. Thus, freshwater is a continually renewable resource. Streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, swamps, estuaries, groundwater, bays, oceans, and the atmosphere all contain water, and they all represent ecosystem capital\u2014goods and services vital to human interests (see Table 5\u20132 for the ar ray of aquatic ecosystems and their characteristics). They provide drinking water, water for industries, and water to irrigate crops. Bodies of water furnish energy through Saltwater 97.5% Polar ice caps and glaciers 1.7% Accessible freshwater 0.77% Figure 10\u20131 Earth\u2019s water. The Earth has an abundance of water, but terrestrial ecosystems, humans, and agriculture depend on accessible freshwater, which constitutes only 0.77% of the total. Australia are also suffering severe drought, an effect scientists believe is made worse by climate change. Yet in other places, severe flooding pollutes waterways and sweeps away homes. Today freshwater is a new form of gold, a precious commodity to be measured and traded. A s we welcome new people into our crowded global community, finding clean, safe water for all will be one of our top priorities. Chapter 10, the first of four chapters on essential resources, focuses on water. The concepts in this chapter are strongly intertwined with those we have already seen in chapters on population and development and with later chapters on soil, food production, and climate change. hydroelectric power and control flooding by absorbing excess water. They provide transportation, recreation, waste processing, and habitats for aquatic plants and animals. Freshwater is a vital resource for all land ecosystems, modulating the climate through evaporation and essential global warming (when water is in the atmosphere as water vapor). During the past two centuries, many of these uses have led us to construct a huge infrastructure designed to bring water under control. We have built dams, canals, reservoirs, aqueducts, sewer systems, treatment plants, water towers, elaborate pipelines, irrigation systems, and desalination plants. As a result, waterborne diseases have been brought under control in the developed countries, vast cities thrive in deserts, irrigation makes it possible to grow 40% of the world\u2019s food, and one-fifth of all electricity is generated through hydropower. These great benefits are especially available to people in the developed countries (Figure 10\u20132a) . In the developing world (Figure 10\u20132b) , by contrast, 0.8 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water, 2.1 billion do not have access to adequate sanitation services, and more than 1.4 million deaths each year are traced to waterborne diseases (mostly in children under five). All too often in these countries, water is costly or inaccessible to the poorest in society, while the wealthy have it piped into their homes. In addition, because of the infrastructure that is used to control water, whole seas are being lost, rivers are running dry, millions of people have been displaced to make room for reservoirs, groundwater aquifers are being pumped down, and disputes over water have raised tensions from local to international levels. Today, freshwater is a limiting resource in many parts of the world and is certain to become even more so as the 21st century unfolds. Feeding a growing world population will challenge our water management infrastructure, especially as cities and industries compete with agriculture for scarce water resources. The growing impact of climate change on the hydrologic cycle is in turn worsening the problems brought on by droughts and floods. Rainfall variability can reduce the economic growth of nations as floods devastate some croplands and droughts dry them up in other parts of the 10.1 Water: A Vital Resource 235 (a) (b) world. Climate change also plays a role as warming increases evaporation and worsens the effects of droughts.", "There are two ways to consider water issues. The focus in this chapter is on quantity\u2014that is, on the global water cycle and how it works, on the technologies we use to control water and manage its use, and on public policies we have put in place to govern our different uses of water. Some of the terms we will be using to describe the water Figure 10\u20132 Differences in availability. Human conditions range from (a) being able to luxuriate in water to (b) having to walk long distances and pull from deep pumps to obtain enough simply to survive. In many cases, however, the abundance of water is illusory because water supplies are being overdrawn. cycle are listed and defined in Table 10\u20131. Later we will focus on water quality\u2014that is, on water pollution and its consequences, on sewage-treatment technologies, and on public policies for dealing with water pollution issues ( Chapter 20). As the polar ice caps melt, how do the relative percentages of Earth\u2019s saltwater and freshwater change? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 10.2 Hydrologic Cycle and Human Impacts Water moves through the land, oceans, and atmosphere in a continuous process called the hydrologic cycle. This cycle is represented in Figure 10\u20133 . The basic cycle consists of water rising to the atmosphere through evaporation (the transformation of water molecules from a liquid to a gaseous state) and transpiration (the loss of water vapor as it moves from the soil through green plants and exits through leaf pores) and returning to the land and oceans through condensation (the formation of liquid water from a gaseous state) and precipitation (the release of water from clouds in the form of rain, sleet, snow, or hail). Modern references to the hydrologic cycle distinguish between green water and blue water. Green water is water in vapor form, while blue water is liquid water wherever it occurs. Green water and blue water are vitally linked in the hydrologic cycle. Evaporation, Condensation, and Purification Recall that a weak attraction known as hydrogen bonding tends to hold water molecules (H2O) together ( Chapter 3). Below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C), the kinetic energy of the molecules is so low that the hydrogen bonding is strong enough to hold the molecules in place with respect to one another, and the result is ice. At temperatures above freezing but below boiling (212\u00b0F or 100\u00b0C), the kinetic energy of the molecules is such that hydrogen bonds keep breaking and re-forming with different molecules. The result is liquid water. As the water molecules absorb energy from sunlight or an artificial source, the kinetic energy they gain may be enough to allow them to break away from other water molecules entirely and enter the atmosphere. This is the process of evaporation, resulting in water vapor\u2014water molecules in the gaseous state. You will learn later that water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas (Chapter 18). It contributes about two-thirds of the total warming from all greenhouse gases. The amount of water vapor in the air is the humidity. Humidity is generally measured as relative humidity, the amount of water vapor as a percentage of what the air can hold at a particular temperature. For example, a relative humidity of 60% means that the air contains 60% of the maximum amount of water vapor it could hold at that particular temperature. The amount of water vapor air can hold changes with the temperature. When warm, moist air is cooled, its relative humidity rises until it reaches 100%. Further cooling causes the excess water vapor to condense back to liquid water because the air can no longer hold as much water vapor (Figure 10\u20134) . Condensation is the opposite of evaporation. It occurs when water molecules rejoin by hydrogen bonding to form liquid water. If the droplets form in the atmosphere, the result is fog and clouds (fog is just a very low cloud). If the droplets form on the cool surfaces of vegetation, the result is dew. Condensation is greatly facilitated by the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere. Aerosols are microscopic liquid or solid particles (like hair spray) originating from land and water surfaces. They provide sites that attract water vapor and promote the formation of droplets of moisture. Aerosols may originate naturally, from sources such as volcanoes, wind-stirred dust and soil, and sea salts. Anthropogenic sources\u2014sulfates, carbon, and dust\u2014 contribute almost as much as natural sources (more in some locations) and can have a significant impact on regional and global climates.", "Purification occurs when water is separated from the solutes and particles it contains. The processes of evaporation and condensation purify water naturally. When water in an ocean or a lake evaporates, only the water molecules leave the surface; the dissolved salts and other solids remain Relative humidity Condensation begins 50% Water vapor Cooling air 0% 3028262422201816141210 8642 0\u20132\u20134\u20136 Temperature \u00b0C Figure 10\u20134 Condensation. The amount of water vapor that air can hold changes with the temperature. The red line follows an air mass that starts with 40% relative humidity (RH) at 30\u00b0C and is cooled. When the mass of air cools to 17\u00b0C, it has reached 100% RH, and condensation begins, forming clouds. If we started with a higher RH, clouds would form sooner when the air is cooled. Further cooling and condensation result in precipitation. 10.2 Hydrologic Cycle and Human Impacts 237 behind in solution. When the water vapor condenses again, it is thus purified water\u2014except for the pollutants and other aerosols it may pick up from the air. The water in the atmosphere turns over every 10 days, so water is constantly being purified. (The most chemically pure water for use in laboratories is obtained by distillation, a process of boiling water and condensing the vapor.) Thus, evaporation and condensation are the source of all natural freshwater on Earth. Freshwater that falls on the land as precipitation gradually makes its way through aquifers, streams, rivers, and lakes to the oceans (blue water flow). In the process, it carries along salts from the land, which eventually accumulate in the oceans. Salts also accumulate in inland seas or lakes, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The salinization of irrigated croplands is a noteworthy human-made example of this process (Chapter 11). Most of the freshwater from precipitation, however, is returned directly to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration. Precipitation Warm air rises from Earth\u2019s surface because it is less dense than the cooler air above. As the warm air encounters the lower atmospheric pressure at increasing altitudes, it gradually expands and cools\u2014a process known as adiabatic cooling. When the relative humidity reaches 100% and cooling continues, condensation occurs and clouds form. As condensation intensifies, water droplets become large enough to fall as precipitation. Adiabatic warming, by contrast, occurs as cold air descends and is compressed by the higher air pressure in the lower atmosphere. Precipitation on Earth ranges from near zero in some areas to more than 2.5 meters (100 in.) per year in others. The distribution depends on patterns of rising and falling air currents. As air rises, it cools, condensation occurs, and precipitation results. As air descends, it tends to become warmer, causing evaporation to increase and dryness to result. A rain-causing event that you see in almost every television weather report is the movement of a cold front. As the cold front moves into an area, the warm, moist air already there is forced upward because the cold air of the advancing front is denser. The rising warm air cools, causing condensation and precipitation along the leading edge of the cold front. Two factors\u2014global convection currents and rain shadows\u2014may cause more or less continuously rising or falling air currents over particular regions, with major effects on precipitation. Convection Currents. At the equator, the rays of the Sun are nearly perpendicular to the Earth\u2019s surface; at the poles, light rays strike the land at an angle. That difference causes the surface of the Earth to be hotter in some places than others and drives great air movements, called global convection currents. As the air at the equator is heated, it expands, rises, and cools; condensation and precipitation occur. The constant intense heat in these equatorial areas ensures that this process is repeated often, thus causing high rainfall, which, along with continuous warmth, supports tropical rain forests. Hadley cells Figure 10\u20135 Global air circulation. (a) The two Hadley cells at the equator. (b) The six Hadley cells on either side of the equator, indicating general vertical airflow patterns. (c) Global wind patterns, formed as a result of Earth\u2019s rotation. Rising air over the equator is just half of the convection current, however. The air, now dry, must come down again. Pushed from beneath by more rising air, it \u201cspills over\u201d to the north and south of the equator and descends over subtropical regions (25\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 north and south of the equator), resulting in subtropical deserts.", "The Sahara of northern Africa and the Kalahari of southern Africa are prime examples. The two halves of the system composed of the rising and falling air make up a Hadley cell (Figure 10\u20135a and b) . Because of Earth\u2019s rotation, winds are deflected from the strictly vertical and horizontal paths indicated by a Hadley cell and tend to flow in easterly and westerly directions\u2014the Altitude37.5\u00b0F (3.1\u00b0C) ft.

Rain Shadows. When moisture-laden winds encounter mountain ranges, the air is deflected upward, causing cooling and high precipitation on the windward side of the range. As the air crosses the range and descends on the other side, it becomes warmer and increases its capacity to pick up moisture. Hence, deserts occur on the leeward (downwind) sides of mountain ranges. The dry region downwind of a mountain range is referred to as a rain shadow( Figure 10\u20136) . For example, westerly winds, full of moisture from the Pacific Ocean, Figure 10\u20136 Rain shadow. Moisture-laden air cools as it rises over a mountain range, resulting in high precipitation on the windward slopes. Desert conditions result on the leeward side as the descending air warms and tends to evaporate water from the soil. 10.2 Hydrologic Cycle and Human Impacts 239 50\u02dc 60\u02dc 70\u02dc 80\u02dc 90\u02dc 140\u02dc 150\u02dc 140\u02dc 130\u02dc 120\u02dc 110\u02dc 100\u02dc 90\u02dc 0\u02dc 0\u02dc Equator Equator INDIAN OCEAN 10\u02dc 10\u02dc 10\u02dc 10\u02dc in. 10\u02dc cm 120\u02dc 150\u02dc 160\u02dc 170\u02dc CORAL SEA 20\u02dc 200 and 80 and 20\u02dc 20\u02dc 20\u02dc 20\u02dc20\u02dc over 20\u02dc over20\u02dc Figure 10\u20137 Global precipitation.

Christopherson, Elemental Geosystems, 7th ed., Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River, NJ.) strike the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. As the winds rise over the mountains, water precipitates out, supporting the lush forests on the western slopes. Immediately east of the southern Sierra Nevada, however, lies Death Valley, one of the driest regions of North America. The general patterns of atmospheric circulation and the effects of mountain ranges combine to give great variation in the precipitation reaching the land ( Figure 10\u20137) . The distribution of precipitation in turn largely determines the biomes and ecosystems found in a given region (Chapter 5) . Groundwater As precipitation hits the ground, it may either soak into the ground (infiltration) or run off the surface. The amount that soaks in compared with the amount that runs off is called the infiltration-runoff ratio. Runoff flows over the surface of the ground into streams and rivers, which make their way to the ocean or to inland seas. All the land area that contributes water to a particular stream or river is referred to as the watershed for that stream or river. All ponds, lakes, streams, rivers, and other waters on the surface of Earth are called surface waters. Water that infiltrates has two alternatives (Figure 10\u20133). The water may be held in the soil in an amount that depends on the water-holding capacity of the soil. This water, called capillary water, returns to the atmosphere either by evaporation from the soil or by transpiration through plants (a green water flow). The combination of evaporation and transpiration is referred to as evapotranspiration. The second alternative is percolation (a blue water flow). Infiltrating water that is not held in the soil is called gravitational water because it trickles, or percolates, down through pores or cracks under the pull of gravity. Sooner or later, however, gravitational water encounters an impervious layer of rock or dense clay. It accumulates there, completely filling all the spaces above the impervious layer. This accumulated water is called groundwater, and its upper surface is the water table ( Figure 10\u20133). Gravitational water becomes groundwater when it reaches the water table in the same way that rainwater is called lake water once it hits the surface of a lake. Wells must be dug to depths below the water table. Groundwater, which is free to move, then seeps into the well and fills it to the level of the water table. Recharge. Groundwater will seep laterally as it seeks its lowest level. Where a highway has been cut through rock layers, you can frequently observe groundwater seeping out.", "Layers of porous material through which groundwater moves are called aquifers. It is often difficult to determine the location of an aquifer. Many times these layers of porous rock are found between layers of impervious material, and the entire formation may be folded or fractured in various ways. Thus, groundwater in aquifers may be found at various depths between layers of impervious rock. Also, the recharge area\u2014the area where water enters an aquifer\u2014may be many miles away from where the water leaves the aquifer. Underground aquifers hold some 99% of all liquid freshwater; the rest is in lakes, wetlands, and rivers. Underground Purification. As water percolates through the soil, debris and bacteria from the surface are generally filtered out. However, water may dissolve and leach out certain minerals. Underground caverns, for example, are the result of the gradual leaching away of limestone (calcium carbonate). In most natural situations, the minerals that leach into groundwater are harmless. Thus, groundwater is generally high-quality freshwater that is safe for drinking. A few exceptions occur when the groundwater leaches minerals containing sulfide, arsenic, or other poisonous elements that make the water unsafe to drink. Drawn by gravity, groundwater may move through aquifers until it finds some opening to the surface. These natural exits may be seeps or springs. In a seep, water flows out over a relatively wide area; in a spring, water exits the ground as a significant flow from a relatively small opening. As seeps and springs feed streams, lakes, and rivers, groundwater joins and becomes part of surface water. A spring will flow, however, only if it is lower than the water table. Whenever the water table drops below the level of the spring, the spring will dry up. Groundwater movement constitutes one of the loops in the hydrologic cycle. Loops, Pools, and Fluxes in the Cycle The hydrologic cycle consists of four physical processes: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and gravitational flow. There are three principal loops in the cycle: (1) In the evapotranspiration loop (consisting of green water), the water evaporates and is returned by precipitation. On land, this water\u2014the main source for natural ecosystems and rain-fed agriculture\u2014is held as capillary water and then returns to the atmosphere by way of evapotranspiration. (2) In the surface runoff loop (containing blue water), the water runs across the ground surface and becomes part of the surface water system. (3) In the groundwater loop (also containing blue water), the water infiltrates, percolates down to join the groundwater, and then moves through aquifers, finally exiting through seeps, springs, or wells, where it rejoins the surface water. The surface runoff and groundwater loops are the usual focus for human water resource management. In the hydrologic cycle, there are substantial exchanges of water among the land, the atmosphere, and the oceans; such exchanges are the cycle\u2019s fluxes. Figure 10\u20138 shows estimates of these fluxes and of the sinks that hold water globally. About 97% of the Earth\u2019s water is in the oceans. Each year a volume of water evaporates off of the ocean surface that would cover it to 100 cm deep, about 425,000 cubic kilometers. Additional water evaporates from land and ice. All together the hydrologic cycle annually moves the equivalent of 25 times the water in the Great Lakes. Absent from Figure 10\u20138, however, are the human impacts on the cycle, which are large and growing. Human Impacts on the Hydrologic Cycle A large share of the environmental problems we face today stem from direct or indirect impacts on the water cycle. These impacts can be classified into four categories: (1) changes to Earth\u2019s surface, (2) changes to Earth\u2019s climate, (3) atmospheric pollution, and (4) withdrawals (or diversions) for human use. Changes to the Surface of Earth. Imagine a temperate forest, its trees rooted in thick soil, drawing water from below, sending water up and out leaves, each tree stopping raindrops in a storm, letting them run down the trunk. The soil and leaf litter slow the water, letting it soak in. Then imagine cutting down the trees. What would happen? Put up a parking lot, a strip mall, a highway. Soon, the very processes that make up the water cycle will be altered. Alterations to the land surface stem primarily from removing vegetation, putting down impervious surfaces, and degrading wetlands. Loss of Vegetation. In most natural ecosystems, precipitation is intercepted by vegetation and infiltrates into porous topsoil. From there, water provides the lifeblood of natural and human-created ecosystems.", "As forests are cleared or land is overgrazed and plants are not there to intercept rainfall, the pathway of the water cycle is shifted from infiltration and groundwater recharge to runoff, and the water runs into streams or rivers almost immediately. This causes floods, surface erosion, sediment, and other pollutants. Increased runoff means less infiltration and, therefore, less evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Lowered evapotranspiration means less moisture for local rainfall. The amount of groundwater may be insufficient to keep springs flowing during dry periods. Dry, barren, and lifeless streambeds are typical of deforested regions\u2014a tragedy for both the ecosystems and the humans who are dependent on the flow. Taming Rivers and Wetlands. Wetlands function to store and release water in a manner similar to the way the groundwater reservoir does, only on a shorter time scale. Therefore, the destruction of wetlands has the same impact as deforestation: Flooding is increased, droughts are also increased, and waterways are polluted. In the Midwest, many fields have been provided with underground drainage pipes (tiles) to move water more quickly so the fields can be planted. This action lowers the water table, and the result is predictable: Rainwater is moved more quickly from the land to the rivers to the ocean. Channelizing rivers (by straightening them) has much the same effect (Chapter 7) . 10.2 Hydrologic Cycle and Human Impacts 241 Figure 10\u20139 Impervious surface. Impervious surfaces, such as those of roofs, roads, and parking lots, decrease the amount of water that can go into the soil and recharge groundwater and increase the amount of water and the speed with which water runs off surfaces. Building Impervious Surface. Roads, buildings, parking lots, and other structures cover the soil, so even a slow steady rain cannot infiltrate. 1 In some places, impervious surfaces cover 90% of the land. The lower 48 states have more than 47,000 square miles of impervious surface, bigger than the size of Ohio ( Figure 10\u20139). Dams. One of the chief ways people try to lower flood risk is by building dams. Dams store water and slow the movement of water to the ocean. However, because they are not wetlands, they often do not result in increased groundwater recharge. In dry areas, the pooling of water in reservoirs can leave water exposed to evaporation. Ironically, evaporation from reservoirs can cause regional water loss even when the purpose of building the reservoir was to provide water during drought. Dams also cause some serious ecological problems. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is a good example. Flooding on the Yangtze River took more than 300,000 lives in the 20th century. This fact, combined with a need for power, prompted the building of one of the most spectacular dams in the world, the Three Gorges Dam. Completed in 2006, it is the largest hydroelectric project in the world (in terms of its maximum capacity), holding back 1.4 trillion cubic feet of water and generating as much as 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, as much as the energy produced by burning 50 million tons of coal. The power generated raised the proportion of China\u2019s electricity generated from renewable sources from 7% to 15%. It will, for a time, bring much of the major flood potential of the Yangtze under control. However, the dam has come with a high price. More than 1.3 million people have been displaced and relocated, and another 3 million to 4 million people will be relocated in coming years to make way for the 600-kilometer-long (410-mile-long) reservoir. The reservoir was 30% full in 2014 and is expected to 1Thomas R. Schueler, \u201cThe Importance of Imperviousness,\u201d reprinted in The Practice of Watershed Protection (Ellicott City, MD: Center for Watershed Protection, 2000). be filled in 2017. As it fills, lowering the Yangtze River flow by 50%, saltwater has crept upriver at the mouth of the river, ships have been stranded, pollutants have accumulated, and many fish populations have been reduced due to interference with breeding cycles. Large reservoirs can increase earthquakes, a phenomenon called reservoir-induced seismicity. Between 2003 and 2009, the area around the Three Gorges Dam experienced 3,429 earthquakes, a 30-fold increase over the pre-dam period. In spite of the many drawbacks, Chinese officials continue with the project. Moving Water to the Ocean. Whereas dams slow the movement of water, nearly all other human activities that change the surface of the land cause rainwater to flow to the ocean more quickly and lessen the amount going into groundwater.", "Deforestation, cultivation, the filling of wetlands, and the development of roads and other impervious surfaces increase the rate of runoff and erosion and reduce the rate of infiltration. These actions contribute to both floods and droughts and increase erosion (Chapter 11 ). Floods have always been common. In many parts of the world, however, the frequency and severity of flooding are increasing\u2014not because precipitation is greater, but because land use has changed. One study of floods in 56 developing countries has confirmed the \u201csponge\u201d effect of forests, concluding that continued loss of forests will lead to greater loss of lives and economies for the developing countries where floods are frequent. For example, extreme flooding in Bangladesh (a very flat country only a few feet above sea level) is now more common because the Himalayan foothills in India and Nepal have been deforested. Due to sediment deposited from upriver erosion, the Ganges River basin has risen 5\u20137 meters (15\u201322 ft.) in recent years. Floods are also increasing as a result of climate change. Figure 10\u201310 shows the impact of floods that occurred in southeastern and central Europe in 2014, when thousands of people were displaced. Mitigating Changes to Water Flow. Solutions to water problems caused by land use changes include changes in Figure 10\u201310 Flooding in the Balkans. People were evacuated from their flooded houses in the town of Obrenovac in northern Serbia in 2014 when the region experienced its heaviest rainfall in a century. requirements for new construction. In many places, developers are now required to build flood retention ponds near new construction. Although retention ponds lack the biodiversity of natural wetlands and often contain pollutants, they do stop floods and allow infiltration. The protection of wetlands and river vegetation has been important to slowing run-off. Another solution is to grow more vegetation in cities. Tree-lined streets, green parks, urban gardens, and rooftop plantings can increase soil infiltration and also lower heat. There is also a move to go to new types of surfaces, especially for driveways, that are more environmentally friendly. These solutions will be discussed un der sustainable cities as well (Chapter 23) . Climate Change. There is now unmistakable evidence that Earth\u2019s climate is warming because of the rise in greenhouse gases, and as this occurs, the water cycle is be ing altered (Chapter 18). A warmer climate means more evaporation from land surfaces, plants, and water bodies because evaporation increases with temperature. A wetter atmosphere means more and, frequently, heavier precipitation and more flood events. In effect, global warming is believed to be speeding up the hydrologic cycle. Already, the United States and Canada have experienced a 5\u201310% increase in precipitation over the past century. Regional and local changes are difficult to project; different computer models predict different outcomes for a given region. However, global climate models project a radically changing hydrological world as the 21st century unfolds (Chapter 18 ). The climatologists calculate that a warmer climate will likely generate more hurricanes and more droughts; extended droughts in the western United States are likely to occur more frequently. They also calculate that many of the currently water-stressed areas like East Africa and the Sahel region will get less rainfall, which will bring large agricultural losses (Chapter 12 ). Climate change has two other key impacts on water bodies. First, warm water has a greater volume. Warming the oceans contributes to sea level rise. Second is the movement of water from ice (the cryosphere) to liquid water. Glaciers and polar ice melt, and that water makes its way to the ocean. Both thermal expansion and melting ice contribute to the sea level rise that is already apparent. Melting ice adds freshwater, which is lighter than saltwater and does not mix well. The influx of great volumes of freshwater may affect ocean currents (see Sound Science, What\u2019s New in the Water Cycle?). Models suggest that oceans will rise about 2 to 3 feet (0.8 to 1 m) by 2100. While that does not sound like much, more than 630 million people live in low elevation areas, less than 33 feet (10 m) above sea level. You can imagine that many will have to move and others will experience flooding. Atmospheric Particles. Tiny atmospheric particles (aerosols) form nuclei that enable water to condense into droplets. The more such particles there are, the greater is the tendency for clouds to form.", "Anthropogenic aerosols are on the increase, primarily in the form of sulfates (from sulfur dioxide in coal), carbon (in soot), and dust. They form a brownish 10.2 Hydrologic Cycle and Human Impacts 243 haze that is associated with industrial areas, tropical burning, and dust storms. Their impact on cloud formation is substantial, and where these aerosols occur, solar radiation to Earth\u2019s surface is reduced (so they have a cooling effect). Their most significant impact, however, is on the hydrologic cycle. Because aerosols promote the formation of smaller-than-normal droplets in the clouds, aerosols actually suppress rainfall where they occur in abundance, even though they encourage cloud formation. As they do so, the atmospheric cleansing that would normally clear the aerosols is suppressed, and they remain in the atmosphere longer than usual. With suppressed rainfall comes drier conditions, so more dust and smoke (and more aerosols) are the result. The impact of aerosol pollution is just opposite to the impact of the greenhouse gases on climate and the hydrologic cycle. Again, there are significant differences; the aerosol impact is more local, whereas the impact of greenhouse gases on climate and the hydrologic cycle is more global. In addition, the greenhouse gases are gradually accumulating in the atmosphere, while the aerosols have a lifetime measured in days. Withdrawal for Human Use. Finally, there are many problems related to the fourth impact, diversion and withdrawals of water for human use. We will discuss these impacts next, as we look at how humans try to have enough clean freshwater\u2014and not too much. CONCEPT CHECK Where would you expect to see more green water (water vapor) forming\u2014at the equator or 30 degrees north of the equator? \u2610\u2713 10.3 Water: Getting Enough, Controlling Excess Meeting water needs is a primary goal in our rapidly crowding world. We are seeing both stresses and successes. Between 1990 and 2012, 2 billion people were given access to clean drinking water, an achievement that met the Millennium Development Goal for water. However, water needs are very serious in many countries. According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, in 2005, humans were appropriating about 3,600 cubic kilometers of water per year, which represents 27% of the accessible freshwater runoff on Earth. Annual global withdrawal is expected to rise by about 10% every decade. While the human population tripled in the 20th century, use of water increased sixfold, much of that increase to enable water intensive higher-yielding agriculture. The U.S. Geological Service periodically prepares estimates of major uses of freshwater in the United States ( Table 10\u20132). It is significant that Americans use less water now than they did in 1980, even with population increases (Figure 10\u201311) . Most of the water used in homes and industries is for washing and flushing away unwanted materials, and the water used in electric power production is for taking away waste heat. These are nonconsumptive water uses because the water, though now contaminated with wastes, remains available to humans for the same or other uses if 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000\u02dc 2005 2010 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 Population, in millions Withdrawals, in billion gallons per day Figure 10\u201311 U.S. trends in population and freshwater withdrawals. Since 1980, Americans have been using less freshwater (86% of total water use), even though the population has increased substantially. (Source: Maupin, M. A., J. F. Kenny, S. S. Hutson, J. K. Lovelace, N. L. Barber, and K. S. Linsey. Estimated Use of Water in the United States in 2010 (Circular 1405) (Reston, VA: U.S. Geological Survey, 2014).) Percent of total withdrawals 100 80 60 40 20 0 its quality is adequate or if it can be treated to remove undesirable materials. In contrast, irrigation is a consumptive water use because the applied water does not return to the local water resource. It can only percolate into the ground or return to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. In either case, the water does reenter the overall water cycle but is gone from human control. Worldwide, the largest use of water is for irrigation (70%), second is for industry (20%), and third is for direct human use (10%) (Figure 10\u201312) . These percentages vary greatly from one region to another, depending on precipitation and the degree to which the region is developed. Most increases in withdrawal are due to increases in irrigated lands. In the United States, irrigation accounts for nearly 80% of freshwater consumption.", "Water is also essential for the process of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a water-intensive process for removing natural gas from shale (Chapter 14). Each gas well may require 4\u20136 million gallons of water; this water becomes contaminated with chemicals and remains underground. 2 According to a recent report, 40% of countries rich in shale deposits face water scarcity in their shale-deposit regions. These countries are having to choose between using water for fracking or for human consumption. Sources In the United States, about 25% of domestic water comes from groundwater sources and 75% from surface waters (rivers, lakes, reservoirs). Before municipal water supplies were developed, people drew their water from whatever source they could: wells, rivers, lakes, or rainwater. This approach is still used in rural areas in the developing countries. Women in many of these countries walk long distances each day to fetch water. Because surface waters and shallow wells often receive runoff, they frequently are polluted with various wastes, including animal excrement and human sewage likely to contain pathogens (disease-causing organisms). In 2Reig, P et al. Executive perspective: 40% of shale-rich countries face water stress. World Resources Institute.

World North America Europe Africa Asia South America 10.3 Water: Getting Enough, Controlling Excess 245 Figure 10\u201312 Regional usage of water. The percentage used in each category varies with the climate and relative development of the region. A less developed region with a dry climate (e.g., Africa) uses most of its water for irrigation, whereas an industrialized region (e.g., Europe) requires the largest percentage for industry. (Source: FAO. AQUASTAT database, 2015. Accessed February 19, 2015.) fact, an estimated 90% of wastewater in developing countries is released to surface waters without any treatment. Yet, unsafe as it is, this polluted water is the only water available for an estimated 1.1 billion people in less developed countries (Figure 10\u201313) . According to the UN World Health Organization, contaminated water is responsible for the deaths of more than 1.6 million people in developing countries each year, 90% of whom are children. Increasing water sanitation is part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Technologies. In the industrialized countries, the collection, treatment, and distribution of water are highly developed. Larger municipalities rely primarily on surface-water sources, while smaller water systems tend to use groundwater. In the former, dams are built across rivers to create reservoirs, which hold water in times of excess flow and can be drawn down at times of lower flow. In addition, dams and reservoirs may offer power generation, recreation, and flood control. Figure 10\u201313 Water in the developing world. In many villages and cities of the developing world, people withdraw water from rivers, streams, and ponds. These sources are often contaminated with patho-gens and other pollutants. This Kenyan man is collecting water from a river used by people and animals. Reservoirs created by dams on rivers are also major sources of water for irrigation. In this case, no treatment is required. However, water for municipal use is piped from the reservoir to a treatment plant, where it is treated to kill pathogens and remove undesirable materials, as shown in Figure 10\u201314. After treatment, the water is distributed through the water system to homes, schools, and industries. Wastewater, collected by the sewage system, is carried to a sewage-treatment plant, where it is treated before being discharged into a natural waterway (Chapter 20). Often, wastewater is discharged into the same river from which it was withdrawn, but farther downstream. Whenever possible, both water and sewage systems are laid out so that gravity maintains the flow through the system. This arrangement minimizes pumping costs and increases reliability. On major rivers, such as the Mississippi, water is reused many times. Each city along the river takes water, treats it, uses it, treats it again, and then returns it to the river. In developing nations, the wastewater frequently is discharged with minimal or no treatment. Thus, as the water moves downstream, each city has a higher load of pollutants to contend with than the previous city had, and ecosystems at the end of the line may be severely affected by the pollution. Pollutants include industrial wastes as well as pollutants from households, because industries and residences generally utilize the same water and sewer systems. Smaller public drinking-water systems frequently rely on groundwater, which often may be used with minimal treatment because it has already been purified by percolation through soil.", "More than 1.5 billion people around the world rely on groundwater for their domestic use. Both surface water and groundwater are replenished through the water cycle (Figure 10\u20133 ). Therefore, in theory at least, these two sources of water represent a sustainable or renewable (selfreplenishing) resource, but they are not inexhaustible. Over the past 50 years, groundwater use has outpaced the rate of aquifer recharge in many areas of the world. Is Bottled Water the Answer? One-half of Americans buy bottled water, which is sometimes seen as a solution to limited water availability, particularly after disasters. Sales of bottled water were $12 billion (about 10 billion gallons) in 2013 in the United States alone. Unfortunately, use of bottled water has a number of negative environmental effects. First, the bottling can occur on a large scale in areas where locals also want to use the water. Does a company have the right to pump out millions of gallons of water from an aquifer? This has been disputed. For example, after many years in the courts, in 2009, Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation won a lawsuit to keep Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, Inc., from pumping 400 gallons of water a minute from a groundwater supply in Michigan. The proposed pumping was drying a local stream. Nestl\u00e9 was allowed to pump, but at a reduced rate. Bottled water also requires a great deal of energy, for the making of plastic bottles and the transportation of the product. Overall, bottled water may be good for emergencies but is not a good solution for a lack of drinking water generally. water often returned to same source, further downstream WATER USE agriculture, industry, household SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT 2 Alum aids settling of suspended solids 3 Settling basins allow sludge removal 4 Sand filters water 5 Lime adjusts pH 6 Flouride added Mixing tank Sludge removal Settling basin Sand filter to water storage (a) Water is often taken from a river or reservoir, piped to the (b) At the treatment plant, water is treated to kill pathogens and treatment plant, treated, used, then returned to the source. remove undesirable material. Figure 10\u201314 Municipal water use and treatment. The stages of water treatment are outlined in the figure. Water is taken from a river or reservoir, piped to a treatment plant, treated with chemicals, filtered, adjusted for pH, and stored before being used. Surface Waters Human activities affect the flow of surface water in many ways. Surface waters are diverted for various uses, slowed and held in dams, and moved along swiftly by levees, impervious surfaces, channelized rivers, and the removal of vegetation. Of these activities, the use of dams is the most prominent for keeping and using surface water. Dams and the Environment. To trap and control flowing rivers, more than 48,000 large dams (more than 50 feet high) have been built around the world. Dams together have a storage capacity around 16,000 km3, serving 30\u201340% of the world\u2019s irrigated land and providing 19% of the world\u2019s total electricity supply. Of the 42,600 cubic kilometers of annual runoff in the hydrologic cycle, only 31% is accessible for withdrawal because many rivers are in remote locations and much of the remaining water is required for navigation, flood control, and the generation of hydroelectric power. Sixty-five percent of ocean bound freshwater is stopped by dams at some point. Large dams also have an enormous direct social impact, leading to the displacement of an estimated 40 million to 80 million people worldwide (primarily in China and India) and preventing access by local people to the goods and services of the now-buried ecosystems. Dam Impacts. The United States is home to some 87,000 dams. Of these, 44,000 are taller than 25 feet (7.6 m), and 6,400 are taller than 50 feet (15 m). (Figure 10\u201315) . These have been built to run mills, control floods, generate electric power, and provide water for municipal and agricultural use. These dams have enormous ecological impacts. When a river is dammed, valuable freshwater habitats, such as waterfalls, rapids, and prime fish runs, are lost. When the river\u2019s flow is diverted to cities or croplands, the waterway below the diversion is deprived of that much water. 10.3 Water: Getting Enough, Controlling Excess 247 The impact on fish and other aquatic organisms is obvious, but the ecological ramifications go far beyond the river. Wildlife that depends on the water or on food chains involving aquatic organisms is also adversely affected.", "Wetlands dry up, resulting in frequent die-offs of waterfowl and other wildlife that depended on those habitats. Fish such as salmon, which swim from the ocean far upriver to spawn, are seriously affected by the reduced water level and have problems getting around dams, even those equipped with fish ladders (a stepwise series of pools on the side of the dam, where the water flows in small falls that fish can negotiate). If the fish do get upriver, the hatchlings have similar problems getting back to the ocean. On the Columbia and Snake Rivers, juvenile salmon suffer 95% mortality in their journey to the sea as a result of negotiating the dams and reservoirs that block their way. If a dam floods an area with dense vegetation, the water may become seriously polluted. Decaying vegetation alters water chemistry and causes pollutants such as mercury to leave the soil. This has been a tremendous problem with dams in tropical rain forests. The Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River is an example of a large dam with significant environmental effects. The dam provides hydropower and created the second largest artificial lake in America: Lake Powell. An environmental impact study in the late 1980s and early 1990s concluded that the operation of the Glen Canyon Dam had seriously damaged the downstream ecology of the Colorado River and its recreational resources (hiking, river rafting). In response, Congress passed the Grand Canyon Protection Act in 1992, which required a process of \u201cadaptive management\u201d that would adjust water-release rates in a manner designed to enhance the ecological and recreational values of the river. This rule has helped balance the needs of different stakeholders. Dams Gone. Increasingly, people are recognizing the environmental costs of dams and finding them to be unacceptable. Figure 10\u201315 Number of dams in the United States. Each point represents a dam; the colors tell the height. (Source: National Inventory of Dams Map.) 0 \u2212 25 25 \u2212 50 50 \u2212 100 100 \u2212 808 NID by Height (ft.) (a) (b) Figure 10\u201316 Removal of a dam. (a) The Glines Canyon Dam on the Elwah River in Washington State. (b) Its 2014 removal was the largest dam removal yet in the United States. Gray sediment from behind the dam rushed downstream and reconfigured the river. Dam removal allowed salmon to spawn upstream. Removing a dam is not easy, however. Legal complexities abound where long-existing uses of a dam (to control floods or to provide irrigation water or water for recreation) conflict with the expected advantages of removal (to reestablish historic fisheries such as salmon and steelhead runs or to restore the river for recreational and aesthetic use). Practical problems also exist. Yet in the last 20 years, 850 dams have been removed from streams and rivers in the United States. Figure 10\u201316 shows the successful removal of a dam on the Elwha River in Washington State. Diversion of Surface Water. Humans often divert water, or move it to other places. Small-scale diversions include moving water though ditches or canals to irrigate fields. Although easy to use, irrigation ditches increase evaporation and often allow water to leak out of the ditch. In some places, disease vectors such as mosquitoes breed in irrigation ditches. Other diversions move water over long distances. For example, the Chinese government is in the process of building the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, which will carry water from the Yangtze River and from rivers south of Beijing to the arid north. Initial flows began in 2014; eventually the diversion will carry 28 cubic kilometers (6.7 mi.3) of water per year. China has discovered already, though, that large water diversion projects can bring unexpected environmental costs, including water pollution or the effects of water loss in the original rivers and lakes. Impacts on Estuaries. When river waters are diverted on their way to the sea, serious impacts are seen in estuaries\u2014 bays and rivers in which freshwater mixes with seawater. Estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth; they are rich breeding grounds for many species of fish, shellfish, and waterfowl. As a river\u2019s flow is diverted (say, to irrigate fields), less freshwater enters and flushes the estuary. Consequently, the salt concentration increases, profoundly affecting the estuary\u2019s ecology. This is exactly what is happening in San Francisco Bay, where the San Joachin and Sacramento Rivers meet and flow to the ocean.", "More than 60% of the freshwater that once flowed from rivers into the bay has been diverted for irrigation in the Central Valley (home to one sixth of all U.S. irrigated land) and for municipal use in southern California (25 million people served). In dry years, the farms and municipalities remove a third of the water that would normally flow through the delta into San Francisco Bay. Without the freshwater flows, saltwater from the Pacific has intruded into the bay, with devastating consequences. Chinook salmon runs have almost disappeared. Sturgeon, Dungeness crab, and striped bass populations are greatly reduced. Exotic species of plants and invertebrates have replaced many native species, and the tidal wetlands have been reduced to only 8% of their former extent. Upriver from the bay, more than a thousand miles of levees protect farmlands that have sunk 20 feet or more below sea level due to compacting. If the levees were to collapse during an earthquake, massive amounts of saltwater would be sucked upriver, shutting down the huge pumps that divert freshwater to the cities and farms. In response to these problems, the CALFED Bay-Delta Program was established, to develop a long-term comprehensive plan that will restore ecological health in the Bay-Delta System. However, major stakeholders (farmers, government agencies, environmental groups) have not been able to agree on changes to the delta recommended by scientists. The problem is not limited to the United States. The southeastern end of the Mediterranean Sea was formerly flushed by water from the Nile River. Because this water is now held back and diverted for irrigation by the Aswan High Dam in Egypt, that part of the Mediterranean is suffering severe ecological consequences (such as severe coastal erosion) as sediments normally flowing out to the coast are kept behind the dam. 10.3 Water: Getting Enough, Controlling Excess 249 (b) (c) Figure 10\u201317 Exploitation of an aquifer. (a) Pumping up water from the Ogallala aquifer has made this arid region of the United States into some of the most productive farmland in the country. (b) Water is applied by means of center-pivot irrigation, in which the water is pumped from a central well to a self-powered boom that rotates around the well, spraying water as it goes. (c) An aerial photograph shows the extent of center-pivot irrigation throughout the region. Groundwater depletion will bring an end to this kind of farming. Groundwater Groundwater is the large unseen storage of water that accumulated slowly in porous rock over millennia. As mentioned before, some 99% of all liquid freshwater is in underground aquifers. Of this groundwater, more than three-fourths has a recharge rate of centuries or more. Such groundwater is considered \u201cnonrenewable.\u201d Because groundwater supplies are vital for domestic use and especially for agriculture, they are a resource that requires management. Groundwater Levels. The agriculture of the Midwestern United States makes the country the breadbasket for the world. Water to support that agriculture is mined from deep underground. Within the seven-state High Plains region of the United States, the Ogallala aquifer supplies irrigation water to 4.2 million hectares (10.4 million acres), one-fifth of the irrigated land in the nation (Figure 10\u201317) . This aquifer is probably the largest in the world, but it is mostly \u201cfossil water,\u201d recharged during the last ice age. The recent withdrawal rate has been about 10.2 billion cubic meters (8.3 million acre-ft.) per year, only one-tenth of the recharge rate. Water tables have dropped 30\u201360 meters (100\u2013200 ft.) and continue to drop. Total depletion of the aquifer is greater than 340 cubic kilometers, a volume larger than the amount of water needed to cover New Mexico to a depth of 1 kilometer (about 2/3 mile). Irrigated farming has already come to a halt in some sections, and it is predicted that over the next 20 years another 1.2 million hectares (3 million acres) in this region will be abandoned or converted to dryland farming (ranching and the production of forage crops) because of water depletion. Figure 10\u201318, on the next page, depicts the overuse of water from several of the world\u2019s major aquifers. Renewable groundwater is replenished by the percolation of precipitation water, so it is vulnerable to variations in precipitation. In tapping groundwater, we are tapping large, but not unlimited, natural reservoirs, contained within specific aquifer systems. Its sustainability ultimately depends on balancing withdrawals with rates of recharge. For most of the groundwater in arid regions, there is essentially no recharge. The resource must be considered nonrenewable.", "Like oil, it can be removed, but any water removed today will be unavailable for the future. Groundwater depletion has several undesirable consequences. Aquifer area/ Groundwater footprint >20 10\u221220 5\u221210 1\u22125 <1 Groundwaterstress Figure 10\u201318 Use of groundwater. The map shows the size and shape of the major aquifers used in agriculture. Aquifers in blue have a withdrawal rate of less than 1, which means their water is being used at a sustainable rate. Below the map are groundwater footprints for six major aquifers from which water is being withdrawn more rapidly than it is being replenished. Footprints show the amount of land that would be needed to replace the water that is being withdrawn. For the large aquifers shown, the groundwater footprint was 3.5 times the size of the aquifers. (Source: T. Gleeson et al. \u201cWater balance of global aquifers revealed by groundwater footprint.\u201d Nature 488, 197\u2013200.) UNDERSTANDING THE DATA Which of the highlighted aquifers appears to have the most overdrawn water supply? (You may select one or two.) How can you tell? Falling Water Tables. The simplest indication that groundwater withdrawals are exceeding recharge is a falling water table, a situation that is common throughout the world. Because irrigation consumes far and away the largest amount of freshwater, depleting water resources will ultimately have its most significant impact on crop production. Although running out of water is the obvious eventual conclusion of overdrawing groundwater, falling water tables can bring on other problems. Diminishing Surface Water. Surface waters are affected by falling water tables. In various wetlands, for instance, the water table is essentially at or slightly above the ground surface. When water tables drop, these wetlands dry up, with the ecological results described earlier. Further, as water tables drop, springs and seeps dry up as well, diminishing even streams and rivers to the point of dryness. Thus, excessive groundwater removal creates the same results as the diversion of surface water. Land Subsidence. Over the ages, groundwater has leached cavities in the ground. Where these spaces are filled with water, the water helps support the overlying rock and soil. As the water table drops, however, this support is lost. Then there may be a gradual settling of the land, a phenomenon known as land subsidence. The rate of sinking may be 10\u201315 centimeters (6\u201312 in.) per year. In some areas of the San Joaquin Valley in California, land has settled as much as 9 meters (29 ft.) because of groundwater removal. Land subsidence causes building foundations, roadways, and water and sewer lines to crack. When it happens in cities, underground pipes break, causing leaks and wasting domestic water. Sewage pipes can also fracture, contaminating the groundwater. In coastal areas, subsidence causes flooding unless levees are built for protection. For example, where a 10,000-square-kilometer (4,000-mi.2) area in the Houston\u2013 Galveston Bay region of Texas is gradually sinking because of groundwater removal, coastal properties are being abandoned as they are gradually being inundated by the sea. More than 80% of land subsidence in the United States results from groundwater withdrawal. Land subsidence is also a serious problem in many other places throughout the world. Another kind of land subsidence, a sinkhole, may develop suddenly and dramatically (Figure 10\u201319) . A sinkhole results when an underground cavern, drained of its supporting groundwater, suddenly collapses. Sinkholes may be 10.3 Water: Getting Enough, Controlling Excess 251 300 feet (91 m) across and as deep as 150 feet. The problem of sinkholes is particularly severe in the southeastern United States, where groundwater has leached numerous passageways and caverns through ancient beds of underlying limestone. An estimated 4,000 sinkholes have formed in Alabama alone, some of which have \u201cconsumed\u201d buildings, livestock, and sections of highways. Saltwater Intrusion. Another problem resulting from dropping water tables is saltwater intrusion. In coastal regions, springs of outflowing groundwater may lie under the ocean. As long as a high water table maintains a sufficient head of pressure in the aquifer, freshwater will flow into the ocean. Thus, wells near the ocean yield freshwater (Figure 10\u201320a) . However, lowering the water table or removing groundwater at a rapid rate may reduce the pressure in the aquifer, permitting saltwater to flow back into the aquifer and hence into wells (Figure 10\u201320b) . Saltwater intrusion is a serious problem in many European countries along the Mediterranean coast. CONCEPT CHECK What are the positive effects of using dams to control the flow of rivers? What are some of the negative effects?", "\u2610\u2713 Figure 10\u201320 Saltwater intrusion. In coastal areas, the removal of groundwater for human use can result in saltwater intrusion, which may make the water in the aquifer unfit for drinking. (a) Where aquifers open into the ocean, freshwater is maintained in the aquifer by the pressure of freshwater inland. (b) Excessive removal of water may reduce the pressure so that saltwater moves into the aquifer. Figure 10\u201319 Sinkhole. The removal of groundwater may drain an underground cavern until the roof, no longer supported by water pres-sure, collapses. The result is the sudden development of a sinkhole, such as this one, which appeared in Plant City, Florida, on May 29, 2000. 10.4 Water Stewardship, Economics, and Policy The hydrologic cycle is entirely adequate to meet human needs for freshwater because it processes several times as much water as we require today. However, the water is often not distributed where it is most needed, and the result is a persistent scarcity of water in many parts of the world. In the developing countries, there is still a deficit of infrastructure, such as wells, water-treatment systems, and (sometimes) large dams, for capturing and distributing safe drinking water. Despite the growing negative impacts of overdrawing water resources, expanding populations create an ever-increasing demand for additional water for agriculture, industry, and municipal use. Water for food dominates the current water demand, estimated at 6,800 cubic kilometers per year. Of this, some 5,000 cubic kilometers are used as green water flow in the world\u2019s rain-fed agriculture and 1,800 cubic kilometers as blue water flow in the form of irrigation water withdrawn from rivers, lakes, and groundwater. It is estimated that 4,500 cubic kilometers (of the total 6,800 km3) are attributed to the developing countries to fulfill current food needs. If we assume that virtually all of the future population increase will be in the developing countries, then so also will be the increased need for food. What are the possibilities for meeting existing needs and growing demands in a sustainable way? Planners call for a Blue Revolution, a radical change in the way we use water. There are only about five options: (1) capture more of the runoff water, (2) gain better access to existing groundwater aquifers, (3) desalt seawater, (4) conserve present supplies by using less water, and (5) make food production more efficient. We will now consider the advantages and disadvantages of these options. Capturing Runoff In some situations, people increase their supply of water by capturing rainwater before it reaches the land. For example, families may use rain barrels to capture runoff from their roofs. This water is often used for gardens. In regions with large seasonal fluctuations in rainfall and on islands with little groundwater, towns and villages may capture and store rainwater in large receptacles called cisterns (Figure 10\u201321) . Dams are the most widely used method of capturing surface water. China is the best example of both the pros and cons of dam building, which we have already discussed. In an effort to provide hydropower while cutting greenhouse gas emissions, China has committed to an aggressive program of dam building. New dam projects threaten China\u2019s remaining biodiversity. In the United States, protection has been accorded to some rivers with the passage of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which keeps rivers designated as \u201cwild and scenic\u201d from being dammed or affected by other harmful operations. The national system of wild and scenic rivers protects some 12,600 miles of our nation\u2019s rivers, less than 0.2% of the total length. The numerous large and small dams across the country have affected some 600,000 miles of our rivers, by comparison. Those rivers designated as wild and scenic are in many ways equivalent to national parks. 3 Figure 10\u201321 A water catchment system. This house in Caye Caulker, Belize, diverts rainwater that falls on its roof into a black cistern, where it is stored for later use. Tapping More Groundwater Already, more than 2 billion people depend on groundwater supplies. In many areas, groundwater use exceeds aquifer recharge, leading to shortages as the water table drops below pump levels. Groundwater depletion is considered the single greatest threat to irrigated agriculture, and it is happening in many parts of the world. India, China, West Asia, countries of the former Soviet Union, the western United States, and the Arabian Peninsula are all experiencing declining water tables.", "Calculations by the International Water Management Institute suggest that an expansion of irrigation on the order of 20% might be possible, but this will not meet the food needs in the developing countries by 2030. 4 Exploiting renewable groundwater will continue to be an option, but it is unlikely to provide great increases in water supply because these same sustainable supplies, recharged by annual precipitation, are being increasingly polluted. Agricultural chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides, animal wastes, and industrial chemicals readily enter groundwater, making groundwater pollution as much of a threat to domestic water use as depletion. For example, some 60,000 square kilometers of aquifers in western and central Europe will likely be contaminated with pesticides and fertilizers within the next 50 years. Also, India and Bangladesh are plagued with arsenic-contaminated groundwater, which has extracted a heavy toll in sickness and death for millions in those countries. 3\u201cWild and Scenic Rivers: Leading the Charge to Protect the Nation\u2019s Last, Best Rivers,\u201d American Rivers (September 2012), http://www.americanrivers.org/ our-work/protecting-rivers/wild-and-scenic/. 4M. Falkenmark and J. Rockstr, \u201cThe New Blue and Green Water Paradigm: Breaking Ground for Water Resources Planning and Management,\u201d Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management 132 (May/June 2006): 131. Removing Salt from Seawater The world\u2019s oceans are an inexhaustible source of water, not only because they are vast, but also because any water removed from them will ultimately flow back in. Not many plants can be grown in full seawater, however, and although researchers are developing salt-tolerant plants via genetic modification, we are not there yet. Thus, with increasing water shortages and most of the world\u2019s population living near coasts, there is a growing trend toward desalination (desalting) of seawater for domestic use. Between 15,000 and 20,000 desalination plants have been installed in some 150 countries, especially in the Middle East. From 2008 to 2013, the worldwide desalination capacity increased by 57%, largely as a result of responses to water shortages. Two technologies\u2014microfiltration, or reverse osmosis, and distillation\u2014are commonly used for desalination. Smaller desalination plants generally employ microfiltration, in which great pressure forces seawater through a membrane filter that is fine enough to remove the salt. Larger facilities, particularly those that can draw from a source of waste heat (for example, from electrical power plants), generally use distillation (evaporation and condensation of vapor). Efficiency is gained by using the heat given off by condensing water to heat the incoming water. Even where waste heat is used, however, the costs of building and maintaining the plant, which is subject to corrosion from seawater, are considerable. The cost of desalinized water can be two to four times what most city dwellers in the United States currently pay, but it is still not a high price to pay for drinking water in areas of the world that are prone to drought; it is also much cheaper than bottled water. In January 2008, the Tampa Bay seawater desalination plant was completed, signaling a new day for desalination (Figure 10\u201322) . The plant is the country\u2019s first ever built to serve as a primary water source. The plant uses salty cooling water from a power plant and reverse osmosis to produce 25 million gallons of drinking water per day, providing Pasco County, Pinellas County, St. Petersburg, and other cities with some 10% of their drinking water. The Tampa Bay region has experienced chronic water shortages and is exploiting an opportunity that has attracted worldwide attention. The largest desalination plant in the United States is the Carlsbad plant in southern California. Built between 2014 and 2016, it was designed to produce 50 million gallons of water per day for the San Diego area. Long-term drought in California and the increased efficiency of desalination technology made this reasonable. However, concerns about the plant\u2019s environmental impacts\u2014especially its high use of energy and its effects on fish\u2014remain. Although the higher cost might cause some people to cut back on watering lawns and to implement other conservation measures, most people in the United States could afford desalinized water without unduly altering their lifestyles. For irrigating croplands, however, the higher cost of desalinized seawater would probably be prohibitive, except possibly for 10.4 Water Stewardship, Economics, and Policy 253 Figure 10\u201322 Desalination plant. The Israel A shkelon Seawater desalination plant is the largest reverse osmosis desalination plant in the world, producing 330,000 cubic meters of drinking water per day. high-value cash crops such as greenhouse flowers or vegetables. Water conservation, which we will discuss next, is much more cost effective than desalination.", "Using Less Water A developing-nation family living where water must be carried several miles from a well finds that one gallon per person per day is sufficient to provide for all of its essential needs, including cooking and washing. Yet, a typical household in the United States consumes an average of 380 liters (100 gal.) per person per day. If all indirect uses are added (especially irrigation), this figure increases to 4,200 liters (1,100 gal.) per person per day. Similarly, a peasant farmer may irrigate by carefully ladling water onto each plant with a dipper, while typical modern irrigation floods the whole field. The way water resource planners think is beginning to change, however: Instead of asking how much water we \u201cneed\u201d and where can we get it, people are now asking how much water is available and how can we best use it. In the United States, the rate of water use per capita has actually begun to drop, the result of some well-needed water conservation strategies already put in place. Some specific measures that are being implemented to reduce water withdrawals are described next. (Also see Stewardship, The Energy-Water-Food Trade: Waste One, Waste Them All.) Agriculture. Agriculture is far and away the largest consumer of freshwater\u2014some 40% of the world\u2019s food is grown in irrigated soils, which produce 100\u2013400% higher yields than traditional farming. Most present-day irrigation wastes huge amounts of water, and in fact, half of it never yields any food. Where irrigation water is applied by traditional flood or center-pivot systems, 30\u201350% is lost to evaporation, percolation, or runoff. Several strategies have been employed recently to cut down on this waste. One is the surge flow method, in which computers control the periodic release of water, in contrast to the continuous-flood method. Surge flow can cut water use in half. Drip, Drip. Another water-saving method is the drip irrigation system, a network of plastic pipes with pinholes that literally drip water at the base of each plant (Figure 10\u201323) . Although such systems are costly, they waste much less water. Also, they have the added benefit of retarding salinization (see Chapter 11 ). Studies have shown that drip irrigation can reduce water use 30\u201370%, while actually increasing crop yields, compared with traditional flooding methods. Although drip irrigation is spreading worldwide, especially in arid lands such as Israel and Australia, 97% of the irrigation in the United States, and 99% throughout the world, is still done by traditional flood or center-pivot methods. The reason that so few U.S. farms have changed over to drip irrigation systems is that it costs about $1,000 per acre to install them. In comparison, water for irrigation is heavily subsidized by the government, so farmers pay next to nothing for it. One recent U.S. program that was designed to save water backfired. Between 1996 and 2013, the federal government spent $1 billion to help farmers install more efficient irrigation equipment, expecting that the new equipment would save water. Instead, farmers expanded the amount of land under irrigation or planted crops that required more water. As a result, water supplies were not conserved. 5 Treadle Pumps. In the developing countries, irrigation often bypasses the rural poor, who are at the greatest risk for hunger and malnutrition. Affordable irrigation technologies such as treadle pumps can be remarkably successful (Figure 10\u201324) . In Bangladesh, low-cost treadle pumps enable farmers to irrigate their rice paddies and vegetable fields at a cost of less than $35 a system. The pump is worked with 5R. Nixon, \u201cFarm subsidies lead to more water use,\u201d New York Times (June 7, 2013) http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/us/irrigation-subsidies-leading-to-more water-use.html?_r=1 Figure 10\u201323 Drip irrigation. Irrigation consumes the most water. Drip irrigation offers a conservative method of applying water. the feet like a step exercise machine, is locally manufactured, and has been adopted by millions. The irrigation it affords makes it possible for farmers to irrigate small plots during dry seasons from groundwater lying just a few feet below the surface. More than 1.5 million treadle pumps have been sold in Bangladesh alone, increasing the productivity of more than 600,000 acres of farmland there. The pumps are now also in use in India, Nepal, Myanmar, Cambodia, Zambia, Kenya, and South Africa. Enhance Soil Water Retention. We have already addressed the need and options for improvement in irrigation technology. However, most of the agriculture in developing countries is rain-fed, depending on green water flow from soil and resulting in evapotranspiration.", "Further, most of the soils are dryland soils, receiving only 10 to 30 inches of rainfall per year ( Chapter 11 ). Crops raised on these soils are characteristically low in yield. Storing the seasonal rainfall with check dams (small rock or raised soil dams across seasonal water courses) increases yields. These dams recharge aquifers, restrain soil erosion, and provide for some irrigation water. Another strategy is to enhance rainfall retention, maintain soil fertility, and restrain soil erosion through conservation tillage, where crop residues are left in place and new crops are planted with little or no tilling. Figure 10\u201324 Treadle pump. This treadle pump in Zambia is operated like a step exercise machine. Millions of these pumps now allow rural farmers to raise crops during dry seasons. 10.4 Water Stewardship, Economics, and Policy 255 Municipal Systems. The 100 gallons of water each person consumes per day in modern homes are used mostly for washing and removing wastes\u2014that is, for flushing toilets (3\u20135 gallons per flush), taking showers (2\u20133 gallons per minute), doing laundry (20\u201330 gallons per wash), and so on. Watering lawns, filling swimming pools, and other indirect consumption only adds to this use. Water conservation has long been promoted as a \u201csave the environment\u201d measure, though without much effect. STEWARDSHIP Now, numerous cities are facing the stark reality that it will be extremely expensive\u2014and in many cases, impossible\u2014to increase supplies by the traditional means of building more reservoirs or drilling more wells. The only practical alternative, they are discovering, is to take real steps toward reducing water consumption and waste. Aging Infrastructure. In the United States, much of the water-delivery infrastructure built after World War II is coming to the end of its life and needs to be replaced. In many cities, water leaks out of aging pipes and land subsidence breaks underground water mains. Aging infrastructure is one of the biggest challenges in national water provision because of the high cost of replacing buried pipes. Lawns. Grass is the most heavily irrigated crop. Cities in Arizona are paying homeowners to replace their lawns with xeriscaping\u2014landscaping with desert species that require no additional watering\u2014and the business is thriving. Many cities and towns ban certain uses of water when droughts reduce the available supply. A Flush World. In 1997, the last phase of a regulation authorized by the 1992 National Energy Act took effect, and it became illegal to sell 6-gallon commodes. In their place is the wonder of the flush world: the 1.6-gallon toilet. Newer versions use even less water than the first, less effective low-flow toilets; the newest work perfectly well and save 10 gallons or more a day per person. In fact, the newest models are dual flush, with options for a 1.28gallon (solids) or 0.8-gallon (liquids) flush. According to a recent estimate, U.S. regulations requiring the use of low-flow toilets have saved 18 trillion gallons of water over 20 years. 6 Los Angeles is offering the low-flow toilets free as part of its efforts to restore Mono Lake, which had lost a great deal of water. In 2011, the City of San Francisco found the downside of low-flow toilets: While the city had saved 20 million gallons of water a year (just from toilets!), the low-flow toilets weren\u2019t pushing the sewage through the pipes as quickly as before. To solve the problem, city engineers are planning to kill bacteria with chemicals, though other solutions have been identified. Gray Water. It seems wasteful to raise all domestic water to drinking-water standards and then use most of it to water lawns and flush toilets. Increasingly, gray water recycling systems are being adopted in some water-short areas. Gray water, the slightly dirtied water from sinks, showers, bathtubs, and laundry tubs, is collected in a holding tank and used for such things as flushing toilets, watering lawns, and washing cars. Going further, a number of cities are using treated wastewater (sewage water) for irrigating golf courses and landscapes, both to conserve water and to abate the pollution of receiving waters (see Chapter 20). In Israel, 70% of treated wastewater is reused for irrigation of nonfood crops. If the idea of reusing sewage water turns you off, recall that all water is recycled by nature. There is hardly a molecule of water you drink that has not moved through organisms\u2014including humans\u2014numerous times. A number of communities are already treating their wastewater so thoroughly that its quality exceeds what many cities take in from lakes and rivers. Virtual Water.", "Another option for reducing water loss in water-stressed regions is to import food or goods that require a great deal of water, to ship virtual water, as it is called. Many arid countries avoid using their own water supplies by importing farm products from regions that have 6\u201c18 Trillion Gallons of Water Saved During 20 Years of Low-Flow Toilet Regulations,\u201d available at http://www.americanstandard-us.com/pressroom/18-trillion gallons-of-water-saved-during-20-years-of-low-flow-toilet-regulations/. excess freshwater. Indeed, an estimated 800 cubic kilometers of virtual water are traded yearly in the form of foodstuffs. However, many of the arid countries are also economically poor and have a limited ability to purchase great quantities of food. Furthermore, shipping takes energy, and as we have seen, wasting energy is eventually bad for water, too. Consumers can help conserve water by purchasing products that have a low water footprint, a way of calculating the amount of water used to produce goods and services. The production of meat, for example, almost always has a larger water footprint than the production of grains or locally grown vegetables. Products that are heavily packaged or transported across the world require large water inputs. You can figure out your water footprint by using one of the calculators on the Web. Water footprints are sometimes divided into three parts: green water (rainwater), blue water (diverted surface water or pumped groundwater), and gray water (water required to dilute a pollutant to an acceptable level). Public-Policy Challenges The hydrologic cycle provides a finite flow of water through each region of Earth. When humans come on the scene, this flow is inevitably divided between the needs of the existing natural ecosystems and the agricultural, industrial, and domestic needs of humans, with the latter usually being met first. Researchers have estimated that humans now use 26% of total terrestrial evapotranspiration and 54% of accessible precipitation runoff. We are major players in the water cycle, but many facets of our water use are unsustainable. It takes public policy to strike a sustainable balance between competing water needs, and this is often sadly lacking. Conflict. Maintaining a supply of safe drinking water for people is a high-priority issue. In addition, water for irrigation is vital to food production across much of the world. Often, these two demands come into conflict, generating what have been referred to as \u201cwater wars.\u201d One example was in Cochabamba, Bolivia, when the World Bank refused to renew loans unless the country opened water resources to foreign privatization. Investors were supposed to put money into providing clean drinking water, but some locals found they lost access to water and rates skyrocketed. This led to protests and the government eventually had to change plans. Figure 10\u201325 depicts protesters in California after a federal judge ordered that less water could be pumped from the Sacramento Delta. This ruling pitted environmentalists against farmers and urban residents in a state with continual water stress. National Water Policy. Many countries have addressed their water resources and water needs with a national policy; not so the United States. The Clean Water Act and subsequent amendments authorize the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop programs and rules to carry out its mandate for oversight of the nation\u2019s water quality (considered in Chapter 20). The EPA, however, does not deal with water quantity. There is no federal agency to provide similar oversight for the water quantity issues discussed in this chapter. 10.4 Water Stewardship, Economics, and Policy 257 Peter Gleick, a leading expert on global freshwater resources, addresses this public-policy need, pointing out that most water policy decisions in the United States are made at local and regional levels. 7 National policies, however, are needed to guide these lower-level decisions and also to deal with interstate issues and federally managed resources. The last time a water policy report was issued was in 1950, when President Harry S. Truman established a water resources policy commission and the commission gave its report. This commission needs to be revived or a new one needs to be established, and in either case, it must be given a mandate to collect data on water resources and problems and issue recommendations on how the federal government could facilitate water stewardship in the 21st century. Key Issues. Any water resources policy commission needs to address several key ideas. Two of these are increasing efficiency and stopping subsidies. In the United States, scarcity and rising costs have led to significant gains in efficiency.", "As a result, water withdrawals peaked in the early 1980s and have leveled off since then (Figure 10\u201311). This change has been attributed to steps taken in all three sectors (domestic, industry, and irrigation) to reduce water losses. The United States still has a high per capita water use compared with the rest of the world. Also, water subsidies need to be reduced or eliminated. Policy makers have persistently subsidized water resources, especially for agricultural use, and the result has been enormous waste and inefficiencies. Various policy approaches to water protection are possible, such as permit fees, \u201cgreen\u201d taxes, direct charges, and market-based trading (see Chapter 20). Public policy needs to focus on the watershed level as well. Watershed management must be integrated into the pricing of water. The City of New York, for example, found out that every dollar it invested in 7Peter H. Gleick, \u201cGlobal Water: Threats and Challenges Facing the United States,\u201d Environment 43 (March 2001): 18\u201326. watershed management paid off handsomely, saving as much as $200 for new treatment facilities. One part of managing watersheds is to regulate dam operations so that river flow is maintained in a way that simulates natural flow regimes. When this happens, rivers below dams can sustain recreational fisheries and other uses, and the natural biota flourishes. Finally, the United States must respond to the global water crisis with adequate levels of international development aid. By achieving the Millennium Development Goal of reducing by half the 1.1 billion people without access to safe drinking water, the world is saving millions of lives and billions of dollars annually. The next global effort regarding water will be to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. International Action. The decade from 2005 to 2015 was designated the UN International Decade for Action: Water for Life. An agency called UN Water coordinated the decade\u2019s activities, addressing issues such as coping with water scarcity and pollution, empowering women and girls in water and sanitation, and managing water across boundaries. Every few years, there is an international meeting called the World Water Forum; the most recent was held in the Republic of Korea in 2015. With a large proportion of the developing world already experiencing shortages of clean water or water for agriculture, the population increases and pressure to develop these countries\u2019 resources that are certain to come in the next few decades will undoubtedly subject hundreds of millions to increased water stress. The problem is not that the Earth contains too little freshwater; rather, it is that we have not yet learned to manage the water that our planet provides.

Chapter 11 Learning Objectives 11.1 Soil and Plants: Describe the basic parts of soil, soil communities, and soil profiles. 11.2 Soil Degradation: Explain how soils are degraded by human activities, including over-cultivation, overgrazing, deforestation, mining, and killing soil biota. 11.3 Conserving and Restoring Soil: Describe how soil conservation requires action at different levels, from individual landholders through national and international public policy. Soil: The Foundation for Land Ecosystems \u201cThe nation that destroys its soil, destroys itself.\u201d \u2014Franklin D. Roosevelt 1 A churning wall of soil, two miles high, bore across the plains. People caught outside fled for buildings, cloths held to their faces. Some faced with the blinding swirl lost their way and died, suffocated by dust. Dust was everywhere, driven by the howling winds: blinding, choking, filling cracks and windows. People wept, prayed, cried, despaired; the apocalypse had come. The day was Black Sunday, April 14, 1935. The dust storm was the worst of the \u201cblack blizzards\u201d in the tragic period we call the American Dust Bowl. The almost-decade-long period of drought and dry storms was arguably the longest and worst environmental disaster in U.S. history.", "The storms carried tons of soil across seven states and left devastation in their wake. Some people fled the dust states or died. Others stayed and survived, only to find themselves coughing and sickly when storm after storm filled the air with dust, victims of a disorder called \u201cdust pneumonia.\u201d The Dust Bowl Begins. A drought beginning in 1931 precipitated the disaster. By 1934, the drought was profound: More than 75% of the country was in drought, and 27 states were severely affected. Although drought was the trigger, human policies and practices made the Dust Bowl worse. Rising wheat and cotton prices encouraged people to plant more and more land, even in areas more suited to ranging animals. During wet years, crops were bountiful, but plowing broke through the tough roots of prairie plants that held soil together, broke open the ground, 1Letter, February 26, 1937, to state governors. Available at http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=15373. A 2014 dust storm in Yuma, Arizona showed just a tiny picture of what the 1930s Dust Bowl was like. 11.1 Soil and Plants 261 and laid the dirt open to be carried away by the winds. Lack of trees or other windbreaks allowed soil to move freely. By 1935, estimates were that 850 million tons of topsoil had been blown off of the southern plains in that year alone. By the end of the Dust Bowl, many areas had lost 75% of their topsoil, once some of the richest soil in the world. The Homestead Act of 1862, which enabled settlers to claim land and settle it, played a role in the disaster. By encouraging hundreds of thousands of small farms (160 to 320 acres) to be established between 1880 and 1920, the act ensured that too much land was cultivated in some areas of the country. Small farm owners were unlikely to let land lie fallow, diversify into pasture, plant crops with strips of vegetation in between, or farm less intensively. These homesteads were more vulnerable to financial ruin during drought. Homesteaders fled the southern plains in the largest migration in American history, described by John Steinbeck in his novel The Grapes of Wrath. A dust storm that hit Phoenix, Arizona, on July 3, 2014, gave only the tiniest glimpse of such storms to modern Americans. With wind speeds of 50 miles per hour, clouds towered and airlines canceled flights. A s was the case in the \u201830s, an ongoing regional drought contributed to the severity of the storm. Even so, the Phoenix storm did not rival the great dust storms of the Depression. Storms as severe as those in the Depression are rare now, in part because of better soil protection practices and the movement away from more intensive cultivation of marginal lands. Around the world, however, loss of soil continues to plague farmland and contribute to poor crops, water pollution, and the spread of deserts. Past Neglect. Ninety percent of the world\u2019s food comes from land-based agricultural systems, and the percentage is growing as the ocean\u2019s fish and natural ecosystems are 11.1 Soil and Plants Soil can be defined as solid material of geological and biological origin that is changed by chemical, biological, and physical processes, giving it the ability to support plant growth. A rich soil is much more than the dirt you might get out of any hole in the ground. Indeed, agriculturists cringe when anyone refers to soil as \u201cdirt.\u201d The quality of soil can make the difference between harvesting an abundant crop and abandoning a field to weeds. In addition to supporting the growth of crops, soil serves as a filter for water and plays key roles in Earth\u2019s nutrient cycles and in the exchange of atmospheric gases. Soil scientists still have a great deal to learn about soil (Figure 11\u20131) . Researchers today are investigating questions such as, What factors can makes soil more fertile? How does the condition of soil affect public health? How can contaminated soil be improved? and How does soil affect climate change? Soils are a fundamental part of terrestrial ecosystems and are home to one-quarter of the world\u2019s species. Recall that various detritus feeders and decomposers feed on the increasingly being depleted. Protecting and nurturing agricultural soils, which are the cornerstone of food production, must be a central feature of sustainability. Yet it is a feature that has been overlooked repeatedly in the past. The Dust Bowl is not the only time croplands have been severely degraded.", "The fall of the ancient Greek, Roman, and Mayan empires was more the result of a decline in agricultural productivity due to soil erosion than of outside forces. A s the world\u2019s population grows past 7.2 billion, croplands and grazing lands are being pressed to yield more crops. The result is soil degradation, in which soil becomes less capable of supporting plant growth. Throughout the world, soils are degraded by erosion, the buildup of salts, pollution from mining, and deforestation. These impacts contribute to water and soil pollution as well as the loss of ecosystem services from the ecosystems that are degraded. The landmark 1991 Global A ssessment of Soil Degradation reported that 15% of Earth\u2019s land was degraded, mostly due to soil erosion. In 2013, a study by the FAO, called the Land Degradation A ssessment in Drylands found that more than one-fourth of Earth\u2019s cropland is degraded. 2 Our objective in this chapter is to develop an understanding of the attributes of soil required to support good plant growth, how these attributes may deteriorate under various practices, and what is necessary to maintain a productive soil. We will then look at what is being done nationally and internationally to rescue this essential resource and to establish practices that are sustainable. 2R. Biancalini, Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands, 2013 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations: Rome. Figure 11\u20131 Soil research. Soil research aims to protect and enhance soil productivity. This soil scientist is measuring soil radiation. organic debris in an ecosystem (Chapter 4) . Nutrients from the detritus are released into the soil and absorbed by producers, thus recycling the nutrients. In short, productive soil involves dynamic interactions among organisms, detritus, and mineral particles of soil (Figure 11\u20132) . Soil Characteristics Most soils are hundreds or thousands of years old and change very slowly. Soil science is crossdisciplinary and is at the heart of agricultural and forestry practice. Many years of the study of soils have resulted in a system of classification of soil profiles and soil structure and a taxonomy of soil types from all over the world\u2014as well as a large body of scientific literature investigating relevant topics. This section presents just enough of this information to enable you to open the door to soil science; you may even be motivated to follow up on your own in this fascinating field. Soil Texture. The mineral material of soil, or parent material, has its origin in the geological history of an area. Parent material can be rock or sediments deposited by wind, water, or ice. Sooner or later parent material is broken down by natural weathering (gradual physical and chemical breakdown) to the point where it may be impossible to tell just what kind of rock the soil came from. As rock weathers, it breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments\u2014stones and smaller particles. These are classified as sand, silt, and clay. Sand is made up of particles from 2.0 to 0.063 millimeters in diameter, silt particles range from 0.063 to 0.004 millimeters, and clay is anything finer than 0.004 millimeters (Figure 11\u20133) . You can see the individual rock particles in sand, and you may be familiar with the finer particles called silt, but you would need a good microscope to see clay particles. Particles larger than sand are called gravel, cobbles, or boulders, depending on their size. The sand, silt, and clay particles constitute the mineral portion of soil. Soil texture refers to the relative proportions of each type of particle in a given soil. If one predominates, soil is said to be sandy, silty, or clayey. You can determine the texture of a given soil by shaking a small amount of it with water in a large test tube then allowing the particles to settle. Because particles settle according to their weight, sand particles settle first, silt second, and clay last. (More precise measurements require a laboratory analysis.) Soil scientists classify soil texture with the aid of a triangle that shows the relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay in a given soil (Figure 11\u20134) . As the soil triangle shows, a soil that consists of roughly 40% sand, 40% silt, and 20% clay is called a loam. Loam containing organic matter is the ideal soil for many types of farming because it retains nutrients and some water but allows excess water to drain. 11.1 Soil and Plants 263 Figure 11\u20133 The relative sizes of soil particles.", "Clay particles are too small to see with the naked eye, while silt particles are slightly larger. Sand particles vary from small to large. Gravel is still larger. Soil Properties. Soil scientists often ask questions about how the components of soil determine its properties. Three basic properties of matter determine how several important properties of soil are influenced by texture: These properties of matter profoundly affect such soil properties as water infiltration, the capacity to hold water and 100 Percent sand Figure 11\u20134 The soil texture triangle. Relative proportions of sand, clay, and silt are represented on each axis. For clay, read across horizontally; for silt, read diagonally downward toward the left from the right axis; for sand, read diagonally upward to the left from the bottom axis. If the triangle is read properly, the content of any soil should total 100%. nutrients, and aeration. Table 11\u20131 shows the relationship between soil texture and these properties. Soil texture also affects workability\u2014the ease with which a soil can be cultivated. Workability has a tremendous impact on agriculture. Clayey soils are very difficult to work with because even modest changes in moisture content can turn them from too sticky and muddy to too hard and even bricklike. Sandy soils are very easy to work because they become neither muddy when wet nor hard and bricklike when dry. Soil Profiles. The processes of soil formation create a vertical gradient of layers that are often quite distinct. These horizontal layers are known as soil horizons, and a vertical slice through the different horizons is called a soil profile ( Figure 11\u20135). A soil profile reveals a great deal about the factors that interact in the formation of soil. O Horizon. The topmost layer, the O horizon, consists of dead organic matter (detritus) deposited by plants: leaves, stems, fruits, and seeds. Thus, the O horizon is high in organic content and is the primary source of energy for the soil community. Toward the bottom of the O horizon, the processes of decomposition are well advanced, and the original materials may be unrecognizable. At this point, the material is dark and is called humus. A Horizon. The next layer in the profile is the A horizon, a mixture of mineral soil from below and humus from above. The A horizon is also called topsoil. Fine roots from the overlying vegetation permeate this layer. The A horizon is usually dark because of the humus that is present and may be shallow or thick, depending on the overlying ecosystem. Vital to plant growth, topsoil grows at the rate of an inch or two every hundred years. E Horizon. In many soils, the next layer is the E horizon, where E stands for eluviation\u2014the process of leaching (dissolving away) many minerals due to the downward movement of water. This layer is usually paler in color than the two layers above it. B Horizon. Below the E horizon is the B horizon. This layer is characterized by the deposition of minerals that O Horizon: Humus (surface litter, decomposing plant matter) A Horizon: Topsoil (mixed humus and leached mineral soil) E Horizon: Zone of leaching (less humus, minerals resistant to leaching) B Horizon: Subsoil (accumulation of leached minerals like iron and aluminum oxides) C Horizon: Weathered parent material (partly broken-down minerals) Figure 11\u20135 Soil profile. This idealized soil profile shows the major horizons from the surface to the parent material. have leached from the A and E horizons, so it is often high in iron, aluminum, calcium, and other minerals. Frequently referred to as the subsoil, the B horizon is typically high in clay and is reddish or yellow in color from the oxidized metals present. C Horizon. Below the B horizon is the C horizon, which is the parent material that originally occupied the site. This layer represents weathered rock, glacial deposits, or volcanic ash and usually reveals the geological process that created the landscape. The biological and chemical processes occurring in the upper layers have little effect on the C horizon. Soil Classification. Soils come in a wide variety of vertical structures and textures. To give some order to this diversity, soil scientists have created a taxonomy, or classification system, of soils. Soil taxonomy is similar to the system of biological taxonomy, with which you may already be familiar. The most inclusive group in the taxonomy is the soil order.", "If you are classifying a soil, you find the order first and then work your way downward through the taxonomic categories (suborders, groups, subgroups, families) until you come to the soil class that best corresponds to the soil in question. There are literally hundreds of soil classes. Figure 11\u20136 shows the worldwide distribution of the 12 major soil orders. The four major soil orders that are most important for agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry are described below. A fifth type of soil that is particularly important to environmental health is also described. Mollisols. Mollisols are fertile, dark soils found in temperate grasslands. They are the world\u2019s best agricultural soils and are encountered in the Midwestern United States; across temperate Ukraine, Russia, and Mongolia; and in the pampas (a broad region of grassy plains) in Argentina. They have a deep A horizon and are rich in humus and minerals; precipitation is insufficient to leach the minerals downward into the E horizon. Alfisols. Alfisols are widespread, moderately weathered forest soils. Although not deep, they have well-developed O, A, E, and B horizons. Alfisols are typical of the moist, temperate forest biome and are suitable for agriculture if they are supplemented with organic matter or mineral fertilizers to maintain soil fertility. Oxisols. The soils of tropical and subtropical rain forests are called oxisols. Such soils have a layer of iron and aluminum oxides in the B horizon and have little O horizon, due to the rapid decomposition of plant matter. Most of the minerals are in the living plant matter, so oxisols provide limited fertility for agriculture. If the forests are cut (as in \u201cslash-and-burn\u201d agriculture), a few years of crop growth can be obtained, but in time, the intense rainfall leaches the minerals downward, forming an impervious hardpan that resists further cultivation. Aridisols. Aridisols are found in drylands, which include deserts as well as semiarid and seasonally dry areas. The paucity of vegetation and precipitation leaves aridisols relatively unstructured vertically. They are thin and light 11.1 Soil and Plants 265 Gelisols (Permafrost Soils) Rock Land Oxisols (Tropical Forest Soils) Histosols (Organic Soils) Shifting Sands Spodosols (Conifer Forest Soils) Inceptisols (Young Soils) Ultisols (Low-Nutrient Soils) Ice/Glacier Mollisols (Prairie Soils) Vertisols (Swelling Clay Soils) Figure 11\u20136 Global map of soil orders. The map shows the worldwide distribution of the 12 soil orders. (Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Services, World Soil Resources staff.) colored and, in some regions, may support enough vegetation for rangeland animal husbandry. Irrigation used on these soils usually leads to salinization, as high evaporation rates draw salts to surface horizons, where they accumulate to toxic levels. Hydric Soils. Another soil type\u2014hydric soil\u2014is important to ecosystems, although not necessarily good for agriculture. Hydric soils indicate a wetland or aquatic site. Hydric soils are not a soil class on their own, but are members of a number of other classes. Maps of hydric soils are used in delineating the boundaries of wetlands, in order to get permits for construction, and to protect wetlands and water bodies from the negative impacts of development. The soil order histosols includes several types of hydric soils. They contain a buildup of undecayed vegetation called peat and hence are called peatlands. Peat contains a great deal of energy and can be dried and burned. Vast areas of northern zones have hydric soils, including soils in the order gelisols, that are permanently frozen at some depth, a condition called permafrost. One of the concerns about climate change is that warming will thaw permafrost and increase rates of decay. This would act as positive feedback, causing the decaying peat to release more green house gases into the atmosphere (Chapter 18). Soil Constraints. Soil scientists often investigate the relationship between soil and the plants it supports. Such scientists speak of soil constraints, meaning the various characteristics of soils that limit primary productivity, especially in agriculture and forestry. These constraints include poor soil drainage, low ability to retain nutrients, high levels of aluminum, low levels of phosphorous, soil cracking (from certain types of clays), the presence of soluble salts, shallowness, and a high likelihood of erosion. Let\u2019s look at the characteristics that enable soils to support plant growth, especially agricultural crops. Soil and Plant Growth For their best growth, plants need a root environment that supplies optimal amounts of mineral nutrients, water, and air (oxygen). The pH (relative acidity) and salinity (salt concentration) of soil are also critically important.", "Soil fertility\u2014a soil\u2019s ability to support plant growth\u2014often refers to the presence of proper amounts of nutrients, but it also includes a soil\u2019s ability to meet all the other needs of plants. Farmers speak of a given soil\u2019s ability to support plant growth as its tilth. Mineral Nutrients and Nutrient-Holding Capacity. Rocks contain various mineral nutrients\u2014phosphate (PO3\u20134), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and other ions\u2014along with non-nutrient elements. Nutrients initially become available to roots through the weathering of rock. Weathering, however, is much too slow to support normal plant growth. The nutrients that support plant growth in natural ecosystems are supplied mostly through the breakdown and release, or recycling, of nutrients from detritus. Nutrients may be washed from soil as water moves through it, a process called leaching. Leaching lessens soil fertility; it also contributes to pollution when materials removed from soil enter waterways. Consequently, soil\u2019s capacity to bind and hold nutrient ions until they are absorbed by roots is important. This property is referred to as the soil\u2019s nutrient-holding capacity. Water and Water-Holding Capacity. The supply of water in soil is crucial to plant growth. Water is constantly being absorbed by the roots of plants, passing up through the plant and exiting as water vapor through microscopic pores in the leaves\u2014a process called transpiration. The pores, called stomata (singular, stoma), permit the entry of carbon dioxide and the exit of oxygen in photosynthesis; however, the loss of water via transpiration through the stomata is dramatic. A field of corn, for example, transpires an equivalent of a field-sized layer of water 43 centimeters (17 in.) deep in a single growing season. Plants with inadequate water may wilt and eventually die. Water is resupplied to soil by rainfall or irrigation. Three attributes of soil are significant in this respect (Figure 11\u20137) . First is soil\u2019s ability to allow water to infiltrate or soak in. If water runs off the ground surface, it won\u2019t be useful to the plants. Worse, it may cause erosion. The second attribute is the soil\u2019s ability to hold water after it infiltrates, a property called water-holding capacity. In soils with poor water-holding capacity, most of the infiltrating water percolates down below the reach of roots, thus becoming unavailable to plants. In contrast, soils with Figure 11\u20137 Plant-soil-water relationships. The Sun\u2019s energy drives transpiration by causing water to evaporate from the plant\u2019s leaves. When water evaporates, a vacuum is created that pulls more water up through the plant\u2019s tissues. The roots draw water from soil to replenish the evaporated water. Water lost from the plant by transpiration must be replaced from a reservoir of water held in soil. In addition to the amount and frequency of precipitation, the size of this reservoir depends on soil\u2019s ability to allow water to infiltrate, to hold water, and to minimize direct evaporation. good water-holding capacity act like sponges, holding a large amount of water and providing a reservoir from which plants can draw between rains. Sandy soils are notorious for their poor water-holding capacity, whereas clayey and silty soils are good at holding water. The third critical attribute of soil is its ability to minimize evaporative water loss. This kind of evaporation depletes soil\u2019s water reservoir without serving the needs of plants. The O horizon functions well to reduce evaporative water loss by covering soil. Aeration. The roots of plants require a constant supply of oxygen to carry out their metabolism. Land plants depend on soil being loose and porous enough to allow the diffusion of oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of the spaces in soil, a property called soil aeration. Overwatering fills the air spaces in soil, preventing adequate aeration. Plants that live in very wet soil have special adaptations that allow them to get oxygen. Compaction, or packing of soil, which occurs with excessive foot or vehicular traffic, lowers soil air, reduces infiltration, and increases runoff. Again, soil texture strongly influences this property, as indicated in Table 11\u20131. Relative Acidity (pH). The term pH refers to the acidity or alkalinity of any solution. A solution that is neither acidic nor alkaline is said to be neutral and has a pH of 7. The pH scale, which runs from 1 to 14, is discussed more fully later (Chapter 19). For now, it is important to know that differ ent plants are adapted to different pH ranges. Most plants do best with a pH near neutral, but many plant species are specialized for distinctly acidic or alkaline soils.", "Blueberries, for example, are acid lovers. Salt and Water Uptake. A buildup of salts in soil makes it impossible for the roots of a plant to take in water. Indeed, if salt levels in soil get high enough, water can be drawn out of the plant (by osmosis), resulting in dehydration and death. Only plants with special adaptations can survive saline soils, and to date, none of those are crop plants. In Section 11.2 we will discuss how irrigation may lead to the accumulation of salts in soil (salinization). Soil and Carbon Storage. Soils hold carbon from leaf litter and dead organisms. In fact, scientists estimate that soils hold as much as three times the amount of carbon held in the atmosphere and living plants. Scientists are keenly interested in knowing what drives the rate at which the organic matter in soil decays. Scientists once thought that temperature was the main driving factor, but now know that factors such as soil moisture, physical separation of particles, and location of roots play a role. In some places, earthworms drive the rapid breakdown of forest litter. Microbial communities also play a role. A better understanding of these processes will help scientists make more accurate predictions about the carbon cycle and climate change. Scientists are now undertaking a long-term, large-scale study to determine how changes in leaf litter will combine with climate change and the effects of soil biota to change soils and, ultimately, the carbon cycle. 3 3P. Garc\u0131a-Palacios et al., \u201cClimate and Litter Quality Differently Modulate the Effects of Soil Fauna on Litter Decomposition Across Biomes,\u201d Ecology Letters (2013), doi:10.1111/ele.12137. 11.1 Soil and Plants 267 The Soil Community As we\u2019ve seen, to support plant growth, soil must (1) have a good supply of nutrients and good nutrient-holding capacity; (2) allow infiltration, have good water-holding capacity, and resist evaporative water loss; (3) have a porous structure that permits good aeration; (4) have a pH near neutral; and (5) have low salt content. Moreover, these attributes must be sustained. How does a soil provide and sustain such attributes? Which is the best soil? Recall the principle of limiting factors: The poorest attribute is the limiting factor (Chapter 3). The poor water-holding capacity of sandy soil, for example, may preclude agriculture altogether because soil dries out so quickly. The inability of clay soils to allow water infiltration or aeration prevents them from being good soils. As Table 11\u20131 indicates, the best soil textures are silts and loams because limiting factors are moderated in these two types of soil. Even though silts and loams are rated only \u201cmedium\u201d for use in agriculture, their soil texture limitations are greatly improved by the organic parts of the soil ecosystem\u2014detritus and soil organisms. Organisms and Organic Matter in Soil. The dead leaves, roots, and other detritus accumulated on and in soil sup port a complex food web, including numerous species of bacteria, fungi, protozoans, mites, insects, millipedes, spi ders, centipedes, earthworms, snails, slugs, moles, and other burrowing animals (Figure 11\u20138) . The most numerous and important organisms are the smallest\u2014the bacteria; liter ally millions of bacteria can be seen and counted in a gram of soil. Humus. As all these organisms feed, the bulk of the detritus is consumed through cellular respiration. Carbon Figure 11\u20138 Soil as a Carpenter ant detritus-based ecosystem.

Note that it has a very loose structure, composed of numerous aggregates of various sizes. Figure 11\u201310 The results of removing topsoil. This \u201csoil\u201d is nothing but gravel with topsoil removed. After 50 years, only lichens and a few stunted trees have developed. (The white ballpoint pen shows the scale of the photograph.) dioxide, water, and mineral nutrients are released as by products (see Chapter 4). However, each organism leaves a certain portion undigested; that is, a portion resists breakdown by the organism\u2019s digestive enzymes. This residue of partly decomposed organic matter is humus, found in high concentrations at the bottom of the O horizon. A familiar example is the black or dark brown spongy material remaining in a dead log after the center has rotted out.", "Humus is good for plant growth because it has an extraordinary capacity for holding water and nutrients\u2014as much as 100 times greater than the capacity of clay, on the basis of weight. Composting is the process of fostering the decay of organic wastes under more or less controlled conditions, and the resulting compost is essentially humus. Soil Structure and Topsoil. As animals feed on detritus on or in soil, they often ingest mineral soil particles as well. For example, it is estimated that as much as 37 tons per hectare (15 tons per acre) of soil pass through earthworms each year in the course of their feeding. As the mineral particles go through the worm\u2019s gut, they become \u201cglued\u201d together by the indigestible humus compounds. Thus, earthworm excrements\u2014or castings, as they are called\u2014are relatively stable clumps of inorganic particles plus humus. The burrowing activity of organisms keeps the clumps loose. These loose clumps are a desirable component of soil structure (Figure 11\u20139) . Whereas soil texture describes the size of soil particles, soil structure refers to their arrangement. A loose soil structure is ideal for infiltration, aeration, and workability. The clumpy, loose, humus-rich soil that is best for supporting plant growth is topsoil, represented in a soil profile as the A horizon (see Figure 11\u20134). If plants are grown on adjacent plots, one of which has had all its topsoil removed, the results are striking: The yield from plants grown on subsoil is only 10% to 15% of that from plants grown on topsoil. In other words, a loss of all the topsoil would result in an 85% to 90% decline in productivity. The development of topsoil from subsoil or parent material is a process that takes hundreds of years or more. Figure 11\u201310 shows a site where the topsoil was removed 50 years ago to provide fill for a highway. Although a lichen cover and some stunted trees have grown on the exposed gravel, there is still no topsoil there. Interactions. There are some important interactions between plants and soil biota. A highly significant one is the symbiotic relationship between the roots of some plants and certain fungi called mycorrhizae. Drawing some nourishment from the roots, mycorrhizae penetrate the detritus, absorb nutrients, and transfer them directly to the plant (Figure 11\u201311) . Thus, there is no loss of nutrients to leaching. Another important relationship is that of certain bacteria that add nitrogen to soil ( Chapter 3) . Not all soil organisms are beneficial to plants, however. For example, nematodes, Figure 11\u201311 Mycorrhizae. Symbiotic fungi connect to the roots of plants; they help the plant by taking in nutrients and increasing root absorption, while getting protection and food. This scanning electron micrograph shows small fungal hyphae entering a plant root hair. 11.1 Soil and Plants 269 small worms that feed on living roots, are highly destructive to some agricultural crops. In a flourishing soil ecosystem, however, other soil organisms may control nematode populations. There is still a great deal about soil communities that scientists do not understand. Scientists initiated the Global Soil Biodiversity Assessment, a collaborative effort to better understand the ecology of soils across the globe. Over time, this coordination should result in knowledge that we can use in protecting soils. Soil Enrichment or Mineralization. You can now see how the aboveground and soil portions of an ecosystem support each other. The bulk of the detritus, which supports soil organisms, is from green-plant producers, so plants support soil organisms. In turn, as soil organisms feed on detritus, they create the chemical and physical soil environment that is beneficial to plant growth. Plants protect soil in two other important ways: The cover of living plants and detritus protects soil from erosion and reduces evaporative water loss. (These functions explain why it is desirable to keep organic mulch around vegetables growing in a garden.) Unfortunately, it is all too easy to break the mutually supportive relationship between plants and soil. The maintenance of topsoil depends on the addition of detritus in sufficient quantity to balance losses. Without continual additions of detritus, soil organisms starve, and their benefit in keeping soil loose and nutrient rich is lost. Additional consequences can occur as well. Although resistant to digestion by soil organisms, humus does decompose at the rate of about 2% to 5% of its volume per year. As soil\u2019s humus content declines, the clumpy aggregate structure created by soil particles glued together with the humus breaks down.", "Water- and nutrient-holding capacities, infiltration, and aeration decline as well. This loss of humus and the consequent collapse of topsoil are referred to as the mineralization of soil because what is left is just the gritty mineral particles\u2014sand, silt, and clay. Thus, topsoil is the result of a dynamic balance between the addition of detritus and humus-forming processes, on the one hand, and the breakdown and loss of detritus and humus on the other (Figure 11\u201312) . Soil deteriorates or is revitalized through loss or additions of organic matter. Fertilizer. In agricultural systems, nutrients in topsoil are replenished with applications of fertilizer\u2014material that contains one or more necessary nutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorus. Fertilizer may be organic or inorganic. Organic fertilizer includes plant or animal wastes; manure and compost (rotted organic material) are two examples. Organic fertilizer also includes leguminous fallow crops (alfalfa, clover) or food crops (lentils, peas), which fix atmospheric nitrogen. Inorganic fertilizers are chemical formulations of nutrients without organic components. Inorganic fertilizers provide necessary nutrients, but lack organic matter to support soil organisms and build the important soil structure we\u2019ve just described. Loss of soil nutrients will be discussed shortly. CONCEPT CHECK A shaded soil contains equal parts of sand, clay, and silt, as well as large amounts of leaf litter and fungi. What would you expect the three water-holding characteristics of this soil to be? \u2610\u2713 11.2 Soil Degradation In natural ecosystems, there is always a turnover of plant material, so new detritus is continuously being added to topsoil. However, when humans cut forests, graze livestock, or grow crops, the soil is at the mercy of their management or mismanagement. Soil degradation is a reduction in the capacity of soil to support plant life and to perform ecosystem functions. As the map in Figure 11\u201313 shows, soil degradation is a worldwide problem (see Sound Science, How Do We Know the Condition of Earth\u2019s Soils?). One of the most critical forms of soil degradation is erosion. Forms of Erosion How is topsoil lost? The most pervasive and damaging force is erosion, which occurs when water and wind pick up particles of soil and carry them away. Erosion occurs any time soil is exposed to the elements. The removal may be slow and subtle, as when soil is gradually blown away by wind, or it may be dramatic, as when gullies are washed out in a storm. In most natural terrestrial ecosystems, a vegetative cover protects against erosion. The vegetation intercepts falling raindrops, and the water infiltrates gently into the loose topsoil without disturbing its structure. With good infiltration, runoff is minimal. Runoff that does occur is slowed as the water moves through the vegetative or litter mat. Similarly, vegetation slows the velocity of wind and holds soil particles. Splash, Sheet, and Gully Erosion. When soil is left bare and unprotected, it is easily eroded. Splash erosion occurs in storms as the impact of falling raindrops breaks up the clumpy structure of the topsoil. The dislodged particles wash into spaces between other aggregates, clogging pores and thereby decreasing infiltration and aeration. The decreased infiltration results in more water running off, carrying away the fine particles from the surface, a phenomenon called sheet erosion. As further runoff occurs, the water converges into rivulets and streams, which have greater volume, velocity, and energy and hence greater capacity to pick up and remove soil. The result is erosion into gullies, or gully erosion ( Figure 11\u201314). This process of erosion can become a cycle that perpetuates itself. Desert Pavement and Cryptogamic Crusts. Both wind and water erosion involve the differential removal of soil particles. The lighter particles of humus and clay are the first to be carried away, while rocks, stones, and coarse sand remain behind. Consequently, as erosion removes the finer materials, the remaining soil becomes progressively coarser\u2014sandy, stony, and finally, rocky. Such coarse soils frequently reflect past or Figure 11\u201313 Global soil degradation. Soil degradation affects about 2,000 million hectares of land worldwide, including about 38% of the world\u2019s cropland. The colors on the map indicate the severity of degradation. (Source: Philippe Rekacewicz, IAASTD\u2014International A ssessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development, UNEP/GRID-Arendal.) 11.2 Soil Degradation 271 ongoing erosion. Did you ever wonder why deserts are full of sand? The sand is what remains after the finer, lighter clay and silt particles have blown away.", "In some deserts, however, the removal of fine material by wind has left a thin surface layer of stones and gravel called a desert pavement, which protects the underlying soil against further erosion (Figure 11\u201315) . Vehicular and pedestrian traffic damage this surface layer, allowing another episode of erosion to commence. Soil with a crust hardened from drying may be colonized by certain kinds of primitive plants (algae, lichens, and mosses) called cryptogams. Their growth and colonization create a crust on the soil, called a cryptogamic crust. Such crusts have a positive ecological impact; they stabilize soil, slow erosion, and add nutrients through nitrogen fixation. However, they can also inhibit water infiltration and seed generation. Cryptogramic crust is readily broken up by Wind Concentration erosion of larger pebbles Time (a) livestock trampling or human intrusion. If the soil below is loosened, it can again be subject to wind and water erosion. The Other End of the Erosion Problem. Water that is unable to infiltrate flows over the surface into streams and rivers, overfilling them and causing flooding. Eroding soil, called sediment, is carried into streams and rivers, clogging channels and intensifying flooding, filling reservoirs, killing fish, and generally damaging the ecosystems of streams, rivers, bays, and estuaries. In many regions of the world, excess sediments and nutrients resulting from erosion are the greatest source of surface-water pollution. Meanwhile, groundwater resources are also depleted because the rainfall runs off rather than recharging groundwater. This is an example of the tight connection between the health of soils and the availability and quality of water. (b) Figure 11\u201315 Formation of desert pavement. (a) A s wind erosion removes the finer particles, the larger grains and stones are concentrated on the surface. The result is desert pavement, which protects the underlying soil from further erosion. (b) The Sinai Desert has a mixture of desert pavement, rock, and tracks from vehicles, which break up the desert pavement and initiate further erosion. SOUND SCIENCE Practices That Cause Erosion Erosion is one of the main elements of soil degradation. Practices that expose soil to erosion include overcultivation, overgrazing, and deforestation, all of which are a consequence of unsustainable management practices. Yet as we will see, many of the impacts of these practices can be reversed. Overcultivation. Traditionally, the first step in growing crops has been plowing to control weeds. The drawback is that the soil is then exposed to erosion by wind and water. Further, the soil may remain bare for a considerable time after planting and again after harvest. Plowing is frequently considered necessary to loosen soil to improve aeration and infiltration through it, yet all too often the effect is just the reverse. Splash erosion destroys soil\u2019s aggregate structure and seals its surface, so that aeration and infiltration are decreased. The weight of the tractors used in plowing compacts the soil. Plowing also accelerates the loss of water through evaporation. Despite the harmful impacts inherent in cultivation, systems of crop rotation\u2014a cash crop such as corn every third year, with hay and clover (which fixes nitrogen as well as adding organic matter) in between\u2014have proved sustainable. If farmers abandon crop rotation, degradation and erosion exceed regenerative processes, and the result is a decline in the quality of soil. This is the essence of overcultivation. Overgrazing. Grasslands that are too steep or receive too little rainfall to support cultivated crops have traditionally been used for grazing livestock. In fact, about two-thirds of dryland areas are rangelands. Unfortunately, such lands are often overgrazed. As grass production fails to keep up with consumption, erosion follows and the land becomes barren. Overgrazing is not a new problem. In the United States in the 1800s, the American bison were slaughtered to starve out Native Americans and allow for stocking the rangelands with cattle. Cattle overgrazing became rampant, leading to erosion and encroachment by hardy desert plants such as sagebrush, mesquite, and juniper, which are not palatable to cattle. Western rangelands now produce less than half the livestock forage they produced before the advent of commercial grazing. The broader ecological impact of overgrazing is significant. Livestock compete with native animals for forage, substantially reducing the populations of native animals. Livestock also pollute waterways with sediment and their waste. A study of rangeland management concluded that 11.2 Soil Degradation 273 desertification affects some 85% of North America\u2019s dry-lands and that the most widespread cause of rangeland desertification is livestock grazing. 5", "In many cases, overgrazing occurs because rangelands are public lands that are not owned by the people who graze the animals. Where this is the case, herders who choose to have fewer livestock on the range sacrifice income, while others continue to overgraze the range. This problem, known as the \u201ctragedy of the commons,\u201d was discussed earlier ( Chapter 7) . Deforestation. Forest ecosystems are extremely efficient at holding and recycling nutrients and at absorbing and holding water because they maintain and protect very porous, humus-rich topsoil. Investigators at Hubbard Brook Forest in New Hampshire found that converting a hillside from forest to grassland doubled the amount of runoff and increased the leaching of nutrients many-fold. Much worse is what occurs if the forest is simply cut and its soil is left exposed. The topsoil becomes saturated with water and the muddy mass slides off the slope and into waterways, leaving only barren subsoil, which continues to erode. Forests continue to be cleared at an alarming rate (Chapter 7 ). The problem is particularly acute when tropical rain forests are cut. Because of leaching by rainwater, tropical soils (oxisols) are notoriously lacking in nutrients. When the forests are cleared, the thin layer of humus with nutrients readily washes away. Only the nutrient-poor subsoil is left. Nutrient Mining In agricultural systems, there is an unavoidable removal of nutrients from soil with each crop because the nutrients absorbed by plants are contained in the harvested material. This removal of nutrients, called nutrient mining, degrades the fertility of the soil. Therefore agricultural systems require inputs of nutrients to replace those removed with the harvest. Nutrients are replenished with applications of organic or inorganic fertilizer. Under intensive cultivation, nutrient content may be kept high with inorganic fertilizers, but mineralization, and thus soil degradation, proceeds. As the soil loses its nutrient-holding capacity, inorganic fertilizers are prone to leach into waterways, causing pollution (Chapters 12 , 20). Often, chemical fertilizers are combined with crop irrigation, a combination that can cause further problems. The overuse of nitrogen-containing fertilizers is a leading cause of disrup tions to the nitrogen cycle (Chapter 3) . In addition, the production of many inorganic fertilizers is fossil-fuel intensive, contributing to global emissions of greenhouse gases. Inorganic fertilizers have a valuable place in agriculture, but growers need to understand the different roles played by organic material and inorganic nutrients and then use each as necessary. 5Government Accountability Office, Livestock Grazing: Federal Expenditures and Receipts Vary, Depending on the Agency and the Purpose of the Fee Charged (September 30, 2005). Figure 11\u201316 Dryland cultivation. Farmers in Jinan, China, till the semiarid desert soil and plant a crop in anticipation of some rainfall. Drylands and Desertification Dryland ecosystems\u2014areas that are arid, semiarid, or seasonally dry\u2014cover 41% of Earth\u2019s ice-free land and are found on every continent except Antarctica. They are defined by precipitation, not temperature. Beyond the relatively uninhabited deserts, much of the land receives only 25 to 75 centimeters (10 to 30 in.) of rainfall a year, a minimal amount to support rangeland or nonirrigated cropland (Figure 11\u201316) . Droughts are common in dryland areas. When the rainfall returns, however, vegetation often returns. Regions that have sparse rainfall or long dry seasons support grasses, scrub trees, or crops only insofar as soils have good water-holding and nutrient-holding capacity. Recall that clay and humus are the most important components of soil for both nutrient- and water-holding capacity. When clay and humus particles are removed from soil, nutrients that are bound to those particles are removed as well. Even more serious, however, is the loss of the soil\u2019s water-holding capacity. As the erosion of topsoil diminishes a soil\u2019s capacity to retain water and nutrients, drylands become deserts, both ecologically and from the standpoint of agricultural production. The term desertification is used to denote this process. Note that desertification doesn\u2019t mean advancing deserts; rather, the term refers to a permanent reduction in the productivity of the land. It is a process of land degradation with a number of possible causes, including extended droughts, overgrazing, erosion, deforestation, and overcultivation. According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 10\u201320% of drylands (about 6 billion hectares) suffer from some form of land degradation. These lands are home to more than 2.3 billion people. Since drylands are commonly inhabited by some of the poorest people on Earth, promoting sustainable land management is essential to improving standards of living. Figure 11\u201317 Flood irrigation.", "The traditional method of irrigation is to flood furrows between rows with water from an irrigation canal. This method is extremely wasteful because most water evaporates or perco-lates beyond the root zone. Irrigation, Salinization, and Leaching How we use water has a huge effect on soil health, especially in agricultural systems. Nowhere is this more clear than with irrigation\u2014supplying water to croplands by artificial means. One-sixth of all cultivated U.S. cropland is irrigated. Worldwide, irrigated acreage has risen dramatically in the past few decades. The FAO estimates that total irrigated land now amounts to just more than 300 million hectares (more than 740 million acres). Irrigation has dramatically increased crop production in regions that typically receive low rainfall and is a major part of the Green Revolution (Chapters 8, 12). However, irrigation is also a major contributor to land degradation and has a dramatic impact on regional water use (Chapter 10) . Methods of Irrigation. Traditionally, water has been diverted from rivers through canals and flooded through furrows in fields, a technique known as flood irrigation ( Figure 11\u201317) . Flood irrigation may cause the water table to rise, waterlogging the soiling and preventing crops from growing. An irrigation method that has become increasingly popular is center-pivot irrigation, in which water from a central well is pumped through a gigantic sprinkler that slowly pivots around the well (see Figure 10\u201317 b and c). In more recent years, the much more efficient drip irrigation method has been used on some crops; in drip irrigation, small tubes carry water directly to the plants. Salinization. New irrigation projects continue to be built, but the gains from this expansion in acreage are now being offset by a negative trend: salinization. Salinization is the accumulation of salts in and on soil to the point where plant growth is suppressed (Figure 11\u201318) . Salinization occurs because even the freshest irrigation water contains at least 200 to 500 ppm (0.02% to 0.05%) dissolved salts. Adding water to dryland soils also dissolves the high concentrations of soluble minerals that are often present in those soils as salts when water evaporates. Because it happens in drylands and renders the land less productive, salinization is considered a form of desertification. Figure 11\u201318 Salinization. Millions of acres of irrigated land are now worthless because of the accumulation of salts left behind as water evaporates. Between 1995 and 2013, an estimated 17 million hectares (42 million acres) of the world\u2019s agricultural land was lost to salinization and waterlogging, a rate that translates into 4,600 football fields a day. In some places salinization reduces the yield of crops by as much as 60%. Salinization can be avoided, and even reversed, if sufficient water is applied to leach the salts down through soil. However, attention must be paid to where the salt-laden water goes. For example, the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in California was destroyed by polluted irrigation drainage from selenium-enriched soils of the San Joaquin Valley. After receiving the salty drainage water for only three years, birds, fish, insects, and plants in the refuge began to die off. The refuge was declared a toxic waste site and has been drained and capped with soil. At least 14 other locations in the western United States have been identified as having the potential to accumulate toxic irrigation water, a process now known as the Kesterson Effect. Leaching. In places that are heavily irrigated or have heavy rainfall, soils can lose nutrients and other chemicals to leaching. This is particularly true in tropical soils. Sometimes this is a problem because nutrients are leached out of soil; other times it is a problem because toxins are released from being bound to soil particles. Some soil chemistry problems result from a change in soil pH. Acid rain, a by-product of burning fossil fuels, can lower soil pH. As acid rain percolates through soil, it can change the amount of attraction between some chemicals and soil particles. This change in pH can have two important effects. First, nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium that are bound to clay and humus can be separated from soil particles more easily and then leached away by rain. Second, a lower pH can mobilize toxins such as mercury or aluminum. Aluminum in soil is usually in the form of aluminum hydroxide, an insoluble compound. Acid rain breaks the chemical bonds in aluminum hydroxide, releasing toxic aluminum ions, a process that stunts the roots of plants, preventing them from absorbing nutrients.", "Loss of Soil Biota Soil health is largely regulated by detritus and microorganisms. The organic material in detritus holds water, binds mineral particles together, and slowly releases nutrients. Soil microbes help plants germinate, obtain nutrients, and perform other activities. Erosion, salinization, acid rain, and waterlogging can kill soil biota. One new threat to soils is that of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are used for a variety of purposes. For example, extremely small beads of silver are added to many products as an antimicrobial agent; you may be familiar with antimicrobial socks or similar products. Unfortunately, such nanoparticles can have negative effects on water and soil. A study in the Journal of Hazardous Materials in 2011 showed that nanoparticles can kill beneficial soil bacteria and reduce the ability of plants to take in nitrogen. However, the study looked at high concentrations of nanoparticles, and it is unclear how lower concentrations of nanoparticles will affect soils. One of the problems with nanoparticles is that they became widely used before sufficient studies of their environmental effects were completed. Impacts of Mining Agriculture is the human activity that probably has the greatest impact on soils, but other human activities also affect soils. For example, soils are affected by changes in land use. Construction projects remove vegetation and topsoil and often lead to erosion. Cutting down forests drives a great deal of erosion. Some of the most significant nonagricultural impacts on soil are the result of mining. The scene after a strip-mining operation is completed is often similar to a moonscape\u2014great piles of rocks with topsoil removed. Laws in some parts of the United States require these areas to be restored, though the success of such restoration varies. In the removed mountaintops of Appalachia, the plateaus left after coal mining are green but relatively unproductive ( Chapter 14). The topsoil is gone, the remaining subsoil is too poor to support crops or most trees, and the vegetation that is planted is usually the non-native Lespedeza cuneata. Mining is big business around the world. In addition to coal, people mine a variety of rocks and minerals such as gypsum, phosphates, salts, and metals, including a group of metals called rare earth elements. Rare earth elements are used in electronic devices and so are critical to modern activities. Despite their name, rare earth elements are relatively common in the Earth\u2019s crust, but are difficult to mine because they are not concentrated in the places where they are found. China mines 85% of the rare earth elements we use. Mining removes vegetation and has huge impacts on soil erosion, water quality, and human health. Because of these connections, mining is of importance in our discussions on fossil fuels, environmental health, water pollution, and hazardous waste (Chapters 14, 17, 20, and 22). The first International Conference on Mining Impacts on the Human and Natural Environments was held in Florida in 2008. Since then, conferences on the environmental impacts of mining 11.2 Soil Degradation 275 and the need for effective land restoration have been held around the world. In 2014, a conference in Beijing, China, covered topics relating to the impact of mining on the environment and successful mining land reclamation approaches. Hopefully, this is a direction scientists will pursue in order to lessen the impacts of mining on soil and water. Creating New Land Throughout history, societies have \u201ccreated\u201d new land. In many parts of Asia, people have built terraces\u2014series of step-like fields and walls\u2014into the sides of mountains to produce flat cropland. The Dutch claimed land from the sea by building levees and pumping out the saltwater. Many coastal cities, such as New York City and Boston, are built on filled-in wetlands. In fact, for many years, the U.S. Bureau of Land Reclamation helped to drain wetlands, which were considered wasted land. Now we know that such changes came with environmental costs, including the loss of habitats and ecosystem functions such as flood control ( Chapter 10). The country of China has created more land than any other country, 6 primarily along its coastlines. From 1949 until the 1990s, China reclaimed about 3 million acres from the China Sea. Today, China is also carrying out an aggressive program of inland land creation: The tops of mountains are being cut away and the material put into valleys to produce flat areas for city expansion, industry, and agriculture (Figure 11\u201319 ).", "Such mountaintop removal is done in coal mining areas in the United States (Chapter 14 ) as a part of mining operations, but the Chinese projects are occurring on an unprecedented scale. According to some estimates, 6P. H. Qian Li and Jianhua Wu, \u201cEnvironment: Accelerate Research on Land Creation,\u201d Nature (June 2014), accessed November 20, 2014, http://www.nature .com/news/environment-accelerate-research-on-land-creation-1.15327. Figure 11\u201319 Land creation. These machines are cutting down the tops of mountains to create a larger area for the city of Lanzhou in central China. Such large-scale efforts have serious environmental consequences. 700 mountains in central China will be leveled to produce hundreds of square miles of land. These Chinese projects come with uncertain environmental costs. Air pollution, landslides, water pollution, and loss of ecosystems are all concerns. The city of Yan\u2019an, in central China, expected to double its area by this process, is especially problematic because the mountains are comprised of compacted loess, a silt that will take years to settle before it can be used as a building site. Such large-scale changes to ecosystems are likely to produce unanticipated consequences. Part of sustainability is trying to avoid the negative consequences of actions we take to provide for growing populations. CONCEPT CHECK Parks often have signs telling tourists to stay on paths. If people ignore these signs, how will the soils in desert areas be affected? How will the soils in wet, mountain areas be affected? \u2610\u2713 11.3 Conserving and Restoring Soil There is broad consensus that soils are vital to human societies and that they should be preserved. This is encouraging, and as long as this consensus translates into action, we will be moving in the direction of sustainability. Because topsoils grow so slowly (an inch every hundred years at best), sustainability means doing all we can to reduce soil erosion and prevent degradation. Soil conservation must be practiced at multiple levels. The most important level is the individual landholder. Soil conservation is also affected by public policy. National farm policies play a crucial role in determining how soils are conserved. In addition, national policies governing the grazing of public lands, forestry practices, and mining can lead to either good or poor stewardship of soils. Individuals and public policies must work in harmony to bring about effective, sustainable stewardship of soil resources. Let us examine briefly what is being done. Helping Landholders in the United States Those working on the land are best situated to put into practice the conservation strategies that will enhance their soils, bring better harvests, and improve their way of life. A great deal of traditional knowledge exists with landholders, who routinely practice soil conservation techniques. Stopping Erosion. A number of techniques are widely employed to reduce erosion. Among the most conspicuous are contour farming and shelterbelts (Figure 11\u201320) . In contour plowing, fields are plowed and cultivated at right angles to the contour of the slope, thereby slowing the downhill flow of water. Shelterbelts are rows of trees and shrubs planted beside fields to protect crops and livestock from wind and blowing snow. Erosion can also be prevented by growing grasses along waterways and strips of perennial plants along the sides of fields to filter runoff. (Also see Sustainability, New Ditches Save Soil.) No-Till and Low-Till Agriculture. A technique that permits continuous cropping while minimizing soil erosion is no-till farming, depicted in Figure 11\u201321. In this technique, the field is first sprayed with herbicide to kill weeds. Next, a planting apparatus is pulled behind a tractor to accomplish several operations at once: A steel disk cuts a furrow through the mulch of dead weeds, drops seed and fertilizer into the furrow, and then closes it. At harvest, the process is repeated, and the waste from the previous crop becomes the detritus and mulch cover for the next. Thus, the soil is never left exposed, erosion and evaporation are reduced, and there is enough detritus, including roots from the previous crop, to maintain the topsoil. However, (a) (b) Figure 11\u201320 Contour farming and shelterbelts. (a) Cultivation up and down a slope encourages water to run down furrows and may lead to severe erosion. The problem is reduced by plowing and cultivating along the contours at a right angle to the slope. In this photograph, strip cropping is also being utilized: The light green bands are one type of crop, the dark bands another. (b) Shelterbelts\u2014belts of trees around farm fields\u2014break the wind and protect soil from erosion, as seen here in New Zealand.", "Figure 11\u201321 Apparatus for no-till planting. This no-till planter is planting corn over stubble with minimal disturbance to the protective vegetation layer on the surface of the soil. The apparatus creates furrows with cutting discs, applies herbicide and fertilizer, drops in seeds, and closes the furrows. no-till farming requires the use of herbicides, which have their own problems and may increase the effects of pests that remain in crop residues from one season to another (Chapter 13). No-till agriculture is now routinely practiced in areas of the United States. A variation on this theme is low-till farming, which is catching on in Asia. For example, to plant wheat after a rice crop has been harvested, only one pass over a field is made\u2014to plant seed and spread fertilizer. In the past, farmers would plow 6 to 12 times to break up the muddy soil and dry it out for the wheat. Natural Resources Conservation Service. The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly the Soil Conservation Service, was established in response to the Dust Bowl tragedy of the early 1930s. Through a nationwide network of regional offices, the NRCS provides information regarding soil and water conservation practices to farmers and others. For example, federal extension service offices test and analyze soil samples and make recommendations for improvements. The NRCS performs an inventory of erosion losses in the United States. In 2010, the Natural Resources Inventory indicated that soil erosion on croplands has lessened in recent years, from 3.36 billion tons in 1982 to 1.72 billion tons in 2010. 7 This decrease is likely a consequence of improved conservation practices, such as shelter-belts and grassed waterways. Ending Overgrazing. The restoration of rangelands benefits both wildlife and cattle production. One solution to overgrazing lies in better management. An NRCS program called the Conservation Stewardship Program provides information and support to enable ranchers who own their 7U.S. Department of Agriculture, Summary Report: 2010 National Resources Inventory (Washington, DC: Natural Resources Conservation Service; and Ames, IA: Center for Survey Statistics and Methodology, Iowa State University, 2013), available at http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/ stelprdb1167354.pdf. 11.3 Conserving and Restoring Soil 277 lands to burn unwanted woody plants, reseed the land with perennial grass varieties that hold water, and manage cattle so that herds are moved to a new location before overgrazing occurs. Public policy, discussed later, also plays a role in ending overgrazing. Soil Restoration. In some cases, degraded soils can be restored. Restoration usually involves the addition of organic material and the use of rooted plants to trap soils, as well as the introduction of soil biota. Compost, manure, other plant products, and earthworms may be used to enhance degraded soils. Sometimes contaminants such as toxic chemicals need to be removed from degraded soil. When organisms are used to remove contaminants, the process is called bioremediation. In the case of petroleum contamination, for example, soil microbes are used to break down the contaminant. In other situations, plants are used to take up pollutants. U.S. Policy and Soils Despite the crucial importance of saving agricultural land and forests, human activities continue to cause erosion, desertification, and salinization. Such land degradation is on a collision course with sustainability. Who is responsible for making changes? At the first level, it is the individual landowner, but landowners are subject to public policies, which is the second level of decision making for soil conservation. Agricultural Policies. Farm policy in the United States was originally focused on increasing production, demonstrated by continuing high yields and surpluses. Today the federal government supports U.S. agriculture through a number of programs that maintain farm income and support of farm commodities. These programs provide benefits, but also have a number of environmental costs. Farm Subsidies. Farmers are guaranteed price levels for many products, including grains, cotton, sugar, peanuts, dairy products, and soybeans. These subsidies help keep food prices from fluctuating year to year. Unfortunately, they can be bad news for the economy and the environment. 8 Subsidies encourage excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, reduce crop rotation by locking farmers into annual crop support, and promote the continued drawdown of groundwater aquifers through irrigation. They also can promote the degradation of soil. The Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act (FAIR) of 1996 attempted to bring needed reforms. Subsidies and controls over many farm commodities were reduced or eliminated, giving farmers greater flexibility in deciding what to plant, but also forcing them to rely more heavily on the market to guide their decisions.", "The 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act succeeded FAIR. It continued to subsidize a host of farm products, maintaining price supports and farm income for American farmers. 8Norman Myers and Jennifer Kent, Perverse Subsidies: How Tax Dollars Can Undercut the Environment and the Economy (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2001). Farm Bills and Conservation. The U.S. Congress periodically passes legislation overseeing agriculture that includes incentives for soil conservation. In 1985, Congress passed the Conservation Reserve Program, under whose authority highly erodible cropland could be established as a \u201cconservation reserve\u201d of forest and grass. Farmers are paid each year for land placed in the reserve. Funding has been provided for two newer programs, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, both of which encourage conservation-minded landowners to set aside portions of their land or address pollution problems. The 2002 Farm Bill initiated the Conservation Security Program (CSP), a voluntary program that encourages stewardship of private farmlands, forests, and watersheds by providing landowners incentives to conserve soil and water resources on their lands. This was renamed the Conservation Stewardship Program in the 2008 Farm Bill; more than $1 billion was provided for the new CSP. The 2014 Farm Bill updated the regulation of the Conservation Stewardship Program, reducing the funds provided for it and limiting it to 10 million new acres per year. Policies for Grazing on Public Lands. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) leases grazing rights through 18,000 permits on 155 million acres of federal lands. The Forest Service leases grazing rights on an additional 95 million acres, with 6,165 permits issued. The income to the government is less than private landowners would be paid for grazing rights, though ranchers have to do more on federal lands, such as provide water and fences and get permits. Altogether these leases pay the government far less than the costs of administration: In 2013, for example, overstocking and the BLM subsidy of ranching on federal public lands cost $48.2 million, but brought in only $12.2 million in grazing fees to the federal government. A worse problem is the ecological cost exacted by livestock to watersheds, streams, wildlife, and endangered species. In a variation of the tragedy of the commons, those who graze stock on public lands have little incentive to practice soil conservation. In response to these issues, some ranchers and environmental groups propose that the government buy up some of the 26,000 existing grazing permits and \u201cretire\u201d those rangelands. The ranchers would be offered a generous payment for the permits they hold, and the land would be used for wildlife, recreation, and watershed protection. Another solution is to charge market value for grazing livestock on public lands. Mining Regulations. In many places, the land left after a mining operation lacks the topsoil necessary for plant growth and contains toxic wastes. The U.S. Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) was created to address the environmental impacts of strip mining. States are expected to regulate mines. Once mines are closed, the mined lands are supposed to be rehabilitated. Restoring such places can be very difficult, but is necessary for a healthy ecosystem. Soil Conservation in the Developing World In the developing world, as in the developed world, it is the individual landholders, farmers, and herders who hold the key to sustainable soil stewardship. They must be convinced that what they do will work, that it will be affordable, and that, in the long run, their own well-being will improve. Such persuasion may require help in the way of microlending, sound advice (often best coming from their peers), or simply encouragement to experiment (Chapter 9). Empowering Farmers. One of the worldwide efforts to empower farmers to protect soil is the Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development Initiative (SARD) facilitated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). SARD is an umbrella organization that coordinates efforts to help small farmers use sound agricultural practices and encourages sustainable development. An example is found in the Bobo Diaulasso region of Burkina Faso, a rural community in Africa\u2019s drylands where intensive farming, driven by population growth, has led to a loss of soil fertility and declining crop yields. An FAO project is enabling a group of farmers there to adopt a range of sustainable practices, such as mixing plots of legumes and cereal grains to preserve soil fertility, cultivating soybeans to diversify income sources, and producing forage to feed livestock during the extended dry season.", "FAO hopes that the practices used there will serve as a model for implementation in other, similar situations. The increased production in Bobo Diaulasso is a prime example of stewardship in action. The Keita Project. Preventing and reversing soil degradation is a key need of the more than 2 billion people who live in drylands, often among the poorest people on Earth and subject to climatic variations that can destroy their livelihood and well-being. Niger is one of the hottest countries of the world, with much of its land in the Sahara. The part of Niger that is south of the Sahara is in the Sahel, a climatic belt that runs across Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. The Sahel is semiarid grassland, receiving 6\u201320 inches of rainfall a year, but less in drought years. In 1982, the Italian government initiated a project in the Keita district of Niger, more than 4,000 square miles of plateaus, rocky slopes, and grasslands inhabited by 230,000 people. The project targeted the serious degradation brought on by overpopulation and the effects of soil and wind erosion. Some 41 dams were established to catch water from the summer rains, countless check dams were constructed to stop rainwater sheet erosion and provide soil and moisture 11.3 Conserving and Restoring Soil 279 Figure 11\u201322 The Keita district of Niger. With the help of foreign donors, villagers in the drylands of Keita planted nearly 20 million trees to reverse desertification and improve food security. for crops, and more than 18 million trees were planted (see Chapter 10). These anti-erosion projects took many years to complete. Local people, especially women, who were paid with food, carried out most of the work. The Keita district is now a flourishing environment for crops, livestock, and people (Figure 11\u201322) . Desertification has been halted; it is also being actively monitored, in case it starts again. The people now have control over their plots of land, an important step toward long-term stewardship of local resources. The Role of International Agencies Internationally, there are few soil protection treaties, although a number of international efforts touch on soil protection. For example, in 2011 the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the European Commission initiated the Global Soil Partnership to promote joint efforts to protect soil resources and to restore the function of soils in ecosystems. 9 The United Nations declared 2015 to be the International Year of Soils and December 5 to be World Soil Day. There have been international efforts to protect and restore soils by reversing deforestation and desertification. The United Nations established the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), which was signed and officially ratified by more than 100 nations in 1996. The goal of the UNCCD is to have a \u201cland degradation neutral world,\u201d a term that came out of the Rio+20 meeting on development. Regular conferences and other UNCCD meetings have been concerned with such issues as the funding of projects to reverse land degradation, \u201cbottom-up\u201d programs that enable local communities to help themselves, and the gathering and dissemination of traditional knowledge on effective drylands agricultural practices. In 2014, India, recognizing the impact of desertification on its ability to provide food, began an effort to become land-degradation neutral by 2030. 10 9Global Soil Partnership, accessed November 22, 2014, http://www.fao.org/ globalsoilpartnership/en/. 10\u201cIndia to Be \u2018Land Degradation Neutral\u2019 by 2030: Javadekar,\u201d Zee News (June 17, 2014), accessed November 21, 2014, http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/india to-be-land-degradation-neutral-by-2030-javadekar_940285.html. One alliance, TerrAfrica, was formed in 2005 by several UN agencies and African countries to fight land degradation in sub-Saharan Africa. The alliance coordinates efforts toward arresting land degradation and promoting sustainable land management. For example, several TerrAfrica partners have been working with the government of Madagascar to reduce land degradation in its upland watersheds and southern arid lands. Currently there are international collaborations among scientists, international agencies, and national governments to protect soil. The Economics of Land Degradation, for example, is a global initiative by public and private stakeholders aimed at making soil protection economically sustainable. One of the reasons for these collaborations is that many people have realized that our development goals are related to soil health. In the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Goal 2 on food security and sustainable agriculture is directly related to soils. One of the targets for Goal 15 on terrestrial systems includes combatting desertification and ending land degradation. Ecosystem services of soil are important to achieving other SDGs, including those concerning climate change, forest conservation, and access to productive land.", "At this point, most international soil protection efforts are focused on agriculture because soil health is so closely tied to food security. Attention to other issues, such as urban soils, soils degraded by mining or hazardous wastes, and the effect of climate change on soils, has lagged. In the future, soil health will probably get more international attention, because it is so closely connected to a number of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The Production and Distribution of Food What does it take to get a MacArthur \u201cGenius Grant\u201d (a grant given by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to people who show exceptional merit and promise for creative work)? For one famous athlete, it took a vision for a farm in the city. Will Allen, a former pro basketball player, had an idea for a way to provide fresh local food for the people of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, so he purchased a defunct plant nursery and began his foray into urban farming. The nonprofit he now directs, Growing Power, is a sustainable agriculture organization. It runs the last functioning farm within the city limits of Milwaukee, operates a 40-acre farm outside of the city, and has branched out as far as Chicago. The piece of the operation that most captures the imagination is the original farm on the north side of Milwaukee, where every piece of space is carefully used. On a 3-acre plot lies an intensive urban agricultural operation with greenhouses, fish, bees, chickens, and goats. The integrated system brings food to an estimated 10,000 people annually. A Whole Life. Growing Power\u2019s Milwaukee farm meets needs other than simply providing fresh food. Each year the farm uses 400 tons of the city\u2019s food waste. It produces and sells worms, worm castings, compost, fruits and vegetables, goat milk and cheese, fish, and honey. It also provides job training for urban youth. And every year about 5,000 visitors come to learn about its activities. This example of urban agriculture highlights the themes of this chapter: The future of agriculture will be different from agriculture of the past. It must produce enough food to support people and to be accessible, while lessening the negative effects on the environment caused by modern agriculture. There is a pressing need for change. Throughout the world, three decades of rapid population growth have left hundreds of millions of people dependent on imported food or food aid, while one in five in the developing world remains William Allen, at the urban farm Growing Power in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 12.1 Crops and Animals: Major Patterns of Food Production 283 undernourished. As the world population continues its rise, no resource is more vital than food. Food production connects to many other topics we address in this book, such as politics and economics, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, population growth, poverty, water availability, soil, pests and their control, environmental health, climate change, water pollution, and sustainable cities.", "Food is central to our lives as humans and central to 12.1 Crops and Animals: Major Patterns of Food Production By many measures, human societies have done very well at putting food on the table. More people are being fed, and with more nutritional food, than ever before. In the past 30 years, world food production has more than doubled, rising even more rapidly than the population. During this time, the daily amount of food available in the developing countries increased by 25%. A lively world trade in foodstuffs forms the bulk of economic production for many nations. How did we get to a place where we produce this much food? The answer lies in changes in agriculture. The Neolithic Revolution (Chapter 8), industrial agriculture, the development of high-yielding crops in the Green Revolution, and modern genetically modified crops have all played a role. Some 12,000 years ago, the Neolithic Revolution saw the introduction of agriculture and animal husbandry, which probably did more than anything else to foster the development of human civilization. Virtually all of the world\u2019s major crop plants and domestic animals were established in the first thousand years of agriculture. In most of the developing world today, farmers continue to raise plants and animals by traditional methods that go back millennia. These subsistence farmers represent the great majority of rural populations. topics in environmental science. Wild foods, forest products, fisheries, and aquaculture are covered elsewhere. Here, we will look at three things necessary to provide nourishment for a burgeoning population and to protect the environment for the long term: the production of more food, the elimination of the harmful effects of food production on the environment, and the distribution of the right kinds of food to everyone on the planet. Subsistence Agriculture in the Developing World Subsistence farmers live on small parcels of land that provide them with enough food for their households and, it is hoped, a small cash crop. The food they produce and consume themselves is not counted in the global economy and is sometimes undervalued by others ( Chapter 2). Subsistence farming is labor intensive and lacks practically all of the inputs of industrialized agriculture (Figure 12\u20131) . In addition, it is often practiced on marginally productive land. Typically, a family owns a small parcel of land for growing food and maintains a few goats, chickens, or cows. The system may be sustainable if crop residues are fed to livestock, the livestock manure is used as a fertilizer, and the family\u2019s nutrition is adequate. Such a family is making the best use of very limited resources. Unfortunately, subsistence agriculture is primarily practiced in regions experiencing the most rapid population growth, even though that kind of agriculture is best suited for areas with low population densities. Worldwide, more than 500 million smallholder farms support more than 2 billion people. Such farms produce almost 80% of the food consumed in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Such agriculture has been called the \u201csilent giant\u201d that feeds most of the world\u2019s rural poor. Successes of Subsistence Agriculture. The practice of subsistence agricultural varies with the local climate and Figure 12\u20131 Subsistence farming. Subsistence farming feeds more than 2 billion people in the developing world. This farmer is plowing a rice paddy with water buffalo in southern Laos. Figure 12\u20132 Slash-and-burn agriculture. A farmer watches a controlled fire in Laos, Southeast Asia. In some cases such agriculture can be a sustainable mix of forest and fields, but too much clearing is unsustainable. with local knowledge. In some areas, subsistence agriculture involves shifting cultivation within tropical forests\u2014often called slash-and-burn agriculture (Figure 12\u20132) . Research has shown that this practice can be sustainable if it is done well. The cultivators create highly diverse ecosystems in which the cleared land supports a few years of crops and gradually shifts into agroforestry\u2014a system of tree plantations with different ground crops employed as the trees grow. The reason this works, though, is because the local human population is low. Difficulties with Subsistence Agriculture. Subsistence farmers live close to the edge, limited by the size of their farms, the availability of crops, animals, and tools, and other factors such as rainfall and pests. They are often poor and lack the financial resources to survive periodic crop failures. Farmers reliant on small crops often lack access to markets and any type of insurance or credit. New technologies may increase crop yields for others, but not for those who are too poor to take advantage of them.", "Subsistence farms are most common in Asia, Latin America, and especially in sub-Saharan Africa. There, agricultural production has lagged behind that of the rest of the developing world (Figure 12\u20133) . Two-thirds of the people in sub-Saharan Africa are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many countries in the region are dependent on imported food, and world food prices have been fluctuating. The Development of Modern Industrialized Agriculture At the start of the 19th century, the majority of people in the United States lived and worked on small farms. Human and animal labor turned former forests and grasslands into agricultural systems that produced enough food to supply a robust and growing nation (Figure 12\u20134a ). Farmers used traditional approaches to combat pests and soil erosion: crops were rotated regularly, many different crops were grown, and animal wastes were returned to the soil. Farming, although difficult, was efficient enough to allow an increasing number of people to leave the farm and join the growing ranks of merchants and workers living in towns and cities. In the mid-1800s, the Industrial Revolution came to the United States. This revolution transformed agriculture profoundly and greatly increased the efficiency of farming. Since the mid-1930s, the number of farms in the country has Figure 12\u20133 The yield gap for YIELD OF CORN BY REGION, 1960\u20132014 corn. Subsistence agriculture often has 10 lower crop yields. The difference in yield in terms of metric tons per hectare between 9 sub-Saharan Africa and other regions continues to widen. 8 (Source: FAOSTAT.) 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Year Yield (metric ton/hectare) 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 12.1 Crops and Animals: Major Patterns of Food Production 285 (a) (b) Figure 12\u20134 Traditional versus modern farming. (a) Traditional farming practiced in Arkansas. For hundreds of years, traditional practices on American farms supported the growing U.S. population. (b) Modern agricultural practice, illustrated by a combine loading corn into a tractor trailer in America\u2019s Midwest. decreased by two-thirds (from 6.8 million to 2.1 million), while the size of farms has grown fourfold. (They now average 434 acres, or 176 hectares.) Today the remaining 2.1 million farms produce enough food for all the nation\u2019s needs, plus a substantial amount for trade on world markets (Figure 12\u20134b) . Virtually every industrialized nation has experienced this agricultural revolution. Crop production has been raised to new heights, doubling or tripling yields per acre ( Figure 12\u20135). To understand how this tremendous increase in production was made possible, you need to understand the components of the agricultural revolution. These in turn reveal some of the problems brought on by the revolution. Machinery and Infrastructure. In the modern farm, an incredible array of machinery handles virtually every imaginable aspect of working the soil: seeding, irrigating, weeding, YIELDS OF U.S. CROPS, 1961\u20132013 Yield (Kg/Ha) 12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Year Figure 12\u20135 U.S. crop yields. Corn, wheat, and soybean yields (measured as kilograms per hectare) have increased over time. (Source: FAOSTAT.) and harvesting. This machinery has enabled farmers to cultivate far more land than ever, using less human labor. The transformation of agriculture in the United States was greatly facilitated by the development of supporting infrastructure. These developments included new roads and rural electrification, irrigation facilities, agricultural programs in state universities, agricultural and soil extension services for farmers, the establishment of markets and efficient transportation of farm goods, banks and credit unions to provide farm loans, the formation of farm cooperatives, price support programs, and many other government subsidies of farming. Most of these developments were essential in achieving the agricultural revolution. However, many believe that the long-term maintenance of farm subsidies and reliance on fossil-fuel-driven machinery favors large corporate farms and works against the interests of small farms. Land Under Cultivation. The United States has the largest area of arable land in the world. Cropland and pastureland comprise more than one billion acres (400 million ha). This is about 45% of the country\u2019s total land area. Essentially all of the good cropland in the United States is now under cultivation or held in short-term reserve. Before 1960, much of the increased production in the United States came from bringing new land into production. Since then, increases in crop yields and consistent crop surpluses have lessened pressure to convert additional land to cropland, enabling farmers to be selective in the land they cultivate.", "The surpluses have also given farmers the opportunity to take erosion-prone land out of production. Under current farm policy, the Conservation Reserve Program reimburses farmers for \u201cretiring\u201d erosion-prone land and planting it with trees or grasses (Chapter 11 ). Recently some of this land has been brought back into production to meet a rising demand for corn used in ethanol production. Globally, agriculture occupies about 38% of the land, a number that has remained relatively steady since 1994, although yields have increased. In the future, any expansion of cropland will come at the expense of forests and wetlands, which are both economically important and ecologically fragile. Fertilizers and Pesticides. Farmers long ago learned that animal manure and other organic supplements to soil could increase their crop yields. When chemical fertilizers first became available for use, however, farmers discovered that they could achieve even greater yields. Moreover, the fertilizers were more convenient to use and more readily available than manure. When fertilizers were first employed, 15 to 20 additional tons of grain were gained from each ton of fertilizer used (Figure 12\u20136) . Between 1950 and 1990, worldwide fertilizer use rose tenfold. Then, following a decline traced to hard times in the countries of the former Soviet Union after it broke up in the 1990s, the worldwide use of fertilizer resumed its rise and topped 176 million tons. It is now projected to reach 263 million metric tons by 2050. Most of the current increase in fertilizer use is in \u201cunderfertilized\u201d countries such as China, India, and Brazil. The manufacture of fertilizers uses energy from fossil fuels. As a result, fertilizer prices vary with the cost of fuel and other factors. For example, world fertilizer prices doubled in 2007, affecting the cost of food. They reached a high in 2008, and dropped afterward because of lower oil prices. In traditional agriculture, pests such as insects and weeds can greatly reduce the yields of crops. The development of chemical pesticides provided significant control over pests, at least initially. However, due to natural selection, pests have become resistant to many pesticides. This leads to a cycle: More pesticides are used, and pests recover and increase. Currently, more than 113 weed species, 150 plant diseases, and 520 insects and mites are resistant to Figure 12\u20136 The effects of fertilizer. This 1942 photo shows the difference between fertilized and unfertilized crops and was part of a campaign to help farmers increase yields. (Source: Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.) pesticides. Between 10% and 16% of global crop production is now lost to pests, an amount that is expected to increase as pests become more resistant to pesticides and climate change allows pests to expand their ranges. The use of pesticides may also affect the health of humans and the environment. As with the use of farm machinery and fertilizer, the manufacture of pesticides depends on fossil fuel energy. Concerns about pesticides are discussed extensively elsewhere ( Chapter 13). Irrigation. Worldwide, irrigated acreage has doubled since 1950, while water withdrawals have tripled. Today irrigated acreage represents 18% of all cropland\u2014some 683 million acres (277 million ha)\u2014and produces 40% of the world\u2019s food. Irrigation is still expanding, but at a much slower pace because of limits on water resources; irrigation represents 70% of all water use. Recall that much current irrigation is unsustainable because groundwater resources are being de pleted (Chapter 10). On as much as one-third of the world\u2019s irrigated land, agricultural production is being adversely affected by waterlogging and salinization\u2014consequences of irrigating where there is poor drainage (Chapter 11). In addition, irrigation ditches are associated with the spread of as many as 30 diseases, because open water provides habitat for mosquito larvae, snails that carry parasites, and other vectors of disease. The Green Revolution The technologies that gave rise to the agricultural revolution in the industrialized countries were eventually introduced into the developing world. There, they gave birth to the remarkable increases in crop production called the Green Revolution. High-Yielding Grains. Several decades ago, plant geneticists developed new varieties of wheat, corn, and rice that produced yields that were double to triple the yields of traditional varieties. In 1943, the Rockefeller Foundation sent agricultural expert Norman Borlaug and three other U.S. agricultural scientists to Mexico, with the objective of exporting U.S. agricultural technology to a developing nation that had serious food problems.", "Mexican wheat was well adapted to the subtropical climate, but it produced low yields and responded to fertilization by growing very tall stalks that were easily blown over. Using wheat from other areas of the world, Borlaug and his coworkers bred a dwarf hybrid with a large head and a thick stalk. The hybrid did well in warm weather when provided with fertilizer and sufficient water (Figure 12\u20137) . The program was highly successful: By the 1960s, wheat production in Mexico had tripled. Mexico had closed the gap between food production and food needs and Mexican wheat appeared on the export market. Research workers with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) extended the work done in Mexico, introducing modern varieties of high-yielding wheat and rice to other developing countries. In one success story, Borlaug induced India to import hybrid Mexican wheat seed in the mid-1960s; in just six years, India\u2019s wheat production tripled. Many countries followed suit. Figure 12\u20137 Traditional versus high-yielding wheat. A compari-son of an old variety of wheat with a new, high-yielding variety of dwarf wheat growing in Mexico. While the world population was increasing at its highest rate (2% per year), the worldwide production of rice and wheat increased 4% or more per year. In 35 years, global food production doubled. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contribution. Worldwide Benefits. The Green Revolution revolutionized food production in the developing world between 1960 and 2000. 1 The early Green Revolution expanded food production in Asia and Latin America; the later years of the Green Revolution benefited Africa and the Middle East. High-yielding crop varieties are now cultivated throughout the world and have become the basis of food production in China, Latin America, the Middle East, southern Asia, and the western nations. Because the technology raises yields without requiring new agricultural lands, the Green Revolution has held back a significant amount of deforestation in the world. Research on high-yielding crops has continued, and more varieties continue to be developed, released, and adopted by farmers. Recent research has focused on resistance to diseases, pests, and climatic stresses. Today, with the help of foreign investment, African crop scientists are working with conventional breeding techniques to improve traditional African food crops, an extension of Green Revolution efforts. 1R. E. Evenson and D. Gollin, \u201cAssessing the Impact of the Green Revolution, 1960 to 2000,\u201d Science 300 (May 2, 2003): 758\u2013762. 12.1 Crops and Animals: Major Patterns of Food Production 287 Costs of Modern Agriculture Despite the great increases in production associated with industrialized agriculture and the Green Revolution, they are not a panacea for the world\u2019s food-population difficulties. Each of the modern agricultural technologies has externalities\u2014 costs not associated with the price of food (Chapter 2 ). These costs mean that ecosystems have been harmed and ecosystem capital has been lost. By 2004, the hidden costs of U.S. industrial agriculture were estimated at $5.7 billion to $16.9 billion per year. 2 Special Conditions for High-Yield Crops. High-yielding varieties of crops can be hard to grow. In many locations, grains grow best on irrigated land, and water shortages have begun to occur as a result of this dependence (Chapter 10 ). In addition, modern varieties of grains require constant inputs of fertilizer, pesticides, and energy-intensive mechanized labor, all of which can be in short supply, or are used unsustainably. The increased use of fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation have externalities that have already been described. Monocultures. The Green Revolution and other aspects of industrialized agriculture increase monocultures, vast areas planted in just one crop. Monocultures have the disadvantage of making pests and diseases worse. Why? Large areas planted with a single crop allow insects and diseases to spread more rapidly than they could if the crop were interspersed with other plants that were not susceptible to the same diseases and pests. Loss of Genetic Diversity. Over the long history of traditional agriculture, an enormous variety of domesticated plants and animals were developed; each breed of plant or animal had a distinctive genetic makeup that was well suited to a particular locale. The movement to industrialized agriculture has maximized yield at the cost of many of these \u201cheritage breeds\u201d or \u201cheirloom varieties.\u201d In just the last 15 years, 190 breeds of farm animals have gone extinct. Thousands of wheat varieties have been lost. 3 In India, 90% of the traditional rice varieties are no longer grown on farms.", "In North America, a similar percentage of fruit and vegetable varieties have gone extinct. Sometimes even the flavor of food is lost as breeders achieve other gains, such as uniformity of shape or color. The genetic diversity of heritage breeds is a valuable resource that can be used to develop crops and livestock that are better adapted to changing conditions. But once breeds are lost, this diversity is no longer available to meet our future needs. To prevent this loss of biodiversity, a number of seed banks around the world store the seeds of heirloom crops. On a smaller scale, one Indian farmer started a cooperative seed-sharing farm that raises and protects 930 different rice varieties on less than 3 acres. 2E. Tegtmeier and M.

Animal Farming and Its Consequences Raising livestock\u2014sheep, goats, cattle, buffalo, and poultry\u2014 has many parallels to raising crops, and there are many connections between the two. One-third of the world\u2019s croplands are used to feed domestic animals; in the United States, 36% of cropland is used to feed animals. The care, feeding, and \u201charvesting\u201d of some 4.7 billion four-footed livestock and almost 21.5 billion birds constitute one of the most important activities on the planet. The primary force driving this livestock economy is the large number of the world\u2019s people who enjoy eating meat and dairy products\u2014most of the developed world and growing numbers of people in less developed nations. This growing appetite for meat, and especially for beef, has a significant impact on the environment (see Sound Science, The Meat Footprint). There are multiple methods of raising livestock. Recent changes in the production of livestock include the development of concentrated livestock and poultry production and an increasing number of extremely large ranches, particularly in the tropics. In other places, such as rural societies in the developing world, livestock and poultry are raised on family farms or by pastoralists who are subsistence farmers. Overgrazing is a problem in many areas with high human populations and traditional herds. Concentrated Livestock Production. In the developed world and increasingly in the developing world, large numbers of animals are raised in confinement in facilities called concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs (Figure 12\u20138) . More than half of the livestock in the United States are grown in CAFOs. Industrial-style animal farming such as CAFOs can damage the environment and human health in a host of ways. One serious problem associated with CAFOs is the management of animal manure. In the United States, livestock produce as much as 1.2\u20131.4 billion tons of manure annually\u2014between 3 and 20 times what humans produce\u2014yet we do not have sewage treatment plants for livestock waste. Some of the waste from CAFOS leaks into Figure 12\u20138 CAFOs. Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), like this cattle lot in Arizona, are common. These cattle are held in very tight quarters while they are fed grains to fatten them. This results in high concentrations of animal waste, sometimes leading to water pollution. surface waters, where it contributes to die-offs of fish, contamination with pathogens, and a proliferation of algae. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asserts that animal-based agriculture is the most widespread source of pollution in the nation\u2019s rivers. The crowded conditions in CAFOs allow diseases to incubate and spread among animals. Diseases may also spread from animals to humans, causing serious public-health concerns. For example, avian flu is a highly contagious disease that moves quickly through poultry that are grown at high densities. A 2014 outbreak of avian flu in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada, lead to the slaughter of 80,000 birds to prevent the disease from spreading; several countries banned the import of poultry products from that region. Further, many bacteria associated with animal farming are human pathogens, causing food-borne human diseases. The bacterium salmonella alone is estimated to cause losses of $2.65 billion per year in the United States. Some people object to CAFOs because of the tight confinement of animals, which can leave them without room to turn around or, in some cases, without the ability to stretch their muscles; such facilities may require animals to lie in their own feces. Recent laws about CAFOs have focused on whether such treatment is humane. Large Ranches. Large ranches occur around the world.", "The largest ranch in the world, Anna Creek Station in South Australia, covers 6 million acres, about the size of the nation of Israel. Many ranches are in the tropics. Ranches account for a great deal of the loss of rain forests. In the last 50 years, 17% of the Amazon River Basin forest has been lost, mostly due to conversion to cattle pasture, often after the land was briefly farmed for crops. Even though most of this land is best suited for growing rain forest trees, some of it supports rural populations of subsistence farmers who produce a diversity of crops. Much of the land, however, is held by relatively few ranchers who own huge spreads. The expansion of cattle production in the Amazon Basin is export driven; for example, Brazilian beef exports bring in more than $5.3 billion annually. 12.1 Crops and Animals: Major Patterns of Food Production 289 SOUND SCIENCE The juicy burger at your favorite diner, the steak at a top-end restaurant, the chicken fingers at a fast-food joint, the pork ribs at a barbeque\u2014all contribute to an American diet with a high percentage of meat. The average American today eats about 57 pounds more meat per year than the average American in 1950. That increase in meat consumption occurred even as the number of vegetarians and vegans rose. Around the world, the consumption of meat has also risen, particularly in places like China where an emerging middle class has funds to enjoy richer foods. More land is used for livestock production than for any other type of food production. However, feeding people meat rather than plant products takes a great deal of energy and has environmental costs, externalities that we may not recognize. Recently Gidon Eshel, an environmental scientist at Bard College, New York, and his colleagues estimated the cost of our increasing appetite for meat. Their paper, \u201cLand, Irrigation Water, Greenhouse Gas, and Reactive Nitrogen Burdens of Meat, Eggs and Dairy Production in the United States,\u201d describes the effects of producing meat and dairy products on four environmental factors: the amount of land required, the amount of irrigation water used, the amount of greenhouse gases emitted, and the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used to grow the feed for livestock. The largest environmental effect of livestock production is the production of feed, including pastureland. The authors concluded that the production of beef has a far greater environmental footprint than the production of other forms of meat. A s their data show, beef production requires 28 times more land, 11 times more greenhouse gases, 5 times more irrigation water, and 6 times more nitrogen than the average of the other livestock categories. The authors acknowledge that in some places, cattle eat plants that humans cannot eat and that some livestock feed is made of plant parts such as leaves that are inedible to humans. Even taking that into pr Dairy Beef Poultry Pork Eggs RESOURCE NEEDED FOR A CONSUMED MEGACALORIE (1,000 kcal) account, however, eating beef has a disproportionately high environmental cost. Including the methane that cows release in their digestion of food would only have increased the disproportionately high effects of beef production. Because of the high environmental costs of meat and dairy production, eating less meat, especially beef, is likely to be a part of successfully feeding the world of the future. In fact, a report by the UN Environmental Programme suggested that reducing meat consumption to 1940s levels (about a 60% drop for Americans) would be important to staying within sustainable cropland limits. As we see in this example, science plays an important role in helping us calculate the cost of human activities accurately, allowing us to make informed decisions about where to put our efforts.

For some factors, the value for beef is off the scale and the correct number is marked at the end of the bar. 20 40 g reactive N per Megacalorie Use of Antibiotics. Antibiotics are used heavily in animal husbandry. An estimated 80% of antibiotics used in the United States are used for livestock. These antibiotics are used to treat animal illnesses but are also added to animal feed, because sub-therapeutic doses encourage rapid tissue growth. The use of antibiotics is particularly high in CAFOs, because the animals are kept in such close quarters. An unfortunate outcome of this widespread use is that many bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics; such bacteria are far more difficult to treat when humans are infected. 4 Of most concern is the use of cephalosporins, a class of antibiotics used in the treatment of pneumonia, strep throat, and other human illnesses, especially in children. The USDA has placed restrictions on their use in the United States. In Canada, the practice of injecting chicken eggs with a type of cephalosporin was discontinued after a drug-resistant strain of salmonella infected birds and people alike. 5 Climate Change. Because agro-ecosystems cover so much land, they are critical to changes in the climate. Indeed, agriculture releases more greenhouse gases than transportation does. Deforestation and burning in the tropics are estimated to release approximately 25% of the annual emissions of carbon dioxide released by humans, contributing a significant amount of carbon dioxide to the greenhouse effect. Yet carbon dioxide emissions represent only 27% of the greenhouse gases emitted by agriculture. Methane makes up about half of the greenhouse gases emitted by agriculture. In addition, the use of fertilizer releases the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, which accounts for 29% of agricultural emissions. Livestock rearing is also a significant source of other greenhouse gases, accounting for 14% of total global emissions. 6 Because their digestive process is anaerobic, cows emit methane through belching and flatulence. The anaerobic decomposition of manure also releases methane. The total methane produced by livestock is estimated at 100 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (Chapter 18). Pastoralists. Pastoralists are subsistence farmers who move their cattle, sheep, or other grazing animals from place to place in search of pasture. Although their animals contribute to the methane problem, it is callous to fault pastoralists whose domestic animals enhance their diet and improve their quality of life. Many such animals live on plants humans cannot eat, and their manure is used for fertilizer and fuel. Livestock that are well managed can enhance the soil and enable rural farmers to maintain a balanced farm and grazing-land ecosystem, unless the herds overgraze local resources. 42012 Summary Report on Antimicrobials Sold or Distributed for Use in Food Producing Animals, Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, 2014. 5M.

J. Gerber et al., Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock\u2014A Global Assessment of Emissions and Mitigation Opportunities (Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2013). Figure 12\u20139 Heifer Project International. A Kenyan woman with a cow her family received from the Heifer Project. Heifer Project International provides animals for families in need. Participants agree to pass on the offspring of their livestock to others. Farmers in developing countries now own two-thirds of the world\u2019s domestic animals, a trend that has made an important contribution to nutrition, especially for women and small children. Livestock can often be the savings for a family. In fact, one kind of sustainable development aid brought to rural families is the gift of a cow or a few goats or rabbits, as carried out by Heifer Project International (Figure 12\u20139) . In addition to livestock, pastoralists need secure access to land. Loss of lands results in food insecurity. Some pastoralists, such as the Maasai, an East African nomadic tribal group, are under extreme pressure because their grazing lands are desired by others. In 2014, the Tanzanian government reneged on a deal and threatened to turn Maasai ancestral lands bordering the Serengeti National Park into a hunting and safari park for the Dubai royal family\u2019s use. Indigenous rights activists were outraged, and the dispute is ongoing.", "Biofuels and Food Production Because of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, global climate change is affecting virtually ev ery country (Chapter 18). The most basic cause of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels. One way to mitigate climate change is to burn biofuels, or fuels derived from agricultural crops, instead of fossil fuels. The burning of biofuels releases no new carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Biofuels are also a form of renewable energy. The primary biofuel in production today is ethanol, which is a suitable substitute for gasoline. Ethanol is usually derived from the fermentation of cane sugar (in Brazil) or cornstarch (in the United States). A rising fraction (40% in 2013) of U.S. corn is devoted to meeting the growing demand from ethanol distilleries. Corn is a staple food around the world. Many people were concerned that the diversion of corn to biofuel production lowered its availability for human consumption and 12.2 From Green Revolution to Gene Revolution 291 caused the rise in global food prices in the 2000s. Research by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) suggested that perhaps 30% of the grain price increases between 2000 and 2007 was linked to biofuel production. However, the relationship between using corn for bio-fuels and world food prices is not simple. Corn is already diverted to many other uses. The United States produces more than 32% of the world\u2019s corn, 45% of which is used for livestock, poultry, and fish feeds, while only 15% is used in human food and beverages. When corn is used for biofuel it is still useful for human and animal food; only the cornstarch is used for ethanol production, and the proteins, vitamins, and fiber are converted to high-energy animal feed, sweeteners, and corn oil. Many observers suggest that some limit be put on corn ethanol production, while making a greater investment in a new generation of biofuels based on grasses and timber waste (see Chapter 16) rather than on human or domestic-animal foods. Part of the solution to feeding the modern world\u2019s growing population has been to use irrigation, fertilizers, pesticides, plant breeding, and industrial animal operations. Emerging technologies promise to change the face of agriculture even more. What were four components of the Green Revolution? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 12.2 From Green Revolution to Gene Revolution Genetic engineering makes it possible to combine characteristics from genetically different organisms and to incorporate desired traits into crop lines and animals, producing transgenic, or genetically modified (GM), varieties. Genetic engineering is a radically different technology from the genetic research that produced the Green Revolution: Researchers are no longer limited to genes that already exist within a species or that could arise via mutation; it is now possible to exchange genes among bacteria, animals, and plants. The most widely adopted GM products include those resistant to pests and those tolerant of herbicides. The first type is represented by crops with built-in resistance to insects that comes from genes taken from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, abbreviated as Bt ( Figure 12\u201310) . The second type includes crops that are resistant to herbicides, including the chemicals glyphosate (usually the brand Roundup\u00ae) and glufosinate (several brands). Herbicide-resistant plants such as corn and soybeans allow farmers to spray herbicide without harming their crops and to employ no-till techniques. In the years since bioengineered seeds became commercially available, farmers in the United States and many other countries have overwhelmingly turned to the transgenic breeds of soybeans, cotton, and corn. In the United States, about half of all land in production is planted with bioengineered crops. Worldwide, 433 million acres (175 million ha) were planted with bioengineered crops in 2013. Figure 12\u201311 , on the following page, shows the dramatic increase in the amount of farm land planted with GM crops. Most of this area is planted in just four crops\u2014corn, soybeans, canola, and cotton. The use of bioengineered sugar beets is also increasing. Figure 12\u201310 Bt cotton. Bioengineered cotton has a gene from a bacterium that helps it resist insect pests. More recently, biotechnology has developed other genetically altered products, including strains of corn, potatoes, and cotton that are resistant to insects; rice resistant to bacterial blight disease; and sorghum (an important African crop) resistant to a parasitic plant called witchweed, which infests many crops in Africa. Genetic engineering has also produced trees and salmon that grow very quickly.", "One rapidly increasing trend is the development of \u201cstacked\u201d products, crops that contain two or more biotech genes, such as traits directed toward different insects or insect resistance plus herbicide tolerance. Genetically modified organisms are under intense research and development, and the potential for transgenic crops and animals seems almost unlimited. Still, in spite of the obvious potential of these organisms, there are concerns about their development and use. Let\u2019s look at both sides of this controversy. Figure 12\u201311 Global area of genetically 180 modified crops. The plot shows the rapid increase in global areas planted with geneti 160 cally modified crops (primarily cotton, soybeans, canola, and corn) for industrial (highincome) and developing countries as well as 140 total global use. (Source: Clive James. \u201cGlobal Status of Commercial-120 ized Biotech/GM Crops.\u201d ISAAA, 2013.) Million Hectares 100 80 60 40 20 0 The Promise The use of genetically modified crops and animals seems to be working, at least in the short term. A 2014 meta-analysis of 147 studies showed that overall, the use of GM soybean, corn, and cotton increased yields and farmer profits and decreased pesticide use. 7 Among the important possible environmental benefits of bioengineered crops are reductions in the use of pesticides because the crops are already resistant to pests, reductions in erosion because herbicide-resistant crops facilitate the use of no-till farming, and less environmental damage associated with bringing more land into production because existing agricultural lands can produce more food. Crops for Developing Nations. The development of GM crops can help the developing world produce more food. Biotech crop research that can benefit developing countries is proceeding at a rapid pace. China, in particular, has emerged as a leader in plant biotechnology, having sequenced the rice genome. Among other aims, the objectives of this technology for developing nations are (1) to incorporate resistance to diseases and pests that attack important tropical plants; (2) to increase tolerance to environmental conditions that stress most plants, such as drought and high levels of salt; (3) to improve the nutritional value of commonly eaten crops; and (4) to produce pharmaceutical products in ordinary crop plants. Products under development include virus-resistant cassavas, sweet potatoes, melons, and papayas; insect-resistant eggplants ( Figure 12\u201312); protein-enhanced corn and soybeans; fungus-resistant bananas; bananas and tomatoes that contain an antidiarrheal vaccine; and drought-tolerant sorghum and corn. 7W. Klumper and M. Qaim, \u201cA Meta-Analysis of the Impacts of Genetically Modified Crops,\u201d PLOS One, November 3, 2014, doi:10.1371/journal.pone .0111629. Pharma Crops. The biotech industry has recognized the advantages of producing pharmaceuticals by engineering genes for desirable products into common crop plants. Such bioengineered plants are called pharma crops. There have been field trials for crops genetically modified to produce hormones, enzymes, diagnostic drugs, and other substances, but none had yet come to market. One risk of such pharma crops is that they could contaminate food crops\u2014some of the compounds being developed could be harmful if ingested by people or animals. In 2002, corn altered to produce a pig vaccine spread through fields in Iowa and Nebraska; intervention by the USDA kept the altered corn out of food. Because it seems unlikely that a foolproof system can be established, experts recommend producing pharmaceuticals with noncrop plants. Figure 12\u201312 Genetically modified eggplant. The brinjal (Indian eggplant) on the left have been attacked by insects; those on the right have been genetically modified to resist insects attack. Such GM foods are controversial in India. 12.2 From Green Revolution to Gene Revolution 293 The Problems Concerns about genetic engineering technology involve three main considerations: food safety, environmental problems, and justice issues. Safety Issues. GM crops contain proteins from different organisms. Such proteins might pose an unexpected risk to the people who consume them. For example, tests showed that a Brazil-nut gene incorporated into soybeans was able to manufacture a protein in the soybeans that induced an allergic response in individuals who were allergic to Brazil nuts. Also, antibiotic-resistance genes are often incorporated into transgenic organisms. Health risks could arise if a separate process of gene transfer allowed antibiotic resistance to enter human systems or if a transgenic food product prevented an antibiotic from being used effectively. Another concern is that new combinations of genes could have unexpected health effects on consumers. However, the World Health Organization, summarizing the finding of many researchers, has stated, \u201cGM foods currently available on the international market have passed risk assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health.\u201d 8 Environmental Concerns.", "Environmental concerns about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been on the radar of the scientific community for years. These concerns include the risks of developing resistant pests and superweeds and harming nontarget organisms, the loss of biodiversity, and the increase in the use of chemicals. 9 Resistant Pests. One major environmental concern is the pest-resistant properties of GM crops. If pests have a broad exposure to a toxin incorporated into a plant, it is possible that they will develop resistance to the toxin and thus render it ineffective as an independent pesticide. The GM crop then loses its advantage. Insect pests could also become resistant to GM plants that are supposed to be insect resistant. For example, Bt cotton is designed to resist the cotton boll weevil by producing a toxin once made by a bacterium. However, boll weevils that can survive on the engineered cotton now abound. When Chinese cotton farmers began turning to Bt cotton in the early 2000s, they found that they used much less pesticide, saving money, time, and their own health in the process. But these benefits did not last. In 2010, Chinese farmers suffered outbreaks of secondary pests (minor pests that became major in the absence of a competing pest), especially mirid bugs, which increased by twelve-fold over their occurrence before the use of the Bt cotton ( Figure 12\u201313). Superweeds. Genes for herbicide resistance or for tolerance to drought and other environmental conditions can spread to ordinary crop plants or their wild relatives, possibly creating new \u201csuperweeds.\u201d Field studies indicate that this concern is valid. One study of genetically modified canola plants (used in animal feeds and vegetable oils) found that the vast majority of canola plants growing wild along roads in North Dakota had genes from GM canola crops. Glyphosate resistance has been found in a number of weeds that infest soybean, corn, and cotton fields. Because so much acreage is now planted with glyphosate-resistant crops, resistant weeds could spread widely and cause economic disaster for farmers. Figure 12\u201313 Mirid bugs. Mirid bugs, such as this one, became a major pest on cotton in China only when Bt cotton resisted other competing insects and their natural predators were killed. Nontarget effects. Another concern is the ecological impact of GM crops on nontarget organisms. For example, the wind can carry pollen from Bt corn (resistant to the corn borer) to adjacent natural areas where the toxin may kill beneficial insects. This effect was shown to occur in laboratory tests with monarch butterflies. Later studies, however, indicated that Bt corn poses a low risk to the butterflies. The EPA cleared the corn for continued planting, although some scientists are still concerned. Loss of Biodiversity. GM crops have increased the trend of earlier industrial agriculture: intensive monocultures and less genetic diversity, contributing to the loss of local plant varieties. Loss of animal diversity is also a concern. The transgenic AquAdvantage\u00ae salmon, the first GM animal approved by the FDA for human consumption, presents another example of concerns about genetic diversity. 10 These farmed fish grow more quickly than native salmon and can aggressively outcompete them. Although the GM salmon are reared in tanks, scientific research has shown that if they were to escape into the wild, they could hybridize with brown trout and pass along their genes for rapid growth. While such an outcome has not yet occurred, the research suggests we should be cautious. 8World Health Organization, \u201c20 Questions on Genetically Modified Foods/ Question 8,\u201d June 25, 2012, accessed December 5, 2014, http://www.who.int/ foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/. 10K.

Royal Society B (2013): doi:10.1098/rspb.2013.1047. Increase in Chemicals. Some pest-resistant GM crops clearly decrease the use of insecticides. But the jury is still out on whether GM crops that are glyphosphate resistant (Round-Up Ready varieties) reduce the use of herbicides as they were originally expected to. Initially the spraying of glyphosphate to kill weeds decreased the use of herbicides. But between 2001 and 2011, the use of herbicides increased by 26%. 11 Access in the Developing World.", "In 2004, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) gave its qualified approval to agricultural biotechnology in The State of Food and Agriculture, but concluded that the promise of the technology to alleviate global hunger and improve the wellbeing of farmers in developing countries was more theory than reality. 12 Several structural problems make this new technology less helpful than it could be. Issues regarding environmental justice are a significant part of the concern about genetically modified organisms. For the first few years, nearly all GM crops were developed by large agricultural-industrial firms with a profit motive. Large seed companies purchased smaller seed companies, until just a few companies dominated the market. The GM crops were patented; farmers were forbidden by contract from propagating the seeds and had to purchase seeds annually. International trade agreements benefitted large companies at the cost of small farmers. This was a cause of dispute in Guatemala when indigenous groups fought for the right to plant and replant their own maize in spite of international trade regulations. Farmers in developing countries are less able to afford the higher costs of the new seeds, which must be paid up front each year. Fortunately, some noncommercial and donor-funded laboratories are taking aim at this problem. Further, biotech research is booming in China, India, and the Philippines, where most of the fruits of the research are being made available to developing-world farmers. In addition, GM seeds are spreading rapidly through seed \u201cpiracy.\u201d The experience of GM cotton growers in India illustrates a number of the concerns associated with GM crops. In 2002, India began planting Bt cotton and doubled its harvest. But 10 years later, farmers were frustrated. In six years, the crop had not increased, though the amount of GM crops planted had increased fourfold. In 2012, the harvest in most areas was half of what it was in 2011. The \u201cwhite revolution\u201d had not panned out the way farmers had hoped, at least in the regions without adequate irrigation or where land was marginal. Bt cotton required more nutrients, fertilizer, and water and was vulnerable to bacterial disease. In addition, many farmers could not afford the GM varieties, but seed for local varieties of cotton had disappeared. 11Food and Water Watch, \u201cSuperweeds: How Biotech Crops Bolster the Pesticide Industry,\u201d (July 2013), accessed December 9, 2014, http://documents .foodandwaterwatch.org/doc/Superweeds.pdf#_ga=1.104040192.1025903332 .1418136676. 12United Nations, Food and Agricultural Organization, The State of Food and Agriculture 2003\u20132004: Agricultural Biotechnology: Meeting the Needs of the Poor? (Rome: UN FAO, 2004). Figure 12\u201314 GM crop protests. Protesters in France rip up geneti-cally modified corn in protest. GMO Controversy. All of these concerns, combined with the general fear of what unknown technologies can bring, have stimulated a rather heated controversy over the spreading use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Activists around the world have rallied to protest the development of such organisms and the \u201cFrankenfoods\u201d derived from them ( Figure 12\u201314). The protests have been strongest in Europe, and some countries, such as Ireland, have banned GM crops. The issue has been far less controversial in the United States. Because corn and soybeans are used in so many processed foods, an estimated 70% of all processed foods in the United States are thought to contain some genetically modified substances. Even so, there is controversy. Some U.S. consumer groups would like to see mandatory labeling of all foods derived from GMOs. Laws have been proposed, but such labeling is not yet required. While the jury is still out on GM crops, countries everywhere are cautiously examining the technology, and many are moving forward. In 2013, 27 countries, including several in the European Union, were growing biotech crops. Most observers agree that biotechnological advances play a role in future food production. Consequently, the world community has been developing national and international policies about their use. The Policies In the United States, the EPA, the USDA, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have regulatory oversight of different elements of the application of biotechnology to food crops. Concern over their oversight led to a number of reports from the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 National Research Council. One report, Impact of Genetically Engineered Crops on Farm Sustainability in the United States (2010), concluded that herbicide resistance in weeds was a real problem but that, overall, GM crops have been a benefit. 13 In sum, several reports endorsed the science, technology, and regulation of GM crops.", "At the same time, the reports called for more research on environmental and safety issues. The Cartagena Protocol. In January 2000, the UN Convention on Biodiversity sponsored a conference to deal with international trade in GMOs. At issue was a fundamental difference in philosophy about how technologies, particularly new ones, should be regulated. Some felt that no one should be able to limit trade in a new product unless they had sufficient scientific evidence to know that it was harmful. Others believed that, because it takes a long time to do research, governments should be able to regulate trade when there was good reason to be concerned about a product before all of the research was completed. After heated negotiations, the conference reached an agreement, called the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Surprisingly, the agreement was welcomed by governments, the private sector, and environmental groups alike. The Precautionary Principle. The Cartagena Protocol states that the \u201clack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientific information and knowledge . . . shall not prevent [a country] from making a decision\u201d on the import of genetically modified organisms. The protocol gives countries the right to deny the entry of GMOs. However, countries cannot ban imports on a whim or simply to protect their own producers. The decision must be based on sound science (involving an assessment of the risks involved) and the broad sharing of information about the products. Thus, the agreement makes operational\u2014for the first time in international environmental affairs\u2014the precautionary principle, laid out in the 1992 Rio Declaration, which states that \u201cWhere there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.\u201d 14 There were other stipulations in the protocol, including one about labeling shipments of GM products. The protocol was ratified by 147 countries (but not the United States) and became legally binding in 2003. Table 12\u20131 lists a number of actions we take to increase food production as well as actions and conditions that eventually lower our ability to produce food. Solutions to the problems modern agriculture causes are going to require us to modify the way we produce food. We will consider this topic later in the chapter. First, let\u2019s look at food distribution. We already produce a lot of food, so we could ask, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t everyone have healthy food?\u201d How are genetically modified crops different from crops produced by earlier plant breeding techniques?

Whenever climate, blight, or war interrupted the agricultural production of a region, the inevitable result was famine and death, sometimes on the scale of millions. Of course, refugees might flee a famine, and some cultures were naturally nomadic, so there was some moving around to escape famine. For the most part, however, natural disasters affected people locally but not people far away. This is one of the reasons the human population was relatively stable for thousands of years before the modern era. Trade on ancient routes moved goods from place to place in a limited way.", "This was expanded when colonies were established in the New World. Timber, furs, tobacco, fish, sugar, coffee, cotton, and other raw materials began to flow back to the Old World to be exchanged for manufactured goods. With the Industrial Revolution, and especially with refrigeration and faster shipping, trade between nations intensified, and soon it became economically feasible to ship basic foodstuffs around the world. As the world trade in foodstuffs increased, the need for self-sufficiency in food diminished. Like other sectors of the economy, food has become globalized. In 2013, world trade in agricultural products was worth nearly $1.75 trillion. Patterns in Food Trade Given this global pattern, agricultural production systems supply more than a country\u2019s internal food needs. For many countries (especially those of the developing world), commodities such as coffee, fruit, sugar, spices, palm oil, cocoa, and nuts provide the only significant export products. This trade clearly helps the exporter, and it allows importing nations to enjoy foods that they are unable to raise themselves or that are out of season. In a market economy, the exchange works well only as long as the importing nation can pay for the food. Cash is earned by exporting raw materials, fuel, manufactured goods, or special commodities. Grain on the Move. The most important foodstuffs on the world market are grains (corn, wheat, rice, barley, rye, and sorghum) and oilseeds, such as canola and soybeans. Some grain is imported by high- and middle-income countries to satisfy the rising demand for animal protein. Table 12\u20132 shows how the pattern of global trade in grain has changed over the past seven decades. In 1935, only Western Europe was importing grain; Asia, Africa, and Latin America were self-sufficient. By 1950, new patterns were emerging, and today the trade in grains\u2014as well as other basic foodstuffs\u2014 has changed again. North America has become the major source of exportable grains\u2014the world\u2019s \u201cbreadbasket\u201d or, in another sense, the world\u2019s \u201cmeat market.\u201d The trade in oilseeds is similarly lopsided. In this case, the United States, Argentina, and Brazil have a corner on the export trade, and Europe and China are major importers. Most oilseed is used as a protein supplement in animal feeds. Market Manipulation. Beginning in 2011, the government of Thailand, in order to support rural farmers, bought rice at above market value. 15 The Thai government withheld the rice from world trade in an attempt to drive up world prices. However, international traders quickly moved to purchase rice from India, Vietnam, and elsewhere as these countries increased production in response to the rice deficit. Thailand was left with storehouses of rice that it could not sell without steep losses. The Thai government had lost an estimated $4.4 billion. The program ran out of money and Thai farmers 15D. Kedmey, \u201cHow Thailand\u2019s Botched Rice Scheme Blew a Big Hole in Its Economy,\u201d Time (July 12, 2014), World.Time.com, accessed March 6, 2015, http://world.time.com/2013/07/12/how-thailands-botched-rice-scheme-blew a-big-hole-in-its-economy/. 12.3 Food Distribution and Trade 297 lost their source of stable income. In 2014, the stockpile of rice in Thailand was estimated at 18 million metric tons. An audit showed that 70% of the rice was beginning to degrade and one fifth was inedible. The government moved to sell the stockpile even at a loss. Although this attempt at market manipulation was a failure, there are times when stockpiling grain is appropriate. Keeping a Reserve. At no time in recent history has the world supply of grain run out. Worldwide, governments try to maintain 70 days worth of grain stored in reserves. Such reserves are often much higher, above 120 days during some years of the 1980s. In 2007, world grain reserves fell to 64 days, but rose shortly thereafter. In 2014, they reached 91 days. Despite these reserves, many people still lack food. This is primarily because they cannot afford to purchase it. Even if food production increases as rapidly as the population grows, some people will still be poor. This problem is the chief cause of hunger in the world today. The Global Food Crisis Between 2006 and 2008, the prices of food commodities on the world market rose precipitously\u2014on average, prices doubled (Table 12\u20133) . As a result, the price of foods increased greatly. These increases triggered food riots and emergency measures in many countries. This global food crisis demonstrated the interconnection of the global trade in food. Causes of the Food Crisis.", "One consequence of high commodity prices is that farmers get much higher prices for their crops; this is especially true for farmers in the higher-income countries that dominate the food export business. In contrast, farmers in developing countries are not connected to the world markets and therefore benefit little from high commodity prices. The developing countries whose food deficits force them to import commodities are faced with prices they can\u2019t afford. For most people in these countries, food expenditures are more than half of their income, and any increase in food price can result in an increase in hunger and malnutrition. Responses to the Food Crisis. The United Nations addressed the issue at a meeting before the World Food Summit in Rome in June 2009. This summit was the third World Food Summit; summits in 1996 and 2002 had led to verbal commitments to eradicate hunger and malnutrition. Although climate change and bioenergy were addressed, the conference shifted much of its focus to the existing world food crisis. One basic function of world conferences is to draw the attention of national leaders to international issues. As details of food shortages, high food prices, and shortfalls in aid were presented, the conference did indeed get the attention of national leaders. One response was that the World Bank began a new effort to provide immediate grants for food and agriculture in the poorest countries. RIO+20 More recently, the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro (called Rio+20) brought world leaders together to reassess progress 20 years after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. The document produced at Rio+20, The Future We Want, highlighted seven themes: jobs, energy, cities, food, water, oceans, and disasters. Food and agriculture were central topics of the meeting and the outcomes document. At Rio+20, countries were given a challenge\u2014to lower hunger to zero, a plan discussed shortly. CONCEPT CHECK Why did the government of Thailand purchase and store large quantities of rice? Why did their scheme backfire? \u2610\u2713 Food Security Bread for the World\u2019s Hunger Institute defines food security as \u201cassured access for every person to enough nutritious food to sustain an active and healthy life.\u201d 16 Food security is the responsibility of three levels of society: family, the nation, and the global community. At each level, the players are part of a market economy as well as a sociopolitical system. In a market economy, food flows in the direction of economic demand. Need is not taken into consideration. A cash economy, following the rules of the market, provides the opportunity to purchase food, but not the food itself. Where the economic status of the player is very low (a jobless parent, a poor country), another group or individual may be willing and able to provide the needed purchasing power or the food (but maybe not). Family Food Security. Family members purchase, raise, and gather food from natural ecosystems or have the food provided by someone, usually in the context of the family. When families cannot do so, they need a safety net\u2014policies or programs at the national, state, or local level whose objective is to meet the food security needs of all individuals in the society. Local food banks and community groups may provide food. In the United States, more than 50,000 local food charities help those who are hungry (Figure 12\u201315) . State and National Food Safety Nets. On a state and national level, safety-net policies and programs include a variety of welfare measures, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Supplemental Security Income program, and voluntary aid through hunger-relief 16Bread for the World Institute, \u201cAgriculture in the Global Economy Hunger 2003,\u201d 13th Annual Report on the State of World Hunger (Washington, DC: Bread for the World Institute, 2003), 20. Figure 12\u201315 Food safety net. When families have difficulty obtaining food, the local community is the first level of defense. These women are choosing produce from a church food bank. organizations. For example, Feeding America, a network of food banks throughout the country, is part of the voluntary safety net that provides emergency food help for more than 25 million Americans. Feeding America retrieves food from food processors and suppliers and distributes it to the organization\u2019s network of food banks. One federal law\u2014the Charity, Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment Act of 2003 (CARE Act)\u2014allows family farmers, ranchers, and restaurant owners to deduct the costs of food donated to agencies such as Feeding America as a charitable contribution.", "National self-sufficiency in food\u2014enough food to satisfy the nutritional needs of all of a country\u2019s people\u2014can be achieved by producing all the food people need or by buying the food on the world market. This goal implies that countries have policies that allow the poorest members into the market, such as a just land-distribution policy and a functioning market economy. Many nations, though, are not self-sufficient in food and turn to the global community for food aid and other forms of technical development assistance. International Food Safety Net. A substantial amount of food aid flows from rich countries to food-poor countries. However, much more food is imported and paid for by the developing countries. Unfortunately, protective policies in developed countries result in tariffs\u2014taxes the developed countries set on imported agricultural products\u2014and in subsidies given to the agricultural sector. U.S. farm bills have continued the subsidies of most agricultural products. The European Union is notorious for its high tariff barriers and large subsidies for its agricultural sector, even though it has reformed the rules for subsidies. Haiti is a good example of the problem of uneven trade policies. In 1995, it cut its tariff on rice from 50% to 3%, opening the country\u2019s markets to subsidized rice from the United States. By 2000, rice production in Haiti was cut in half, leaving thousands of small rice farmers without a means of livelihood. Haiti began to import rice. Haiti\u2019s problems were exacerbated by the 2010 earthquake. After the earthquake, several NGOs and scientists collaborated to try a new rice-growing initiative, which produced yields that were 64% higher, with fewer seeds and less water and fertilizer. However, uneven trading policies still make it difficult for Haitian farmers to survive in the world market. There are other initiatives that can help the poorer countries become self-sufficient in food. One of the most important is relieving the debt crisis in developing countries (Chapter 9) . Another factor in meeting global nutrition needs is the trade imbalance between the industrial and the developing countries. The globalization of markets is now working to the advantage of the developing countries, which have a surplus of labor and low labor costs. As a result, many industrial corporations have outsourced their manufacturing to developing countries, which is helping workers in developing countries improve their well-being. How do tariffs and subsidies affect food prices and distribution? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 12.4 Hunger, Malnutrition, and Famine 299 12.4 Hunger, Malnutrition, and Famine At a UN World Food Conference in 1974, delegates from all nations subscribed to the objective \u201cthat within a decade no child will go to bed hungry, that no family will fear for its next day\u2019s bread, and that no human being\u2019s future and capacities will be stunted by malnutrition.\u201d That was an unattained dream, though great strides have been made. In the Millennium Development Goals, the target was to cut world hunger in half by 2015 in the developing countries. This meant a reduction in the proportion of hungry people from 20% to 10%. That target was met, although the food crisis of 2007\u20132008 added 75 million to the 848 million people in the world still suffering from hunger and malnutrition. The Sustainable Development Goals are poised to continue the effort to cut hunger. Let\u2019s look at hunger and malnutrition in the world. Hunger and Nutrition Hunger is the general term referring to a lack of basic food required to provide energy and to meet nutritional needs such that the individual is unable to lead a normal, healthy life. Undernourishment is the lack of adequate food energy (usually measured in Calories). Malnutrition is the lack of essential nutrients, such as specific amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, and can occur in people who eat nutritionally poor diets even if they have other food available. Another nutritional disorder is overnourishment, a condition of eating too much. Overnourishment is becoming epidemic, even in many developing countries. Worldwide, more than 1.5 billion adults are overweight. This is partly the result of an obesogenic culture, one that promotes the consumption of calorie-rich foods and a sedentary lifestyle. More than one-third of the U.S. population is clinically obese (more than 30 pounds overweight). As the World Health Go lean with protein Choose low-fat or lean meats and poultry Vary your protein routine\u2013 choose more fish, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds Know your limits on fats, sugars, and sodium Your allowance for oils is 6 teaspoons a day.

Organization describes the situation, \u201c65% of the world\u2019s population lives in countries where overweight and obesity kill more people than underweight.\u201d 18 To address nutritional problems in the United States, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) established a graphic of a food plate (Figure 12\u201316) . The Food Plate Guide represents the kinds of foods that should be emphasized in a healthful diet\u2014fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and calcium-rich foods. Foods that are high in calories and saturated fats but have little nutritional value are to be avoided. Of course, healthy eating and exercise are both parts of a healthy lifestyle. Extent and Consequences of Hunger Accurate, reliable figures on the worldwide extent of hunger are unavailable, mainly because few governments document such figures. Hunger is often a seasonal phenomenon in rural areas that are supported by subsistence agriculture, as people are forced to ration their stored food in order to survive until the beginning of the next harvest. On the basis of household surveys, the FAO estimated in 2014 about 805 million people in the world are chronically undernourished, a drop of 120 million in less than five years. 19 This is great news, although the fact that hunger still occurs on a large scale should concern everyone. Where? Two-thirds of the world\u2019s undernourished people live in Asia. Yet in recent decades, Asia has experienced a dramatic decline in undernourishment, with the exception of western Asia. The region with the highest percentage of undernourished people is sub-Saharan Africa, where one person in three is afflicted. When faced with such large numbers, it is easy to lose track of the fact that each person is a unique individual whose potential, hopes, and dreams are limited by this lack of food. 18 World Health Organization, 2012 Obesity and Overweight Factsheet No. 311, 19 World Food Programme, Hunger Statistics 2014, accessed December 12, 2014, accessed March 6, 2012, http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/. http://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats. Figure 12\u201317 Malnourished children. These Guatemalan children are suffering from chronic malnourishment, a condition that can stunt their growth. Consequences. The effects of undernourishment and malnutrition are greatest in preschool children and next greatest in women. Hunger can prevent normal growth in children, leaving them thin, stunted, and often mentally and physically impaired ( Figure 12\u201317), a condition known as protein-energy malnutrition. Undernourishment in early childhood can seriously limit growth and intellectual development throughout life. In Guatemala, for example, half of the children under five are chronically undernourished, with rates much higher among indigenous people. This state of malnourishment irreversibly stunts children and inhibits their physical and mental capabilities. As adults, their productivity may be reduced by as much as a third. UNICEF estimated that chronic malnutrition costs Guatemala $8.4 million a day because of sickness, repeated schooling, hospitalization, and lowered productivity. Sickness and death are companions of hunger. Because poor nutrition lowers a person\u2019s resistance to disease, measles, malaria, and diarrheal diseases are common and are major causes of death in the malnourished and undernourished. Root Cause of Hunger As we have already seen, the root cause of hunger is poverty. Hungry and malnourished people lack either the money to buy food or enough land to raise their own. One FAO report on food insecurity states that \u201cMost of the widespread hunger in a world of plenty results from grinding, deeply rooted poverty.\u201d 20 Addressing hunger and the poverty that causes it will be essential to making progress toward all the other Sustainable Development Goals. One measure of progress toward reducing hunger is the proportion of children under five who are underweight because of chronic or acute hunger. Figure 12\u201318 20UN Food and Agriculture Organization, State of Food Insecurity in the World 2002 (Rome: UNFAO, 2003). 12.4 Hunger, Malnutrition, and Famine 301 compares data on the proportion of underweight children from 1990 and 2012, showing that several regions\u2014eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and northern Africa\u2014were on target to reduce this measure of hunger 50% by 2015.", "A number of countries significantly reduced the extent of poverty and hunger during the 1980s and 1990s. Indonesia has benefited from oil exports and Green Revolution technology, and it continues to put a major emphasis on rural development and the country\u2019s social infrastructure. Malawi has been able to double its agricultural productivity through a voucher program for fertilizer and seed, helping poor farmers feed their families and produce crops for the market. Thus it is possible for societies to make progress in reducing the extent of poverty and hunger. Yet in any given year, there are countries or even whole regions that face exceptional food emergencies. It is here that international responsibility comes most sharply into focus. Famine A famine is a severe shortage of food accompanied by malnutrition, epidemics, and a significant increase in the death rate.

(Source: Millennium Development Goals Report 2014 (New York: United Nations, 2014).) unwilling to distribute food to all segments of its population. In recent years, two factors\u2014drought and conflict\u2014have been immediate causes of famines. Drought. More than 70 million people who practice subsistence agriculture or tend cattle, sheep, and goats occupy the Sahel, the broad belt of drylands south of the Sahara in Africa. Although the region normally has enough rainfall to support dry grassland or savanna ecosystems, the rainfall is seasonal, undependable, and prone to failure. Drought and deforestation have brought on catastrophic desertification, which in turn has triggered massive dust storms that spread clouds of Sahara dust across the Atlantic Ocean and into the Northern Hemisphere. Drought is blamed for famines that occurred in the Sahel in 1968\u20131974, 1984\u20131985, and again in 2010\u20132012. Beginning in 1965, the region experienced 20 years of subnormal rainfall, with tragic results. Crops withered, forage for livestock declined, watering places dried up, and livestock died. Both farmers and pastoralists began abandoning their land and migrating toward urban centers, where they ended up in refugee camps. Unsanitary conditions in the camps led to the spread of infectious diseases such as dysentery and cholera, and many thousands died before effective aid could be organized. The 1984\u20131985 famine is thought to have been responsible for almost a million deaths in Ethiopia alone. The number would have been higher if not for aid extended by Africans and numerous international agencies. In the last few decades, rainfall in the Sahel has increased, although droughts are still the norm in this arid region. In 2003\u20132004, favorable weather led to desert locust infestations, which devastated crops in many regions. Although rainfall is normal in the western Sahel at present, the eastern Sahel\u2014the Horn of Africa\u2014remains in the grip of an extended drought that has put more than 23 million people at risk. The years 2010\u20132013 were particularly dry. Warning Systems. In order to prevent droughts from leading to famines, two major efforts provide crucial warnings about food insecurity in different regions. One, the FAO\u2019s Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS), monitors food supply and demand all over the world, watching especially for those places where food supply difficulties are expected or are happening. The GIEWS issues frequent reports and alerts that are usually the result of its field missions or on-the-ground reports from other UN agencies and NGOs. The agency also relies on satellite imagery to monitor crops. The second major effort is the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. FEWS NET is a partnership of agencies involved in satellite operations focusing on sub-Saharan Africa. It continually measures rainfall and agricultural conditions and gives governments and relief agencies accurate and timely assessments of the status of food security in African countries. Conflict. Devastating and prolonged civil warfare put millions of people at risk of famine.", "In the 1990s, war was the cause of the famines that threatened Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Rwanda, Sudan, Mozambique, Angola, and Congo. Continuing conflicts in Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Syria interfere with access to food, and a 30-year civil war in Guatemala helped to set the stage for the chronic malnutrition in that country, though it is not an actual famine. Famines from drought and war are preventable. India, Brazil, Kenya, and southern Africa have coped with droughts in recent years by mobilizing effective relief in the form of food, clothing, and medical assistance. Unfortunately, international aid often comes after a food shortage has become a famine (see Sustainability, Preventing Food Crises). Hunger Hot Spots Much of Africa has experienced long-term and severe droughts as well as widespread civil conflict. Erratic weather patterns and a general warming trend, thought by some scientists to be the outcome of global climate change, have caused crop harvests to oscillate between average and poor. Climate change is expected to affect global food production worldwide, lowering food production in South and Southeastern Asia, for example, by as much as 50% over the next three decades. Other countries with recurrent hunger and food insecurity include North Korea, Haiti, and Bangladesh. In 2014, the FAO identified 36 countries, including 26 African countries in need, as being \u201cin crisis and requiring external assistance.\u201d 21 The \u201cexternal assistance\u201d here is food aid; the reasons for the need vary from conflict to drought, floods, hurricanes, cyclones, and localized crop failures. Food Aid Widespread, severe hunger and famine are being averted today only because of food aid, though it does not always work as well as we would like. The World Food Program (WFP) of the United Nations coordinates global food aid, receiving donations from the United States, Japan, and the countries of the European Union. In addition, many nations conduct their own programs of food aid to needy countries. International food aid has fluctuated wildly. At about 6.2 million metric tons in 1996, it rose to 15 million metric tons in 1999 when the grain harvest in the Russian Federation collapsed and the United States increased aid. It dropped to less than 5.0 million metric tons in 2011 (Figure 12\u201319). Food aid is distributed to countries all over the world, not just where famines are threatened. Food aid is negotiated on the world stage. In April 2012, a new Food Assistance Convention (FAC) was agreed on (replacing the Food Aid Convention of 1999). This international treaty requires members to provide a minimum amount of food assistance. The 2012 FAC also addressed concerns about the problems of food aid, including activities that foster dependence, and problems caused by aid that isn\u2019t useful to the recipients. 21UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Crop Prospects and Food Situation, No. 1 (Rome: UNFAO, 2009). 12.4 Hunger, Malnutrition, and Famine 303 Food aid (thousands of metric tons) 18,000 16,000 14,000 12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 WORLD FOOD AID (MILLIONS METRIC TONS) 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Figure 12\u201319 Global food aid. Global food aid from 1993 to 2012. Orange indicates food aid delivered by the World Food Program; green indicates food aid from all sources. (Source: World Food Program annual reports, FAIS, UNFAO.) When Aid Doesn\u2019t Help. Numerous humanitarian campaigns to end world hunger have been mounted in the past 50 years. The United States and Canada have been world leaders in giving away food (which is first purchased from farmers and, therefore, represents a subsidy). A number of serious famines have been moderated or averted by these efforts, and certainly the need for ongoing emergency food aid is undeniable. However, routinely supplying food aid in an attempt to alleviate chronic hunger in developing countries can be the worst thing to do. Why is a routine supply of food aid a problem? Free or very cheap foreign food undercuts the local market. In effect, local farmers must compete economically with free or low-cost imported food. When they cannot earn a profit, local farmers stop producing and eventually enter the ranks of the poor. In the long run, the entire local economy deteriorates. Another way that food aid fails results from the cost and time required to store and ship food.", "The U.S. food aid program, the largest humanitarian food assistance program in the world, gives much of its aid under regulations that require the purchase and shipment of U.S. food around the world. 22 Food produced in the United States moves more slowly, in some cases requiring 147 days rather than the 35 days it could have taken if locally sourced. Furthermore, a portion of the aid must be shipped on U.S. flagged vessels. Purchasing and shipping food from the United States costs a great deal more than purchasing food elsewhere. From 2003 to 2012, USAID spent $7.4 billion on food for aid and $9 billion on shipping and logistics. While most donor countries now use a system of cash or vouchers, the United States continues to use a system that wastes time and funds, 22A. Sreevatsan and R. Andersson, \u201cAid Undermined,\u201d Medill National Security Reporting Project 2014, accessed December 9, 2014, http://foodaid .nationalsecurityzone.org/aid-undermined/. although the 2014 Farm Bill did include a few changes to make the system more efficient. When It Does Help. The World Food Programme (WFP) is aware of the problem of local economy collapse and targets most of its food aid to emergency situations. Some aid goes to development projects, benefiting poor people in countries where food security is at risk and regions where malnutrition is severe. The intention of this aid is to free poor people of the need to provide food for their families and allow them to devote their efforts to other development activities. As an important component of this strategy, the WFP now makes 80% of its food purchases in the developing countries themselves. This is a win-win solution, where small-scale farmers receive income for their crops and needy people are fed. In fact, WFP has special programs designed to prevent hunger by better connecting poor farmers to the market. The Goal Is Zero, the Way There Is Complex Alleviating hunger is primarily a matter of addressing the absolute poverty that afflicts one of every five people on the planet. At the 2012 Rio+20 summit, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon offered the Zero Hunger Challenge to the world. Ki-moon said that achieving zero hunger would lower conflict and increase productivity and prosperity. The challenge was focused on five objectives: 100% access to adequate food all year round; zero stunted children under two years old and no more malnutrition in pregnancy and early childhood; all food systems sustainable; 100% growth in smallholder productivity and income, particularly for women; and zero loss or waste of food, including responsible consumption. It is a tall order, but to get anywhere, we must begin by setting high goals. Although food is our most vital resource, we do not treat it as a commons; it is not free to all who need it. Indeed, the production and distribution of food constitute one of the most important economic enterprises on Earth. What has not been done, however, is to bring the market economy under the discipline of sustainability. Short-term profit crowds out long-term sustainable management of natural resources. We understand the situation well, but the solutions are not simple. The solutions lie in the realm of political and social action at all levels of responsibility. Given the current groundswell of concern about the environment and the global attention to the Millennium Development Goals and, we hope, the Sustainable Development Goals, there may never be a better time to turn things around and take more seriously our responsibilities as stewards of the planet and as our brothers\u2019 (and sisters\u2019) keepers. What are three components of effective food aid? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 12.5 Feeding the World as We Approach 2030\u20132050 Looking ahead to 2020, we need to be able to feed an additional 700 million people and also make significant progress toward meeting the Sustainable Development Goal of eliminating existing hunger and malnutrition in the world\u2014and do so without the unsustainable practices agriculture currently employs. Is this possible? What will we need to do as we look even further ahead, to 2030 and 2050? Given the limits on suitable land for agriculture, there are several prospects for increasing the supply of food. We could continue to increase crop yields with new technologies. We could grow food crops on land that is now used for feedstock crops, biofuels, or cash crops. We could use new agricultural opportunities such as urban agriculture and mixed permacultures.", "We could also attempt to feed more people with the food we already produce by changing social structures so more people have a chance to enter the market\u2014 and by eating foods that require less fuel, water, land, and pesticides to produce. Increasing Food Production A dramatic rise in crop yields in the developing countries was the major accomplishment of the Green Revolution: Wheat yields tripled, rice and corn yields more than doubled, potato yields rose 78%, and cassava yields rose 36%, according to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Interestingly, grain yields have continued to rise in some of the developed countries, too. In France, for example, wheat yields have quadrupled since 1950, reaching more than 7.4 tons per hectare (2.93 tons per acre). In the same period, rice yields in Japan have risen 170%. Indeed, the genetic potential exists for wheat yields of 14 tons per hectare or higher, and rice yields can be as high as 13 tons per hectare under the right conditions. Can we expect yields to continue to increase up to their genetic potential? Environmental Limits. It turns out that the great differences in grain yields among regions have less to do with the genetic strains used and more to do with the weather. Egypt and Mexico, for example, irrigate their wheat and get higher yields, while U.S. wheat is rain-fed. Australian wheat yields are even lower, the result of the country\u2019s sparse rainfall. Once the agricultural land is planted with high-yielding strains and fertilized to the maximum, other factors\u2014soil, rainfall, and available sunlight\u2014limit productivity. These environmental limits are a reminder that agricultural sustainability is highly dependent on the conservation of soil and water (Chapters 10 and 11). Doubly Green. Some people still see the Green Revolution as the way forward. Gordon Conway, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, has called for a \u201cDoubly Green Revolution,\u201d by which he means, \u201ca revolution that is even more productive than the first Green Revolution and even more \u2018green\u2019 in terms of conserving natural resources and the environment. During the next three decades, it must aim to repeat the successes of the Green Revolution on a global scale in many diverse localities and be equitable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly.\u201d 23 New Developments in Breeding. One part of the next generation of agriculture is the development of super green rice. Developed using modern breeding techniques but not genetic engineering, super green rice is a group of about 250 varieties of rice bred to survive on marginal lands. These varieties may be tolerant of salt or drought or have other capabilities that allow them to survive in poor conditions. As a result, they require less fertilizer, water, and pesticides than GM and other high-yield crops commonly used in modern agriculture. A new technique called marker-assisted breeding can speed up traditional plant breeding. In this technique, scientists use DNA sequencing to identify genes for desirable traits in crop plants or their wild ancestors. Then plants with the desired gene are crossbred with a modern crop breeding line. Screening the DNA of seedlings for the desired gene makes the process move more quickly. Crops being developed with this approach include high-calcium \u201csuper-carrots,\u201d potatoes with more starch, and pigeon peas with higher yields. Expanding Our Diets. One way to increase the supply of food is to eat a broader range of foods. Insects, for example, are protein-rich and have always been a part of the diet in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Worldwide, about 1,900 insect species are consumed by humans. Raising insects for food would provide jobs and lower food insecurity. Insects can also be fed to poultry and fish, thereby freeing up grain for human consumption. 23Gordon Conway, The Doubly Green Revolution: Food for All in the 21st Century (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1999). Values Relative to 1970 300 250 200 150 100 Year Using Current Production More Effectively One way to feed more people is to use what we are producing more efficiently. Several mechanisms for this are to divert less human food to animal feed and biofuels, to eat locally, and to reduce food waste. Fewer Crops to Animal Food and Biofuels. We can switch from the production of feed grain and cash crops to food for people. Almost 70% of domestic grain in the United States is used to feed livestock. The percentages drop over other regions of the world in proportion to the economic level of the region.", "Sub-Saharan Africa and India, for example, use only 2% of their grain to feed livestock. The current trend, however, is in exactly the opposite direction ( Figure 12\u201320) . More people want to eat higher on the food chain. A more sustainable approach is to find a balance in which people have protein in their diets but are not heavily dependent on meat. In other words, people in developed countries need to eat lower on the food chain, allowing others to eat more. Locavore, Anyone? Eating locally lowers the environmental cost of food because it reduces the need for transportation and refrigeration. It also reduces food waste, at least to some extent. Locavores are people who try to purchase or grow most of their food within their own region. Of course, many foods are not available in all seasons so foods have to be preserved in some way. Community-supported agriculture programs (CSAs) are on the rise in American urban and suburban areas. People support CSAs by purchasing shares of the produce from local farms and often by volunteering ( Figure 12\u201321) . Because shares are purchased in advance, the risks of a poor crop are shared, so farmers need to borrow less money and are likely to weather difficult seasons more easily. CSA programs are popular because they provide fresh local produce and support for farms that might not be economically viable if they 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 12.5 Feeding the World as We Approach 2030\u20132050 305 Figure 12\u201320 Global population and grain and meat production. Grain production has kept up with the population increase, and meat production has greatly outpaced it over the past 35 years. High meat consumption in the West makes it difficult to produce food sustainably. (Source: FAOSTAT.) had to compete with cheap food trucked long distances from industrial farms. Waste Not, Want Not. Eliminating food waste would allow us to feed more people without using more resources. This important concept is covered elsewhere ( Chapters 2 , 10 ). Many of the causes of waste are systemic and not easily solved. As the example of rice stores in Thailand shows, storage of food has impacts on economic markets and includes the risk of spoilage. Sometimes there is a trade-off between public health concerns and reducing waste. For example, health regulations control what restaurants can do with leftover food and how long food can be on store shelves. Changes in these regulations could help us waste less of the food we raise. Figure 12\u201321 Community-supported agriculture. This woman runs a CSA farm in West Falmouth, Maine. CSA s lower the financial risk for farmers and increase access to local produce. Sustainable Agriculture Modern agriculture has too many externalities to be sustainable. We cannot set up our most important systems (such as food production) to constantly damage the very ecosystems on which we depend. Feeding many people sustainably is going to take something different than more of the same. It will require sustainable agriculture, that is, agriculture that can be carried on indefinitely without environmental harm. What would sustainable agriculture look like? It might include some of the large farms we are used to, though with fewer chemicals, fewer fossil fuels, and fewer of the most wasteful types of irrigation (as we have seen in other chapters). It would include various forms of organic farming. But it will also require wildly creative approaches very different from industrial agriculture, such as the intensive, mixed-product (polyculture) urban farm described in the story of Growing Power at the beginning of this chapter. Here are some trends in the future of food production. Organic Farms. Organic farming has been around a long time and overlaps with many other sustainable practices. In the United States, the USDA can certify farms as organic. Certified organic farms have to meet strict criteria. They are limited to natural pesticide products and cannot use the artificial fertilizers typical of modern agriculture. Often, organic farm yields are somewhat lower and organic food prices higher. In one study of more than 322 research papers, scientists found that organic yields were 80% of conventional yields on average (with a great deal of variability). However, in intensive mixed cultures (such as the Growing Power farm), with practices where different types of crops are grown together (companion planting) and the natural enemies of pests are supported, yields can be high (Chapter 13). In the United States, certified organic farms cannot use GM crops.", "This is a controversial issue. Many people who support organic farming also see GM crops (especially those modified for drought or salt tolerance or enhanced nutrition) as one of the tools we will need to use to feed the world. It is also difficult to keep organic farms GM free; farmers often find their crops contaminated with GM crop plants. As a result of some of these limitations, many farms that use less polluting methods are not certified as organic by the USDA. Urban Agriculture. Urban farming occurs across the world and is part of the future of food production. Cuba is the poster country for urban farming and the only country in the world with extensive state-supported urban agriculture. Food shortages of the 1990s drove a grassroots effort to produce food in Cuban city neighborhoods. To meet the needs of small-scale urban farmers, the Cuban government created an Urban Agriculture Department. It provides expertise and places to buy seeds and equipment and supports infrastructure. In Havana alone, there are more than 30,000 people growing food in more than 8,000 farms and gardens ( Figure 12\u201322) . Cubans even grow rice in small plots. Figure 12\u201322 Urban agriculture. A man thinning seedlings in an urban garden in Havana, Cuba. Small-scale rice production now rivals the large-scale production of large farms in Cuba. Urban Foraging. Another model of urban food production is foraging. Urban foragers find fruits, berries, and other foods available in the urban landscape. Sometimes they create urban food maps, which are available on the Web. There is a growing community of urban foragers. In Seattle, community organizers designed a 7-acre mixed foraging and garden plot area called an urban food forest. Initially designed as a class project, this food forest (the Beacon Food Forest) expects to use grants to become the largest urban food forest on U.S. public land. The project will be realized over a period of years. Algae to the Rescue. Imagine a world in which nutritious algae grow in fish tanks on nearly everyone\u2019s windowsills, farms in the ocean produce edible seaweeds, algae are grown in ponds and tanks for fish food, and vast bags of wastewater are treated with algae, which are then fed to fish (Figure 12\u201323) . Algae in ditches at the edges of farm fields take up nutrients and provide a rich fertilizer for the fields. Algae are also used to produce biofuels. That imagined future is now. Work is proceeding rapidly on all of these fronts to produce a world in which algae can be used in a wide array of ways. Food from algae is very 12.5 Feeding the World as We Approach 2030\u20132050 307 Figure 12\u201323 Algae for food. NASA has a project for algal treatment of wastewater. The algae are then fed to fish. Other researchers are inves-tigating the use of algae as biofuels. Figure 12\u201324 Permanent polyculture. Polycultures have a variety of perennial plants in an agricultural setting. On this Welsh farm, fruit trees, herbs, wildflowers, and vegetables grow together. nutritious, high in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants. As sources of biofuel, algae are competitive because of their high oil content; as nutrient extractors, algae are efficient because of their rapid growth. Dr. Aaron Baum is a good example of an algal entrepreneur. He is working with NASA, which has a large algae project (the OMEGA project) designed to use wastewater to raise algae for biofuel production. But Baum\u2019s major effort is with small food algae production. He designs kits for people to raise Spirulina, an extremely nutritious type of algae found in food supplements. Instead of taking a small-scale idea and trying to scale up to industrial levels, Baum is trying to make household-sized algae-growing apparatuses that can be used by any apartment dweller to grow healthy food. Laboratory-Grown Meat. This high-tech world of food and fuel grown in vats or petri dishes may also soon include lab-grown meats. Eating meat is environmentally costly in part because we have to raise whole animals, a very inefficient effort. Scientists are working on raising meat products that can be grown in the lab, in the hopes of allowing us to eat meat without the downsides of current animal farming. This is a long way off, but may be important in the future. Permanent Polycultures. In Salina, Kansas, Wes Jackson has spent a career working toward another model of sustainable agriculture.", "Instead of the conventional monoculture that is susceptible to insects and diseases and drought, Jackson and his colleagues are trying to create an agricultural system modeled on a native prairie. What they describe is permanent polyculture, a group of perennial plants of different species grown together that produce food or fuel. This is hard to achieve, in part because perennial plants put more energy into roots and leaves and less into the parts of the plant we eat. There are other models of permanent polyculture, such as the field shown in Figure 12\u201324 . This type of research is important to a radically new approach to food production. Policy Change The future also needs to include policy and individual changes. U.S. farm policies currently encourage large farms, support fewer workers, discourage sustainable agriculture, and subsidize industrial agriculture to the detriment of the environment. Incorporating externalities such as the true cost of erosion, water pollution, or overuse of water resources into the price of food would go a long way to changing the way we produce food. Finding ways to support farmers in the United States without subsidizing large industrial agriculture and CAFOs at the expense of small or organic farmers and small farmers abroad would go a long way toward solving job and food insecurity. Providing means to get crop insurance for small farmers, including subsistence farmers, would help lessen their vulnerability to the environmental changes we anticipate with climate change. Furthermore, food aid needs to be structured in a way that does not undermine local economies or waste money on shipping. On the international level, middle-income countries are home to the majority of hungry and malnourished people. Therefore efforts to increase economic development need to support individual access to food, not just the average wealth of nations. Efforts to address climate change are also essential to increasing food security (Chapter 18). Individuals need to feel connected to the rest of the world and empowered to do something about the big issues of our time. One part of this is transparency from producers. Just as wood and fish are certified sustainable (Chapter 7) and food can be certified organic (Chapter 13), requiring transparency in food systems can help consumers make better decisions. Food production is central to every topic in environmental science. In order to solve environmental problems, we will need to have new ways of approaching them.

Pests and Pest Control What do the city of Lubbock, Texas, and the New York City subway have in com mon? In 2014, they both dealt with outbreaks of bedbugs (Cimex lectularius). Bedbugs, once common in the United States, had been well controlled since World War II, but have resurged to epidemic proportions in recent years. Small blood-sucking wingless insects, bedbugs are a public health nuisance. Their bites cause itchy rashes, though they do not transmit other diseases. While bedbug-sniffing dogs can be used to pinpoint infestations, getting rid of the pests can be extremely difficult.", "Bedbugs lay a lot of eggs, can hide in small cracks, and can go a year without feeding. Once controlled by DDT, a pesticide no longer in use in the United States, bedbugs are finding the modern world to their liking. They are spread by an increase in domestic and international travel and can be found in hotels ranging from cheap to expensive. Many are resistant to the pesticides we do use. Some bedbugs in New York City are 264 times more resistant to a common pesticide than similar bedbugs in Florida. Once established, bedbugs are terribly difficult to eradicate. One Particularly Bad Outbreak. In 2010, a particularly bad summer outbreak of bedbugs prompted five states to ask the Department of Defense for resources to get rid of the pests. The state of Ohio petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for permission to use a pesticide, Propoxur, for in-home use. The petition was denied because of concerns about the effect of the chemical on children, leaving Ohio in a quandry. Bedbug research found that the foggers, or pesticide bombs, commonly used in other types of domestic infestations are ineffective against the insects. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the EPA gave a joint statement about bedbugs as a public health concern. Among the non-chemical means of controlling bedbugs, the CDC recommends vacuuming regularly, sealing cracks, treating with heat, removing clutter, and monitoring. A dry soil called diatomaceous earth, which is non-toxic but scratches the waxy coating found on bedbugs, can also be distributed. Bedbugs are a modern scourge, highly adapted to survive attempts to get rid of them. A Great Illustration. Bedbugs are a great illustration of the issues surrounding controlling pests: the costs of pests, the difficulties with chemical controls, and the need for a combination of treatments used in concert. The heyday of chemical pesticides as a silver bullet is over due to their 13.1 The Need for Pest Control Since earliest times, humans have suffered frustration and losses brought on by destructive pests. To this day, farmers, herdsmen, and homeowners wage a constant battle against the insects, plant pathogens, and unwanted plants that compete with them for the biological use of crops, animals, and homes. Pests are organisms that interfere with human endeavors. Pests include a wide variety of organisms\u2014insects, weeds, molds, pathogens, and nuisance wild animals. Of course, this is a very human-centered approach; we call a species a pest if we do not like how it affects us. In reality, pests are not a scientific category. The emphasis in this chapter is on those pests that affect agriculture, households, stored products, wood products, and structures. Other chapters consider nuisance wild animals, non-native species in natural ecosystems, and pathogens (Chapters 6, 7, and 17). 13.1 The Need for Pest Control 311 environmental effects and pesticide resistance. Now we have to use new and innovative approaches to pests, whether they are found in agricultural settings, in structures, in the flour on your pantry shelf, or in beds. In this chapter, we will connect the issues of pests in our daily lives to environmental science. Types of Pests Pests are often defined by the type of activity they disturb or what they live on. Agricultural pests are organisms that feed on agricultural crops, ornamental plants, or animals. The most notorious of these organisms are insects, but certain fungi, viruses, worms, snails, rodents, and birds also fit into the category (Figure 13\u20131a\u2013c) . Weeds are plants that compete with agricultural crops, forests, and forage grasses for light and nutrients (Figure 13\u20131d) . Some weeds poison cattle or have other serious effects; others simply detract from the appearance of lawns and gardens. Pests also destroy important crops. In the 1990s, Russia suffered a 70% yield loss from a potato fungus, Phythophtora infestans, considered to be global agriculture\u2019s worst crop disease. Another fungal pest, soybean rust, has spread throughout South America, causing $2 billion in losses in Brazil alone in 2004. A 2011 plague of mice in Australia caused more than $300 million in crop losses. (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 13\u20131 Agricultural pests and weeds. (a) Soybean rust. (b) Cotton boll weevil. (c) Male medfly. (d) Giant hogweed. (a) (b) Figure 13\u20132 Veterinary and medical pests. (a) The dog tick is a veterinary pest. (b) The Anopheles mosquito can transmit malaria. Veterinary pests affect domestic animals. These include the screwworm fly, for example, or fleas, ticks, and mites (Figure 13\u20132a) .", "Often such pests are disease vectors. They may be similar to pests attacking humans, the medical pests. Houseflies are significant pests because they can carry diseases onto food, especially from manure sources. Darkling beetles are significant pests of poultry production worldwide; they carry human and animal diseases and destroy insulation. Mosquitoes (Figure 13\u20132b) carry dengue and yellow fevers and malaria; snails carry schistosomiasis, and chagas bugs carry a protozoan parasite. Other medical pests, such as the bedbug mentioned earlier, carry no diseases. The malaria-carrying mosquito, one of the most important medical pests, will be discussed at some length later (see Stewardship, DDT for Malaria Control) though many medical pests are discussed elsewhere ( Chapter 17) . Forest pests destroy living trees and wood products. The mountain pine beetle is devastating to forest ecosystems (Chapter 7). Other wood pests include beetles such as the em erald ash borer (Figure 13\u20133a) . Originally from Russia, China, Japan, and Korea, the beautiful green beetle was first discovered in the United States in 2002. Since then it has spread to at least 24 states and parts of Canada. Its spread is monitored with purple traps visible along highways ( Figure 13\u20133b) . The beetle burrows into the layers directly under the bark of ash trees, destroying the layers and killing the trees. The borer threatens the nearly 7.5 billion trees (about 37.5 million in urban and suburban settings) of several ash species in North America. A 2012 report estimated that the emerald ash borer and another forest pest, the Asian longhorned beetle, cost $1.7 billion in local government expenditures annually and an additional $830 million in lost property values. Stored-product pests live in items such as cereals and processed foods. Rice weevils and flour moths may be familiar pests in kitchen pantries. The Khapra beetle (Trogoderma granarium) is one you probably have not seen (a) Figure 13\u20133 Emerald ash borer. (a) Emerald ash borers are forest pests that tunnel into the bark of ash trees and kill them. (b) Traps for emerald ash borers are found along roads. They are important parts of monitoring the movement of the insects. (b) 13.1 The Need for Pest Control 313 because of the efforts of federal agents to keep it out of the country. It is tiny; can eat many types of food; is resistant to many pesticides; and can even survive without food for long periods. Between 2001 and 2013, this beetle was intercepted about 200 times a year in various products at U.S. borders. Sometimes border agents use trained canines to detect such pests ( Figure 13\u20134). Biofouling organisms are organisms that settle on surfaces in aquatic environments. Some make shipping more expensive and less fuel efficient; others clog intake pipes and screens for industries. Anything in the water can be covered. Biofouling is described later (see Sound Science, Marine Fouling Organisms: Keeping One Step Ahead of the Barnacles). Other types of pests specialize on cloth, leather, feathers, paper, and various other products. The Cost of Controlling Pests. Part of the credit for modern human prosperity can be attributed to pest control. Two of the most frequently used tools in this effort are pesticides, chemicals that kill animals and insects thought to be pests, and herbicides, chemicals that kill plants. The use of pesticides and herbicides is quite costly. Recently, the EPA estimated that efforts to control pests in the United States involved the use of 1.133 billion pounds (514,000 metric tons) of herbicides and pesticides annually ( Figure 13\u20135), at a direct cost of $12.5 billion. According to the EPA, 5.21 billion pounds (2.4 million metric tons) of pesticides were used worldwide in 2007, at a cost of $39 billion. 1 Many of 1EPA Pesticide Sales and Usage 2006\u20132007 Market Estimates Report, 2011, available at http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/pestsales/07pestsales/table_of_contents 2007.htm.

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agriculture specialist works with an agricultural detector beagle. This team works to find invasive species or banned products, some containing insects known to be harmful to U.S. agriculture. the changes in agricultural technology, such as monoculture and the widespread use of genetically identical crops, have boosted yields. Yet despite the use of pesticides, the proportion of crops lost to pests has increased. Depending on the crop and region, the losses to pests range from 20% to more than 50%. 2", "During the past half-century, the use of herbicides and pesticides multiplied manyfold, leading to an unsustainable dependency on them. 2E.

(Source: Data from the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs.) 1996 2000 2004 2007 SOUND SCIENCE Pests and Climate Change. It is hard to predict the exact effects climate change will have on pests, but scientists are trying to figure out trends as the world changes. Many insects, including several of medical or agricultural importance, are already increasing their ranges, and pathogens will respond to changes in precipitation, temperature, and weather events. In North America, ticks are increasing as a result of warmer temperatures. Researchers anticipate some increase in crop pests such as nematodes and weevils that attack the roots of the plantain, a crop in the tropics, as temperatures increase. In other places, drought may lower mosquito populations. Overall, scientists expect an increase in pests, but a great deal of research still needs to be done. Different Philosophies of Pest Control Medical practice employs several basic means of treating infectious diseases. One approach is to give the patient a massive dose of antibiotics or other medicines, hoping to either eliminate the pathogen or stop it before it can get established. Another approach is to stimulate the patient\u2019s immune system with a vaccine to produce long-lasting protection against any future invasion. Yet another is to prevent a patient from becoming ill in the first place by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and cutting down on activities that transmit disease (for example, by washing hands or avoiding sneezing on others). In practice, all of these means are often used to keep a particular pathogen under control. 13.2 Chemical Treatment: Promises and Problems 315 The same basic philosophies govern the control of pests. Sometimes we use chemical treatment. Like the use of antibiotics and other medicines, chemical treatment seeks to eradicate or greatly lessen the numbers of the pest organism. Although it has had much success, this approach gives only short-term protection. Furthermore, the chemical often has side effects that are highly damaging to other organisms. A different approach is ecological pest control. Like stimulating the body\u2019s immune system, this approach seeks to give long-lasting protection by developing control agents on the basis of knowledge of the pest\u2019s life cycle and its ecological relationships. Such agents, which may be other organisms or chemicals, work in one of two ways: Either they are highly specific for the pest species being fought, or they manipulate one or more aspects of the ecosystem. Ecological control emphasizes the protection of people and domestic plants and animals from damage from pests rather than eradication of the pest organism. Thus, the benefits of pest control can be obtained while maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem. These two philosophies are combined in the approach called integrated pest management (IPM). IPM is an approach to controlling pest populations by using all suitable methods\u2014chemical and ecological\u2014in a way that brings about long-term management of pest populations with minimal environmental impact. This approach is increasing in usage, especially where pesticides are seen as undesirable because of health risks and in developing countries where the cost of pesticides is often prohibitive. Why does ecological pest control lead to fewer pests than chemical treatments do? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 13.2 Chemical Treatment: Promises and Problems Pesticides are categorized according to the group of organisms they kill. There are insecticides for insects, rodenticides for mice and rats, fungicides for fungi, and herbicides for plants. None of these chemicals, however, is entirely specific to the organisms it was designed to control; they can all pose hazards to other organisms, including humans. Development of Chemical Pesticides and Their Successes Finding effective materials to combat pests is an ongoing endeavor. The early substances used to control agricultural pests, frequently called first-generation pesticides, included toxic heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, and mercury. Scientists now recognize that these substances may accumulate in soils, inhibit plant growth, and poison animals and humans. In addition, toxic heavy metals lose their effectiveness as pests become increasingly resistant to them.", "For example, in the early 1900s, citrus growers were able to kill 90% of injurious scale insects (minute insects that suck the juices from plant cells) by placing a tent over an infested tree and piping in deadly cyanide gas for a short time. By 1930, this same technique killed as little as 3% of these pests. The next step had its origins in the science of organic chemistry. During the 19th century, chemists synthesized thousands of organic compounds, but for the most part, these compounds sat on shelves because uses for them had not yet been found. By the 1930s, however, with agriculture expanding to meet the needs of a rapidly increasing population and with first-generation pesticides failing, farmers needed something new. In time, second-generation pesticides, as they came to be called, were developed as a result of synthetic organic chemistry. One of the most famous is the pesticide DDT. The DDT Story. In the 1930s, a Swiss chemist named Paul Mler began systematically testing some organic chemicals for their effect on insects. In 1938, he hit on the chemical dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a chlorinated hydrocarbon that had first been synthesized some 50 years earlier. Just traces of DDT killed flies in Mler\u2019s laboratory. DDT appeared to be nothing less than the long-sought \u201cmagic bullet,\u201d a chemical that was extremely toxic to insects and yet seemed nontoxic to humans and other mammals. It was inexpensive to produce and effective against a broad spectrum of insect pests ( Figure 13\u20136) . In addition, it was persistent (it did not break down readily in the environment) and, hence, provided lasting protection. (DDT belongs to a group of chemicals now called persistent organic pollutants.) This persistence lowered cost by eliminating both the material and the labor expense of repeated treatments. Figure 13\u20136 DDT in war. During and after World War II, DDT was sprayed to kill vectors of typhus, malaria, and other diseases with great success. This image from 1945 shows a U.S. soldier spraying DDT directly on a fellow soldier. In War . . . During World War II, DDT quickly became indispensible. The military used it to control body lice that spread typhus fever. As a result, World War II was one of the first wars in which fewer people died of typhus than of battle wounds. On the island of Saipan, DDT helped in the fight against dengue fever. The World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations used DDT throughout the tropical world to control mosquitoes and greatly reduced the number of deaths caused by malaria. There is little question that DDT saved millions of lives. In fact, the virtues of DDT were so outstanding that Mler was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1948 for his discovery. And in Peace. Postwar uses of DDT expanded dramatically. The chemical was sprayed on forests to control spruce budworm, on salt marshes to kill nuisance mosquitoes, on suburbs to control the beetles that spread Dutch elm disease. DDT even proved highly effective in controlling agricultural insect pests. Indeed, DDT was so effective that many crop yields increased dramatically. Growers could ignore other, more painstaking methods of pest control such as crop rotation and the destruction of old crop residues. They could grow more productive but less resistant varieties. They could grow certain crops in a broader range of conditions. In short, DDT gave growers more options for growing the most economically productive crop. The success of DDT led to the development of a great variety of synthetic organic pesticides. Currently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Pesticide Program regulates more than 18,000 pesticide products, most of which are synthetic organic pesticides. Examples and some characteristics of these insecticides and herbicides are listed in Table 13\u20131. Problems Stemming from Chemical Pesticide Use Overuse of chemical pesticides has led to a wide range of environmental and human health problems. Human health effects are of particular concern, especially when pesticides get into water bodies and groundwater. People who work directly with pesticides, especially with inadequate safety gear, and children, whose developing bodies are heavily affected by toxins, are among the most vulnerable. Adverse Human Health Effects. As with all toxic substances, pesticides can be responsible for both acute and chronic health effects. Acute Effects. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, more than 88,690 persons called poison control centers after having been exposed to pesticides in the United States during 2012.", "Those with the most exposure were farm workers or employees of pesticide companies who came in direct contact with the chemicals. Different pesticides affect different human systems: glyphosate poisoning, for example, can lead to nausea, abdominal pain, shock, and respiratory failure; pyrethrin poisoning leads to allergic reactions, seizures, pneumonia, and coma. There is no global documentation of pesticide poisoning; however, the WHO has recently proposed standards for diagnosis and identification of acute pesticide poisoning cases. The WHO has estimated that there are 1 million serious poisoning episodes per year leading to hospitalization, but numbers are far higher when detailed household surveys are taken. Most of these cases occur in developing countries, where regulations and training are often lax and information on pesticides may be poorly understood. The use of pesticides by untrained persons is considered to be the major cause of these poisonings ( Figure 13\u20137), but in many cases, children and families come in contact with the pesticides through aerial spraying, the dumping of pesticide wastes, incorrect storage of pesticides in the home, or the use of pesticide containers to store drinking water. Figure 13\u20137 Pesticides used unsafely. This farmer in Thailand is spraying pesticide on soybeans, without the benefit of protective gear. Chronic Effects. Pesticides are applied to fields and orchards to reduce pest damage to crops. They are also used to protect harvested food so that it is brought undamaged to market. Because of the wide-ranging use of pesticides by most farmers, consumers are inevitably exposed to pesticide residues on their food and farmers are exposed to low levels even when they avoid acute exposure. Symptoms of pesticide poisoning (headaches, blurred vision, fainting, and nausea) are often similar to other illnesses, so exposure may not be diagnosed. The public-health concern is that pesticides might have chronic effects including the potential for causing cancer, as indicated by animal testing. In fact, evidence of carcinogenicity has been observed for many pesticides. Epidemiological evidence has implicated organochlorine pesticides in various cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. Other chronic effects include dermatitis, neurological disorders including permanent brain and nerve damage, birth defects, and infertility. For example, male sterility has been clearly linked to dibromochloropropane (DBCP), once used to control nematodes but now banned. Two disorders recently associated with pesticide use are suppression of the immune system and disruption of the endocrine system. New epidemiological evidence suggests that long-term exposure to pesticides can trigger Parkinson\u2019s disease in some people. Workers in India and Russia exposed to pesticides 13.2 Chemical Treatment: Promises and Problems 317 experienced abnormally low white blood cell counts. (White blood cells are crucial elements of the immune system.) Endocrine Disruption. Laboratory tests have shown that a number of pesticides, including atrazine and alachlor (herbicides) and DDT, endosulfan, diazinon, and methoxychlor (insecticides), interfere with reproductive hormones. These endocrine disruptors are described at length elsewhere ( Chapter 22). A rise in the incidence of breast cancer among humans and reports of abnormal sexual development in alligators, fish, and other animals have suggested the possibility that very low levels of a number of chemicals are able to mimic or disrupt the effects of estrogenic hormones (Chapter 10) . Estrogneic hormones are sexual hormones that are highly potent at low concentrations. The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996 directed the EPA to develop procedures for testing chemicals for endocrine disruption activity, which it has done through the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). Adverse Environmental Effects. The story of DDT is a good illustration of the environmental impacts of pesticides as well. There Go the Birds. In the 1950s and 1960s, ornithologists (people who study birds) observed drastic declines in populations of many species of birds that fed at the tops of food chains. Fish-eating birds such as the bald eagle and osprey ( Figure 13\u20138) were close to extinction. Investigators at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Research Center near Baltimore, Maryland, showed that the problem was reproductive failure. The eggs were breaking in the nest before hatching. Furthermore, the eggs contained high concentrations of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), a product of the partial breakdown of DDT by the animal\u2019s body. DDE interferes with calcium metabolism, causing birds to lay thin-shelled eggs. Because of accumulation, small, seemingly harmless amounts received over a long period of time may reach toxic levels in one organism. This phenomenon\u2014referred to as bioaccumulation\u2014can be understood as follows: Many synthetic organic chemicals are highly soluble in lipids (fats or fatty compounds), but less soluble in water.", "In the body, they are stored in lipids rather than being excreted by the kidneys. Thus, synthetic organics such as pesticides and their breakdown products that are absorbed with food or water are trapped and held by the body\u2019s lipids, while the water and water-soluble wastes are passed in the urine. The body cannot fully metabolize them and has no mechanism to excrete them, so they gradually accumulate in the body and may produce toxic effects. Figure 13\u20138 Osprey. Populations of fish-eating birds such as the osprey (shown here feeding its young), brown pelican, and bald eagle were decimated in the 1950s and 1960s by the effects of widespread spraying with DDT. With the banning of the pesticide, these populations have greatly recovered. The bald eagle was taken off the endangered species list in 1994. Up the Chain. The bioaccumulation that occurs in individual organisms may be compounded at higher trophic levels (Chapter 5). Each organism accumulates the contami nation from its food, so the concentration of contaminants in its body is many times higher than that in its food. This effect concentrates contaminants as they go up the food chain. Eventually, this multiplying effect, biomagnification, causes extremely high levels of contaminants in the top levels of the biomass pyramid (Chapter 5) . Figure 13\u20139 shows how DDT and its metabolic products worked their way up the food chain to the top predators. DDT concentration (parts per million) 20.00 2.0 0.20 0.04 0.000003 Magnification of DDT concentration (approximate) Fish-eating 107 birds Small fish 106 Silent Spring. In the 1950s, Rachel Carson, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist and an accomplished science writer, began reading the disturbing scientific accounts of the effects of DDT and other pesticides on wildlife. By 1962, Carson finished a book, Silent Spring, that documented the effects of the almost uncontrolled use of insecticides across the United States. Its basic message was that, if insecticide use continues as usual, there might someday come a spring with no birds\u2014and with ominous consequences for humans as well. Silent Spring became an instant best seller and triggered a debate that has not ended. Representatives of the agricultural and chemical industries claimed that the book was an unreasonable and unscientific account that, if taken seriously, would halt human progress. At the same time, the book was hailed as an unparalleled breakthrough in environmental understanding. By the early 1970s, concerns about environmental and long-term health effects led to the banning of DDT in the United States and most other industrialized countries. Numerous other chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides (for example, chlordane, dieldrin, endrin, and heptachlor) were also banned because of their propensity for Bald eagle Osprey Small fish Zooplankton Protozoa 105 Phytoplankton Algae 104 1 Water Figure 13\u20139 Biomagni fication. Organisms on the first trophic level absorb the pesticide from the environment and accumulate it in their bodies (bioaccumulation). Each successive consumer in the food chain accumulates the contaminant to yet a higher level. Thus, the concentration of the pesticide is magnified manyfold as it moves up the food chain. Organisms at the top of the chain are likely to accumulate toxic levels. UNDERSTANDING THE DATA 13.2 Chemical Treatment: Promises and Problems 319 bioaccumulation in the environment and suspected potential for causing cancer. In the years since the banning of DDT, the bird species that were adversely affected have recovered. Rachel Carson is credited with stimulating the start of the modern environmental movement and the creation of the EPA. Silent Spring has become a classic, and the regulation of insecticides and other toxic chemicals is in a sense a monument to Rachel Carson, who died of cancer only two years after her book was published. (See Chapter 1 for more about Rachel Carson.) Development of Resistance by Pests. One fundamental problem with chemical pesticides is that they gradually lose their effectiveness. Over the years, it becomes STEWARDSHIP necessary to use larger and larger quantities, to try new and more potent pesticides, or to do both to obtain the same degree of control. Synthetic organic pesticides fare no better than first-generation pesticides in this respect. For example, in 1946, 2.2 pounds (1 kg) of pesticides provided enough protection to produce about 60,000 bushels of corn. By 1971, it took 141 pounds (64 kg) to produce the same amount, and losses due to pests actually increased during the intervening years. Resistance is not limited to agricultural pests.", "Stored-product pests are resistant to a fumigant used in shipments, and many medical and veterinary pests have developed pesticide resistance as well. In 2011, poison-resistant \u201csupermice\u201d were discovered in Spain and Germany. They appeared to have resulted from the breeding of mice from Algeria and continental Europe. Evolution at Work. Resistance builds up because pesticides destroy the sensitive individuals of a pest population, leaving behind only those few that already have some resistance to the pesticide. Resistance develops most rapidly in r-strategists with high reproductive capacity (Chapter 4) . A single pair of houseflies, for example, can produce several hundred offspring that may mature and reproduce themselves only two weeks later. Consequently, repeated pesticide applications result in the unwitting selection and breeding of genetic lines that are highly resistant to the chemicals that were designed to eliminate them. The Colorado potato beetle, for example, developed resistance to 52 compounds across all chemical insecticide classes, including cyanide, in 50 years. In short, pesticide resistance simply confirms that natural selection is a powerful evolutionary force. Many major pest species are resistant to all of the principal pesticides. Plant pests can also become resistant to herbicides, as previously described (Chapter 12). Resurgences and Secondary-Pest Outbreaks. The second problem with the use of synthetic organic pesticides is that, after a pest has been virtually eliminated with a pesticide, the pest population not only recovers, but also explodes to higher and more severe levels. This phenomenon is known as resurgence. To make matters worse, small populations of insects that were previously of no concern because of their low numbers may suddenly start to explode, creating a new problem called a secondary-pest outbreak. In China, Figure 13\u201310 Invertebrate food chains. (a) Food chains exist among insect pests, their food and their predators, just as they do among higher animals. (b) Ant lions are the larvae of lace-winged insects in the family Myrmeleontidae. This ant lion is using its powerful jaws to capture an ant. (c) Spiders eat many pest species. This huntsman spider is eating a grasshopper. the extended use of Bt cotton led to a secondary outbreak of mirid bugs, insects which previously had not been major pests. (Chapter 12). Unfortunately, the species appearing in secondary-pest outbreaks quickly became resistant to pesticides, thus compounding the problem. Some scientists use the term pesticide treadmill to describe attempts to eradicate pests with synthetic organic chemicals. Overuse of chemicals increases resistance and secondary-pest outbreaks, which lead to the use of new and larger quantities of chemicals, which in turn lead to more resistance and more secondary-pest outbreaks. The same can occur on weeds or stored-product pests. The use of glyphosate on GM crops and the resistance of weeds to this power ful herbicide is a good example (Chapter 12 ). The chemical approach breaks down because it ignores basic ecological principles. It assumes that the ecosystem is a static entity in which one species, the pest, can simply be eliminated. In reality, the ecosystem is a dynamic system of interactions, and a chemical assault on one species perturbs the system and produces other, undesirable effects. Populations of plant-eating insects are frequently held in check by other insects or spiders that parasitize or prey on them (Figure 13\u201310) . Pesticide treatments often have a greater impact on these natural enemies than on the plant-eating insects they are meant to control. Consequently, with their natural enemies suppressed, the populations of both the original target pest and other plant-eating insects explode. Insect food chains (a) (b) (c) Nonpersistent Pesticides: Are They the Answer? A key characteristic of chlorinated hydrocarbons is their persistence; that is, they take a long time to break down. Lingering in the environment for years, they can contaminate many organisms and become biomagnified. DDT, for example, has a half-life on the order of 20 years. Because the persistent pesticides have been banned, the agrochemical industry has substituted nonpersistent pesticides for the banned compounds. Synthetic organic phosphates such as malathion, parathion, and chlorpyrifos, as well as carbamates such as aldicarb and carbaryl, have been used extensively in place of chlorinated hydrocarbons (see Table 13\u20131). These compounds are potent inhibitors of the enzyme cholinesterase, which is essential for proper functioning of the nervous system in all animals. They break down into simple nontoxic products within a few weeks after their application. Thus, there is no danger of their migrating long distances through the environment and affecting wildlife or humans long after being applied. Toxicity.", "For several reasons, however, nonpersistent pesticides are not as environmentally sound as they might appear. First of all, they are persistent enough to harm non-target organisms. The total environmental impact of a pesticide is a function not only of its persistence, but also of its toxicity, its dosage, and the location where it is applied. Many of the non-persistent pesticides are far more toxic than DDT. They present a significant hazard to agricultural workers and others exposed to these pesticides. For instance, the organophosphates are responsible for an estimated 70% of all pesticide poisonings. The law requires the EPA to develop new health-based standards that address the risk of children\u2019s exposure to such pesticides, which has led to the banning of several chemicals from a range of home garden and agricultural uses. Bird Kill. Nonpersistent pesticides may still have far-reaching environmental impacts. For example, carbofuran is a pesticide widely used on alfalfa, rice, and soybeans. It is spread on the ground and absorbed into plants through their roots. Unfortunately, it is highly toxic to birds and other vertebrates. In the \u201980s, the EPA estimated that 1 million to 2 million birds were killed annually by carbofuran. In one incident, 800 to 1,200 ducks and geese died after treatment of an alfalfa field with carbofuran. Because of its toxicity to humans and wildlife, the EPA announced in 2008 that it would no longer allow residues of carbofuran on any food, essentially revoking all uses. The EPA decision was based primarily on the grounds that the pesticide posed an unacceptable risk to toddlers. Another hazard of nonpersistent pesticides is that desirable insects may be just as sensitive to them as pest insects are. Bees, for example, which play an essential role in pollination, are highly sensitive to them. Thus, the use of these compounds creates an economic problem for beekeepers and jeopardizes pollination. Also, regular spraying of neighborhoods with malathion to control mosquitoes leads inevitably to great declines in butterflies and fireflies. Many pesticides also harm predatory insects and spiders, which would otherwise keep pests down. Finally, nonpersistent chemicals are just as likely to cause resurgences and secondary-pest outbreaks as persistent pesticides are, and pests become resistant to nonpersistent pesticides just as readily. 13.2 Chemical Treatment: Promises and Problems 321 Synergistic Effects. As scientists try to figure out what is happening in ecosystems, the answer may be complicated by multiple factors that work together to create an unexpected outcome, something called a synergistic effect. A possible example is the mystery of what is killing pollinators. Pollinators are in decline worldwide. Some of the deaths are a phenomenon known as honeybee colony collapse disorder (CCD), which came into the news in 2006\u20132007 when beekeepers discovered their hives dying and their worker bees mysteriously gone ( Figure 13\u201311). Meanwhile, other pollinators such as bumblebees and various types of solitary bees are also in decline. Scientists know CCD is not a simple case of acute pesticide poisoning because in the case of acute poisonings, worker bees are found dead at the hive. In CCD cases, the worker bees are nowhere to be found. Scientists hypothesize that CCD is the result of the synergistic effects of a mixture of pests, pathogens, and chemicals that weaken or confuse bees. Several parasitic and pathogenic factors may be involved, including the invasive varroa mite, viruses, a gut parasite, poor nutrition, and stress. Pesticides may interact with these other factors. Several recent studies support the involvement of pesticides in the pollinators\u2019 decline. In one study on honeybees, researchers found that bees exposed to nectar containing a type of pesticide called a neonicotinoid had more difficulty finding their way back to the hive than those exposed to a control. In another study, bumblebees treated with neonicotinoids had lower growth rates and produced fewer queens than unexposed bees. In yet another study, honeybees were found to eat less food and perform fewer communication dances when exposed to pesticides. In solving the mystery of CCD and other problems with pollinators, scientists are finding that chemicals may contribute to many other problems, causing a perfect storm of variables. CONCEPT CHECK How does resistance to pesticides evolve? What are two ways of slowing the development of pesticide resistance in an insect population? \u2610\u2713 Figure 13\u201311 Pollinators in decline. Colony collapse disorder (CCD) killed the bees in this hive in Florida. CCD has caused a massive, worldwide die off of bees that has puzzled scientists.", "13.3 Alternative Pest Control Methods Numerous ecological and biological factors affect the relationship between a pest and its host. Ecological control seeks to manipulate one or more of these natural factors so that crops and people are protected without jeopardizing environmental and human health. This natural approach depends on an understanding of the pest and its relationship with its host and with its ecosystem. The more we know about the organisms involved, the greater are our opportunities for ecological control. The life cycle typical of moths and butterflies is shown in Figure 13\u201312. Many groups of insects have a similarly complex life cycle. The development of each stage may be influenced by numerous abiotic factors, and at each stage, the insect may be vulnerable to attack by a parasite or predator. The proper completion of each stage depends on internal chemical signals provided by insect hormones. Locating mates, finding food, and other behaviors depend on external chemical signals. All these findings suggest ways in which pest populations may be controlled without resorting to synthetic chemical pesticides. Next we will consider the four general categories of ecological pest control: cultural control, control by natural enemies, genetic control, and natural chemical control. Figure 13\u201312 Complex life cycle of insects. Like the moth shown here, most insects have a complex life cycle that includes a larval stage and an adult stage. Biological control methods recognize the different stages and attack the insect, using knowledge of its specific needs and behaviors at each stage. Cultural Control A cultural control is a nonchemical alteration of one or more environmental factors in such a way that the pest finds the environment unsuitable or is unable to gain access to its target. This type of control can be practiced on all scales\u2014by a homeowner, a farmer, or even a government. Control of Pests Affecting Crops, Gardens, and Lawns. Weed problems in lawns are frequently a result of cutting the grass too short. If grass is left at least 3 inches (8 cm) high, it will usually maintain a dense enough cover to keep out most crabgrass and other noxious weeds. Thus, monitoring the height of grass is a form of cultural weed control. In gardens, a clean mulch of material such as grass clippings or hay will keep down the growth of weeds while also protecting the soil from drying and erosion. A gardener may also control pests by avoiding plants that act as attractants or by planting ones that act as repellants for certain pests. Roses attract several kinds of common pests, while marigolds and chrysanthemums are justly famous for repelling insects. Some parasites require an alternative host, so they can be controlled by eliminating that host (Figure 13\u201313) . Also, hedgerows, fencerows, and shelterbelts can provide refuges where natural enemies of pests (birds, amphibians, praying mantises, and so on) can be maintained. Metamorphosis 13.3 Alternative Pest Control Methods 323 Figure 13\u201313 Cultural control. Part of the life cycle of wheat rust, a parasitic fungus that is a serious pest on wheat, requires that the rust infest barberry, an alternate host plant. The elimination of barberry in wheat-growing regions has been an important cultural control. Crops. Insects and the spores of plant pathogens may overwinter or complete part of their life cycle in the dead leaves, stems, or other plant residues that remain in the fields after harvesting. Therefore it is important to manage any crop residues that are not harvested. Plowing under or burning the material may be quite effective in keeping pest populations to a minimum. Crop rotation\u2014the practice of changing crops from one year to the next\u2014may provide control because pests of the first crop cannot feed on the second crop ( Figure 13\u201314) and vice versa. Similarly, breaking up monocultures with mixed plantings lowers the crop loss to any one pest. Trap cropping involves planting a pest\u2019s preferred host plant near a crop to lure pests away from the crop. Finally, refuge plants (untreated plants near treated crops) allow natural enemies to survive. Natural enemies of pests are maintained in the uncultivated strips. This approach is also used with insect-resistant GM crops to keep all of the insects from being exposed to the GM crop and becoming more resistant to the crop (Chapter 12). Stopping Imports. Most of the pests that are hardest to control were unwittingly imported from other parts of the world. Therefore, it is important to keep would-be pests out of the country.", "This is a major function of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and of the agriculture departments of some states. Biological materials that may carry pest insects or pathogens are either prohibited from crossing the border or subjected to quarantines, fumigation, or other treatments to ensure that they are free of pests. A recent example is the Asian longhorned beetle, which arrived in packing crates from China. The beetle infests healthy maple, birch, poplar, and ash trees and eventually kills them. As a result of this pest, new regulations require that wooden crates and pallets from China be kiln-dried or chemically treated. The Animal and Plant Health Inspections Service (APHIS) of the USDA has the job of tracking and stopping the flow of pests into the United States. Figure 13\u201314 Tomato wilt. This tomato plant has been devastated by tomato wilt. Growing tomatoes in the same plot maintains wilt spores in the soil, guaranteeing that wilt will strike the plants every year. (Source: Author\u2019s garden.) Cultural Control of Pests Affecting Humans. We routinely practice many forms of cultural control against diseases and parasitic organisms. For instance, disposing properly of sewage and avoiding drinking water from unsafe sources are cultural practices that protect against waterborne disease-causing organisms. Brushing hair, bathing, laundering clothes and linens, and cleaning rugs and furniture are all cultural practices that eliminate head and body lice, fleas, bedbugs, and other parasites. Bed nets, which are widely used in the tropics, offer a barrier that keeps mosquitoes away from sleepers. Special covers for mattresses can cut down on bedbugs and mites. Garbage disposal, housekeeping, and sealing cracks in buildings help keep down populations of roaches, mice, rats, flies, mosquitoes, and other pests. Sanitation in handling food as well as refrigeration, freezing, canning, and drying of foods are cultural controls that inhibit the growth of organisms that cause rotting, spoilage, and food poisoning. If these practices are compromised, as they usually are in any major disaster, there is the very real danger of widespread mortality resulting from outbreaks of parasites and diseases (see Chapter 17). Control by Natural Enemies There are four well-defined types of natural enemies: predators, parasitoids, pathogens, and herbivores. This type of control is used all over the world. In the eastern United States, tiny predator beetles have been imported in an attempt to control the invasive, non-native wooly adelgid, which is killing off hemlock trees. In Africa, mealybugs are controlled by parasitic wasps; these types of wasps are also effective in controlling caterpillar populations (Figure 13\u201315). In sub-Saharan Africa, the swarming desert locust was controlled by spraying infested fields with \u201cGreen Muscle,\u201d a mix of dry spores of the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae with oil. Water hyacinth, which has blanketed many African lakes, is coming under control following the introduction of Brazilian weevils. More than 30 weed species worldwide are now limited by insects introduced into their habitats. Protect the Natives. The challenge involved in using natural enemies lies in finding organisms that provide control of the target species without attacking other, desirable species. Entomologists estimate that of the 50,000 known species of plant-eating insects that have the potential for being serious pests, only about 1% are actually causing problems. The populations of the other 99% are held in check by one or more natural enemies. Therefore, the first step in using natural enemies for control should be conservation\u2014protecting the natural enemies that already exist. This means avoiding the use of broad-spectrum chemical pesticides, which may affect natural enemies of the target species even more than they do the target pests themselves. Restricting the use of broad-spectrum chemical pesticides will often allow natural enemies to reestablish themselves and control secondary pests\u2014those that become serious problems only after the use of pesticides. Import Aliens as a Last Resort. Effective natural enemies are not always readily available. In many cases, the absence of a pest\u2019s natural enemies is the result of accidentally importing the pest without also importing its natural enemies. Quite often, effective natural enemies have been found by systematically combing the home region of an introduced pest to find its various predators or parasites. Once an enemy species has been identified, it must be carefully tested before intentionally releasing it, something that has (a) (b) Figure 13\u201315 Parasitic wasps.

The wasp larvae feed on the caterpillar, and shortly before the caterpillar dies, they emerge and form the cocoons seen here. (c) 13.3 Alternative Pest Control Methods 325 Figure 13\u201316 Cane toad. Introduced into Australia to control beetles in sugar cane fields, the cane toad (Bufo marinus) quickly became a pest. Figure 13\u201317 Hessian fly. This pest of wheat is controlled by main-taining wheat plants that produce a chemical that is toxic to the fly. not always been done well. The cane toad (Figure 13\u201316) , imported into Australia in 1935 to control beetles in sugar cane fields, overran Queensland, eating, outcompeting, and poisoning many native species without ever controlling the beetles that prompted its original release. On the other hand, the cassava mealybug, Phaenococcus manihoti, ran rampant across Africa, destroying as much as 50% of a crop that was a staple for 200 million people, until it was successfully controlled by the introduced parasitoid wasp Epidinocarsis lopezi. Modern releases are much more likely to succeed than earlier releases because of better science and more rigorous controls. Plant Breeding Most plant-eating insects and plant pathogens attack only one species or a few closely related species. This specificity implies a genetic incompatibility between the pest and any species that are not attacked. Most genetic-control strategies are designed to develop genetic traits in the host species that provide the same incompatibility\u2014that is, resistance to attack by the pest. The technique has been used extensively in connection with plant diseases caused by fungal, viral, and bacterial parasites. Unfortunately, the battle between agricultural scientists and plant diseases never ends. In the 1950s, plant breeders developed varieties of wheat that were resistant to wheat stem rust, a parasitic fungus that used to devastate fields of wheat. However, a new strain of the fungus appeared in Africa in the early 2000s and is spreading eastward into Asia, infecting many varieties of wheat in the developing world. Other plants are bred to produce substances that are lethal or at least repulsive to the would-be pest. One example is the resistance of new varieties of wheat to the Hessian fly ( Figure 13\u201317). The fly lays its eggs on wheat leaves, and the larvae move into the main stem, weakening it. Scientists at the University of Kansas developed a variety of wheat that produces a chemical that is toxic to the Hessian fly; this reduced losses to this pest to less than 1% where resistant varieties have been planted for several years. Plants can be bred to have physical traits that provide physical barriers and structural traits that impede the attack of a pest. For example, hooked hairs on the leaf surfaces of some plants tend to trap and hold insects, and glandular hairs that exude a sticky substance fatally entrap others (Figure 13\u201318) . Biotechnology. As we have seen elsewhere, biotech nology techniques can be used to incorporate pest control into plants (Chapter 12). One promising strategy is to incorpo rate the gene for the protein coat of a plant virus into the plant itself. When the plant manufactures the virus protein coat, the plant becomes resistant to infection by the real virus. In this way, crop plants have been made resistant to more than a dozen plant viruses. Another strategy is to craft a chemical that interferes with an insect\u2019s normal cell function, silencing a gene that controls molting and sidetracking that process\u2014thus, a gene-silencing pesticide. Figure 13\u201318 Alfalfa glandular hairs. This scanning electron micro-graph shows an immature potato leafhopper trapped by sticky glandular hairs on the stem of a resistant alfalfa strain. Figure 13\u201319 Bioengineered potatoes. A researcher holds two plants of a potato cultivar Fortuna. The left plant is not genetically modified, while the plant on the right is resistant to Phytophora infestans, a plant pest. Bt. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces a potent protein that kills the larvae of a number of plant-eating insects but is harmless to mammals, birds, and most other insects. Scientists have engineered the gene that produces this protein into a number of plants, including cotton, potatoes, and corn ( Figure 13\u201319). Unfortunately, resistance to Bt by some pests and outbreaks of secondary pests are dampen ing the success of Bt cotton (Chapter 12 ).", "Anticipating the development of resistance because of the heavy exposure of pests to the Bt toxin, the EPA has required seed companies to verify that farmers plant 20% of their fields with non-Bt versions of the crop. The non-Bt fields provide a refuge for pests that are susceptible to the Bt toxin, allowing these insects to interbreed with potentially resistant colleagues from the Bt acreage and, hopefully, dilute resistance genes in the insect populations. Bt toxin is also used directly as a natural chemical control, described next. Natural Chemical Control Natural chemicals can be compounds that are used directly as biocides (such as Bt toxin), pesticides made from plants, chemicals used to mimic communication chemicals, or chemicals that boost immunity. Some natural chemicals mimic those used to communicate internally or between members of a species. Some species communicate via pheromones\u2014chemicals secreted by one individual that influence the behavior of another individual of the same species. Once identified and synthesized, pheromones may be used to trap or confuse pests. In the trapping technique, the pheromone is used to lure males or females into traps or into eating poisoned bait (Figure 13\u201320). In the confusion technique, the pheromone is dispersed over the field in such quantities that males become confused, cannot find females, and thus fail to mate. Research has identified a large number of pheromones, and these natural chemicals are now key tools employed in IPM on many insects, such as the cotton boll weevil and the pink bollworm for cotton, the codling moth for pears and apples, the tomato pinworm for tomatoes, and several bark beetles that infest forest trees, among others. Hormones are chemicals produced in organisms that provide \u201csignals\u201d that control developmental processes and metabolic functions. Hormones or hormone mimics can be used to disrupt the life cycle of a pest. Two advantages of such natural chemicals are that they are nontoxic and that they are highly specific to the pest in question. (They do not affect the natural enemies of the pest to any appreciable extent.) If the affected pest is eaten by another organism, it is simply digested. For example, an insecticide called Mimic\u00ae is a synthetic variation of the molting hormone of insects. Mimic\u00ae triggers the molting process to begin in insect larvae but not to continue, which eventually kills the larva. Mimic is specific to moths and butterflies and is viewed as a potent agent in the control of the spruce budworm, the gypsy moth, the beet armyworm, and the codling moth\u2014all highly devastating pests. Natural chemicals can also be used on crops to boost plant defenses. When plants (including tomato, maize, sweet pepper, and wheat) are grown from seeds dipped in jasmonic acid, a naturally occurring plant compound, aphid attacks and caterpillar damage decline. These early results may lead to promising new directions. The spraying of Bt toxin into water or onto crops rather than incorporation into genetically modified plants is another example of natural chemical control. Figure 13\u201320 Trapping technique. Adult Japanese beetles are lured into a trap by scented bait they find attractive. Once inside the trap, baffles prevent the beetles from escaping. These traps are avail-able in hardware stores and are quite effective. (Japanese beetles are notorious lawn grubs as larvae; as adults, they are voracious consumers of garden flowers and vegetables.) Sterile-Insect Techniques Another strategy for controlling insects involves flooding a natural population with sterile males that have been reared in laboratories. Combating the screwworm fly provides a prime illustration of this sterile-insect technique. This fly, which is closely related to the housefly, lays its eggs in open wounds of cattle and other animals, causing pain, infection, and often death. Early in the 20th century, the problem became so severe that cattle ranching from Texas to Florida and northward was becoming economically impossible. Screwworm flies have two essential features that make control possible: their populations are never very large, and female flies mate only once. If a female mates with a sterile male, no offspring are produced. Today sterile males are routinely used to control this pest. After huge numbers of screwworm larvae are grown in laboratories, the resulting pupae are subjected to just enough high-energy radiation to render them sterile. These sterilized pupae are then air-dropped into the infested area. Ideally, 100 sterile males are dropped for every normal female in the natural population, giving a 99% probability that wild females will mate with one of the sterile males.", "This technique was successful in eliminating the screwworm fly from Florida, Mexico, and most of Central America. The sterile-insect technique has saved billions of dollars for the cattle industry. The sterile-insect technique has been used successfully on a number of agriculturally important pests. Recently, the technique was used to eradicate the tsetse fly from the island of Zanzibar, thus eliminating the disease trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), which the tsetse fly carries. List three possible ways to use natural chemicals to deter insect pests. CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 13.4 Making a Coherent Plan The increasing availability of alternative pest control methods and the accumulating evidence of the failures of chemical treatment have led to a growing movement away from the use of pesticides, particularly on foods. This movement must contend with a strong tendency on the part of farmers to employ pesticides. Pressures to Use Pesticides A species becomes a pest only when its population multiplies to the point of causing significant damage. Natural controls are generally aimed at keeping pest populations below damaging levels, not at total eradication of the populations. By keeping pest populations down, natural controls avert significant damage while preserving the integrity of the ecosystem. 13.4 Making a Coherent Plan 327 The question to be asked when facing any pest species is: Is the species causing significant damage? Damage should be deemed significant only when the economic losses due to the damage considerably outweigh the cost of applying a pesticide. This point is called the economic threshold (Figure 13\u201321) . If significant damage is not occurring, natural controls are already operating, and the situation is probably best left as is. Spraying with synthetic chemicals at this stage is more than likely to upset the natural balance and make the situation worse through resurgences. It is also not cost effective. If, however, significant damage is occurring, a pesticide treatment may be in order. A grower who believes that his or her plantings are at risk may resort to insurance spraying (the use of pesticides to prevent losses to pests) such as occurs on European apple crops, where the most important threats are mildew and scab\u2014airborne diseases that, once established, cause significant economic damage. Farmers typically employ insurance spraying to control these diseases. Consumers also put indirect pressure on growers to use pesticides because they select the best-looking fruits and vegetables, leaving the remainder to be sold at lower prices or to be discarded. Growers know that blemished produce means less profit, so they indulge in cosmetic spraying\u2014the use of pesticides to control pests that harm only the item\u2019s outward appearance. Cosmetic spraying accounts for a significant fraction of pesticide use, does nothing to enhance crop yield or nutritional value, and results in an increase in pesticide residues remaining on the produce. Natural Damage to crops controls signals need for operating pesticide treatment Figure 13\u201321 The economic threshold. The objective of pest control should not be to eradicate a pest totally. All that is needed is to keep population levels below the economic threshold\u2014the point at which the damage caused by a pest considerably outweighs the cost of applying a pesticide. Integrated Pest Management IPM aims to minimize the use of synthetic organic pesticides without jeopardizing crops. This is made possible by addressing all the interacting sociological, economic, and ecological factors involved in protecting crops. With IPM, the crop and its pests are seen as part of a dynamic ecosystem. The goal is not eradicating the pests, but maintaining crop damage below the economic threshold. The EPA uses a four-tiered approach in describing IPM: Making the economic benefits of natural controls known to growers is an important aspect of IPM. Because pesticides increased yields and profits when they were first used, many farmers still cling to them, believing that they offer the only way to bring in a profitable crop. The rising costs of pesticides, along with their tendency to aggravate pest problems, have eliminated their economic advantage. Pest-loss insurance, which pays the farmer in the event of loss due to pests, has enabled insured growers in developed countries to refrain from unnecessary and costly insurance spraying. Control of Malaria. Malarial mosquitoes provide a good example of the value of research in IPM. Control now consists of a combination of cultural controls such as pesticide-impregnated nets and removal of mosquito breeding sites along with chemical sprays, Bt, and encouragement of natural enemies such as birds and predatory insects. There is hope that current research will yield even more solutions.", "In the case of pesticide-resistant mosquitoes, scientists have found that a pathogenic fungus can kill mosquito larvae. Other research has shown that infection with a bacterium that is found in many insects doesn\u2019t kill malarial mosquitoes but keeps them from passing along the malarial parasite as effectively. Recently, scientists have been able to rear large numbers of mosquitoes in a lab environment cheaply in order to try the sterile-male technique. In other research, scientists have found a virus that kills older mosquitos. Only older mosquitoes can pass on malaria. Consequently, killing them as adults but before they are ready to transmit the disease, rather than constantly killing the youngest stages, will cut malarial transmission and at the same time slow the development of pesticide resistance. IPM in Indonesia. In the developing world, governmental agricultural policy often determines the extent to which IPM is adopted. Governments and aid agencies usually subsidize the purchase of pesticides, thereby strongly encouraging growers to step onto the pesticide treadmill. By contrast, Indonesia has provided a viable IPM model for other rice-growing countries. Faced with declining success in controlling the brown plant hopper (Figure 13\u201322) , Indonesian rice growers have switched from heavy pesticide spraying to a light spraying regime that preserves the natural enemies of the insect. The success of the program can be traced to close cooperation between the Indonesian government and the FAO (Figure 13\u201323) . FAO workers conducted training sessions for farmers that lasted throughout the growing season. Eventually, more than 200,000 farmers were taught about the rice agro-ecosystem and IPM techniques, and these farmers formed a corps that could in turn teach others. The economic and environmental benefits of the Indonesian IPM program have been remarkable. The government has saved millions of dollars annually by not purchasing pesticides, farmers have not had to invest in pesticides and spraying equipment, the environment has been spared the application of thousands of tons of pesticide, fish are once again thriving in the rice paddies, and the health benefits of reduced pesticide use have been spread from applicators to consumers and wildlife. The FAO is sponsoring similar IPM training programs in many other developing countries. Figure 13\u201322 Brown plant hoppers. Immature brown plant hoppers (Nilaparvata lugens), shown on the stem of a rice plant. 13.4 Making a Coherent Plan 329 IPM IN INDONESIA For 15 years, Indonesian farmers Brown plant hoppers resistant to used heavy pesticide applications the pesticides devastate rice crops. on high-yielding rice. Scientists from International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) find that pesticides are killing natural predators. Farmers now spread out and teach other farmers what they have learned. Rice harvests are improved, and Indonesia saves millions each year. In 1986, Indonesian government banned most pesticides used on rice. The government and the FAO set up \"farmer field schools,\" where farmers are taught rice ecology and IPM techniques. Figure 13\u201323 Integrated pest management. IPM has helped Indonesian rice farmers bring the brown plant hopper under control after years of frustration on the pesticide treadmill. Organically Grown Food Have you ever purchased meat, fruit, or vegetables with a label like the one shown in Figure 13\u201324? For consumers concerned about pesticides in their food, organic food is an attractive option. Many farmers are turning away from the use of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, antibiotics, and hormones as they raise grains, vegetables, and livestock for the organic food trade. Typically, organic farms are small, employ traditional farming methods with diverse crops, and are tied to local economies. For the farmers, the organically raised crops often represent lower crop yields, but also lower expenses. Sales of organics have increased rapidly over the past 15 years. In the United States, the sale of organically grown food has passed the $33 billion mark (up from $1 billion in 1990) and is more than $63 billion worldwide. Organic foods are more costly, but recent tests have shown that these foods are far less likely to have any pesticide residues, and those that do have residues contain much lower amounts than conventionally grown foods. Most residues in organic foods came from older, persistent pesticides, such as DDT, lingering in the soil. USDA Organic. The certification of organic foods has been a contentious process. In 1990 Congress passed the Organic Foods Protection Act, which established the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), under USDA auspices. After many years of work, proposed guidelines for certification from the NOSB were aired in early 1998.", "Possibly in response to lobbying from the food industry, the board allowed genetically engineered foods, irradiated foods (foods subjected to radiation to kill bacteria), and crops fertilized with sewage sludge to be included as organic. A firestorm of protest from the organic-food community ensued. The NOSB went back to work, and in late 2002, the USDA published its final standards for certifying organic foods. As a result, no product involving genetically engineered or irradiated foods or foods Figure 13\u201324 Organic foods. This symbol on food signals that the food or crop has been produced on a certified organic farm. fertilized with sewage sludge can be certified as 100% organic. The standards also prohibit the use of conventional pesticides, antibiotics, growth hormones, and chemical fertilizers. To market certified organic foods, farmers now must have their operations scrutinized by USDA-approved inspectors. Only then may they use the USDA seal on their products. If the food is at least 95% organic, it may also display the seal, but may not claim to be 100% organic. Because it is expensive and relatively difficult to be certified organic, many farmers who use significantly less pesticides and artificial fertilizers are not certified. In addition, some organic farms are extremely large and distant, so the environmental costs of transportation, storage, and packaging of foods remain. For this reason, buying local and supporting less toxic farming benefit the environment even if organic certification is not available. What are three problems organic farming might help solve? What is one problem it might increase? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 13.5 Pests, Pesticides, and Policy When you go to the grocery store and purchase food, most likely you assume it will have minimal pesticide residues. You might even think, \u201cWell, they wouldn\u2019t sell it if it wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d Likewise, when you go to a plant nursery and buy a plant, you probably assume that they wouldn\u2019t sell a noxious weed pest that is likely to invade your state and cost farmers millions of dollars. Both of these assumptions are at least partially true. While the fact that something is sold doesn\u2019t guarantee its safety, the United States has a wide range of guidelines followed by state and federal agencies to monitor, eradicate, and prevent pests and to protect food safety. There are also international treaties designed to lower the impact of pests and prevent the misuse of dangerous pesticides. Let\u2019s look at regulation of pests and then pesticides. Regulation of Pests In 1972, the United States Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), a part of the USDA, was established to monitor and control pests that could harm plants and animals. The jobs of the agency have changed over time. It has consolidated jobs formerly done by multiple agencies, including the Bureau of Animal Husbandry and various plant bureaus. It includes regulation of animals used in research and exhibition and by dealers, a function created after the Animal Welfare Act of 1966. One of the jobs of APHIS is to monitor potential pests in order to act quickly and prevent infestations that would require more pesticide use later (Figure 13-25 ). One example has been its intensive monitoring of soybean rust, a fungus that has devastated soybean crops in Brazil. When the pathogen was blown into the United States by winds from Hurricane Irene and began to spread northward, APHIS had to act quickly. The agency set up a continual Web-based tracking system with records of all counties where the pest was discovered. APHIS organized governmental agencies, universities, and farmers to track the pest, using sentinal plots, small fields planted early that were rigorously surveyed to track fungal spread. This and other actions were effective, and the environment was different enough from its native Brazil that the fungus has never reached the epidemic proportions here that it has there. Plant Protection Act. Plants have been regulated in the United States since the 1912 Plant Quarantine Act, the 1957 Federal Plant Pest Act, and the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974. These functions were consolidated into the Plant Protection Act of 2000, which, among other things, allowed APHIS to crack down on illegal smuggling of plants and agricultural products that could harbor pests. One program APHIS runs is the noxious weed program. Plants designated as noxious weeds cannot be moved across state lines, imported, or exported. States often have their own noxious weed lists and may have additional regulations. Plants not on the noxious weed list may also be pests.", "APHIS also tracks plant pests and regulates imports and exports to prevent movement. In 2012, APHIS was carefully regulating the movement of ash tree products and firewood to allow interstate commerce but halt the spread of the emerald ash borer, a juggling act that makes shipping difficult. Diseases, Bioterrorism, and GM Organisms. Over the years, APHIS\u2019 role has expanded to include monitoring for pests that might attack wildlife and the monitoring of bioengineered species. It regulates the welfare of domestic animals and protects U.S. plant and animal agriculture from incoming disease. One APHIS program tracks the efforts to eradicate diseases such as cattle brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, and pseudorabies in swine. APHIS also tracks plant diseases. In 2003, APHIS personnel detected a bacterial disease of geraniums in greenhouses in four Midwestern states. A devastating disease that could ruin potato and tomato crops, this bacterium had not been detected in the United States since 1999. APHIS agents determined that the disease had been imported in geranium cuttings from Kenya. Geranium imports from Kenya were halted until the outbreak could be contained. Figure 13\u201325 Catching them early. On December 23, 2013, one adult coconut rhinoceros beetle, an invasive pest on palms, was caught in a trap in Honolulu, Hawaii. Others were soon discovered. APHIS is coordinating a response to eradicate the pest before it can spread. 13.5 Pests, Pesticides, and Policy 331 APHIS oversees the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002, which regulates laboratories and vaccine companies that use, possess, or transport toxins and agents that could be harmful to humans, plants, or animals. The act aims to prevent the release of devastating diseases from a research lab or medical facility. APHIS also has the job of assessing the safety of bioengineered organisms. In 2012, it completed assessments of the possible effects of glyphosphate-resistant sugar beets. The assessments are held open to public review and then APHIS makes a regulatory determination. U.S. federal agencies collaborate with other countries to prevent the spread of pest organisms. The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) ratified by the United States in 1972 set up an international system to quarantine products to prevent pest spread. One provision of the 1995 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was to prevent the introduction of marine species to new environments. Other international agreements such as the Agreement concerning Cooperation in the Quarantine of Plants and their Protection against Pests and Diseases of 1959 and the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of 1994 help prevent the spread of plant diseases and other pests. Regulation of Pesticides Regulation of pesticides focuses on three main areas: safety and testing of pesticides, protection of pesticide workers, and protection of consumers from products that may have pesticides on them. As is the case with regulation of potential pests, there are numerous historic federal regulations about pesticides, which have been pulled together into modern laws. There are also international treaties. Federal Regulations. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), established in 1947 and amended in 1972, is administered by the EPA, which has total jurisdiction over the manufacture, sale, use, and testing of pesticides. FIFRA requires manufacturers to register pesticides with the EPA. As part of registration, it must test for toxicity to animals (and, by extrapolation, to humans) and set usage standards. For example, chlordane, which was used for 40 years as a pesticide on crops, lawns, and gardens, was tested and shown to be acutely toxic to animals in high doses. Chronic exposure led to damaging effects on most vital systems and caused liver cancer in animals. Acute and chronic exposure of humans to chlordane showed similar results, except for the development of cancer. On the basis of these results, the EPA canceled all uses of chlordane for food crops in 1978, but allowed continued use against termites until 1988, when all uses of the chemical in the United States were banned. The law also stipulates that the EPA must determine whether a product \u201cgenerally causes unreasonable adverse effects on the environment,\u201d and if it so determines, the product may be restricted or banned. This was the basis for the banning of DDT. The rapid increase in the number of chemicals used as pesticides makes their regulation difficult. The EPA\u2019s Pesticide Program places high priority on registering \u201creduced-risk\u201d pesticides, especially those that promise to replace more toxic chemicals. Many are biopesticides\u2014naturally occurring substances that control pests.", "These include microbial pesticides such as Bt, plant-incorporated protectants (in GM crops) such as corn bioengineered to manufacture Bt in its tissues, or biochemical substances that are naturally occurring, such as pheromones (e.g., Mimic). These pesticides can usually be registered more rapidly than other kinds of pesticides. The EPA has recently been under fire for giving provisional registration to hundreds of pesticides without requiring them to be fully tracked or tested. FFDCA. Protecting consumers from exposure to pesticides on food was a contentious and confusing process for many years. Three agencies are involved: the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA. Basically, the EPA sets the allowable tolerances for pesticide residues, based on its assessment of toxicity, and the FDA monitors and enforces the tolerances on all foods except meat, poultry, and egg products, which are managed by the USDA. The original enabling act was the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) of 1938. For many years, one clause of the FFDCA, the so-called Delaney clause, was highly controversial. The clause stated, \u201cNo [food] additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal.\u201d Because pesticides represent one of the largest categories of toxic chemicals to which people are exposed, this clause prohibited many pesticides from being used on foodstuffs when those pesticides had been found to cause cancer in laboratory tests with animals. In essence, the law stated that, if a given pesticide presents any risk of cancer, no detectable residue may remain on the food. Consequently, as analytical chemical techniques became more and more sensitive, more and more pesticides were banned for use on food. FQPA. The National Research Council examined this dilemma and recommended in 1987 that the anticancer clause be replaced with a negligible risk standard, based on risk-analysis procedures that had been developed subsequent to the Delaney clause. After years of debate, Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) in 1996 and did away with the Delaney clause and amended both FIFRA and FFDCA. The major requirements of the act include: setting \u201ca reasonable certainty of no harm\u201d as the safety standard for substances applied to foods; giving special consideration to the exposure of young children to pesticide residues; defining a risk of more than one case of cancer per million people as the allowable upper limit over long periods of exposure to chemicals; requiring evaluation of all possible sources of exposure to a given pesticide, not just exposure from food; reassessing older products according to the new requirements within 10 years; and applying the same standards to raw and processed foods (previously regulated separately). Care for Kids. One of the emphases in the new legislation was protection of children. The focus is on children both because they typically consume more fruits and vegetables per unit of body weight than do adults and because studies have shown that children are frequently more susceptible to carcinogens and neurotoxins. Accordingly, the FQPA requires the EPA to add a tenfold safety factor in assessing children\u2019s risks from pesticides. International Pesticide Regulation U.S. laws and international treaties both regulate the way the United States relates to the rest of the world regarding pesticides. The United States currently exports thousands of tons of pesticides (active ingredients) each year, some of which are banned in the United States itself. A number of factors\u2014 low literacy, weak laws, unfamiliarity with equipment\u2014 increase the potential for serious exposure to toxic pesticides in the developing countries. FIFRA requires \u201cinformed permission\u201d prior to the shipment of any pesticides banned in the United States. This permission comes from the purchaser. The EPA must then notify the government as to the identity of the importing company. Internationally, there are treaties that regulate information about pesticides. Treaties and Guidance. Two international treaties and one guidance document provide a framework for pesticides in the international arena. The Rotterdam Convention was adopted in 1998 and went into effect in February 2004. It is a treaty ratified by 70 countries that promotes open exchange of information about hazardous chemicals. Central to the convention is the process of prior informed consent (PIC), whereby exporting countries inform all potential importing countries of actions they have taken to ban or restrict the use of pesticides or other toxic chemicals and label them clearly.", "Governments in the importing countries, UN agencies, and exporting countries communicate so everyone can make decisions with the information they need. The International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides is a worldwide guidance document that addresses conditions of safe pesticide use. The most recent version was approved by the FAO in November 2002. The code makes clear the responsibilities of both private companies and countries receiving pesticides in promoting their safe use. In 2004, the Stockholm Convention, a treaty designed to eliminate or restrict persistent organic pollutants, came into effect. By 2013, 178 countries and the European Union were parties to the convention; the United States remained a notable non-ratifier. Countries are expected to ban 9 of the 12 most dangerous chemicals (the \u201cdirty dozen\u201d), use DDT only for malaria control, and limit the accidental production of two pesticide breakdown products, dioxins and furans. The Future. These international efforts are leveling the safety field for pesticide use globally and pulling the worst chemicals out of the global stream, at least slowly. Pesticide use illustrates two trends we see in many environmental science issues: the problems of cumulative impacts and of unintended consequences ( Chapter 1) . As with many environmental issues, significant progress in both pest and pesticide control has benefited from grassroots action and pressure from public-interest groups and NGOs, such as the Consumers Union and the Pesticide Action Network. These and other groups are pressing for continued movement in the direction of safe and sustainable pest prevention and management. Care for the welfare of our fellow human beings and all other creatures is necessary to solve pest problems in a fashion that is sustainable in the long term. What is the role of APHIS in controlling pests? What is the role of the EPA?

Energy from Fossil Fuels Approximately 300 million years ago, the Gulf of Mexico was formed by a sinking of the sea floor. In subsequent geological eras, organic matter accumulated in sediments that were deposited in the Gulf, where it was buried and converted into oil and gas. Today, large deposits of oil and gas lie below the warm waters of the Gulf. Petroleum exploration began in the Gulf in earnest after World War II, and 1947 marked the first offshore well drilled out of the sight of land, under 20 feet of water. Since then, some 15,000 oil and gas wells have been drilled in the Gulf of Mexico, in depths of up to 10,000 feet below the surface and a further 13,000 feet below the sea floor. Oil and gas production in the Gulf has been prolific, currently accounting for 30% of U.S. yield. However, much of the oil and gas that can be extracted from shallow wells has already been withdrawn from the Gulf, so the industry has been forced to drill in deeper waters and deeper strata to find oil. To get at the deep oil and gas, increasingly expensive and elaborate rigs are required, platforms that float on the surface and support all the necessary equipment for drilling in deep water, housing a crew, and providing a helicopter pad. One such rig was Deepwater Horizon; on April 20, 2010, that rig had a crew of 126. The Blowout at Macondo. Drilling at the BP-owned Macondo Well was begun in October 2009 by another rig. The Deepwater Horizon moved to the site in February 2010 and successfully completed the drilling. By April 20, the crew of the rig had inserted a cement barrier over the well surface preliminary to abandoning the well for the time being. Such a barrier must be able to withstand high pressures because the oil and gas accessed by the boring are themselves under high pressure. Suddenly, the well began blowing seawater and drilling mud up the string of connected drill casings to the rig platform, forming a geyser 240 feet into the air. The drilling mud was followed by a slushy combination of mud, oil, and gas, which ignited and exploded. The explosion and subsequent fire on the rig killed 11 workers and injured many more before they could be evacuated.", "The rig continued to burn until, 36 hours later, it sank into the Gulf. Chapter 14 Learning Objectives 14.1 Energy Sources and Uses: Explain how the three kinds of fossil fuel were developed over time and how they are coupled to major end uses today. 14.2 Exploiting Crude Oil: Evaluate the changes in crude oil sources and prices and their impact on the U.S. economy, and examine the concept of peak oil and its consequences. 14.3 Drilling for Natural Gas: Describe the versatility of natural gas, and explain how it can be extracted from shale. 14.4 Mining Coal: Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of coal as a power source, and evaluate the methods used to mine coal. 14.5 Energy Policy: Compare supply-side and demand-side energy policies that have been developed in recent years, and explain their different impacts on the future. Fire boats spray water on the burning remnants of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Under pressure from below, oil began to gush out of the well on the Gulf floor and continued to do so for 87 days until the well was capped off. Close to 5 million barrels of oil flowed up into the Gulf of Mexico, making an awful mess\u2014forming a huge slick, contaminating some 625 miles of Gulf coastline, and killing countless sea turtles, birds, fish, and smaller marine organisms. It was one of the largest oil spills in world history. An intense cleanup began immediately; much oil on the surface was simply burned, sending tons of black soot into the atmosphere. Some oil was pumped up from the bottom in the vicinity of the well, some was siphoned by booms and boats on the surface, but the vast bulk of the spill either evaporated at the surface of the Gulf or was broken down by bacteria in the water column and along the shores. These natural forces were aided by the high volatility of the Gulf oil and the warm temperatures of Gulf water. Nevertheless, the Deepwater Horizon spill was an economic disaster for the 14.1 Energy Sources and Uses Every day, you use energy\u2014the part of the physical world that allows objects to move and to do work (see Chapter 3) . Some energy comes from the center of our planet as it cools, but the ultimate source of most of the energy on Earth is the Sun, where it is released by nuclear reactions. This energy travels to Earth as radiation and then flows through Earth\u2019s systems. Recall that plants trap the Sun\u2019s energy to make complex molecules (chemical energy), which they use to carry out their life functions. Animals and other consumers get their energy by eating plants or other consumers. We humans get our energy from the food we eat, which is used to build tissues and move our bodies. In addition to the energy in our food, we use a variety of energy sources to power machinery, heat our homes, communicate, grow crops, travel from place to place, and perform the many other activities of daily life. These energy sources include fossil fuels as well as renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy. The energy sources we choose to use have a profound impact on our lives, our society, and the environment. Energy Transformations As energy flows through a system, it can change from one form to another. Primary energy sources can be used in the form in which they are found in nature; the Sun\u2019s radiation, geothermal energy, coal, wood, and nuclear energy are primary energy sources. Secondary energy sources, such as electricity, need to be made from primary sources; thus secondary energy sources are really energy holding systems. Differences in efficiency and cost drive decisions about which energy sources we use. Efficiency of Energy Transformations. In every energy transformation, some usable energy is lost to the system; this loss is a direct result of the Second Law of Thermodynamics ( Chapter 3) . Lost energy is released as heat; on Earth, that Gulf Coast fishing and tourism industries during the spring and summer of 2010 and afterwards. Much of this loss is being covered by a $20 billion trust fund created by BP at the demand of President Barack Obama. Costs of Fossil Fuels. Ultimately the environmental consequences of oil spills, drilling operations, and coal mining are some of the many costs of doing business in a fossil fuel\u2013driven economy. Americans use almost 19 million barrels of oil every day.", "In future chapters, you will learn some of the other costs, such as air pollution, which is affecting human and environmental health, and rising greenhouse gases, which are leading to global climate change. This chapter presents an overview of the sources of the fossil fuels that support transportation, homes, and industries. We discuss the consequences of our dependence on fossil fuels and then close the chapter with a look at public policy. energy is eventually released into space. As we will see throughout the chapter, the concept of the inefficiency of energy transfer at every level of a system is critical to understanding the pros and cons of different energy sources. For example, burning coal releases a certain amount of energy. Transforming that energy into electricity, transporting the electricity over wires, and using it to produce light involves losses of energy at each step in the flow of energy. If a primary source of energy (such as coal) is turned into a secondary source of energy (such as electricity), there is more energy lost than if the primary energy source could be used directly. In some situations, energy can be used more efficiently by combining several activities in one structure. For example district heating\u2014a system in which a large, central plant heats several residential and commercial spaces\u2014is usually more efficient than having many smaller heating systems in separate locations. The most efficient of these systems is district heating with combined heat and power (CHP), also called cogeneration. CHP produces electricity and heat simultaneously. Costs of Obtaining Energy. In this chapter we will discuss the costs for obtaining different types of fuel. These include direct financial and energy costs as well as environmental costs during extraction, refinement, transportation, and use. One way to measure the cost of obtaining a source of energy is to calculate the ratio of energy returned to energy invested, or EROI. (For a longer discussion, see Sound Science, Energy Returned on Energy Invested.) We will see that some fossil fuels are relatively easy to obtain, which is part of the reason why we are heavily dependent on them. We will also see how economic factors such as the cost of extraction and the supply of a fuel make prices rise or fall. Yet other costs, such as the pollution of land, water, and air are largely externalities in the economic system. Let\u2019s look at a little bit of history in order to understand how we got to a situation where fossil fuels dominate the global economy and environment. 14.1 Energy Sources and Uses 337 A Brief History of Energy Use Throughout human history, the advance of technological civilization has been tied to the development of energy sources. In early times (and even today in less developed regions), the major energy source was muscle power. Some people lived in relative luxury by exploiting the labor of others\u2014slaves, indentured servants, and minimally paid workers. Human labor was supplemented by the use of domestic animals for agriculture and transportation, by water or wind power for milling grain, and by the Sun. In the late 1700s, the breakthrough that launched the Industrial Revolution was the development of the steam engine. In a steam engine, water is boiled in a closed vessel to produce high-pressure steam, which pushes a piston back and forth in a cylinder. In turn, the piston turns a wheel to drive the machinery. The steam engine solved the problem of finding a steady, portable power source. Steam engines rapidly became the power source for steamships, steam shovels, steam tractors, steam locomotives, and stationary engines to run sawmills, textile mills, and virtually all other industrial plants. At first, the major fuel for steam engines was firewood. Then, as demands for energy increased and firewood around industrial centers became scarce, coal was substituted. By the end of the 1800s, coal had become the dominant fuel, and it remained so into the 1940s. In addition to being used as fuel for steam engines, coal was widely used for heating, cooking, and industrial processes. In the 1920s, coal provided 80% of all energy used in the United States. Although coal and steam engines powered the Industrial Revolution, which greatly improved life for most people, there were many drawbacks. The smoke and fumes from the numerous coal fires made air pollution in cities far worse than anything seen today. Coal is also notoriously hazardous to mine and dirty to handle, and burning coal results in large quantities of ash that must be removed.", "As for steam engines, because of the size and bulk of the boiler, the engines were heavy and awkward to operate (Figure 14\u20131) . Frequently, the fire had to be started several hours before the engine was put into operation in order to heat the boiler sufficiently. In the late 1800s, the simultaneous development of three technologies\u2014the internal combustion engine, oil-well drilling, and the refinement of crude oil into gasoline and other liquid fuels\u2014combined to provide an alternative to steam power. The replacement of coal-fired steam engines and furnaces with petroleum-fueled engines and oil furnaces was an immense step forward in convenience. Also, the air quality improved greatly as cities were gradually rid of the smoke and soot from burning coal. (It was only in the 1960s, with the tremendous proliferation of cars, that pollution from gasoline engines became a problem.) Further, the gasoline-driven internal combustion engine provided a valuable power-to-weight advantage that allowed rapid advances in technology. A 100-horsepower gasoline engine weighs only a tiny fraction of what a 100-horsepower steam engine and its boiler weigh, and jet engines have an even greater power-to-weight ratio. Automobiles and other forms of ground transportation would be cumbersome, to say the least, without this power-to-weight advantage, and airplanes would be impossible. Figure 14\u20131 Steam power. Steam-driven tractors like this 1915 Case marked the beginning of the industrialization of agriculture. Today, trac-tors half the size do 10 times the work. Modern tractors are also much easier and safer to operate. Economic development throughout the world since the 1940s has depended largely on technologies that consume fuels refined from crude oil. By 1951, crude oil became the dominant energy source for the United States. Since then, it has become the mainstay not only of the United States (making up 36% of total U.S. energy consumption), but also of most other countries, both developed and developing. Crude oil currently provides about 33% of the total annual global energy consumption (Figure 14\u20132) . In the countries of eastern Europe and in China, coal is still the dominant fuel. Coal ranks second globally, at 30%, and provides 20% of U.S. demand. Natural gas, the third primary fossil fuel, is often found in association with oil or during the search for oil. Natural gas is largely methane, which produces only carbon dioxide and GLOBAL PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY Coal 30.1% Oil 32.9% Natural Gas 23.7% Nuclear 4.4% Hydro 6.7% Combustables, Renewables, and Waste 2.2% Figure 14\u20132 Global primary energy supply. The world consumed some 12,730 million tons of oil equivalent in 2013. The sources of the total primary energy supply are shown here. Note that 87% comes from fossil fuels. (Source: Data from BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2014, 41.) water as it combusts; thus, it burns more cleanly than coal or oil. In terms of pollution, it is the most desirable fuel of the three. Despite the obvious fuel potential of natural gas, at first there was no practical way to transport it from wells to consumers. Any gas released from oil fields was (and in many parts of the world still is) flared\u2014that is, vented and burned in the atmosphere, a tremendous waste of valuable fuel. Gradually, the United States constructed a network of pipelines connecting wells with consumers. With the completion of these pipelines, the use of natural gas for heating, cooking, and industrial processes escalated rapidly because gas is clean, convenient (no storage bins or tanks are required on the premises), and relatively inexpensive. Currently, natural gas satisfies about 30% of U.S. energy demand and 24% of the global demand. Thus, three fossil fuels\u2014crude oil, coal, and natural gas\u2014provide 86% of U.S. energy consumption and 87% of the world\u2019s consumption. The remaining percentages are furnished by nuclear power, hydropower, and renewable sources. The changing pattern of energy sources in the United States is shown in Figure 14\u20133. The picture is similar for other de veloped countries of the world, though the percentages differ somewhat depending on the energy resources of the country. With the help of fossil fuel energy, people and goods have become so mobile that the human community has in fact become a global community. Adding to this linkage is the explosion in information storage and flow, made possible by digital devices and the Internet\u2014all powered by electricity.", "Electrical Power Production A considerable portion of the energy we gain from fossil fuels is used to generate electrical power, defined as the amount of work done by an electric current over a given time. The electricity itself is an energy carrier\u2014it transfers energy from a primary energy source (coal or waterpower, for instance) to its point of use. Electricity defines our modern technological society, powering appliances and computers in our homes, lighting up the night, and enabling the global Internet and countless other vital processes in business and industry to operate. Approximately 32% of fossil fuel production is now used to generate electricity in the United States; in 1950, the figure was only 10%. Generators. Electric generators were invented in the 19th century. In 1831, English scientist Michael Faraday discovered that passing a coil of wire through a magnetic field causes a flow of electrons\u2014an electrical current\u2014in the wire. An electric generator is basically a coil of wire that rotates in a magnetic field or that remains stationary while a magnetic field is rotated around it. The process converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. Remember, any time energy is converted from one form to another, some is lost through resistance and heat (in accordance with the Second Law of Thermodynamics; see Chapter 3). Also, some energy is lost in transmitting the electricity over wires from the generating plants to end users. In the end, it takes three units of primary energy to create one unit of electrical power that can be put to use. This apparently inefficient proposition is justified because electrical power is so useful and indispensable.

Total consumption and major primary sources from 1860 to 2013 are shown here in quadrillion Btus (one Btu is the amount of heat required to raise one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit). Note how the mix of primary sources has changed over the years and how the total amount of energy consumed has continued to grow. Note also the skyrocketing increase in the use of oil after World War II (1945) as private cars and car-dependent commuting became common. (Source: Data from Energy Information Administration, U.S. Department of Energy, Monthly Energy Review, February 2015.) In the most widely used technique for generating electrical power, a primary energy source is employed to boil water, creating high-pressure steam that drives a turbine\u2014 a sophisticated paddle wheel\u2014coupled to the generator (Figure 14\u20134a) . The combined turbine and generator are called a turbogenerator. Any primary energy source can be harnessed for boiling the water. Coal, oil, and nuclear energy are most commonly used at present, but burning refuse, solar energy, and geothermal energy (heat from Earth\u2019s interior) may be more widely used in the future. In addition to steam-driven turbines, gas- and water-driven turbines are used. In a gas turbogenerator, the high-pressure gases produced by the combustion of a fuel (usually natural gas) drive the turbine directly (Figure 14\u20134b) . For hydroelectric power, water under high pressure\u2014at the base of a dam or at the bottom of a pipe beginning at the 14.1 Energy Sources and Uses 339 MAJOR METHODS OF GENERATING ELECTRICITY STEAM TURBINES\u201466.7% Gas GAS TURBINES\u201421.8% Turbine + Boiler + Dam Turbine (c) (d) Figure 14\u20134 Electrical power generation. Most electricity is produced commercially by driving generators with (a) steam turbines, (b) gas turbines, and (c) water turbines. The percentage of the U.S. electricity supply derived from each source (as of 2013) is indicated. Smaller amounts of power (4.1%) are now also coming from wind energy, solar thermal energy, and photovoltaics (solar cells). (d) Each generator in this array in a hydroelectric plant is attached by a shaft to a turbine propelled by water.

Wind turbines are also coming into use. A utility company supplying electricity to its customers will employ a mix of power sources, depending on the cost and availability of each and the demand cycle. There are currently nearly 7,000 power plants in the United States producing 4.1 billion megawatt-hrs of electricity. Figure 14\u20135, on the next page, shows the remarkable shifts that have occurred in U.S. sources of electricity over the last 70 years.", "Although few new coal plants have been built in recent years, coal-burning power plants stay on line for decades; coal still provides more electrical power than any other source. Note, however, the exceptional rise in recent years of natural gas-powered plants and the appearance of renewable power sources. Fluctuations in Demand. Where does your electricity come from? It depends on what\u2019s available. Most utility companies are linked together in what are called pools. In New England, for example, ISO New England ties together some 350 electric-power-generating plants through 8,000 miles of transmission lines, called the power grid. The utility is responsible for balancing electricity supply and demand, regardless of daily or seasonal fluctuations. The generating capacity of the ISO New England utilities is currently 31,000 megawatts (MW), produced by a variety of energy 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2011 2012 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 Name plate capacity (megawatts) Figure 14\u20135 U.S. electric generating capacity by year in service, 1940\u20132012. Remarkable changes have occurred over the years in the construction of power plants, with many decades of coal plants, two decades of nuclear plants, and, most recently, a huge increase in natural gas and renewable sources. (Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration: EIA-860 Annual Electric Generator Report, 2013.) sources, as shown in Table 14\u20131. One MW is enough electricity to power 800 homes, on average. The greatest demands on electrical power in New England come in the summer months, when air conditioning use is at its highest. The all-time peak load (highest demand) record of 28,130 MW was set on August 2, 2006, a very hot day in New England. A power pool must accommodate daily and weekly electricity demand as well as seasonal fluctuations. Demand Cycle. The typical pattern of daily and weekly electrical demand in the United States is shown in Figure 14\u20136. The baseload represents the constant supply of power provided by the large coal-burning and nuclear plants with capacities as high as 1,000 MW. As demand rises during the day, the utility draws on additional plants that can be turned on and off\u2014the intermediate and peak-load power sources that represent the utility\u2019s reserve capacity. These are 100 80 60 40 20 0 Percentage of electrical energy capacity Figure 14\u20136 Weekly electrical demand cycle. Electrical demand fluctuates daily, weekly, and seasonally. Less energy is used at night and on weekends. A variety of generators must be employed to meet base, intermediate, and peak electricity needs. 14.1 Energy Sources and Uses 341 the utility\u2019s gas turbines and diesel plants, or the utility may use pumped-storage hydroelectric power (water is pumped to a reservoir using off-peak power and is allowed to flow through turbines when needed). Occasionally, a deficiency in available power will prompt a brownout (a reduction in voltage) or a blackout (a total loss of power), temporarily disrupting whole regions. Such events are most likely to occur during times of peak power demand. Summer heat waves represent the greatest source of sudden pulses in the demand for electricity. As the climate continues to grow warmer in many parts of the United States, more and more regional utilities are being pushed to the edge of their ability to satisfy summer electricity demand, although they still have some reserve. An even more serious problem is the antiquated system that controls the power transmission grid connecting power sources to users. Blackout. Power brownouts and blackouts are a threat to an economy that is now highly dependent on computers and other electronic devices (brownouts are a cutback in power, blackouts are total power failures). On August 14, 2003, the largest blackout in U.S. history hit eight eastern states and parts of Canada, imposing a $30 billion cost on the economies of the two countries. The blackout began when several power lines in Ohio brushed against trees and shut down. Transmission lines around the failure cut out, a local power plant shut down, more and more lines and plants dropped out, and within eight minutes, 50 million people across eight states and two Canadian provinces were without power. Power outages and interruptions cost the United States an estimated $150 billion a year.", "What is needed to prevent blackouts and brownouts is a self-healing smart grid, one that is able to monitor problems in real time, react to trouble quickly, and isolate trouble areas so that a cascading failure like the one in 2003 would be impossible. The technology for this fix is available, but funding is a huge problem. However, the utilities are busy installing one component of a smart grid\u2014smart meters\u2014by the millions. The meters give instant feedback on electricity use to homeowners and the utility control center. Another component would be smart sensors at many points on the grid; the sensors would provide feedback on transformers and power lines, allowing instant shunting of power away from breaks and between transformers. A pilot installation of smart grid technology in Boulder, Colorado, in 2008 was highly successful. The government has invested $4.5 billion in smart grid projects, matched by $5.5 billion from private sources. Clean Energy? There was a time when electrical power was promoted as being the ultimate clean, nonpolluting energy source. This is true at the point of its use: Using electricity creates essentially no pollution but generating electricity does. For a time, electricity was relatively inexpensive, and electric heating systems were installed in many new homes. This is no longer true. The public knows that electricity is (1) an expensive way to heat homes and (2) generated from fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Coal-burning power plants are the major source of electricity in the United States but are heavily implicated in acid deposition and global climate change (Chapters 18 and 19). Nuclear power is a much- mistrusted technology because of the potential for accidents and the problem of disposal of the nuclear waste products. (Nuclear power is discussed in Chapter 15.) Additional ad verse effects of using electrical energy apply to other parts of the fuel cycle, such as mining coal and processing uranium ore. The pollution is simply transferred from one part of the environment to another. The only sources of energy that produce less pollution are the renewables\u2014hydroelectricity, solar, wind, and biomass\u2014and these have their own limita tions (Chapter 16). The problem of transferring pollution from one place to another becomes even more pronounced when you consider efficiency; for example, the production of electricity from burning fossil fuels has an efficiency of only 30\u201335%. The energy loss is accounted for partly by some heat energy from the firebox going up the chimney and partly by a large amount of heat energy remaining in the spent steam as it leaves the turbine. These unavoidable energy losses, called conversion losses, are a consequence of the need to maintain a high temperature difference between the incoming steam and the receiving turbine so as to maximize efficiency. Heat energy will go only toward a cooler place, so it cannot be recycled into the turbine. The most common practice is to dissipate it into the environment by means of a condenser (a device that turns turbine exhaust steam into water). In fact, the most conspicuous features of coal-burning and nuclear power plants are the huge cooling towers used for that purpose (Figure 14\u20137) . Another significant energy loss occurs as the electricity is transmitted and distributed to end users by connecting wires. An alternative to cooling towers is to pass water from a river, a lake, or an ocean over the condensing system (Figure 14\u20134a). With this approach, however, the waste heat energy is transferred to the body of water, with the result that all the small planktonic organisms drawn through the condensing system with the water are cooked and the warm water added back to the waterway may have deleterious effects on the aquatic ecosystem. Thus, waste heat energy discharged into natural waterways is referred to as thermal pollution. Figure 14\u20137 Cooling towers. A coal-fired power plant is equipped with cooling towers to dissipate the heat from the spent steam after it has passed through the turbines. Members of the public often mistake such cooling towers for nuclear reactor containment vessels. Electricity is a form of energy that is indispensable to modern societies as they are currently structured. Worldwide, the electrical power industry produces more than 22,000 billion kilowatt-hours a year and, at the same time, generates a challenging array of environmental problems.", "Matching Energy Sources to Uses In addressing whether energy resources are sufficient and where additional energy can be obtained, it is necessary to consider more than just the source of energy because some forms of energy lend themselves well to one use, but not to others. For example, the vast majority of cars and trucks traveling on U.S. highways have internal combustion engines that require liquid fuels. Almost all other machines used for moving, such as tractors, airplanes, locomotives, and ships, also depend on liquid fuels. An enormous infrastructure has been set up to supply these vehicles with gasoline and other liquid fuels. Crude oil, together with much smaller amounts of biofuels, is needed to support this transportation system. Coal and nuclear power can do little to mitigate the demand for crude oil because they are suitable only for boiling water to drive turbogenerators, which will do essentially nothing for our transportation system. Although this situation might change with more widespread use of electric vehicles, their practicality for long distances still requires a technological breakthrough in the form of a low-cost, lightweight battery that can store large amounts of power. In addition, electric propulsion would not be practical for trucking and aviation. Primary energy use is commonly divided into four categories: (1) transportation, (2) industrial processes, (3) commercial and residential use (heating, cooling, lighting, and appliances), and (4) the generation of electrical power, which goes into categories (2) and (3) as a secondary energy use. The major pathways from the primary energy sources to the various end uses are shown in Figure 14\u20138. Transportation, which represents 27% of energy use, depends on petroleum (and some ethanol), whereas nuclear power, coal, and water power are limited to the production of electricity. Natural gas and oil are more versatile energy sources, and significant shifts have occurred in the use of these sources in recent years. For example, today only 1% of U.S. electricity is generated by oil, whereas 35 years ago it was about 15%. Figure 14\u20138 also indicates the high proportion of consumed energy that is lost as heat (\u201cwaste energy\u201d), rather than being used for its intended purpose\u2014some 59%. Some waste is inevitable, as dictated by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, but the current losses are much greater than necessary. The efficiency of energy use can be doubled for some uses, including cars that get twice as many miles ESTIMATED U.S. ENERGY USE IN 2013 14.1 Energy Sources and Uses 343 per gallon and appliances that consume half as much power. In general, increasing the efficiency of energy use would have the same effect as increasing the energy supply, at far less expense. Such increases in efficiency represent a largely untapped \u201creserve\u201d of energy that is saved, the conservation reserve discussed in more detail in Section 14.5. Of the various energy sources used to generate electricity, those that power steam turbines are used most often. Why might that be? \u2610\u2713 14.2 Exploiting Crude Oil The United States has abundant reserves of coal, adequate reserves of natural gas (at least for the time being), and the potential for the expansion of nuclear power. Therefore, no shortages loom in these areas now. (Note that the environmental concerns regarding coal and nuclear power are being set aside for the moment.) Petroleum to fuel our transportation system, however, is another matter. The U.S. crude-oil supplies fall far short of meeting demand; we now depend on foreign sources for half of our crude oil. Foreign sources come at increasing costs, such as trade imbalances, military actions, economic disruptions, and oil spills. Let us examine the situation, starting with where crude oil comes from and how it is exploited. How Fossil Fuels Are Formed Crude oil, coal, and natural gas are called fossil fuels because they are derived from the remains of living organisms ( Figure 14\u20139) . In the Paleozoic and Mesozoic geological eras, 100 million to 500 million years ago, freshwater swamps and shallow seas, which supported abundant vegetation and phytoplankton, covered vast areas of the globe. Anaerobic conditions in the lowest layers of these bodies of water impeded the breakdown of detritus by decomposers. As a result, massive quantities of dead organic matter accumulated. Over millions of years, this organic matter was gradually buried under layers of sediment and converted by microbial action, pressure, and heat to coal, crude oil, and natural gas. Coal is highly compressed organic matter\u2014mostly leafy material from swamp vegetation\u2014that decomposed relatively little.", "Sediments buried 7,500 to 15,000 feet are in a temperature range that breaks down large organic molecules to smaller carbon molecules, producing crude oil. Below 15,000 feet, molecular breakdown leads to the one-carbon compound methane, or natural gas. The crude oil that is extracted from the ground is a dark mixture of hydrocarbons and contaminants, such as sulfur and nitrogen. Before this mixture can be used, it must be refined to separate the various hydrocarbons and remove the contaminants. In the refining process, crude oil is distilled, or heated to high temperatures so it vaporizes. Because the various hydrocarbon chains are of different lengths, they vaporize and condense at different temperatures. As they condense, they form separate fractions, each with a particular weight and viscosity. The lighter and thinner fractions include kerosene and gasoline. Diesel fuel is heavier and thicker than gasoline; wax and asphalt are even heavier and thicker. Further chemical processes can be used to turn some of the heavier compounds into lighter ones, which are in greater demand. Crude-Oil Reserves Versus Production The total amount of crude oil remaining in the ground represents Earth\u2019s oil resources. Finding and exploiting these resources is the challenge. The science of geology provides information about the probable locations and extents of ancient shallow seas. On the basis of their knowledge and their field experience, geologists make educated guesses as to where oil or natural gas may be located and how much may be found. These estimates are termed undiscovered resources. The estimates may be far off the mark because there is no way to determine whether undiscovered resources actually exist except by exploratory drilling. Proved Reserves. If exploratory drilling confirms the presence of oil, further drilling is conducted to determine the extent and depth of the oil field. From that information, a fairly accurate estimate can be made of how much oil can be economically obtained from the field. That amount then becomes proved reserves. Amounts are given in barrels of oil (1 barrel = 42 gallons), and the content of each reserve field is expressed in probabilities. Thus, a 50% probability, or P50, of 700 million barrels for a field means that a total of 700 million barrels is just as likely as not to come from the field. The final step, the withdrawal of oil or gas from the field, is called production or recovery. Both terms refer to the extraction of materials from Earth. Production from a given field cannot proceed at a constant rate because crude oil is a viscous fluid held in pore spaces in sedimentary rock, just as water is held in a sponge. Initially, the field may be under so much pressure that the first penetration produces a gusher. Gushers, however, are generally short lived, and the oil then seeps slowly from the sedimentary rock into a well from which it is pumped out. Ordinarily, conventional pumping (primary recovery) can remove only 25% of the oil in an oil field. Further removal, of up to 50% of the oil in the field, is often possible, but it is more costly because it involves manipulating pressure in the oil reservoir by injecting brine or steam (secondary recovery), which forces the oil into the wells. In some fields, even greater recovery (enhanced recovery) is obtained by injecting carbon dioxide, which breaks up oil droplets and enables them to flow again. Price Drives the Use of Reserves. Economics\u2014the price of a barrel of oil\u2014determines the extent to which reserves are exploited. No oil company will spend more money to extract oil than it expects to make selling the oil. At $13 per barrel of crude oil, the price in the late 1990s, it was economical to extract no more than 25\u201335% of the oil in a given field. Thus, an increase in price makes more reserves available. In the 1970s and early 1980s, higher oil prices justified reopening old oil fields and created an economic boom in Texas and Louisiana. Then an economic recession occurred in the late 1980s, and a drop in oil prices caused the fields to be shut down again. Following that, oil prices began to rise in 1998, reached a peak of $145 a barrel in mid-2008, and then began a sharp decline as global oil demand dropped\u2014a consequence of a severe global economic crisis. As the global economic picture began to improve, oil prices rose again, until by mid-2011 oil was once again more than $100 a barrel.", "However, increased oil production and a switch to natural gas in some sectors caused the price of oil to continue to change, dropping precipitously in 2014. 14.2 Exploiting Crude Oil 345 FORMATION OF FOSSIL FUELS (a) Plants and phytoplankton use the Sun\u2019s energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic carbons.

Four stages can 21 be seen: (1) Up to 1970, the discovery of new reserves allowed production to parallel increasing 20 consumption. (2) From 1970 to 1973, a lack of new oil discoveries caused production to decline while consumption continued to climb, resulting in a vast increase in oil imports. (3) In the late 1970s to 18 early 1980s, high oil prices promoted both lowered consumption and increased production\u2014 which included bringing the Alaskan oil field into pro 16 duction. (4) From 1986, when oil prices declined sharply, until the present, consumption has again increased while production has resumed its decline, until very recently.

Crude oil (millions of barrels per day) 14 Crude oil (billions of barrels per year) 12 10 8 6 4 2 U.S. Reserves and Importation Up to 1970, the United States was fairly oil independent, producing about two-thirds of oil consumed and keeping imported oil prices low (Figure 14\u201310) . In 1970, however, new discoveries fell short, so production decreased, while consumption continued to grow rapidly. This downturn vindicated the predictions of the late geologist M. King Hubbert, who proposed that oil exploitation in a region would follow a bell-shaped curve. Hubbert observed the pattern of U.S. exploitation and predicted that U.S. production would peak (now called the Hubbert peak) between 1965 and 1970. At that point, about half of the available oil would have been withdrawn, and production would decline gradually as reserves were exploited. Figure 14\u201310 demonstrates that a Hubbert curve can be applied to U.S. oil production. To fill the energy gap between rising consumption and falling production, the United States depended increasingly on imported oil, primarily from the Arab countries of the Middle East. European countries and Japan did likewise. The Oil Crisis of the 1970s. It was obvious that the United States and most other highly industrialized nations were becoming dependent on oil imports. In a classic economic move, a group of predominantly Arab countries known as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) formed a cartel and agreed to restrain production in order to get higher prices. Imported oil began to cost more in the early 1970s, and then, in conjunction with an Arab-Israeli war in 1973, OPEC initiated an embargo of oil sales to countries that gave military and economic support to Israel (such as the United States). Spot shortages quickly occurred, which escalated into widespread panic and long lines at gas stations. We were willing to pay almost anything to have oil shipments resumed\u2014and pay we did: OPEC resumed shipments at a price of $12 a barrel ($66 in 2015 dollars), more than four times the previous price of $2.30 a barrel. Then, by continuing to limit oil production all through the 1970s, OPEC was able to keep supplies tight enough to force prices even higher. In the early 1980s, a barrel of oil delivered to the United States cost $36 ($90 in 2015 dollars), and the United States was paying accordingly. The high energy costs were devastating to the economy; inflation and unemployment rose and the country experienced several recessions. The purchase of foreign oil became, and remains, the single largest factor in our balance-of-trade deficit\u2014where we buy more goods from other countries than we sell as exports. Adjusting to Higher Prices. In response to the higher prices, the United States and other industrialized countries made a number of adjustments during the 1970s.", "The following are the most significant changes made by the United States: The results of the new actions were not immediate, nor could quick returns have been expected. For example, it takes at least three to five years to design a new car model and start production. Then another six to eight years pass before enough new models are sold and old ones retired to affect the overall highway \u201cfleet.\u201d As we entered the 1980s, however, these efforts were definitely having an impact. The United States continued to depend substantially on foreign oil, but consumption was declining, and production, up after the Alaska pipeline was Million barrels per day 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 Year 14.2 Exploiting Crude Oil 347 completed, was holding its own (see Figure 14\u201310). Elsewhere in the world, significant discoveries in Mexico, Africa, and the North Sea made the world less dependent on OPEC oil. As a result of all these factors, plus OPEC\u2019s inability to restrain its own members\u2019 production, world oil production exceeded consumption in the mid-1980s, and there was an oil \u201cglut.\u201d Supply exceeded demand, with predictable results. In 1986, world oil prices crashed from the high $20s to $14 per barrel. From that time until late 1999, oil prices fluctuated in the range from $10 to $20 per barrel, almost as low as they were in the early 1970s. The lower oil prices apparently benefited consumers, industry, and oil-dependent developing nations, but they hardly solved the underlying problem. Back to Old Ways. Whereas high oil prices stimulated constructive responses, the collapse in oil prices undercut those responses: Production of crude oil in the United States continued to drop as proved reserves were drawn down. At the same time, consumption of crude oil rose again because of increases in the number of cars on the highways and the average number of miles per year that each car is driven. Adding to that consumption, consumers began buying vehicles that were less fuel efficient. Minivans, four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), light trucks, and other less fuel-efficient models constituted more than half of the new-car market. Our dependence on foreign oil rose after the mid-1980s. Recently, however, intensive oil production in the United States has lessened our dependence. Today less than 50% of the crude oil we use comes from imports (Figure 14\u201311) . Figure 14\u201311 Consumption, domestic production, imports, and exports of petroleum products. After the oil crises of the 1970s, the United States became less reliant on foreign oil. Since the mid-1980s, consumption of foreign oil has been rising, although recently it has fallen.

The collapse in oil prices set the stage for another developing crisis: a rise in oil prices that began in late 1998. OPEC was concerned about the continuing oil glut and its low prices, so it decided to cut production just as East Asia was coming out of a serious recession. The rapid rise in demand brought on a shortfall in the oil supply, and the price of crude oil rose precipitously (Figure 14\u201312a) . With demand outpacing supply, oil prices kept rising, peaking in mid-2008. Homeowners were strapped with high fuel-oil prices, commuters faced gasoline prices in the $4 range (Figure 14\u201312b) , people cut back on driving, economic growth began to slacken, and only the oil industry prospered as record profits poured in. Internationally, food prices rose to unprecedented levels, forcing many in the developing world into dependency and hunger. In the United States, shoppers purchased smaller vehicles, sales of hybrid vehicles blossomed, and the auto industry began closing factories Year that produced SUVs, vans, and trucks. Once again, Congress responded, raising the fuel efficiency standard, mandating the increasing use of renewable fuels, and establishing new standards for energy efficiency. In the fall of 2008, the U.S. housing market collapsed and the bottom dropped out of the stock market.", "Soon the countries of the world slid into a recession that was called the worst in 75 years. The impact on oil prices was profound: Oil demand dropped, supply exceeded demand, and the price dropped back below $50 a barrel by December of the same year. Gasoline prices dropped down into the $2 a gallon range, and homeowners facing the winter could anticipate much lower fuel-oil prices. Oil-exporting countries suddenly faced a sharp decline in their revenues. However, prices have risen and fallen since then. International factors, such as political unrest in several oil-producing countries and large oil purchases by China, caused prices to increase. More recently, 14.2 Exploiting Crude Oil 349 the extraction of oil trapped in shale in the United States has led to lower prices. Because of the complexity of the international market, the future price of oil is hard to predict. The Consequences of U.S. Dependency What problems does our dependency on foreign oil present? Such a dependency presents problems at three levels: (1) the costs of purchasing oil, (2) the risk of supply disruptions due to political instability in the Middle East, and (3) ultimate resource limitations. Costs of Purchase. The United States exports a small amount of oil and imports a great deal. The cost of this reliance on foreign oil is an increased trade deficit. In some years, our net oil trade deficit accounts for as much as two-thirds of our total deficit. The oil trade deficit reflects the volume of imports and the price of oil at the time: A high oil price increases the deficit, and a low price decreases it. After increases in the early 2000s, by 2014 our oil trade deficit had been decreasing for several years. Payments for foreign oil have significant consequences for our economy. The price we pay at the pump is basically the same whether the oil is produced here or abroad. If the oil is produced at home, however, the money we pay for it circulates within our own economy, providing jobs and producing other goods and services. Finally, there are the environmental costs of oil spills such as the Deepwater Horizon accident and of other forms of pollution from the drilling, refining, and consumption of fuels\u2014although estimating total damage in dollars is sometimes difficult. Persian Gulf Oil. Our dependence on foreign oil poses risks to our national security. The Middle East is a politically unstable region of the world. As noted earlier, it was the unexpected Arab boycott that plunged us into the first oil crisis in 1973. Maintaining access to Middle Eastern oil is also a major reason for our efforts toward negotiating peace agreements between various parties in that region. Recognizing this political instability, President Jimmy Carter in January 1980 stated that the United States would use military force if needed to ensure our access to Persian Gulf oil (the so-called Carter Doctrine). This doctrine was tested in the fall of 1990 when Saddam Hussein of Iraq invaded Kuwait, then producing 6 million barrels of oil per day. The U.S.-led Persian Gulf War of early 1991 threw Hussein\u2019s armies out of Kuwait and gave the United States an established military presence in the Persian Gulf region. It was this presence, however, that angered the radical Islamic terrorist Al Qaeda organization and contributed to the horrific September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Two More Wars. In response to 9/11, U.S. and British forces invaded Afghanistan, which had been harboring Osama bin Laden and elements of Al Qaeda. The purpose of the war was to capture bin Laden, destroy the Al Qaeda training camps, and overthrow the ruling Taliban regime. Although Afghanistan is not an oil-producing country, it can be argued that the Afghan war was a consequence of our presence in the Persian Gulf region. The Afghan war was formally ended in December 2014, although U.S. troops were expected to remain there until 2016. It was America\u2019s longest war, but did not result in a clear end of the Taliban regime. Figure 14\u201313 The U.S.-Iraqi war and oil. A soldier from the U.S. 173rd Airborne stands guard at a refinery near the Baba Gurgur oil field in Kirkuk, Iraq. In 2003, a U.S.\u2013British coalition invaded Iraq in order to overthrow Saddam Hussein\u2019s rule and eliminate suspected weapons of mass destruction (Figure 14\u201313) . Some observers suggest that oil was an important part of the picture.", "Although it is clear that the United States and Britain did not simply commandeer the Iraqi oil, they have spent billions to restore Iraq\u2019s oil industry\u2014and the United States and other oil-hungry Western countries are eager customers for the oil now that it is flowing again at a rate of 2.9 million barrels per day. Those countries rely on Persian Gulf oil for half of their oil imports. It is fair to say that military costs associated with maintaining access to Persian Gulf oil represent a substantial U.S. government subsidy of our oil consumption, one that has also been costly in human lives. Other Sources. The United States has turned more and more to non\u2013Middle Eastern oil suppliers. Canada is now the number-one exporter of oil to the United States, with about 40% of the market. Mexico and Colombia are also major sources of oil. Western Hemisphere sources now provide about 52% of our imports. The relative political stability and proximity of these sources are good reasons for the United States to turn to them and away from the Middle East. Russia, a number of former Soviet republics, and several African countries (especially Nigeria) are important new sources of oil. However, most of these other sources, like the United States, are on the downside of the Hubbert curve and are seeing production declining. The conclusion? We will continue to depend on OPEC and the Persian Gulf for a substantial share of our oil imports. Oil Resource Limitations and Peak Oil Crude-oil production in the United States is decreasing because of diminishing domestic reserves. Moreover, on the basis of the \u201cEaster-egg hypothesis,\u201d there is dim hope for major new U.S. finds. According to this hypothesis, as your searching turns up fewer and fewer eggs, you draw the logical conclusion that nearly all the eggs have been found. In terms of oil, North America is already the most intensively explored of any continental landmass. The last major find was the Alaskan oil field in 1968. Discoveries since then have been small in comparison, with increasing numbers of dry holes in between. Indeed, much of the \u201cnew\u201d oil in the United States is coming from innovative computer mapping of geological structures and horizontal drilling technology that enable oil to be identified and withdrawn from small isolated pockets that were previously missed within old fields. The Deepwater Horizon oil leak was a consequence of the need to develop wells in deeper water and deeper below the sea floor in order to keep production up. In spite of the high costs (and risks) of offshore oil, it accounts for 30% of domestic production at present. Oil resources like deep Gulf oil and potential resources (undiscovered) below the Arctic Ocean will be exploited only if prices are high enough to pay for exploration and production (see Sound Science, Energy Returned on Energy Invested). How much oil is still available for future generations? More than 1,150 billion barrels (BBs) of oil have already been used, almost all in the 20th century. Currently, the nations of the world are using about 92 million barrels per day. Rising demand by the developing countries has more than counterbalanced a slight decline in the demand for oil in some developed countries resulting from weak economies and greater energy efficiency, so the global demand for oil continues to rise. How long can the existing oil reserves provide that oil? As with many issues, it depends upon whom you believe. Hubbert\u2019s Peak. Some years ago, oil geologists Colin Campbell and Jean Laherr\u00e8re provided an analysis that put the world\u2019s proved reserves at about 850 BBs.1 This is much lower than the 1,688 BBs claimed by more recent oil industry reports (Table 14\u20132) . On the basis of their estimates and the known amount already used, the two geologists calculated a Hubbert curve indicating that peak oil production has already occurred. Princeton professor and former oil geologist Kenneth Deffeyes used the Hubbert technique in his book Beyond Oil: The View from Hubbert\u2019s Peak to draw the same conclusions. 2 Even if these scientists are wrong and the oil industry estimates are right, it would delay the peak by only a decade at most. The Association for the Study of Peak Oil (ASPO), founded by Colin Campbell, believes that the peak for conventional oil is already behind us (Figure 14\u201314) . If not, it is likely to be close, from all reports.", "1Colin J. Campbell and Jean H. Laherr\u00e8re, \u201cThe End of Cheap Oil,\u201d Scientific American, March 1998. 2Kenneth Deffeyes, Beyond Oil: The View from Hubbert\u2019s Peak (New York: Hill and Wang, 2005). GLOBAL OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION PROFILES 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 1930 Downward Trajectory. At the current rate of use (which is expected to rise), the proved reserves can supply only 43 years of oil demand. New discoveries continue to add to proved reserves, but they are only a fraction of our annual use. The remaining oil will be more costly to extract, and at some point, producers will close wells rather than sustain losses on their oil production. Thus, the 21st century will be an era of declining oil use. As oil becomes scarcer, and developing countries such as China and India demand more of it, the United States needs to be careful about its dependence on foreign oil. We can become more independent in three ways: (1) We can increase the fuel efficiency of our transportation system, which uses most of the oil; (2) we can develop alternatives to fossil fuels, many of which are ready now; and (3) we can use the other fossil fuel resources we have to make fuel for vehicles. This leads us to some non-conventional sources of oil\u2014oil sand and oil shale\u2014which are abundant in the United States and Canada. Oil Sand and Oil Shale Oil sand is a sedimentary material containing bitumen, an extremely viscous, tarlike hydrocarbon. When oil sand is heated, the bitumen can be \u201cmelted out\u201d and refined in the same way as crude oil can. Northern Alberta, in Canada, has the world\u2019s largest oil-sand deposits, and Canada is commercially exploiting them because the cost has been competitive with oil prices. Canadian oil sands currently yield 1.6 million barrels of oil per day (584 million barrels per year). The United States is eager to buy the oil, which represents more than 10% of our imported oil. Oil from the Canadian oil sands is piped to refineries in Oklahoma and Illinois via the Keystone pipelines (Figure 14\u201315) . 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 Year Billions of barrels of oil equivalent per year (Gb/a) 14.2 Exploiting Crude Oil 351 Figure 14\u201314 Hubbert curve of oil and gas production. The A ssociation for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas believes that combined oil and gas production has already peaked. (Source: ASPO Newsletter No. 100, April 2009. http://aspoireland.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/ newsletter100_200904.pdf. October 20, 2011.) These pipelines have a limited capacity, however, and TransCanada Keystone has proposed a longer and larger pipeline, the Keystone XL, that would run 1,700 miles through seven U.S. states to Port Arthur, Texas, on the Gulf coast. This proposed extension is controversial. Proponents cite the large number of jobs the pipeline construction would provide, property taxes to the communities it would pass through, and the energy security that Canadian oil provides to the United States. Objections to the Keystone XL project are many: leaks in the pipeline are bound to occur; the pipeline would cross ecologically sensitive lands; and it would also cross over major recharge areas of the Oglalla aquifer, an extremely important source of irrigation water to Midwestern states. (In 2010, corrosive oil from oil sands broke a pipeline owned by a Canadian energy company, polluting the Kalamazoo River in Michigan, even though the company had known about the corrosion of the pipes for five years.) In addition, Canada does not guarantee that the oil carried through this extension will be sold to the United States. Opponents are also concerned about the substantial environmental damage associated with the extraction of oil from the Canadian oil sands; 110,000 acres of boreal forest and wetlands have already been heavily disturbed. In addition, the extraction process generates enormous quantities of greenhouse gases. Oil shale is a fine sedimentary rock containing a mixture of solid, waxlike hydrocarbons called kerogen. The United States has extensive deposits of oil shale in Colorado, Utah, Texas, and Wyoming. When shale is heated to about 1,100\u00b0F (600\u00b0C), the kerogen releases hydrocarbon vapors that can be recondensed to form a black, viscous substance similar to crude oil, which can then be refined into gasoline and other petroleum products. However, about a ton of oil shale yields little more than half a barrel of oil.", "The mining, transportation, and disposal of wastes necessitated by an operation producing, for instance, a million barrels a day (just 5% of U.S. demand) would be a Herculean task, to say nothing of its environmental impact. Nevertheless, because the deposits contain an estimated 800 billion barrels of oil, the rising costs of importing oil make it inevitable that every domestic source will be considered. In November 2008, the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) finalized rules for how commercial oil-shale leases will be regulated, opening the way for oil companies to begin serious consideration of developing oil from the shale deposits. The process faces stiff opposition because of its potential to damage air quality and groundwater; any oil-shale development is subject to National Environmental Protection Act analysis (environmental impact statements) and must get local and state approval. Worldwide, the combination of oil shale and oil sand has been estimated to hold several trillion barrels of oil. Large-scale commercial development of oil sands has begun, but oil shale will remain undeveloped until oil prices rise. However, shale has recently begun yielding natural gas. How would a drop in the price of oil be expected to affect the excavation of oil sands? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 14.3 Drilling for Natural Gas In the United States, natural gas is gaining popularity as a fossil fuel of choice. Natural gas has a number of benefits over other fossil fuels. Burning gas in power plants releases only half as much CO2 as burning coal to produce the same amount of electricity. Natural gas is also cleaner than either oil or coal, releasing far fewer pollutants when it is burned. Almost equal quantities of natural gas go to industrial, residential, and commercial use and electrical power genera tion (Figure 14\u20138). As with oil, the cost of natural gas is sub ject to market fluctuations in supply and demand, and prices often rise and fall with seasonal changes. At the 2014 rate of use (24.4 trillion cubic feet), proved reserves in the United States (308 trillion cubic feet) hold only a 12-year supply of gas. However, new drilling is opening up more deposits. Shale Gas and Fracking. Until recently, most natural gas was mined from fields associated with oil and coal (Figure 14\u201316) . As a fossil fuel, gas production in the United States peaked in 1970 and gradually declined. Proved reserves were not increasing as rapidly as domestic use. All this has changed, however. Using new techniques adapted from oil extraction, an abundant source of natural gas trapped in shale has dramatically changed the natural gas picture in the past few years. New shale gas resources provide an additional supply of gas, bringing the estimated reserves to 2,300 trillion cubic feet, or a total of about 100 years at today\u2019s usage rate. This is a conservative estimate. The United States is blessed with an abundance of shale gas basins, the largest being the huge Marcellus basin extending from New York to Tennessee. Some natural gas has always been found around shale rock formations, tapped by conventional vertical wells, but enormous quantities of gas remained trapped in the shale itself. The new shale mining technique involves Gas-rich shale Gas trapped in Oil dense sand Figure 14\u201316 Geology of natural gas resources. Until recently, most natural gas was accessed via vertical drilling into reservoirs associated with coal and oil. Natural gas is also found in isolated beds. Natural gas trapped in shale and in very densely packed sand or silt has recently been developed using horizontal drilling and \u201cfracking,\u201d or injecting hydraulic fluid under high pressure to open up the shale and release the gas. (Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration.) 14.3 Drilling for Natural Gas 353 drilling a vertical well into the shale and then turning the drill horizontally for distances up to a mile ( Figure 14\u201317) . Then, at regular intervals along the horizontal pipe, hydraulic fluids containing sand are forced into the pipe by huge pumps, fracturing the shale and releasing gas into spaces propped open by sand. The fluid, and then the gas, flows back up the well. The technique is called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking; the amount of hydraulic fluids pumped into just one well can exceed a million gallons at a single stage, and a number of stages can be employed over time at the well. The new shale sources have risen to 20% of U.S. gas production, and one consequence of this new abundance is lower prices.", "However, there are some serious environmental concerns with shale gas and fracking. Although the hydraulic fluids used are mostly water, other chemicals are added to the water, and much of the fluid comes back up to the surface in the process, requiring holding ponds that over time could leak into groundwater. The injected water could also contaminate underground drinking water sources at other stages in the process. A 2014 report on the environmental effects of fracking by the New York State Department of Health described a wide array of public health consequences resulting from fracking, such as air and water pollution. One less well-known consequence of deep-well injection of wastewater was an increase in the number of earthquakes. New York State\u2019s ban on fracking was, in part, a response to this report. 3 3NY State Department of Health, A Public Health Review of High Volume Hydraulic Fracturing for Shale Gas Development, 2014, 176. (b) Figure 14\u201317 Hydraulic fracturing. Fracking can be used to extract either natural gas or oil from porous shale. (a) The fracking process starts with the injection of a fluid containing water, sand, and chemicals into shale. The pressure of the fluid fractures the rocks, allowing bubbles of trapped gas or oil to move to the surface. (b) These fracking wells and storage pools are located on the Roan Plateau in Colorado. Because of the increasing fleet of natural gas power plants (Figure 14\u20135), gas is expected to surpass coal if supplies con tinue to grow as expected and prices stay low. And because of its extensive use in residential and commercial heating, natural gas has been replacing oil as well. But if we need to move to an economy that is not based on fossil fuels, this reliance on natural gas can be only a temporary stage. Global Resources. Worldwide, the estimated natural-gas resource base is even more plentiful ( Table 14\u20132) than in the United States. Almost four times as much equivalent gas (that is, equivalent in energy) is likely to be available as oil. Much of it, however, is relatively inaccessible. Gas must either be pumped through a pipeline (a process limited by the length of the line) or be subjected to high pressures so that it remains a liquid at room temperature (liquefied natural gas, or LNG). It can then be shipped in large tankers; currently, eight LNG terminals in the United States handle these ships. Thirteen more have been approved but are not yet built. Constructing new LNG terminals has proven to be difficult, as the public views the terminals and tankers as major security and safety hazards. With domestic gas supplies now more abundant, new LNG terminals may not be needed. Natural Gas\u2013Run Cars. Natural gas can also meet some of the fuel needs for transportation. With the installation of a tank for compressed gas in the trunk and some modifications of the engine fuel-intake system\u2014costing several thousand dollars\u2014a car will run perfectly well on natural gas. Natural gas is a clean-burning fuel, producing carbon dioxide and water but virtually no hydrocarbons or sulfur oxides. Natural gas is in use in the United States by many buses and a number of private and government car fleets, but use is restricted due to the limited number of natural-gas service stations. Detroit automakers have stopped selling natural gas\u2013powered cars, but they are abundant in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Worldwide, some 18 million natural gas vehicles were in operation in 2014, many of them buses; such vehicles are expected to number 25 million by 2019. It will take stronger public-policy support for this option to grow in the United States; until that happens, the natural-gas option will likely stay on the back burner. Synthetic Oil. With the aid of the Fischer-Tropsch process, developed in the 1920s, natural gas can be chemically converted to a hydrocarbon that is liquid at room temperature and pressure\u2014basically, a synthetic oil. Researchers are hotly pursuing ways to convert natural gas to synthetic oil more efficiently. Presently, the fuel produced is only about 10% more expensive than oil. Several major oil companies are spending billions on gearing up refineries to convert gas to liquid diesel and home-heating fuels and researchers are seeking an appropriate catalyst that can convert natural gas (methane) to methanol (methyl alcohol), a liquid. These options promise to make the abundant, but inaccessible, \u201cstranded\u201d natural gas deposits suddenly very valuable.", "Applying natural gas to the transportation sector\u2014both directly as a fuel and indirectly as a synthetic oil\u2014may extend the oil phase of our economy, but it will not be a sustainable solution because it is still a fossil fuel. What are two benefits of using natural gas? What are two concerns? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 14.4 Mining Coal 355 14.4 Mining Coal Coal is the world\u2019s most abundant fossil fuel. The leading producer of coal is China (3.6 billion tons in 2013), where a booming economy has stimulated energy demand. Most of this is burned to produce electricity; coal provides nearly 80% of China\u2019s electricity. In the United States, 45% of electricity comes from coal-fired power plants. In cost per British thermal unit (Btu), coal is much less expensive than natural gas or oil. Current U.S. reserves are calculated to be 237 billion tons, and at the 2013 rate of production (0.98 billion tons/year), the supply could last hundreds of years. Unlike oil and natural gas, we produce more coal each year than we use, and we export about 6% of coal production annually. Mining coal can be hazardous, and injuries and fatalities are not uncommon\u2014in 2013, a methane explosion in a Turkish coal mine killed more than 300 miners and trapped 600 others underground. Although such accidents are rare, coal mining comes with many dangers. The most serious of these is the occupational disease called black lung, or coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis (CWP), acquired by inhaling coal dust. Fatalities and hospitalizations from this disease have risen in recent years, prompting the federal government to post new regulations designed to lower the risks posed by coal dust. Coal can be obtained by surface mining (67%) or underground mining (33%). Both methods have substantial environmental impacts. Land subsidence and underground fires often occur in conjunction with underground mines. The town of Centralia, Pennsylvania, for example, has been abandoned and bought by the government because of a coal fire that started 40 years ago and could burn for another 100 years. Coal fires around the world produce almost as much carbon dioxide as do all the cars and trucks in the United States, contributing significantly to the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. In underground mining, at least 50% of the coal must be left in place to support the roof of the mine, which is one reason why mining companies have turned to surface mining. Surface Mining In surface, or strip, mining, dynamite is used to break overlying layers, and then gigantic power shovels turn aside the rock above the coal seam and remove the coal. For example, mountaintop removal mining began in the southern Appalachians in the late 1970s as a more economical way to get at the valuable low-sulfur coal found in seams up to 1,000 feet down. The Whitesville mine ( Figure 14\u201318) is only one of many that have devastated parts of West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. Roughly 7%\u2014more than 470 mountains\u2014of the 12 million acres of mountainous land in these states has been or will soon be disturbed by mountaintop removal. Already, more than 700 miles of streams have been completely buried, and another 800 miles have been degraded by the waste products that leach from the mine waste. (This process is similar to the mountaintop removal process used in China to create new land; see Chapter 11.) Lawsuits in the late 1990s over the impact of mine waste held the practice down, but a rule by the Bush administration changed all that. In 2002, mining debris was reclassified from \u201cwaste\u201d to \u201cfill,\u201d thus allowing companies free rein to dump the debris into stream valleys. A number of grassroots organizations, including the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, Mountain Justice, Appalachian Voices, and Christians for the Mountains, have been formed to combat mountaintop removal mining. They face a formidable array of supporters of the coal industry who argue that the procedure is legal, generates thousands of jobs, and provides the country with cheap energy. Indeed, the state of West Virginia supplies about 15% of U.S. coal production. In recent years, mountaintop removal mining has come under greater regulatory control. Citing the Clean Water Act, the EPA issued \u201cfinal guidance\u201d on the mining practices; these guidelines strengthen and clarify the permitting process and give greater protection to waterways affected by mining operations. This action was prompted by a widespread Figure 14\u201318 Aerial view of mountaintop coal removal. This coal mining operation in Whitesville, West Virginia, is managed by Massey Energy.", "The tops of mountains are stripped away and dumped in valleys to get at the coal below. failure of the mining companies to provide water discharge monitoring reports and the use of a fast-track permitting process that led to violations of the Clean Water Act. Coal Power Virtually all of the coal the United States produces is used to generate electricity. Once it is mined, coal is transported to large power plants. A typical 1,000-MW plant burns 8,000 tons of coal a day\u2014a mile-long train\u2019s worth. Combustion of this much coal releases 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide and 800 tons of sulfur dioxide (most of which is prevented from entering the atmosphere if the power plant is well provided with scrubbers; see Chapter 19). Then there is the waste: 800 tons of fly ash and 800 tons of boiler residue ash daily, requiring a special landfill. A 2008 spill of coal ash slurry in a containment area of a coal plant run by the Tennessee Valley Authority in Kingston, Tennessee, sent 1.1 billion gallons (4.2 million cubic meters) across 300 acres of land and into adjacent streams. This spill caused the EPA to reevaluate coal ash storage and begin a long process of developing a regulation to protect the ground and water from such contamination. This regulation was finalized in 2014. Coal-burning power plants are responsible for more than generating electricity; each year pollution from them takes an estimated 13,200 lives and costs more than $100 billion in health care expenditures. The main reason for these impacts is older power plants that lack pollution controls, exempted by grandfather clauses in older Clean Air Act legislation. The EPA invoked the Clean Air Act \u201cgood neighbor rule,\u201d which prohibits downwind pollution, to issue its Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. This rule required heavy reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in older power plants, effective in 2014. However, much of the impact of coal-burning power plants is their effect on greenhouse gas emissions, discussed next. Climate Issues Coal combustion is the world\u2019s largest source of CO2, which is the greenhouse gas most significantly forcing climate change (see Chapter 18 ). If progress is to be made in reducing CO2 emissions, coal should be on the way out. In reality, new coal-burning power plants are coming on line as older ones are being phased out. The new plants are more efficient and are equipped with the latest pollution controls but lack any control of CO2 emissions. Yet it turns out that there are ways to continue to use coal and, at the same time, greatly reduce CO2 emissions, but the technology is still being developed. The government-and-industry-sponsored Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) program is the successor to the Clean Coal Technology (CCT) program. The CCT supported a spectrum of experimental technologies applicable to existing power plants and to a new generation of coal-fired power plants. The objectives of both programs have been to remove pollutants from coal before or after burning and to achieve higher efficiencies so that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. Another technology developed under the program is the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant. In IGCC, coal is mixed with water and oxygen and heated under pressure to produce a synthetic gas, or syngas, which is burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity. Sulfur and other contaminants are removed before burning. The CO2 stream from the process is concentrated; one syngas plant in North Dakota pipes the CO2 to an oil field, where it is injected into oil wells to enhance recovery. Clean coal technologies would be an improvement over the current ones. But they still involve substantial greenhouse gas emissions and all of the drawbacks of mining the coal. In 2014, the EPA proposed a Clean Power Plan, a regulation to lower greenhouse gas emissions from power plants to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The EPA estimated that this rule would result in climate and health benefits worth $55\u2013$93 billion in 2030; those health benefits would include the prevention of 2,700\u20136,600 premature deaths and 140,000\u2013150,000 asthma attacks in children. 4 What are two advantages and two disadvantages of using coal as a source of energy? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 14.5 Energy Policy Because energy supply and demand are nationwide issues, only federal policies have the sweeping power to effect changes that will make a difference. Public policy can bring about major improvements in energy use.", "During the period from 1973 to 1995, the United States saw an 18% reduction in energy growth, saving the economy $150 billion a year in energy expenditures. This reduction was due to the steps taken in response to the oil crisis of the 1970s. But as that crisis faded into history, the country slipped back into old ways. The state of affairs clearly demanded a new energy policy. Supply-Side and Demand-Side Policies In order to have secure energy and be less reliant on imported oil, both supply-side and demand-side policy options are possible. Supply-side initiatives increase available fossil fuels, whereas demand-side policies lower the use of fossil fuels through efficiency or alternative energy sources. Supply-side policies dealing with fossil-fuel energy are business-as-usual solutions to our energy security issues. They do little to reduce our vulnerability to oil price disruptions, terrorist actions, and global climate change. Demand-side policies, by contrast, have the advantage of reducing our energy needs and making it possible to move to a future in which renewable energy can take over. Such policies will decrease our vulnerability to terrorists and to disruptions of the oil market. They will also save money and reduce pollution from burning fossil fuels. 4EPA, \u201cFact Sheet: Clean Power Plan Overview: Cutting Carbon Pollution from Power Plants,\u201d December 23, 2014, http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution standards/fact-sheet-clean-power-plan-overview. 14.5 Energy Policy 357 Overview of Major Energy Policies In recent years, the federal government has used both supply-side and demand-side policies to influence our use of energy. Table 14\u20133 and Table 14\u20134 (on the following page) compare features of three recent federal energy policies. After years of debate, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (PA), which was intended to establish U.S. energy policies for years to come. The PA acted on recommendations from the Bush administration to increase the energy supply, but also included a mixture of other initiatives. Then a sea change in environmental policy led to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EI), which addressed mainly the demand side. After 2008, the new Obama administration used both supply and demand policies to influence energy policy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 directed $90 billion into clean energy. The Recovery Act and various Obama administration actions related to energy policy are referred to as O&R. Current U.S. energy policy focuses on lowering dependence on foreign oil, making sure our energy supply is secure, and solving climate change. To achieve these goals, we use a combination of approaches, some of which are better for the environment and some of which are worse. Supply-Side Policies. To increase supply, the federal government has pursued actions that allow for faster permitting, increased exploration, and greater use of public lands in exploring and developing domestic sources of oil and gas. Two very contentious issues in increasing domestic sources have been the approval of new oil pipelines and the possibility of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to drilling. The O&R approved an oil pipeline into Minnesota and Wisconsin to transport oil from Alberta\u2019s tar sands, approved drilling of exploratory wells in the Arctic Ocean, and advocated for approval of the Keystone XL pipeline for oil from Canada\u2019s tar sands. The increasing use of coal has been another controversial element of supply-side policy. The O&R opened up new federal lands in Wyoming\u2019s Powder River Basin to coal mining, potentially yielding 2.35 billion tons of coal. The PA promoted energy from coal via \u201cclean coal\u201d technologies. Several of these provisions have been hotly contested by people concerned about their environmental effects. Federal laws have continued subsidies to oil and nuclear industries, an approach not supported by environmentalists or advocates for small government. The PA guaranteed $6.9 billion in tax incentives and billions more in loans. In contrast, the EI included a broad repeal of tax incentives for oil and gas in the original legislation, designed to offset the cost of many of the new elements of the law. Opposition to the repeal forced the removal of this option. The O&R recommended cutting oil and gas subsidies in order to fund a proposed $467 billion job-creation package. Demand-Side Policies. Lowering demand requires more efficient technology and changes in behavior. This is done through a number of incentives and disincentives\u2014\u201ccarrots\u201d and \u201csticks.\u201d Some changes have the effect of removing economic externalities by making environmentally damaging activities reflect their true cost. For example, in 2014 the EPA began to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases from coal-fired gas plants.", "This was a huge step in reflecting the true cost of coal on the environment. Table 14\u20134 shows several ways the federal energy laws promote energy policies to lower demand. Increasing the mileage for motor vehicles, for example, results from raising the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards, the fuel efficiency requirements for vehicles. The most recent energy policy mandated a CAFE target of 38 mpg for cars and 28 mpg for light trucks by 2016. New standards have also been issued for heavy trucks and buses, designed to increase fuel economy by 25%. This conservation reserve has already been tapped to some extent, because auto manufacturers had already doubled the average fuel efficiency of cars from 13 to 27.5 mpg. Federal law also grants consumer tax credits for fuel-efficient hybrid and other advanced-technology vehicles. Lighting, appliances, and buildings. Demand can be lowered by increasing the energy efficiency of lighting, appliances, and buildings. The PA provided tax breaks for manufacturers of energy efficient appliances; encouraged the EPA to continue its Energy Star program, which also addresses energy efficient buildings; and provided tax breaks for those making energy efficiency improvements to their homes (see Chapter 16). The EI required a 30% efficiency in crease for lightbulbs. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs) are between 20% and 25% efficient ( Figure 14\u201319), whereas incandescent lightbulbs are only 5% efficient. This act also set new efficiency standards for appliances (such as refrigerators, freezers, washers, dishwashers), addressed energy efficiency in buildings and industry, and encouraged the development of energy efficient \u201cgreen\u201d commercial buildings. The Recovery Act extended the EPA\u2019s successful Energy Star program to many more facilities; provided tax credits for improving energy efficiency in buildings; developed more efficiency standards for appliances; promoted plans for a smart grid; and invested in weatherizing low-income homes. Combined heat and power. U.S. energy policies encourage industries to use combined heat and power (CHP) technologies. In CHP technology, a factory or large building installs a small power plant that produces electricity and heats the building with the \u201cwaste\u201d heat. Such systems can achieve an efficiency of 80%. A new energy-saving technology\u2014 the combined-cycle natural-gas unit\u2014has been increasingly employed to generate electricity. Two turbines are employed in this unit: The first turbine burns natural gas in a conven tional gas turbine (Figure 14\u20134b); the second turbine is a steam turbine (Figure 14\u20134a) that runs on the excess heat from the gas turbine. The use of this technology boosts the efficiency of the conversion of fuel energy to electrical energy from around 30% to as high as 50%. The cost of combined-cycle systems is half that of conventional coal-burning plants, and the pollution from such systems is much lower. A large proportion of new units being built or planned for the future consists of combined-cycle systems. Renewable energy. Several federal laws promote the greater use of non-fossil fuel sources of energy (nuclear and renewable energy). The PA included a wide range of incentives to stimulate nuclear power: tax credits for generated electricity, insurance against regulatory delays, and federal loan guarantees. The act also authorized $4.5 billion in support of renewable energy and efficiency, with tax credits for wind, solar, and biomass energy and major funding for research and development of renewable energy initiatives. The EI established a renewable fuel standard, encouraging the production of biofuels. The Recovery Act poured some $90 billion into clean energy, including subsidies to renewable energy systems for homes and businesses, electric car development, advanced biofuels, smart electric meters, and factories to manufacture renewable energy components. These and other renewable energy provisions will be covered later ( Chapter 16). Conservation reserve. In rethinking our energy strategies, we need to realize that energy has no real value by 14.5 Energy Policy 359 Figure 14\u201319 Energy-efficient lightbulbs. Replacing standard incandescent lightbulbs with screw-in fluorescent bulbs (shown here) can cut the energy demand for lighting by 75\u201380%. The higher cost of the fluorescent bulbs is more than offset by the greater efficiency and much longer lifetime of the bulb. itself. Its only worth is in the work it can do. Thus, what we really want is not energy, but comfortable homes, transportation, manufactured goods, and so forth. As a result, many energy analysts argue that we should stop thinking in terms of where we can get additional supplies of fossil fuels. Instead, we should be thinking of ways to satisfy these needs with a minimum expenditure of energy and the least environmental impact.", "Imagine discovering a new oil field having a production potential of at least 6 million barrels a day\u2014three times the capacity of the Alaskan field, even at its height. Furthermore, imagine that this newfound field is inexhaustible and that exploiting it will not adversely affect the environment. Of course, such an oil field does not exist, but saving energy through greater efficiency is the equivalent of exploiting an untapped reserve\u2014a conservation reserve. Increasing the Cost of Carbon. A number of economists and environmental groups suggest that we should be paying more for gasoline and other fossil fuels. In most other developed countries, gasoline is so heavily taxed that it costs consumers upward of $6 per gallon\u2014unlike U.S. prices, which were below $3 for 14 of the past 20 years. If the price of fossil fuels included the externalities of their production and consumption, consumers would have an incentive to use less. Thus, increasing the price of these fuels is a demand-side policy. Two strategies for achieving this goal are a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade approach. Both strategies also come up in any discussion of climate change (Chapter 18 ). Carbon tax. A carbon tax is a tax levied on all fuels according to the amount of carbon dioxide that they produce when they are extracted, transported, and consumed. Such a tax would provide incentives to use renewable energy sources, which would not be taxed, and disincentives to consume fossil fuels. A number of European countries have already adopted such a tax, but in the United States such a tax is controversial. Cap and trade. Other economists suggest using a process in which a national government or international body sets a cap on the amount of pollutant allowed into the environment. Different groups are allotted amounts they can produce. They may buy and sell (trade) those rights. A company that invests in very efficient technologies would be able to sell its permits; those that do not would be forced to buy permits. Periodically the total allotment drops, forcing permit holders to become more efficient. The European Union Emission Trading Scheme is an example of a cap-and-trade program. The United States used a similar approach to reduce the emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides that caused acid rain (Chapter 19). State Policies. In addition to federal regulations, states may enact laws that have broad energy impacts. In 2011, for example, California set a higher standard for lightbulb efficiency and enacted a law requiring 33% of state energy supplies to be renewable by 2020; then governor Jerry Brown said this Renewable Energy Portfolio would enable California to lead the country in energy policy. In 2013, California set in place a policy to require utilities to develop energy-storage capacities to lower the risk of power interruptions. In 2014, New York State banned fracking for natural gas. States may also increase taxes on gasoline and other fossil-fuels. International Policies. Countries cooperate internationally in energy policy. The most obvious way is through climate change treaties and nuclear treaties (Chapters 16 and 18). Final Thoughts While conservation of fossil fuels is extremely important, there are two major pathways for developing a low-carbon energy future: pursuing nuclear power and promoting renewable-energy applications. Both could be expanded to meet further energy needs if suitable technological solutions and public acceptance (in the case of nuclear power) or pressure and government support (in the case of renewable energy) are provided. (Chapter 15 focuses on the nuclear option, and Chapter 16 focuses on renewable options).

Nuclear Power Earthquakes are common in Japan, which sits on the Pacific Rim, an area well known for its seismic activity. On March 11, 2011, the Pacific tectonic plate slipped under the plate that lies under northern Japan, 42 miles offshore and 15 miles below the surface (see Chapter 4, Figure 4\u201321, for plate tectonic map). The resulting upthrust triggered an earthquake of magnitude 9.0, the most severe in Japan\u2019s recorded history, and a tsunami that hit the northern Japanese coast with a wall of water 10\u201350 feet high. The earthquake was damaging, but the Japanese infrastructure was built with earthquakes in mind and the damage was not devastating. The tsunami, however, hit the coast within 10\u201330 minutes of the earthquake, sweeping over tsunami seawalls meant to protect cities and towns and pushing buildings, vehicles, and debris inland at a frightening speed. People had little time to escape the incoming waves; the death toll was close to 20,000. More than 1 million buildings were damaged or destroyed, and the economic losses from the disaster were estimated to be more than $300 billion. Japan\u2019s 55 nuclear power plants are located on the coastline where cooling water is available. When the earthquake struck, 11 of the plants shut down automatically. However, several of the plants were on the east coast, and those closest to the epicenter of the earthquake suffered damage first from the earthquake and then from the tsunami. The Fukushima Daiichi power station, with six nuclear reactors, took a direct hit. Seawater swept by the reactors, cut off all electrical power, and demolished the backup generators and diesel fuel tanks. All of the reactors automatically shut down when the quake hit, but even with the nuclear fission halted, radioactive decay in the fuel rods generated heat and needed to be kept cool. With no cooling water available, three of the reactors suffered meltdown of the nuclear fuel in the reactor vessels. Several units were rocked by explosions set off by hydrogen gas generated by extreme temperatures in the fuel rods, stripping the hydrogen from surrounding water. All of these events released radioactive A huge tsunami wave at Miyako City, Japan, on March 11, 2011. 15.1 Nuclear Energy in Perspective 363 fission products into the air. Authorities proclaimed a mandatory evacuation zone for a 12-mile (20-km) radius from the stricken plant; 75,000 people were moved to emergency housing. Containment. The next day, plant workers began to inject seawater into the reactor vessels to cool them down. Another problem became evident when pools holding spent fuel rods also lost water and began releasing radiation. These too eventually received cooling from seawater. Within days, electrical power was restored to the facility, but conditions in the vicinity of the reactors and pools were so radioactive that workers could not get near enough to make repairs. Some 800 workers were involved in efforts to bring the reactors under control, working short periods in order to limit their exposure to the considerable radiation. The 12-mile exclusion zone received significant radioactive fallout from the stricken plant; it is likely that this will become a \u201cdead zone.\u201d Workers erected a fabric cover over the stricken units to contain airborne radiation emanating from the reactors. New cooling systems for the reactors have been established, but temperature levels in the reactors and fuel pools were not brought down below the boiling point until six months after the disaster. Ultimately, the objective of this phase of containment was to achieve cold shutdown\u2014where the temperature at the base of the reactor vessels is below 200\u00b0F and pressure is at 1 atmosphere. By the end of 2011, heat from radioactive decay in the fuel and vessels was under control and no more radioactive vapors were escaping. However, the decommissioning of the plant is expected to take 30 to 40 years. By 2015, there were still 6,000 workers in the plant every day, wearing heavy gear to protect them from the dangerous conditions.", "On a positive 15.1 Nuclear Energy in Perspective Limits to fossil fuel reserves, the environmental costs of their extraction, transport, and use, and the long-term threat of climate change all suggest that an energy future based on fossil fuels is not an option. To achieve a carbon-neutral future, one in which we are not putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than ecosystems can absorb, it seems prudent to do everything possible to develop non-fossil-fuel sources of energy. Nuclear power is an alternative that contributes few emissions to global warming, and there is sufficient uranium to fuel nuclear reactors well into the 21st century, with the possibility of extending the nuclear fuel supply indefinitely through reprocessing technologies. Thirty countries now have nuclear power plants in operation. In some of these countries, nuclear power generates more electricity than any other source. Is nuclear energy the key to the future of global energy? Is nuclear energy the best route to a sustainable relationship with our environment? note, no citizens or plant workers have died from radiation exposure, though a number of workers at the site received significant radiation doses. This is in huge contrast to the death toll from the tsunami. Consequences. Fallout from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was not all radioactive. Shortly after the disaster, Japan\u2019s prime minister, Naoto Kan, announced that his government would cancel plans to build 14 more nuclear power plants, which aimed to bring Japan from its current 30% of electricity generated by nuclear power to 50%. Other countries have responded in divergent ways: China is moving full speed ahead with its plans to increase its reliance on nuclear power but, like virtually every country with nuclear power plants, is assessing safety conditions at all of its existing plants and those under construction. Germany and Switzerland announced plans to phase out nuclear energy, and Italy has put its plans to build new reactors on hold. The United States, like China, has ordered a safety review of all existing nuclear power plants. Japan\u2019s nuclear disaster is a reminder that nuclear power carries with it risks of events that have low probabilities of occurring but huge consequences if they do. Swedish Nobel physicist Hannes Alfv\u00e9n said it well, in reference to nuclear power: \u201cNo acts of God can be permitted.\u201d 1 The 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan is one of the most devastating incidents in the history of nuclear power. In this chapter, we will delve into that history through the lenses of science and public policy as the many concerns about nuclear power are raised and discussed. 1\u201cEnergy and Environment,\u201d Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (May 1972), 6. The History of Nuclear Power Geologists have known for years that fossil fuels would not last forever. Sooner or later, other energy sources would be needed. It was anticipated that nuclear power could produce electricity in such large amounts and so cheaply that we would phase into an economy in which electricity would take over virtually all functions, including the generation of other fuels, at nominal costs. Following World War II, determined to show the world that the power of the atom could benefit humankind, the U.S. government embarked on a course to lead the world into the Nuclear Age. The Nuclear Age. And so the government moved into the research, development, and promotion of commercial nuclear power plants (along with the continuing development of nuclear weaponry). Using this research, companies such as General Electric and Westinghouse constructed nuclear power plants that were ordered and paid for by utility companies, with assurances from the federal government, via the Price-Anderson Act of 1957, that these corporations and utilities would be covered by insurance for any legal Figure 15\u20131 Nuclear power in the United States. After the early 1970s, when orders for plants reached a peak, few utilities called for new plants, and many canceled earlier orders. Nevertheless, the number of reactors in service increased steadily as plants under construction were completed. The number of operating reactors peaked at 112 and is holding between 100 and 104. (Source: Data from U.S. Department of Energy.) liabilities incurred. The Atomic Energy Commission, now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), an agency in the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), set and enforced safety standards for the operation and maintenance of the new plants, as it does today. In the 1960s and early 1970s, utility companies moved ahead with plans for numerous nuclear power plants (Figure 15\u20131) .", "By 1975, 53 plants were operating in the United States, producing about 9% of the nation\u2019s electricity, and another 170 plants were in various stages of planning or construction. Officials estimated that by 1990 several hundred plants would be online and by 2000 as many as a thousand would be operating. A number of other industrialized countries got in step with their own programs, and some less developed nations were going nuclear by purchasing plants from industrialized nations. Curtailed. After 1975, however, the picture changed dramatically. Utilities stopped ordering nuclear plants, and numerous existing orders were canceled. In some cases, construction was terminated even after billions of dollars had already been invested. Most strikingly, the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant on Long Island, New York, after being completed and licensed at a cost of $5.5 billion, was turned over to the state in the summer of 1989, to be dismantled after generating electricity for only 32 hours. The reason was that citizens and the state deemed that there was no way to evacuate people from the area should an accident occur. Similarly, just a few weeks earlier, California citizens voted to shut down the Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant, located near Sacramento, after a 15-year history of troubled operation. In the United States, 28 units (separate reactors) have been shut down permanently for a variety of reasons. Currently . . . At the end of 2014, 100 nuclear reactors were operating in the United States. The Watts Bar Unit 1 reactor in Tennessee was the last unit to come online, beginning operations in February 1996; Unit 2\u2014partially completed, but halted in 1988\u2014is again under construction and will be the first reactor to be completed in the 21st century in the United States ( Figure 15\u20132) . The 100 existing reactors (the most in any country) generate 20% of U.S. electrical power. However, in looking ahead, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected an increase in nuclear generating capacity because of government incentives to stimulate the nuclear power industry. These increases have not yet been seen, in part because the retirement of aging reactors has somewhat offset the opening of new reactors. Figure 15\u20132 The Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station. Located in Spring City, Tennessee, Unit 1 of this power plant was the last reactor to come online in the United States (in 1996). Unit 2 construction was halted in 1988 but has since resumed, with completion expected in 2016. 15.2 How Nuclear Power Works 365 Global Picture. After a catastrophic nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in April 1986, nuclear power was rethought in many countries (see Section 15.3). Yet the demand for electricity is more robust than ever, and the other means of generating electricity have their own problems. Coal-powered electricity produces more greenhouse gases and other pollutants than does any other form of energy. Oil and natural-gas supplies are more limited, and oil is vital to transportation and home heating. Hydroelectric power is already heavily developed. Wind and solar power, though increasing rapidly, are still only a small fraction of the total electricity generated. Therefore, nuclear power plants continue to be built. Including those in the United States, the world has a total of 437 operating nuclear reactors, with an additional 69 under construction. Nuclear power now generates about 13.5% of the world\u2019s electricity, but dependence on nuclear energy varies greatly among the 30 countries operating nuclear power plants (Figure 15\u20133) . France now produces 74% of its electricity with nuclear power and has plans to go to more France Belgium Slovakia Hungary Ukraine Sweden Switzerland Czech Republic Slovenia Finland Bulgaria Armenia South Korea Romania Spain USA UK Russia Canada Germany South Africa Mexico Argentina Pakistan India Brazil Netherlands China Japan Iran 0 10 20 30 than 80%. China and India, the world\u2019s population giants, also are investing heavily in nuclear energy, China with 26 and India with 6 new units under construction. If the safety and economic issues can be resolved, can nuclear power supply future energy needs? In order to respond intelligently to this issue, we must start with a clear understanding of what nuclear power is. CONCEPT CHECK Although many countries are building nuclear reactors, the number of active nuclear power plants has been relatively stable for years. Why hasn\u2019t the number of active plants been increasing? \u2610\u2713 15.2 How Nuclear Power Works The objective of nuclear power technology is to control nuclear reactions so that energy is released gradually as heat.", "As with plants powered by fossil fuels, the heat energy produced by a nuclear plant is used to boil water and produce steam, which 40 50 60 70 80 Nuclear share (%) Figure 15\u20133 Nuclear share of electrical power generation. In 2013, those countries lacking fossil fuel reserves tended to be the most eager to use nuclear power. (Source: Data from International Atomic Energy Agency.) then drives conventional turbogenerators. Nuclear power plants are baseload plants (see Chapter 14) ; they are always operating unless they are being refueled, and they are large plants, generating up to 1,400 MW. From Mass to Energy The release of nuclear energy is completely different from the burning of fuels or any other chemical reactions discussed so far. To begin with, materials involved in chemical reactions remain unchanged at the atomic level, though the visible forms of these materials undergo great transformation as atoms are rearranged to form different compounds. For example, the carbon in gasoline is still carbon after it is burned and comes out of the tailpipe as carbon dioxide. Nuclear energy, however, involves changes at the atomic level through one of two basic processes: fission and fusion. In fission, a large atom of one element is split to produce two smaller atoms of different elements (Figure 15\u20134a) . In fusion, two small atoms combine to form a larger atom of a different element (Figure 15\u20134b ). In both fission and fusion, the mass of the product(s) is less than the mass of the starting material, and the lost mass is converted to energy in accordance with the law of mass-energy equivalence (E = mc2), first described by + ENERGY Uranium-235 Free neutrons Radioactive by-products (mostly wastes) (a) Fission Hydrogen-2 Free neutron Helium + ENERGY Neutrons Hydrogen-3 Protons (b) Fusion Figure 15\u20134 Nuclear fission and fusion. Nuclear energy is released from either (a) fission, the splitting of certain large atoms into smaller atoms, or (b) fusion, the fusing together of small atoms to form a larger atom. In both cases, some of the mass of the starting atom(s) is converted to energy. Albert Einstein. Because the small loss of mass is multiplied by the speed of light squared, the amount of energy released by this mass-to-energy conversion is tremendous: The sudden fission or fusion of just one kilogram of material, for example, releases the devastatingly explosive energy of a nuclear bomb. The Fuel for Nuclear Power Plants. All current nuclear power plants employ the fission (splitting) of uranium-235. The element uranium, which occurs naturally in various minerals in Earth\u2019s crust, exists in two primary forms, or isotopes: uranium-238 (238U) and uranium-235 (235U). Isotopes of a given element contain different numbers of neutrons but the same number of protons and electrons. Many elements exist in more than one isotopic form. The number 238 or 235 that accompanies the chemical name or symbol for uranium is called the mass number of the element. It is the sum of the number of neutrons and the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom. All atoms of any given element must contain the same number of protons, so variations in mass number represent variations in numbers of neutrons. 238U contains 92 protons and 146 neutrons; 235U contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons. Although all isotopes of a given element behave the same chemically, their other characteristics may differ profoundly. In the case of uranium, 235U atoms will readily undergo fission, but 238U atoms will not. Fission of Uranium-235. Because 235U is an unstable isotope, a small but predictable number of the 235U atoms in any sample of the element undergo radioactive decay and release neutrons, among other things. If one released neutron moving at just the right speed hits another 235U atom, the latter becomes 236U, which is highly unstable and undergoes fission immediately into lighter atoms (fission products). The fission reaction gives off several more neutrons and releases a great deal of energy (Figure 15\u20134a). Ordinarily, these neu trons are traveling too fast to cause fission, but if they are slowed down and then strike another 235U atom, they can cause fission to occur again. In this way, more neutrons and more energy are released, with the potential to repeat the process. A domino effect, known as a chain reaction, may thus occur (Figure 15\u20135a) . Nuclear Fuel. To make nuclear fuel, uranium ore is mined, purified into uranium dioxide (UO2), and enriched.", "Significant uranium deposits in the United States are found in Wyoming and New Mexico and are mined underground or in open pits. The ore is then subjected to milling, where it is crushed, treated chemically, and rendered into yellowcake, so called because of its yellowish color. The yellowcake, about 80% UO2, is then delivered to a conversion facility for purification and enrichment. Because 99.3% of all uranium found in nature is 238U (thus, only 0.7% is 235U), enrichment involves separating 235U from 238U to produce a material containing from 3% to 5% of 235U (and the rest 238U). Since these two isotopes are chemically identical, enrichment is based on their slight difference in mass. The technical difficulty of enrichment is the major hurdle that prevents less-developed countries from advancing their own nuclear capabilities. 15.2 How Nuclear Power Works 367 (c) Sustaining Chain Reaction. In a sustaining chain reaction, the extra neutrons are absorbed in control rods, so that amplification does not occur. Figure 15\u20135 Fission reactions. An Atomic Bomb. When 235U is highly enriched, the spontaneous fission of an atom can trigger a self-amplifying chain reaction. In nuclear weapons, small masses of virtually pure 235U or other fissionable material are forced together so that the two or three neutrons from a spontaneous fission cause two or three more atoms to undergo fission; each of these in turn triggers two or three more fissions, and so on. The whole mass undergoes fission in a fraction of a second, releasing all the energy in one huge explosion (Figure 15\u20135b) . The Nuclear Reactor. A nuclear reactor for a power plant is designed to sustain a continuous chain reaction (Figure 15\u20135c) . Control is achieved by enriching the uranium to 3\u20135% 235U. The modest 3\u20135% enrichment will not support the amplification of a chain reaction into a nuclear explosion. However, in the process of fission, some of the faster neutrons are absorbed by 238U atoms, converting them into 239Pu (plutonium), which then also undergoes fission when hit by another neutron. So much plutonium is produced in this way that at least one-third of the energy of a nuclear reactor comes from plutonium fission. Moderator. A chain reaction can be sustained in a nuclear reactor only if a sufficient mass of enriched uranium is arranged in a suitable geometric pattern and is surrounded by a material called a moderator. The moderator slows down the neutrons that produce fission so that they are traveling at the right speed to trigger another fission. In slowing down the neutrons, the moderator gains heat. In nuclear plants in the United States, the moderator is near-pure water, and the reactors are called light-water reactors (LWRs). The term light water denotes ordinary water (H2O), as opposed to the substance known as heavy water, or deuterium oxide (D2O); deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen. (a) Chain Reaction. A simple chain reaction. When a 235U atom fissions, it releases two or three high-energy neutrons, in addition to energy and split \u201chalves.\u201d If another 235U atom is struck by a high-energy neutron, it fissions, and the process is repeated, causing a chain reaction. (b) Self-Amplifying Chain Reaction. A self-amplifying chain reaction leading to a nuclear explosion. Because two or three high-energy neutrons are produced by each fission, each may cause the fission of two or three additional atoms. Uranium-235 Control H2O moderator rods Fuel rods Uranium-235 Neutron-absorbing material (a) (b) Figure 15\u20136 A nuclear reactor. (a) In the core of a nuclear reactor, a large mass of uranium is created by placing uranium in adjacent tubes, called fuel rods. The rate of the chain reaction is moderated by inserting or removing rods of neutron-absorbing material (control rods) between the fuel rods. (b) The fuel and control rods are surrounded by the moderator fluid, near-pure water. Fuel Rods. To achieve the geometric pattern necessary for fission, the enriched uranium dioxide is made into pellets that are loaded into long metal tubes. The loaded tubes are called fuel elements or fuel rods (Figure 15\u20136a) . Many fuel rods are placed close together to form a reactor core inside a strong reactor vessel that holds the water, which serves as both moderator and coolant (Figure 15\u20136b) . Over time, fission products that also absorb neutrons accumulate in the fuel rods and slow down the rate of fission and heat production. The highly radioactive spent-fuel rods are then removed and replaced with new ones. Control Rods.", "The chain reaction in the reactor core is controlled by rods of neutron-absorbing material, referred to Figure 15\u20137 A nuclear reactor. Technicians ready the core housing to receive uranium fuel rods in this nuclear reactor. as control rods, inserted between the fuel rods. The chain reaction is started and controlled by withdrawing and inserting the control rods as necessary. Consequently, a nuclear reactor is simply an assembly of fuel rods, moderator-coolant, and movable control rods ( Figure 15\u20137). As the control rods are removed and a chain reaction is initiated, the fuel rods and the moderator become intensely hot. The Nuclear Power Plant. In a nuclear power plant, heat from the reactor is used to boil water to provide steam for driving conventional turbogenerators. One way to boil the water is to circulate it through the reactor, as in the boiling-water reactor. Two-thirds of the power plants in the United States, however, are pressurized-water reactors ( Figure 15\u20138) employing a double loop. In these, the moderator-coolant water is heated to more than 600\u00b0F by circulating it through the reactor, but it does not boil because the system is under very high pressure (155 atmospheres). The superheated water is circulated through a heat exchanger, boiling other, unpressurized water that flows past the heat exchanger tubes. This action produces the steam used to drive the turbogenerator. Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA). The double-loop design of the pressurized-water reactor isolates hazardous materials in the reactor from the rest of the power plant. However, both reactor types have one serious drawback: If the reactor vessel should crack, the sudden loss of cooling water from around the reactor, called a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), could result in the core\u2019s overheating. The sudden loss of the moderator-coolant water would cause fission to cease, because the moderator would no longer be present. Nevertheless, the fuel core could still overheat, because 7% of the reactor\u2019s heat comes from radioactive decay in the newly formed fission products. In time, the uncontrolled decay would release enough heat energy to melt the materials in the core, a situation called a Heat Cool water Pump Condenser meltdown. Then the molten material falling into the remaining water could cause a steam explosion. To guard against all this, backup cooling systems keep the reactor immersed in water should leaks occur, and the entire assembly is housed in a thick concrete containment building ( Figure 15\u20138). In the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plants, cooling water was no longer being circulated because the pumping mechanism had no power. A meltdown occurred in three of the units, and explosions resulted as hydrogen was separated from the superheated water (a chemical reaction where the water is split into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen). Comparing Nuclear Power with Coal Power Nuclear plants are baseload plants that provide the foundation for meeting the daily and weekly electrical demand cycle. If nuclear power plants are phased out, one option is replacing such large plants with coal-burning plants. The United States has abundant coal reserves, but is burning coal the course of action we wish to pursue? Nuclear power has some decided environmental advantages over coal-fired power (Figure 15\u20139) . Comparing a 1,000 MW nuclear plant with a coal-fired plant of the same capacity, each operating for one year, we find the following characteristics: \u2022 Fuel needed. The coal plant consumes 2\u20133 million tons of coal. If this amount is obtained by strip mining, significant environmental destruction and acid leaching will result. If the coal comes from deep mines, there will be human costs in the form of accidental deaths and impaired health. The nuclear plant requires about 30 tons of enriched uranium, obtained from mining 75,000 tons of ore, with much 15.2 How Nuclear Power Works 369 Figure 15\u20138 Pressurized nuclear power plant. The double-loop design isolates the pressurized water from the steam-generating loop that drives the Electricity turbogenerator. One loop is completely contained within the containment building (left). This loop, under high pressure so that the water does not boil, absorbs the heat from the nuclear reactions and transfers it to the steam generator/heat exchanger. There, water in the second loop is heated to boiling and circulated to the turbo- Pump generator (right), where the steam turns a turbine to generate electricity. The steam is condensed by cool water, and the hot water is circulated to cooling towers. Pump Cooling towers Heat less harm to humans and the environment.", "The fission of about 1 pound (0.5 kg) of uranium fuel releases the energy equivalent to burning 50 tons of coal. Figure 15\u20139 Nuclear power versus coal-fired power. Both methods of generating electricity have environmental advantages and disadvantages. The nuclear power option assumes perfect containment of radioactivity and the availability of some method for storing and disposing of nuclear waste. Figure 15\u201310 Radioactive wastes and radio active emissions. Nuclear fission results in the production of numerous unstable isotopes, designated radioactive waste. These isotopes give off potentially damaging radiation until they regain a stable structure. Uranium-235 It is the disposal of radioactive wastes and the potential for accidents that have led to public concern over nuclear power. Can these problems be overcome, or are other energy options\u2014natural-gas-powered boilers or renewable energy\u2014 less problematic and less costly than nuclear power? Which source of power has a bigger effect on the atmosphere\u2014coal power or nuclear power? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 15.3 The Hazards and Costs of Nuclear Power Facilities Assessing the hazards of nuclear power requires an understanding of radioactive substances and their danger. Radioactive Emissions When uranium or any other element undergoes fission, the split \u201chalves\u201d are atoms of lighter elements, such as iodine, cesium, strontium, cobalt, or any of some 30 other elements. These newly formed atoms\u2014the direct products of the fission\u2014 are generally unstable isotopes of their respective elements. Unstable isotopes (called radioisotopes) become stable by spontaneously ejecting subatomic particles (alpha particles, beta particles, and neutrons), high-energy radiation (gamma rays and X-rays), or both. Radioactivity is measured in curies (after Marie Curie, the scientist who first coined the term radioactivity); one gram of pure radium-226 gives off one curie per second, which is approximately 37 billion spontaneous disintegrations into particles and radiation. The particles and radiation are collectively referred to as radioactive emissions. Materials in the reactor may also be converted to unstable isotopes and become radioactive by absorbing neutrons from the fission process (Figure 15\u201310). These indirect products of fission, along with the direct products, are the radioactive wastes of nuclear Nonradioactive IndirectDirect fission components fissionproducts of the reactor products Neutrons fissions Radioisotopes 235U Radioactive radiations Radioisotopes Stable isotopes, Radioactive nonradioactive radiations power. The direct products of fission generate high-level wastes, so called because they are highly radioactive. The indirect products of fission, such as the reactor materials, are much less radioactive and are classified as low-level wastes, a category that also includes materials from hospitals and industry. Biological Effects. A major concern of the public regarding nuclear power is that large numbers of people may be exposed to low levels of radiation, thus elevating their risk of cancer and other disorders. Is this a valid concern? Radioactive emissions can penetrate biological tissue, resulting in radiation exposure. This exposure is measured as absorbed dose, using joules per kilogram (J/kg)\u2014energy imparted (J) per mass of body tissue (kg). Doses are reported in Sieverts (Sv); the old unit rem, still in use by some agencies, is the equivalent of 0.01 Sv. As radiation penetrates tissue, it displaces electrons from molecules, leaving behind charged particles, or ions, so the emissions are called ionizing radiation. The process of ionization may involve breaking chemical bonds or changing the structure of molecules in ways that impair their normal functions. Ordinarily, the radiation is not felt and leaves no visible mark unless the dose is high. High Dose. In high doses, radiation may cause enough damage to prevent cell division. This is why, in medical applications, radiation can be focused on a cancerous tumor to destroy it. However, if the whole body is exposed to such levels of radiation (over 1 Sievert is considered a high dose), a generalized blockage of cell division occurs, preventing the normal replacement or repair of blood, skin, and other tissues. This result is called radiation sickness and may lead to death a few days or months after exposure. Very high levels of radiation may totally destroy cells, causing immediate death. Low Dose. In lower doses, radiation may damage DNA, the genetic material inside cells. Cells with damaged (mutated) DNA may then begin dividing and growing out of control, forming malignant tumors or leukemia. If the damaged DNA is in an egg or a sperm cell, the result may be birth defects (mutations) in offspring. The effects of exposure to radiation may go unseen until many years after the event (10 to 40 years is typical). Other effects include the weakening of the immune system, mental retardation, and the development of cataracts.", "Exposure. Health effects are directly related to the level of exposure. There is broad agreement that doses between 100 and 500 milliSieverts (1 milliSievert, or mSv = 1/1,000 of a Sievert) result in an increased risk of developing cancer. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from studies of patients with various illnesses who were exposed to high levels of X-rays in the 1930s, before the potential harm of such radiation was understood. People in these groups subsequently developed higher-than-normal rates of cancer and leukemia. It is noteworthy that the Japanese Health Ministry has raised the legal limit for workers at the Fukushima power plant from 100 to 250 milliSieverts, making it possible for them to spend more time working at the stricken plant, but also increasing their risk of developing cancer. Is radiation dangerous even at doses below 100 milliSieverts? Some scientists point to the ability of living cells to 15.3 The Hazards and Costs of Nuclear Power Facilities 371 repair small amounts of damage to DNA and believe that there is a threshold of radiation below which no biological effects occur. A study by the National Research Council (NRC) 2 found that there is no safe level of radiation, dismissing the idea of a threshold. Federal agencies employ the concept of no threshold and assume a direct relationship between the amount of radiation and the incidence of cancer. The NRC report predicted that 1 in 1,000 individuals would develop cancer from an exposure to 10 mSv; a tenfold increase in exposure would increase the risk to 1 in 100. Federal standards set 1.7 mSv/yr as the maximum exposure permitted for the general populace per year, except for medical X-rays. Sources of Radiation. Nuclear power is by no means the only source of radiation, as Table 15\u20131 shows. There is also normal background radiation from radioactive materials, such as uranium and radon gas that occur naturally in the Earth\u2019s crust and cosmic rays from outer space. For most people, background radiation is the major source of radiation exposure. In addition, we deliberately expose ourselves 2National Research Council, Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: Beir VII-Phase 2 (Washington, DC: National Academy of Sciences, 2005). Available at fermat.nap.edu/execsumm_pdf/11340. According to Table 15\u20131, which of these pairs of sources releases more radiation: (a) ten chest X-rays or one CT scan; (b) the radon in an average house or three mammograms? to radiation from medical and dental X-rays and, more and more frequently, from CT scans, by far the largest source of human-induced exposure. For the average person, these deliberate exposures equal one-fifth the exposure from background sources. The average person in the United States receives a dose of about 3.6 mSv per year. Thus, the argument becomes one of relative hazards. That is, does or will the radiation from nuclear power significantly raise radiation levels and elevate the risk of developing cancer? During normal operation of a nuclear power plant, the direct fission products remain within the fuel elements and the indirect products are maintained within the containment building, which houses the reactor. No routine discharges of radioactive materials (other than permissible minor stack emissions) into the environment occur. Even very close to an operating nuclear power plant, radiation levels from the plant are lower than normal background levels. A radiation detector will pick up more radiation from the ground or the concrete of a basement floor than it will when held within 150 yards of a nuclear power plant. Careful measurements have shown that public exposure to radiation from normal operations of a power plant is less than 1% of natural background radiation. The main concern about nuclear power, therefore, should not focus on a plant\u2019s normal operation. Instead, the real problems arise from the storage and disposal of radioactive wastes and the potential for accidents. Radioactive Wastes and Their Disposal To understand the problems surrounding nuclear waste disposal, you must understand radioactive decay, a process in which unstable isotopes, as they eject particles and radiation, become stable and cease to be radioactive. As long as radioactive materials are kept isolated from humans and other organisms, the decay proceeds harmlessly. Half-Life. The rate of radioactive decay is such that half of the starting amount of a given isotope will decay within a certain period. In the next equal period, half of the remainder (half of a half, which equals one-fourth of the original) decays, and so on.", "The time for half of the amount of a radioactive isotope to decay is known as the isotope\u2019s half-life. The half-life of an isotope is always the same, regardless of the starting amount. Each particular radioactive isotope has a characteristic half-life. The half-lives of various isotopes range from a fraction of a second to many thousands of years. Uranium fission results in a heterogeneous mixture of radioisotopes, the most common of which are listed in Table 15\u20132. Much of this material\u2014 in particular, the remaining 235U and the plutonium (239Pu) that has been created by the neutron bombardment of 238U\u2014 can be recovered and recycled for use as nuclear fuel in an operation called reprocessing. Although Britain and France have a large reprocessing operation, U.S. policy prohibits the practice because of concerns over plutonium and atomic weapons (plutonium can be more easily fabricated into nuclear weapons than can uranium). A move to a lower carbon footprint may require rethinking that policy. Nuclear wastes include spent fuel as well as less dangerous wastes. A single nuclear power plant produces about 20 metric tons of spent fuel annually, accumulating to a worldwide total of 71,780 metric tons of spent fuel over four decades. Low-level radioactive wastes include items that have come into contact with radioactive materials and are themselves now radioactive, such as water, concrete, tools, and used protective clothing. These items must be disposed of as nuclear waste, but the time until their radioactivity returns to safe levels may be as short as decades. The development of nuclear power went ahead without ever fully addressing the issue of what would be done with the radioactive wastes. Proponents of nuclear power generally assumed that the long-lived high-level wastes could be solidified, placed in sealed containers, and buried in deep, stable rock formations (geologic burial) as the need for such containment became necessary. However, this has not yet happened, anywhere. Thus, the problem of nuclear waste disposal is twofold: Tanks and Casks. For short-term containment, spent fuel is first stored in deep swimming pool\u2013like tanks on the sites of nuclear power plants. The water in these tanks dissipates waste heat (which is still generated to some degree) and acts as a shield against the escape of radiation. The storage pools can typically accommodate 10 to 20 years of spent fuel. However, the storage pools at U.S. nuclear plants had been filled to 50% of their capacity by 2004; by 2015 there was little remaining capacity. After a few years of decay, the spent fuel may be placed in air-cooled dry casks for interim storage until long-term storage becomes available (Figure 15\u201311) . The casks are engineered to resist floods, tornadoes, and extremes of temperature. Currently, 70 facilities (mostly nuclear plants) in the United States are licensed to employ dry storage, with the prospect of many more being licensed as pool storage capacity is exhausted. High-Level Nuclear Waste Disposal. The United States and most other countries that use nuclear power have decided that geologic burial is the safest option for disposing of the highly radioactive spent fuel, but no nation has developed plans to the point of actually carrying out the burial. Figure 15\u201311 Dry cask storage. These dry storage casks contain spent fuel assemblies generated at the James A. Fitzpatrick nuclear power plant in Scriba, New York. The assemblies had been stored for more than 30 years in the spent fuel pool on the plant site. Each dry cask has a 3\u00bd-inch steel liner surrounded by 21 inches of reinforced concrete and weighs 126 tons. 15.3 The Hazards and Costs of Nuclear Power Facilities 373 Most nuclear nations have not even been able to find a site that may be suitable for receiving wastes. Where sites have been selected, questions about their safety have surfaced. The basic problem is that no rock formation can be guaranteed to remain stable and dry for tens of thousands (let alone millions) of years. Everywhere scientists look, there is evidence of volcanic or earthquake activity or groundwater leaching within the past 10,000 years or so, which is to say that it may occur again in a similar period. If such events did occur, the still-radioactive wastes could escape into the environment and contaminate water, air, or soil, with consequent effects on humans and wildlife. Yucca Mountain. In the United States, efforts to locate a long-term containment facility have been hampered by a severe \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d (NIMBY) syndrome.", "A number of states, under pressure from citizens, have passed legislation categorically prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within their boundaries. In the meantime, the need to select and develop a long-term repository has become increasingly critical, given the buildup of spent fuel in every nuclear power plant. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 committed the federal government to begin receiving nuclear waste from commercial power plants in 1998. At the end of 1987, Congress called a halt to the debate and selected a remote site, Yucca Mountain, in southwestern Nevada (Figure 15\u201312) , to be the nation\u2019s civilian nuclear waste disposal site. Two other sites being considered were rejected. Not surprisingly, Nevadans fought this selection, passing a law in 1989 that prohibits any storage of high-level radioactive waste in the state. The federal government has the power to override state prohibitions, though, and the Nevada site has undergone intensive study and exploratory construction over the past 25 years, at a cost of $10 billion. In July 2002, the federal government officially designated the Yucca Mountain facility as the nation\u2019s nuclear waste repository. The DOE submitted a license application for operation of the Yucca Mountain repository to the NRC in June 2008, and NRC staff recommended that the agency adopt DOE\u2019s environmental impact statement for the project. Figure 15\u201312 Yucca Mountain, Nevada. This remote ridgeline in Nevada was chosen as the nation\u2019s sole high-level nuclear waste deposi-tory. The site is on federally protected land, approximately 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Critics of the site and DOE\u2019s plans for disposal question if any degree of safety can be guaranteed, given the possibilities of earthquakes, volcanic activity, or other changes in geologic time. Indeed, studies began to suggest that water would leak through the mountain into the repository, corrode the fuel assemblies stored there, and then release radioisotopes into groundwater. When it was ruled that the site would have to be guaranteed safe for a million years, things began to look bad for the NRC\u2019s plans for long-term storage at Yucca Mountain. Yucca Rejected. Eventually, the Obama administration decided to terminate the Yucca Mountain program, citing health and safety concerns as the reason. Instead, the administration appointed a Blue Ribbon Commission to recommend a new strategy for the nuclear power plant waste dilemma. The commission issued its report early in 2012, with the following key recommendations: In spite of the downsides, in 2014, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission released a report stating that Yucca Mountain did meet the criteria for long-term sustainability. Congress may decide to push the project forward. One radioactive waste repository has already been constructed and is operating to receive defense-related wastes\u2014 the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico. The site is above a huge salt deposit, and the wastes are conveyed to salt caves 2,150 feet underground. In this case, the city of Carlsbad was happy to have the depository, which is accompanied by significant economic benefits. The site was opened in 1999, and has already received more than 10,000 shipments of wastes totaling more than 105,000 cubic yards. These wastes are largely plutonium-contaminated byproducts of nuclear weapons plants and laboratories around the country. In February of 2014, the site had two accidents. In one, a truck caught on fire. In another, an air monitor alarm went off and a small amount of radioactivity was released; the cause of the accident has not been determined. Although no 3Lee H. Hamilton and Brent Scowcroft, chairmen, Draft Report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on America\u2019s Nuclear Future, July 2011 (November 1, 2011), www.brc.gov. one was exposed to more radiation than is typical of a chest X-ray, such incidents highlight the need for extremely high safety measures in a large waste facility. Radioactive wastes from weapons manufacture in the United States and Russia are discussed in Sound Science, Radioactivity and the Military; except for the Megatons to Megawatts program converting Russian weapons uranium to power-plant fuel, it is not a pretty picture. Nuclear Power Accidents Although the waste issues are a serious concern, it is the potential for accidents that generates the greatest concern over nuclear power. Three Mile Island. On March 28, 1979, the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, suffered a partial meltdown as a result of a series of human and equipment failures and a flawed design.", "The steam generator ( Figure 15\u20138) shut down automatically because of a lack of power in its feedwater pumps, and eventually, a valve on top of the generator opened in response to the gradual buildup of pressure. Unfortunately, the valve remained stuck in the open position and drained coolant water from the reactor vessel. There were no sensors to indicate that this pressure-operated relief valve was open. Operators responded poorly to the emergency, shutting down the emergency cooling system at one point and shutting down the pumps in the reactor vessel. One instrument error compounded the problem: Gauges told operators that the reactor was full of water when, actually, it needed water badly. The core was uncovered for a time and suffered a partial meltdown. Ten million curies of radioactive gas were released into the atmosphere. The drama held the whole nation\u2014particularly the 300,000 residents of metropolitan Harrisburg, who were poised for evacuation\u2014in suspense for several days. The situation was eventually brought under control, and no injuries or deaths occurred, but it would have been much worse if the meltdown had been complete. The reactor was so badly damaged and so much radioactive contamination occurred inside the containment building that the continuing cleanup proved to be as costly as building a new power plant. There are no plans to restart the reactor. GPU Nuclear, operator of the plant, has since paid out $30 million to settle claims from the accident, although the company has never admitted the existence of any radiation-caused illnesses. Chernobyl. Prior to 1986, the scenario for a worst-case nuclear power plant disaster was a matter of speculation. Then, at 1:24 AM local time on April 26, 1986, events at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine (then a part of the Soviet Union) made such speculation irrelevant ( Figure 15\u201313). Since that day, Chernobyl has served as a horrible example of nuclear energy gone awry. Here\u2019s how it happened: While conducting a test of standby diesel generators, engineers disabled the power plant\u2019s safety systems, withdrew the control rods, shut off the flow of steam to the generators, and decreased the flow of coolant water in the reactor. However, they did not allow for the radioactive heat energy generated by the fuel core; lacking coolant, the reactor began to heat up. The extra steam that was produced could not escape and had the effect of rapidly boosting the energy production of the reaction. In an attempt to quell the reactor, the engineers quickly inserted the carbon-tipped control rods. The carbon tips acted as moderators, slowing down the neutrons that were produced in the reaction. The neutrons, however, were still speedy enough to trigger more fission reactions, and the result was a split-second power surge to 100 times the maximum allowed level. Steam explosions then blew the 2,000-ton top off the reactor, the reactor melted down, and a fire was ignited in the graphite that was being used as a moderator, burning for days. At least 50 tons of dust and debris bearing 100\u2013200 million curies of radioactivity in the form of fission products were released in a plume that rained radioactive particles over thousands of square miles, 400 times the radiation fallout from the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Figure 15\u201313 Chernobyl. An aerial view of the Chernobyl reactor disaster. This disaster was a serious nuclear power accident, directly kill-ing at least 31 people and putting countless others in the surrounding countryside at risk for future cancer deaths. The Consequences. As the radioactive fallout settled, 135,000 people were evacuated and relocated. The reactor was eventually sealed in a sarcophagus of concrete and steel. A barbed-wire fence now surrounds a 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone around the reactor site. The soil remains contaminated with radioactive compounds, yet for years 2,000 Ukrainian workers were bused in daily to work at the remaining reactor in the Chernobyl complex. In December 2000, the last reactor was permanently shut down. Only two engineers were directly killed by the explosion, but 28 of the personnel brought in to contain the reactor in the aftermath of the explosion died of radiation within a few months. Over a broad area downwind of the disaster, buildings and roadways were washed down to flush away radioactive dust. Even with these precautions, many people in or near the evacuation zone were exposed to high levels of radiation, especially the short-lived radioisotope iodine-131. 15.3", "The Hazards and Costs of Nuclear Power Facilities 375 A report by a team of experts convened by United Nations agencies has provided the most reliable assessment of the impacts of the accident on the surrounding populations. 4 The main health impact has been an outbreak of thyroid cancer among children who drank milk contaminated with radioactive iodine. Thousands of cases have been diagnosed in this group, with numerous deaths. Several thousand additional deaths due to cancer are expected, but the increase will be hard to detect because of the hundreds of thousands of cancer deaths from other causes to be expected in the affected populations. However, 22 years after the accident, Russian television\u2019s Health program reported increases in thyroid cancer some 20 to 70 times above normal in many regions of the country and recommended that people between the ages of 20 and 40 from regions around the Ukraine seek ultrasound thyroid examinations. The environmental effects of the Chernobyl disaster are complex. Immediately after the disaster, many plants and animals died, including an entire forest of pines. But later, trees that were more tolerant of radiation grew and animals returned. (Many animals remain healthy even when they are exposed to radiation and experience mutations.) Ironically, the evacuation of humans from the area allowed populations of elk, deer, bear, numerous birds, and the rare Przewalski\u2019s horse to thrive (Figure 15\u201314) . Could It Happen Here? Are we in the United States in danger of such an explosion occurring at a nuclear power plant? Nuclear scientists argue that the answer is no because U.S. power plants have a number of design features that should make a repeat of Chernobyl impossible. For one thing, 4The Chernobyl Forum: 2003\u20132005, Chernobyl\u2019s Legacy: Health, Environmental and Socio-Economic Impacts, and Recommendations to the Governments of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, 2nd rev. version (Vienna, Austria: International Atomic Energy Agency, 2005). Available at www.iaea.org/ Publications/Booklets/Chernobyl/chernobyl.pdf. Figure 15\u201314 Ecosystem Resilience at Chernobyl. Although radiation initially killed off whole forests of pine, many other plants, and numerous animals, ecosystems around Chernobyl have rebounded in subsequent decades. These rare wild horses are thriving in part because the area is too dangerous for human habitation. the Chernobyl reactor used graphite as a moderator rather than the water used in LWRs. Further, LWRs are incapable of developing a power surge more than twice their normal power, well within the designed containment capacity of the reactor vessel. Finally, LWRs have more backup systems to prevent the core from overheating, and these reactors are housed in thick, concrete-walled containment buildings designed to withstand explosions such as the one that occurred in the Chernobyl reactor, which had no containment building. LWRs are not immune to accidents, however, the most serious being a core meltdown as a result of a total loss of coolant. This is what happened at three of the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant as a result of the earthquake and tsunami off the coast of Japan on March 11, 2011 (Figure 15\u201315) . Fukushima Daiichi. The opening story of this chapter describes what can go wrong with nuclear power in the face of unexpected natural disaster. There was no anticipation of such an intense earthquake accompanied by a strong tsunami and, as a result, no way to accurately protect the power plant. Power was lost from the electrical grid and backup diesel generators, leaving only eight hours of batteries to provide power for cooling the reactors. There was no way to provide cooling to spent fuel once the water drained out of their pools. There was no way to vent dangerous gases from the containment buildings. Again, could such an accident happen in the United States? The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), an NGO that has spent years evaluating nuclear power plant safety, believes that it could. 5 A task force organized by the NRC disagrees. 6 Figure 15\u201315 Fukushima Daiichi power plant. The power plant has six reactors, four of which were damaged by nuclear meltdowns and/or hydrogen explosions. This photo shows the wrecked building housing the No. 4 reactor. The real cost of the accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima must be reckoned in terms of public trust. Public confidence in nuclear energy plummeted after the first two accidents, which pointed to human error as a highly significant factor in nuclear safety\u2014and human error is something the public understands well. Fukushima demonstrated nuclear power\u2019s vulnerability to disasters, and the public also understands natural disasters.", "Although the Fukushima disaster was the largest nuclear accident ever to occur in Japan, the country had previously experienced several smaller accidents at nuclear power plants that had already eroded public confidence. After Fukushima, operations were suspended at many of Japan\u2019s nuclear reactors. Because of the danger of such disasters, the future safety of nuclear power must be a major concern. Safety and Nuclear Power As a result of Three Mile Island and other, lesser incidents in the United States, the NRC has upgraded safety standards not only in the technical design of nuclear power plants, 5Union of Concerned Scientists, \u201cCan It Happen Here?\u201d Catalyst, Summer 2011: 7\u20139. 6Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Recommendations for Enhancing Reactor Safety in the 21st Century (Near-Term Task Force, July 12, 2011). November 3, 2011, www.psr.org. 15.3 The Hazards and Costs of Nuclear Power Facilities 377 but also in maintenance procedures and in the training of operators. Thus, proponents contend, nuclear plants were designed to be safe in the beginning, and now they are safer than ever. Some proponents of nuclear power claim that we now have the technology to build inherently safe nuclear reactors, designed in such a way that any accident would result in an automatic quenching of the chain reaction and suppression of heat from nuclear decay. In reality, however, eliminating all risk of radioactive release is an impossible expectation. Passive Safety. Nuclear scientists have designed a new generation of nuclear reactors with built-in passive safety features rather than the active safety features found in current reactors. Active safety relies on operator-controlled actions, external power, electrical signals, and so forth. As accidents have shown, operators may override such safety factors, and electricity, valves, and meters can fail or give false information. Passive safety, by contrast, involves engineering devices and structures that make it virtually impossible for the reactor to go beyond acceptable levels of power, temperature, and radioactive emissions; their operation depends only on standard physical phenomena, such as gravity and resistance to high temperatures. New Generations of Reactors. Nuclear scientists distinguish four generations of nuclear reactors. Generation I reactors are the earliest, developed in the 1950s and 1960s; few are still operating. The majority of today\u2019s reactors are Generation II vintage, the large baseline power plants, of several designs. Generation III refers to newer designs with passive safety features and much simpler power plants\u2014 among them the so-called advanced boiling-water reactors (ABWRs), depicted in Figure 15\u201316 on the following page. General Electric has submitted a design for an economic simplified boiling water reactor for NRC approval. This new design has many more passive safety features than General Electric\u2019s current ABWR. In the event of a loss-of-coolant accident, two separate passive systems would allow water to drain by gravity to the reactor vessel. In East Asia, the nuclear reactor design of choice is now the ABWR, which produces 1,400 MW of electricity. The new plants are designed to last for 60 years, can be constructed within five years, and are simple enough that a single operator can control them under normal conditions. They generate electricity at a cost competitive with the costs of fossil fuel options. Generation IV plants are now being designed and will likely be built within the next 20 years. One example of a Generation IV reactor is the pebble-bed modular reactor (PBMR), which will feed spherical carbon-coated uranium fuel pebbles gradually through the reactor vessel, like a gumball machine. The PBMR will be cooled with fluidized helium, an inert gas, which will also spin the turbines. These reactors will be small, will produce about 160 MW of power, and are expected to be cheap to build and inexpensive to operate. The modules can be built in a factory and shipped to the location of the power plant. Figure 15\u201316 Advanced Boiling-Water Reactor. The core is surrounded by three concentric structures: a reactor pressure vessel, in which heat from the reactor boils water directly into steam; a concrete chamber (outlined with heavy black line) and a water pool, which together contain and quench steam vented from the reactor in an emergency; and a concrete building, which acts as a secondary containment vessel and shield. Any excessive pressure in the reactor will automatically open valves that release steam into a quenching pool, reducing the pressure. Water from the quenching pool can, if necessary, flow downward to cool the core. (Source: \u201cAdvanced Light-Water Reactors,\u201d by M. W. Golay and N. E. Todreas. Copyright 1990 by Scientific American. All rights reserved.)", "Vent Cooling pool Steam condenser Control rods Concrete One motive behind the new designs is to restore the public\u2019s confidence in nuclear energy. Previously, nuclear proponents had emphasized the very low probabilities of accidents. As we have seen, though, improbable events can happen, and when they happen to nuclear power plants, the consequences can be dreadful. Terrorism and Nuclear Power. What would have happened if one of the terrorist groups that took over four airliners on September 11, 2001, had targeted a nuclear power plant instead of the World Trade Center? This question has raised great concern in many venues, from the NRC, to Congress, to local hearings in municipalities that host nuclear plants. After some uncertainty following September 11, the general consensus is that a jetliner could not penetrate the very thick walls of the containment vessel protecting the reactor. After September 11, the NRC immediately beefed up the requirements for security around every power plant\u2014adding more guards, more physical barriers, and vehicle checks at greater distances from the plant\u2014as well as keeping the shoreline near the plants off limits. A subsequent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report concluded that the most vulnerable locations for terrorist attack containment boundary are the spent-fuel pools. 7 The NAS recommended policies that would protect the pools from a loss-of-coolant-pool-water event brought on by terrorist activity. New Safety Issues. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster has generated new concerns about the safety of both current and possible future nuclear power reactors. In the United States, the NRC has deployed a defense-in-depth philosophy that covers everything from design and operation, to precautions against failures and mistakes, containment against the release of radioisotopes in case of accidents, and emergency plans to protect citizens. Nevertheless, the Near-Term Task Force felt that the NRC\u2019s approach could be strengthened by: 7National Research Council, Safety and Security of Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage: Public Report (Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2006). Available at www.nap.edu/catalog/11263.html. 15.3 The Hazards and Costs of Nuclear Power Facilities 379 that are highly unlikely but would have catastrophic repercussions if they happened. The UCS analysis agreed with these recommendations and added a further one: \u2022 Require plant owners to move spent fuel after five years to dry cask storage; this lowers the risk of overheating in the pools in case of lost cooling water (as in Fukushima). 9 The potential for accidents and terrorist acts certainly raises questions about a more widespread promotion of nuclear power. However, as Figure 15\u20131 shows, utilities in the United States were already turning away from nuclear power before Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. The reasons were mainly economic. Economics of Nuclear Power What was behind the cancellation of so many nuclear power plants (more than 100)? First, projections of future energy demands were overly ambitious, so a slower growth in the demand for electricity postponed orders for all types of power plants. Second, the costs for nuclear power were higher than expected, especially relative to other fuel sources. Nuclear power plants and their required safety features are expensive to build. Because many of the costs of fossil fuels are externalized, the costs of using fossil fuels are artificially low. Some energy companies had expected a carbon tax to raise the cost of fossil fuels and make nuclear power more competitive, but that has not occurred, at least in the United States ( Chapter 18). Third, public protests frequently delayed the construction or start-up of a new power plant. Such delays increased costs still more because the utility was paying interest on its investment of several billion dollars, even when the plant was not producing power. As these costs were passed on, consumers became yet more disillusioned with nuclear power. Finally, safety systems may protect the public, but they do not prevent an accident from financially ruining the utility. Because radioactivity prevents straightforward cleanup and repair, an accident can convert a multibillion-dollar asset into a multibillion-dollar liability in a matter of minutes, as Three Mile Island demonstrated. Thus, nuclear power involves a financial risk that utility executives have been hesitant to take. The Vermont Yankee plant, which closed in 2014, provides an example of the complex factors affecting nuclear power plants. One of the reasons for its closure was economic\u2014it is more expensive to produce electricity with nuclear power than with fossil-fuel powered plants because there is no carbon tax on the emission of greenhouse gases. Another reason was anti-nuclear activism, resulting from fears about radioactivity. 8Task Force, ix. 9UCS, 8.", "Figure 15\u201317 Maine Yankee. The Maine Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in the process of being decommissioned, in 2003. The decommis-sioning is now complete, involving the removal of 200,000 tons of solid waste by rail, truck, and barge. Decommissioning. At some point, nuclear power plants need to be closed down, or decommissioned, a complex process. Decommissioning can be extremely costly. Decommissioning Maine Yankee (Figure 15\u201317) cost $635 million. (By comparison, the plant cost just $231 million to build in the late 1960s.) The site now houses some 64 dry casks containing the spent-fuel assemblies, which await disposal at their final resting place, wherever that happens to be. The owners of the plant are allowed to bill former customers to recover some costs\u2014a \u201cstranded cost\u201d nobody likes. Faced with these costs, some utilities are opting to repair older plants in spite of the high costs of such repairs. Other closed reactors are on sites currently occupied by active units. The old, closed-down reactors are simply defueled and allowed to sit until the day when all the reactors are closed and the entire site must be decommissioned. In one closed reactor (Humboldt Bay, California), only the nuclear components were removed, and the plant was converted to a conventional natural-gas plant. Longevity? Originally, it was thought that nuclear plants would have a lifetime of about 40 years. It now appears that lifetimes will be considerably less for many of the older plants. For example, the government of Ontario decided in 2005 to shut down two 540-MW nuclear reactors more than a decade before their scheduled retirement. The reactors had been idle since 1997 because of corrosion in the pipes carrying heavy coolant water from the reactor core. The repair bill was estimated to be $1.6 billion, approximately the cost of a new reactor. The lifetimes of nuclear power plants are often shorter than originally expected due to embrittlement and corrosion. Embrittlement occurs as neutrons from fission bombard the reactor vessel and other hardware. Gradually, this neutron bombardment causes the metals to become brittle enough that they may crack under thermal stress\u2014for example, when emergency coolant waters are introduced in the event of a loss-of-coolant accident. When the reactor vessel becomes too brittle to be considered safe, the plant must either be shut down or be repaired at great cost. Corrosion is a normal consequence of steam generation. Very hot, pressurized water flows from the core into the steam generator through thousands of 3/4-inch-diameter pipes immersed in water ( Figure 15\u20138). The water inside and outside these pipes contains corrosive chemicals that, over time, cause cracks to develop in some of the pipes. Cracked pipes are \u201crepaired\u201d by plugging them, cutting the overall plant power. In March 1995, using a new high-tech probe, officials discovered that up to half of the steam generator pipes in the Maine Yankee plant in Wiscasset, Maine, had developed cracks, some penetrating 80% of the pipes\u2019 thickness. As a result, the plant was shut down after only 24 years of operation. Sometimes the lifespan of nuclear plants can be extended by upgrading equipment and replacing parts that are wearing out. Such lifespan extensions can help reduce the cost of power. New Life? Until the Fukushima disaster, nuclear power was being viewed more favorably by policy makers, as well as by many in the environmental community, in spite of the economic issues. Most of the operating nuclear power plants in the United States were built before global climate change was recognized as a serious problem, but concerns about the greenhouse gas emissions of conventional coal-fired power plants have brought many to reconsider the advantages of nuclear power. This has come into sharp focus as the time has been drawing near for the retirement of a number of older nuclear plants, most of which will reach the end of their operating licenses within the next 10 years. As plants reach the end of their operating licenses (after 30 years or so), owners are routinely applying for license extensions. After an NRC review, these are awarded, and many plants now are licensed to operate for 60 years. Most of the new reactors planned are to be built on the sites of existing nuclear power plants. In the United States at least, nuclear power has a good track record, and the global warming imperative plus our growing need for electricity suggest that nuclear power may continue its revival. Compare the disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima. What are two similarities and two differences?", "CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 15.4 More Advanced Reactors Uranium\u2014especially 235U\u2014is not a highly abundant mineral on Earth. At the height of optimism about nuclear energy in the 1960s, when as many as 1,000 plants were envisioned by the turn of the century, it was forecast that shortages of 235U would develop. Breeder reactors, which utilize chain reactions, were seen as the solution to this problem. Breeder (Fast-Neutron) Reactors Recall from Section 15.2 that when a 235U atom fissions, two or three neutrons are ejected. Only one of these neutrons needs to hit another 235U atom to sustain a chain reaction; the others are absorbed by something else. The breeder reactor is designed so that (nonfissionable) 238U absorbs the extra neutrons, which are allowed to maintain their high speed. (Such reactors are now called fast-neutron reactors.) When this occurs, the 238U is converted to plutonium (239Pu), which can then be purified and used as a nuclear fuel, just like 235U. Thus, the fast-neutron reactor converts nonfissionable 238U into fissionable 239Pu. Because the fission of 235U generally produces two neutrons in addition to the one needed to sustain the chain reaction, the fast-neutron reactor may produce more fuel than it consumes. Furthermore, 99.3% of all uranium is 238U, so converting that to 239Pu through fast-neutron reactors effectively increases nuclear fuel reserves more than a hundredfold. In the United States and elsewhere, small fast-neutron reactors are operated for military purposes. France, Russia, and Japan are currently the only nations with commercial fast-neutron reactors, and these have not been in continuous use. Fast-neutron reactors present most of the problems and hazards of standard fission reactors, plus a few more. The consequences of a meltdown in a fast-neutron reactor would be much more serious than those of a meltdown in an ordinary fission reactor, due to the large amounts of 239Pu, with its half-life of 24,000 years. In addition, because plutonium can be purified and fabricated into nuclear weapons more easily than can 235U, the potential for the diversion of fast-neutron reactor fuel to illicit weapons production is greater. Hence, the safety and security precautions needed for fast-neutron reactors are greater. Also, fast-neutron reactors are more expensive to build and operate. However, they have the ability to extract much more energy from recycled nuclear fuel, and they produce much less high-level waste than do conventional nuclear plants. Reprocessing The United States has enough uranium stockpiled to satisfy current industry needs. Although the global supply of uranium is not a problem right now, a number of countries are reprocessing spent fuel through chemical processes, recovering plutonium and mixing it with 238U to produce mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel that is about 5% plutonium and suitable for further use in many nuclear power plants. In this way, some of the high-level waste is reused and does not add to the stockpile of waste. The Bush administration DOE established a program called the Advance Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI), moving toward establishing reprocessing in the United States as a way of reducing our growing inventory of spent fuel. However, the Obama DOE canceled this initiative because of concerns about security, and redirected AFCI into a program that simply provides funding for academic research\u2014on fuel separation and transmutation of plutonium to useful fuels, among other topics. One outcome of AFCI is the International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation, a partnership 15.5 The Future of Nuclear Power 381 of 25 countries aiming to improve the proliferation-resistance of the nuclear fuel cycle and work toward cooperative reprocessing of used fuel in fast reactors. It remains to be seen if this partnership develops into something more substantial than just consulting and research, however. Fusion Reactors The vast energy emitted by the Sun and other stars comes from fusion (Figure 15\u20134b). The Sun is composed mostly of hydrogen. Solar energy is the result of the fusion of hydrogen nuclei (protons) into larger atoms, such as helium. Scientists have duplicated the process in the hydrogen bomb, but hydrogen bombs hardly constitute a useful release of energy. The aim of fusion technology is to carry out fusion in a controlled manner in order to provide a practical source of heat for boiling water to power steam turbogenerators. The d\u2013t Reaction.", "Because hydrogen is an abundant element on Earth (there are two atoms of it in every molecule of water) and helium is an inert, nonpolluting, nonradioactive gas, hydrogen fusion is promoted as the ultimate solution to all our energy problems; that is, fusion affords pollution-free energy from a virtually inexhaustible resource: water. However, most current designs do not use regular hydrogen (1H), but rather employ the isotopes deuterium (2H) and tritium (3H) in what is called the d\u2013t reaction. Deuterium is a naturally occurring, nonradioactive isotope that can be extracted in almost any desired amount from the hydrogen in seawater. Tritium, by contrast, is an unstable, gaseous, radioactive isotope that must be produced artificially. Radioactive and difficult to contain, tritium is a hazardous substance. As a result, fusion reactors could easily become a source of radioactive tritium leaking into the environment unless effective (and costly) designs are used to prevent that. In the present state of the art, fusion power is still an energy consumer rather than an energy producer. The problem is that it takes an extremely high temperature\u2014some 100 million degrees Celsius\u2014and high pressure to get hydrogen atoms to fuse. In the hydrogen bomb, the temperature and pressure are achieved by using a fission bomb as an igniter. Getting to the high temperature is only one part of the problem; extracting the heat from the reacting region is also a daunting task, given the large amount of energy released from the fusion reactions. Two Ways of Controlling Fusion. Efforts are well under way to demonstrate that controlled fusion is possible. One method is to focus an array of powerful laser beams on a pellet containing hydrogen isotopes (d\u2013t). The laser beams would crush the core of the pellet with such energy that the hydrogen atoms inside would fuse together (ignite) and release energy. This method is employed at the U.S. National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California, a $3.5 billion facility completed in 2009 and getting close to achieving better than break-even results\u2014releasing more energy than the energy of the laser beams. This is a demonstration project, however, and even if it works, it would generate only about 3.5 kilowatts of heat, enough to power one home. The scale-up needed to accomplish laser-driven fusion power is intimidating, but the Japanese and Europeans also have plans to work on this basic method. A second process is the Tokamak design, in which ionized hydrogen is contained within a magnetic field while being heated to the necessary temperature. Some controlled fusion has been achieved in the Tokamak devices, and in late 1994, a Tokamak facility at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey, achieved 10.7 MW of fusion power in 0.27 seconds of reaction. As yet, however, the break-even point has not been reached: More energy is required to run the magnets than is obtained by fusion. An international research team from seven countries is working on a design for an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, a prototype fusion reactor of the Tokamak variety. The facility, under construction in Cadarache, France, is expected to cost more than $20 billion, and the reactor is expected to produce 10 times as much energy as it consumes. Recently, the United States rejoined the project, some 10 years after withdrawing because of concerns about costs and the science itself. No matter what design is used, developing, building, and testing a fusion power plant will require many more years and many billions of dollars. This assumes that the engineering difficulties will be overcome, which is by no means a given. Thus, fusion is, at best, a very long-term and uncertain option. What are the main difficulties in developing a way to use nuclear fusion as a source of power? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 15.5 The Future of Nuclear Power With fossil fuels contributing to global climate change and with alternatives such as solar and wind power in their early stages, the long-term outlook for energy is discouraging ( Chapter 16). Using nuclear power seems to be an obvious choice; however, there continues to be organized opposition to nuclear energy, and it is still a costly technology, highly dependent on government patronage. After the Fukushima Daiichi power-plant disaster, most countries are examining their nuclear options, as we have seen. However, a total of 69 nuclear reactors are currently under construction (see Figure 15\u201318, on the following page) and 437 are still operating, generating 13.5% of the world\u2019s electricity.", "Russia and other eastern European countries are holding onto their existing nuclear power plants and building more. A new plant is being built in Finland, and the United Kingdom is planning a new generation of reactors to replace its aging fleet. Asian countries are welcoming nuclear power, with China, South Korea, and India seemingly intent on using it to fulfill a major share of their energy needs. The International Atomic Energy Agency predicts that the Fukushima disaster will slow growth in nuclear energy but not reverse it. The agency also predicts that nuclear power will double its production of energy by 2030. Figure 15\u201318 Nuclear power reactors China under construction, 2014. Worldwide, Russian Federation 69 reactors were under active construction in 2014, with an electrical capacity of India 68 Gigawatts. South Korea (Source: Data from International Atomic Energy USA Agency.) United Arab Emirates Japan 2 2 Slovak Republic 2 Belarus 2 Ukraine 2 Pakistan 1Argentina 1 Brazil 1 Finland 1 France 0 Opposition Opposition to nuclear power is based on several premises: Opponents of nuclear power also cite the basic mismatch between nuclear power and the energy problem. The main energy problem for the United States is an eventual shortage of crude oil for transportation purposes, yet nuclear power produces electricity, which is not yet used much for transportation. Consequently, nuclear power simply competes with coal-fired power in meeting the demands for baseload electrical power. Given the high costs and additional financial risks of nuclear power plants, coal is cheaper, and the United States does have abundant coal reserves. 26 10 6 5 5 3 5 10 15 20 25 30 Number of reactors under construction Nonetheless, there are still the environmental problems of mining and burning coal, especially global climate change. Burning coal emits more CO2 per unit of energy produced than any other form of energy does (Chapter 14). If the long-term environmental costs were factored into the price of coal, that price would be considerably higher than it is now. In the final analysis, nuclear power may be a unique energy option, but it is also controversial. Interestingly, public opinion about nuclear power has been shifting. For a time, polls indicated that Americans viewed nuclear power as increasingly important, in the light of surging prices for oil and gas. Some leaders in the environmental field are viewing nuclear energy more favorably, given the serious consequences for global climate change of continued use of fossil fuels. However, shortly after Fukushima, an ABC News/ Washington Post poll indicated that 64% of Americans oppose any new nuclear construction. Opposition continues because of the perceived risks to both human health and the environment and because of the mismatch to our most critical energy problem\u2014an impending shortage of fuel for transportation. Opponents don\u2019t believe that the benefits are worth the risks. Rebirth of Nuclear Power If nuclear energy is to have a brighter future, it will be because we have found the continued use of fossil fuels to be so damaging to the atmosphere that we have placed limits on their use but have not been able to develop adequate alternative energy sources. Nuclear supporters point out that U.S. nuclear power plants prevent the annual release of 590 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, as much as that released by 113 million cars, 1 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide, and half a million metric tons of nitrogen oxides. Also, electric cars and plug-in hybrids are now available from major car manufacturers. If this catches on, nuclear-generated electricity can indeed be substituted for oil-based fuels. 15.5 The Future of Nuclear Power 383 Observers agree that if the rebirth of nuclear power is to come, a number of changes will have to be made: Nuclear Energy Policies. President George W. Bush made expanding nuclear energy a major component of his energy policy by signing into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which included a tax credit for the first 6,000 MW of new nuclear capacity for the first eight years of operation, insurance to protect companies building new reactors from the risk of regulatory delays, and federal loan guarantees for up to 80% of construction costs of new power plants. The act also authorized funds for the planning and construction of a nuclear plant that would produce hydrogen from water (the Next Generation Nuclear Plant), a key part of a coming fuel-cell technology for automobiles (see Chapter 16).", "The newer Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 addressed nuclear power only tangentially; the legislation had a provision to promote American-built nuclear power plants in overseas markets. In his 2011 State of the Union address, President Obama included nuclear energy as one of the components of a national goal of generating 80% of U.S. electricity from \u201cclean energy sources\u201d by 2035. Today the United States is the world\u2019s largest producer of nuclear power. However, because of the low cost of coal and natural gas in 2014, experts expect only four more nuclear reactors to come online by 2020. Although future trends are still uncertain, many experts believe that the use of nuclear power will increase.

You\u2019ll also hear talk of another German distinctive: Energiewende, or energy transformation, the country\u2019s policy of transition to renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and sustainable development. To meet this goal, the country is investing in new energy technologies, with a goal of 80% of the nation\u2019s power to be supplied by renewables by 2050. The city of Freiburg im Breisgau is on the forefront of this massive transformation. Established in the Middle Ages, nearly 900 years ago, the city thrived during the Renaissance. Today, Freiburg is a prototype of a new Renaissance\u2014 a shift away from fossil fuels and nuclear power to other sources of energy. Solar panels cover its houses, schools, and train station; energyefficient trams run on the streets; and nearly everyone works to conserve energy. Between 1992 and 2011, the city cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 20%. Freiburg exemplifies the changes occurring as Germany reaches for its lofty ideal. Today Germany leads the world in the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Most of the time, 25\u201330% of the country\u2019s energy is produced from renewables, more than double the percentage in the United States. During several peak days in 2014, an amazing 75% of Germany\u2019s domestic electricity came from renewable energy sources. A decentralized approach. Germany\u2019s Renewable Energy Act guarantees that electricity from renewables, including that from small suppliers, has priority access to the electrical grid. Even individuals with solar panels can sell electricity to the grid. This access is an incentive for local groups to build solar parks and wind farms. By 2011, one German village was producing 300% more energy than it needed and selling the excess to the national grid. Of course, there are other ways to support the energy transformation, especially by improving the efficiency of energy conversions. To this end, some local power plants produce heat and power at the same time, thereby increasing efficiency. Chapter 16 Learning Objectives 16.1 Strategic Issues: Explain why it is essential to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, and give some details of what has to be done. 16.2 Putting Solar Energy to Work: Describe how much solar energy reaches Earth, and explain how this energy is being used to heat water and produce electricity. 16.3 Indirect Solar Energy: Summarize what is being done to employ hydropower, wind power, and biomass energy to meet energy needs. 16.4 Renewable Energy for Transportation: Discuss how renewable energy is beginning to meet the need to replace oil for transportation, and assess the technologies involved. 16.5 Additional Renewable-Energy Options: Evaluate the potential for geothermal energy, tidal power, and wave power to meet current and future energy needs.", "16.6 Policies for a Sustainable-Energy Future: Explain how national and international energy policies encourage both renewable energy and energy conservation. Solar panels on the roofs of houses in Freiburg, the greenest city in Germany. Dramatic changes don\u2019t come without difficulties. Despite their benefits, all renewable energy sources have draw backs. There are, for example, costs involved in switching systems, as well as environmental costs for their production and use. The intermittent supply of solar and wind power limits the use of these renewables: solar panels trap energy only on sunny days, while wind turbines generate electricity only when the wind blows. There are also difficulties in coordinating systems when there is an energy glut. Fortunately, a number of engineers and inventors are seeking solutions to these prob lems. One German inventor has developed a battery that is better at storing the energy produced by sunlight through the night. Overall, Germany\u2019s investment in Energiewende has lowered its greenhouse gas emissions as well as its reliance 16.1 Strategic Issues The objective of this chapter is to give you a greater understanding of the potential for capturing energy from sunlight, wind, biomass, flowing water, and other sources. In 2013, renewable energy provided 10% of U.S. primary energy (Figure 16\u20131) and 14% of electric power generation; President Barack Obama has called for 80% of the nation\u2019s electricity to be generated from clean energy (non-fossil fuel) sources by 2035. Worldwide, renewable energy supplies 11% of total energy use and about 20% of electric power. (Table 16\u20131) . The UN has targeted a reduction in fossil fuel energy of 80% by 2050, meaning that other sources would have to supply that much. These are ambitious goals, and they raise some significant questions. Why? Why should we want to replace fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy in just a matter of decades? The most salient RENEWABLE-ENERGY USE IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2013 Biomass energy 49.0% Hydropower 28.0% Wind 17.4% Solar 3.5% Geothermal 2.2% Total = 9.14 quadrillion btu units (= 10% of U.S. energy use in 2013) Figure 16\u20131 Renewable-energy use in the United States. A mix of sources of renewable energy provided 10.0% of the nation\u2019s energy used in 2013. (Source: Data from Department of Energy, Energy Information Agency, August 2014.) on imported natural gas. The cost of renewable energy in Germany has fallen so that it is now at parity with that of fossil fuels. Although electric bills in Germany are high, an expense that has a dampening effect on industry, the transition has driven research and provided jobs. Today Germany still uses coal and natural gas in power plants, and its vehicles still run on gas and diesel. However, the country is making great strides in its decadeslong transition. In this chapter, we will look at different sources of renewable energy, their pluses and minuses, and the roles they may play in a sustainable future. Figuring out the best way to use these resources sustainably will be part of our global task. reason is global climate change (see Chapter 18 ). The use of fossil fuels has loaded the atmosphere with the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2), raising the concentration of that one gas by more than 40% to its present concentration of 400 parts per million (ppm). As a result, global temperatures and sea level have already risen, with serious environmental consequences. If we were to continue to increase our use of fossil fuels at the present rate, atmospheric CO2 would be over 600 ppm by mid-century and well over 1,000 ppm by 2100, with global temperature and sea level increases that would be catastrophic. Most international agencies have agreed that to avoid catastrophic climate change we must achieve a stable CO2 level of 450 ppm by mid-century. This is why there is a call to reduce our use of fossil fuels by 80% before 2050. There are other reasons. Oil and gas reserves will only last a matter of decades, so we are going to have to find new energy sources anyway, and in this century ( Chapter 14 ). By contrast, the supply of renewable sources is not being depleted, although there are limits to the rate at which they can be used ( Figure 16\u20132). Also, there are 1.3 billion people who currently do not have access to electricity and many more whose access is intermittent at best. Renewable energy sources are well suited to supplying power in areas not served by a central electrical grid.", "And there is the matter of other pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, mercury, and nitrogen oxides, all of which are given off as we burn fossil fuels and all of which contribute significantly to poor health and fatalities. Getting It Done Is it possible to accomplish a shift to renewables in so short a time span? Here we encounter some significant problems. Fossil fuels are great sources of concentrated energy, and we access them, distribute them, and employ them in a massive infrastructure. Our modern industrial society \u201chas been built around, by and for fossil fuels,\u201d as one commentator put it. 1 It took 70 to 100 years to build the infrastructure of our fossil fuel economy, and we have only a few decades to rebuild much of this infrastructure around clean energy sources. (Experts consider nuclear power to be a clean energy source because it does not generate CO2, although it 1Roberts, David. \u201cDirect subsidies to fossil fuels are the tip of the (melting) iceberg.\u201d Grist, October 26, 2011. 16.1 Strategic Issues 387 does produce hazardous wastes and is not renewable.) This transition will be nothing short of a revolution, one that is possibly as large as the Industrial Revolution, with its shift from work carried out by humans and animals to work done by machines. Clearly, the manufacture of wind turbines, PV panels, transmission lines, concentrated solar power plants, electric vehicles, and recharging stations would have to take place in a relatively short period of time, and this would require massive government support. Another barrier to accomplishing this transition is government subsidies for fossil fuels. Between 2003 and 2013, global subsidies to fossil fuels were $775 billion, while those for renewables were only $88 billion. In the United States, fossil fuel subsidies are $38 billion annually. 2 Even so, new government subsidies for renewables are helping to support the development of new technologies. An additional barrier is the fluctuating price of fossil fuels, which makes investment in renewables difficult. The oil production glut and price crash of 2014 made alternative energy sources less competitive. The global shift from fossil fuels to renewable or clean energy sources is starting to happen, so the question is, will it 2Ibid.

Perez. \u201cA fundamental look at energy reserves for the planet,\u201d Solar Update: IEASHC Newsletter (2009) 50:2\u20133.) happen fast enough? There are some encouraging developments that suggest it is possible, but much more has to be done: We can now turn our attention to the different forms of renewable energy. As we saw in Figure 16\u20132, which compares the amount of energy that is potentially available from fossil fuels with that from various sources of renewable energy, the supply of solar energy far exceeds that of all other energy sources. Thus, full sunlight can deliver about 700 watts per square meter to Earth\u2019s surface when the Sun is directly overhead. At that rate, the Sun can deliver 700 MW of power (the output of a large power plant) to an area of 390 square miles (1,000 km2). The total amount of solar energy reaching Earth is vast\u2014almost beyond belief. Just 40 minutes of sunlight striking the land surface of the United States yields the equivalent energy of a year\u2019s expenditure of fossil fuel. The Sun delivers 10,000 times the energy used by humans. Using some of this ample supply of solar energy will not change the basic energy balance of the biosphere. Solar energy absorbed by water or land surfaces is converted to heat and eventually lost to outer space. Even the fraction that is absorbed by vegetation and used in photosynthesis is ultimately given off again in the form of heat as various con sumers break down food (Chapter 3) .", "Similarly, if humans were to capture and obtain useful work from solar energy, it would still ultimately be converted to heat and lost in accordance with the Second Law of Thermodynamics (see Chapter 3). The overall energy balance would not change. Although solar energy is an abundant source, it is also diffuse (widely scattered), varying with the season, latitude, and atmospheric conditions. The main challenge in using solar energy is one of taking a diffuse and intermittent source and concentrating it into a form, such as fuel or electricity, that can be used to provide heat and run vehicles, appliances, and other machinery. This requires us to solve problems involving the collection, conversion, and storage of solar energy. Also, in the final analysis, overcoming such hurdles must be cost effective. In the sections that follow, you will see how we can overcome or, even better, sidestep these three problems to meet our energy needs in a cost-effective manner. 15 Does the discovery of new oil reserves make it unnecessary for us to move to an energy budget without fossil fuels? Why or why not? \u2610\u2713 16.2 Putting Solar Energy to Work Before turning our attention to the practical ways that solar energy is captured and used, let us consider some general concepts of solar energy. Solar energy originates with thermonuclear fusion in the Sun. (Importantly, all the chemical and radioactive byproducts of the reactions remain behind on the Sun.) The Energy emitted from Sun (103 cal/cm2/min) 10 5 solar energy reaching Earth is radiant energy, entering at 0 the top of the atmosphere at 1,366 watts per square meter, Wavelength (micrometers) the solar constant. This energy ranges from ultraviolet light Figure 16\u20133 The solar-energy spectrum. Equal amounts of energy to visible light and infrared light (heat energy) ( Figure 16\u20133). are found in the visiblelight and the infrared regions of the spectrum. In About half of this energy actually makes it to Earth\u2019s surface, the Sun, the nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium emits a spectrum 30% is reflected, and 20% is absorbed by the atmosphere. of radiant energy that reaches Earth. Sunlight Tubes through which water circulates Heat Black surface Insulation Glass or plastic window Figure 16\u20134 The principle of a flat-plate solar collector. A s sunlight is absorbed by a black surface, it is converted to heat. A clear glass or plastic window over the surface allows the sunlight to enter the collector, which traps the heat. Air or water is heated as it passes over and through tubes embedded in the black surface. Solar Heating of Water Solar hot-water heating is already popular in warm, sunny climates. A solar collector for heating water consists of a thin, broad box with a glass or clear plastic top and a black bottom in which water tubes are embedded ( Figure 16\u20134). Such collectors are called flat-plate collectors. Faced toward the Sun, the black bottom gets hot as it absorbs sunlight\u2014 similar to how black pavement heats up in sunlight\u2014and the clear cover prevents the heat from escaping, as in a Hot-water tank 16.2 Putting Solar Energy to Work 389 greenhouse. Water circulating through the tubes is heated and conveyed to a tank, where it is stored. In an active system, the heated water is moved by means of a pump. In a passive solar water-heating system, the system is mounted so that the collector is lower than the tank. Thus, heated water from the collector rises by natural convection into the tank, while cooler water from the tank descends into the collector (Figure 16\u20135). The tank usually has a source of auxiliary heat (electric or gas) in order to get the temperature to a desired level or to provide heat when solar energy is insufficient. In temperate climates, where water in the system might freeze, the system may be adapted to include a heat-exchange coil within the hot-water tank. Then antifreeze fluid is circulated between the collector and the tank. Worldwide, there are approximately 60 million solar hot-water systems, but this is still only a small fraction of the total number of hot-water heaters. The reason is the initial cost; in the United States, solar heaters cost 5 to 10 times as much as gas or electric heaters. However, over time, the solar system costs less to operate than an electric or a gas system.", "In China, more than 18 million households get their hot water from solar thermal systems; China leads the world in this application of solar energy. Solar Space Heating Sunlight may also be used to heat the air in buildings. This is called solar space heating, a type of passive solar heating. Inexpensive, even homemade, flat-plate collectors similar to those used to heat water can be used for space heating. All that is needed is to have air circulate through the collector box. Again, efficiency is gained if the collectors are mounted, to allow natural convection to circulate the heated air into the space to be heated (see Figure 16\u20136, on the next page). Figure 16\u20135 Solar water heaters. In nonfreezing climates, simple waterconvection systems may suffice. In freezing climates, an antifreeze fluid is circulated. Solar heat is augmented by an auxiliary heat source in the hotwater tank. Element Hot water out Cold water in Figure 16\u20136 Passive hot-air solar heating. Many homeowners could save on fuel bills by adding homemade solar collectors like the one shown here. Air heated in the collector moves into the room by passive convection. Building = Collector. The greatest efficiency in solar space heating is gained by designing a building to act as its own collector. The basic principle is to have windows facing the Sun. In the winter, because of the Sun\u2019s angle of incidence, sunlight can come in and heat the interior of the building (Figure 16\u20137a) . At night, insulated curtains or shades can be pulled down to trap the heat inside. A well-insulated building, with appropriately made doors and windows, acts as its own best heat-storage unit. Other systems for storing heat, such as tanks of water or masses of rocks, have not proved to be cost effective. In the summer, excessive heat can be avoided by using an awning or overhang to shield the window from the high summer Sun (Figure 16\u20137b) . Appropriate landscaping can contribute to the heating and cooling efficiency of both solar and nonsolar space-heating designs, thereby conserving energy. In particular, deciduous trees or vines on the sunny side of a building can block much of the excessive summer heat while letting the desired winter sunlight pass through. An evergreen hedge on the shady side can provide protection from the wind. Figure 16\u20137 Solar building siting. In contrast to utilizing expensive and complex active solar systems, solar heating can be achieved by suitable architecture and orientation of the home at little or no additional cost. (a) Large, Sunfacing windows permit sunlight to enter during the winter months. Insulating curtains or shades are drawn to hold in the heat when the Sun is not shining. (b) Suitable overhangs, awnings, and deciduous plantings prevent excessive heating in the summer. Energy Stars. In almost any climate, a well-designed passive solar-energy building can reduce energy bills substantially, with an added construction cost of only 5\u201310%. Because about 25% of our primary energy is used for space and water heating, proper solar design, broadly adopted, would create enormous savings on oil, natural gas, and electrical power. In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) extended its Energy Star Program to buildings and began awarding the Energy Star label to public and corporate edifices. Buildings awarded the label use at least 40% less energy than others in their class and must meet a number of other criteria to qualify. By 2014, more than 25,500 buildings had earned the label\u2014a major contribution to energy conservation. Backup Systems. A common criticism of solar heating is that a backup heating system is still required for periods of inclement weather. Good insulation is a major part of the answer to this criticism. People with well-insulated solar homes find that they have minimal need for backup heating. When backup is needed, conventional forms of heating are used to augment the solar heating system. In any case, the criticism concerning the need for backup heating misses the point: The objective of solar heating is to reduce our dependency on conventional fuels. Even if solar heating and improved insulation reduced the demand for conventional fuels by a mere 20%, that would still represent sustainable savings of 20% of the traditional fuel and its economic and environmental costs. Solar Production of Electricity Solar energy can also be used to produce electrical power, providing an alternative to coal and nuclear power. There are two distinct approaches: photovoltaic systems and concentrated solar power. Photovoltaic Cells.", "A solar cell\u2014more properly called a photovoltaic, or PV, cell\u2014looks like a simple wafer of material with one wire attached to the top and one to the bottom (Figure 16\u20138). As sunlight shines on the wafer, it puts out an amount of electrical current roughly equivalent to that emitted by a flashlight battery. Thus, PV cells collect light and convert it to electrical power in one step. The cells, measuring about four inches square, produce about one watt of power. Some June 21 (a) (b) 40 such cells can be linked to form a module that generates enough energy to light a lightbulb. Varying amounts of power can be produced by wiring modules together in panels. How They Work. The simple appearance of PV cells belies a highly sophisticated level of science and technology. Each cell consists of two very thin layers of semiconductor material separated by a junction layer. The lower layer has atoms with single electrons in their outer orbital that are easily lost. The upper layer has atoms lacking electrons in their outer orbital; these atoms readily gain electrons. The kinetic energy of light photons striking the two-layer \u201csandwich\u201d dislodges electrons from the lower layer, creating a current that can flow through a motor or some other electrical device and back to the upper side. Thus, with no moving parts, solar cells convert light energy directly to electrical power, with an efficiency of 15\u201320%. Because they have no moving parts, solar cells do not wear out. However, deterioration due to exposure to the weather limits their life span to about 30 years. The major material used in PV cells is silicon, one of the most abundant elements on Earth, so there is little danger that the production of PV cells will ever suffer because of limited resources. Uses. PV cells are already in common use in pocket calculators, watches, and numerous toys. Panels of PV cells provide power for rural homes, irrigation pumps, traffic signals, radio transmitters, lighthouses, offshore oil-drilling platforms, Earth-orbiting satellites, and other installations that are distant from power lines. It is not hard to imagine a Figure 16\u20138 Photovoltaic cell. A photovoltaic cell powers this portable solar panel charging a radio on a camping trip in Sequoia National Park, California. 16.2 Putting Solar Energy to Work 391 future in which every home and building has its own source of pollution-free, sustainable electrical power from an array of PV panels on the roof. Current installations in many countries and 43 states in the United States employ net metering, where the rooftop electrical output is subtracted from the customer\u2019s use of power from the power grid. Inverters. The most complicated (and yet necessary) component of a PV system is the inverter. The inverter (Figure 16\u20139) acts as an interface between the solar PV modules and the electric grid or batteries. It must change the incoming direct current (DC) from the PV modules to alternating current (AC) compatible with the electricity coming from the grid and the devices that will be powered by the PV system. It must also act as a control, able to detect and respond to fluctuations in voltage or current on either DC or AC, and it must be robust enough to withstand the high temperatures of an attic (where rooftop PV systems are involved). An inverter for a rooftop system costs several thousand dollars, but in most cases, these inverters are eligible for local and national subsidies. Fortunately, the cost of inverters has come down over time. Cost. The cost of PV power (cents per kilowatt-hour) is the cost of the installed PV systems divided by the total amount of power they may be expected to produce over their lifetime (currently as low as 12 cents per kilowatt-hour). This cost is quite comparable to that of other power alternatives (8\u201316 cents per kilowatt-hour for residential electricity in the United States). The first PV cells had a cost factor several hundred times that of electricity from conventional power stations transmitted through the power grid, so those cells were used mainly in areas far from the grid. PV power had its first significant application in the 1950s, in the solar panels of space satellites. This application started the development cycle rolling. As more efficient cells and less expensive production techniques evolved, costs came down dramatically. In turn, applications, sales, and potential markets expanded, creating the incentive for further development. Today the PV-power industry is the fastest-growing energy technology industry in the world.", "In 2013, the industry shipped solar panels with a total capacity of 37 gigawatts (GW). Existing solar PV panels now have the capacity to turn sunlight into more than 137 GW of electricity ( Figure 16\u201310) . Figure 16\u20139 PV system inverter. Inverter (on right) and controllers for a PV system at Channel Islands National Park, California. The inverter is a device that connects the PV panels of a rooftop system to the electric grid or devices powered by PV electricity. It converts the direct current coming from PV panels to alternating current and also acts as a control for the system. Utilities. The utility companies are moving toward large-scale PV installations (Figure 16-11) . At the end of 2014, there were 40 plants worldwide with capacities greater than 20 MW, with 31 more planned or under construction. The largest one in the world is the 550 MW Topaz Solar Farm in California, which provides electricity for 160,000 homes. This record won\u2019t last long, as there are much larger ones under construction. In some cases, PV is getting the nod over concentrated solar power facilities (discussed later), because it can be added in smaller increments, allowing limited transmission lines to handle the voltages. However, the most promising future for PV power is in the installation of PV panels on rooftops, where a huge amount of unused space is readily available. For residential use, utilities in many states have established programs that provide incentives to customers to install 2- to 4-kilowatt (kW) PV systems on their roofs. A 2 kW system provides about half of the annual energy needs of a residence; if the homeowner is generating more than needed, the utility buys the excess electricity at the retail rate. Even though the rooftop 160,000 140,000 120,000 100,000 80,000 60,000 40,000 20,000 0 EVOLUTION OF GLOBAL CUMULATIVE INSTALLED CAPACITY 2000\u20132013 (MW) 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Year Figure 16\u201310 The market for PV panels. Global sales of PV panels have increased dramatically, approaching 137,000 MW by 2013. (Source: EPIA.) Figure 16\u201311 PV power plant. The Copper Mountain Solar Facility in Nevada consists of 775,000 solar panels and has an installed capacity of 48 MW. systems represent a loss in power purchases, the utilities benefit because they avoid the need to build expensive new power plants. A federal investment tax credit of 30% of the system cost was enacted in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, providing incentives to homeowners to go solar. Sunny California passed the 1,000 MW (1 GW) mark in late 2011. In 2013 alone, the worldwide capacity of solar rooftop power increased by 40 GW. The world leader in installed rooftop PV is Germany, with more than 37 GW installed capacity. New PV Technologies. To compete with electricity from conventional sources, the cost of solar cells needs to be low. At least four new technologies may drive the cost even lower: (1) thin-film PV cells, in which cheap amorphous silicon or cadmium telluride is used instead of expensive silicon crystals, and the film can be applied as a coating on roofing tiles or glass; (2) a 3-D silicon solar cell that captures up to 25% of the incoming light energy; (3) glass coated with light-absorbing dyes that transmit energy to solar cells on the edge of the glass, while allowing much of the light to pass through to conventional solar panels; (4) flexible plastic polymer cells. All of these techniques are either in production or close to it. 16.2 Putting Solar Energy to Work 393 Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). If you have ever focused sunlight through a magnifying glass to burn a hole in a leaf, you have used CSP. Several technologies convert solar energy into electricity by using reflectors (or concentrators) to focus sunlight onto a receiver that transfers the heat to a conventional turbogenerator. These devices work well only in regions with abundant sunlight and plenty of space; currently they are producing power in the U.S. Southwest and in Spain. A major drawback to this technology is the need for a lot of water to cool the steam that is generated. Nevertheless, CSP is growing rapidly, now at 1.8 GW generating capacity globally, with a number of projects under construction. The two methods currently in the lead for CSP are the solar (or parabolic) trough and the power tower. Solar Trough.", "One method that is proving to be cost effective is the solar-trough collector system, so named because the collectors are long, trough-shaped reflectors tilted toward the Sun ( Figure 16\u201312). The curvature of the trough is such that all of the sunlight hitting the collector is reflected onto a pipe running down the center of the system. Oil or some other heat-absorbing fluid circulating through the pipe is thus heated to very high temperatures. The heated fluid is passed through a heat exchanger to boil water and produce steam for driving a turbogenerator. This technology has the capability of storing some thermal energy for release at night. Solar-trough is the most developed of the CSP technologies, and most new CSP plants are solar-trough. The largest solar-trough plant in the world is Solana, a 250 MW facility located in the Arizona desert. Power Tower. A power tower is an array of Sun-tracking mirrors that focuses the sunlight falling on several acres of land onto a receiver mounted on a tower in the center of the area ( Figure 16\u201313). The receiver transfers the heat collected to a molten-salt liquid, which then flows either to a heat exchanger to drive a conventional turbogenerator or to a tank at the bottom of the tower to store the heat for later use. At present, the Sierra SunTower is the only power tower operating in the United States, generating 5 MW of electricity. Figure 16\u201312 Solar thermal power in southern California. A solartrough power plant. Sunlight striking the parabolicshaped mirrors is reflected onto the central pipe, where it heats a fluid that is used in turn to boil water and drive turbogenerators. Figure 16\u201313 Sierra SunTower. Suntracking mirrors are used to focus a broad area of sunlight onto a moltensalt receiver mounted on the two towers. The hot salt is stored or pumped through a steam generator, which drives a conventional turbogenerator. The Future of Solar Energy Solar electricity is growing at a phenomenal rate\u2014the solar power business is currently a $60 billion industry and is expected to reach $137 billion by 2020. The industry is hard-pressed to keep up with current demand. Solar energy does have certain disadvantages, however. First, the available technologies are still more expensive than conventional energy sources, though solar sources are getting close to parity with conventional ones. Second, solar energy works only during the day, so it requires a backup energy source, a storage battery, or thermal storage for nighttime power. Also, the climate in many parts of the world is not sunny enough to use solar energy in the winter. These drawbacks should be weighed against the hidden costs that are not included in the cost of power from traditional sources: air pollution, strip mining, greenhouse gas emissions, and nuclear waste disposal, among others. Matching Demand. The Sun provides power only during the day, but 70% of electrical demand occurs during daytime hours, when industries, offices, and stores are in operation. Thus, considerable savings still can be achieved by using solar panels just for daytime needs and continuing to rely on conventional sources at night. In particular, the demand for air-conditioning, which, after refrigeration, is the second largest power consumer, is well matched to energy from PV cells. In the long run, the nighttime load might be carried by forms of indirect solar energy, such as wind power and hydropower (discussed later in the chapter). SUSTAINABILITY About 66% of U.S. electrical power (51% worldwide) is currently generated by coal-burning and nuclear power plants (Chapter 14, Table 14\u20131). Therefore, the development of solar and wind power can be seen as gradually reducing the need for coal and nuclear power. Unlike new nuclear or coal power plants, which take years to plan and build, solar or wind facilities can become operational within months of the decision to build them. The utility does not have to guess what power demands will be in 10 or 15 years. With solar or wind power, a utility can add capacity as it is needed, make relatively small investments at any given time, and have those investments start paying back almost immediately. Thus, this approach involves much less financial risk for both the utility and its consumers. One further advantage of solar and wind facilities is their relative invulnerability to terrorist attack compared with oil and gas pipelines and large power plants, especially nuclear facilities. Furthermore, solar and wind facilities produce less hazardous waste than traditional power plants.", "Solar power has also proved suitable for meeting the needs of electrifying villages and towns in the developing world. Where centralized power is unavailable, rural electrification projects based on PV cells are already beginning to spread throughout the land (see Sustainability, Transfer of Energy Technology to the Developing World). The cost of the alternative\u2014putting roughly 1.3 billion people who are still without electricity on the power grid (and thus requiring central power plants, high-voltage transmission lines, poles, wires, and transformers)\u2014is unimaginable. Drawbacks of Solar Power. The chief drawback of solar power is that sunlight is not continuously available, so solar power plants must be supplemented with other sources of energy. While passive solar power is low tech, active solar power, especially PV panels, requires manufacturing processes that are polluting and has a high cost of installation. The widespread use of solar panels will eventually require systems for their recycling, in part because they contain mercury, lead, and cadmium. Another concern about solar towers is the incineration of birds that fly in the path of the concentrated radiation. The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generation System, a plant in the California desert southwest of Las Vegas that opened in 2014, was estimated to have killed close to 1,000 birds in just one year. The plant is working on deterrents to prevent birds from coming into the dangerous air space. Despite these drawbacks, the abundance of solar energy makes it likely that solar power will be a large part of our energy future. CONCEPT CHECK Compare the scale of operation for PV solar panels and power towers. What causes the difference? Which technology is appropriate for small-scale installations? \u2610\u2713 16.3 Indirect Solar Energy Water, fire, and wind have provided energy for humans throughout history. Dams, firewood, windmills, and sails represent indirect solar energy because energy from the Sun is the driving force behind each. (Recall from Chapter 10 that solar energy powers the evaporation in the hydrologic cycle and also drives the convection currents that produce the wind.) What is the potential for expanding these options from the past into major sources of sustainable energy for the future? Hydropower Early in technological history, it was discovered that the force of falling water could be used to turn paddle wheels, which in turn would drive machinery to grind grain, saw logs into lumber, and run simple machines. The modern culmination of this use of waterpower, or hydropower, is huge hydroelectric dams, where water under high pressure flows through channels, driving turbogenerators (Figure 16\u201314) . The amount of power generated is proportional to both the height of the water behind the dam\u2014that is what provides the pressure\u2014and the volume of water that flows through. (Chapter 10 describes the role played by dams in trapping and controlling rivers for flood control, irrigation, and hydropower.) About 6.6% of the electrical power generated in the United States currently comes from hydroelectric dams, most of it from about 300 large dams concentrated in the Northwest and Southeast. Worldwide, hydroelectric dams have a generating capacity of 1,000 GW, with more very large projects in the construction or planning stage. Hydropower generates about 18% of electrical power throughout the world and is by far the most abundant form of renewable energy in use. 16.3 Indirect Solar Energy 395 Trade-offs. Dams\u2014especially large ones\u2014are often controversial; they provide important benefits but also involve some serious consequences. The most obvious advantages are these: There are also some serious disadvantages, however: Figure 16\u201314 Hoover Dam. About 6.6% of the electrical power used in the United States comes from large hydroelectric dams such as this one on the Colorado River in Nevada. More Dams? In the United States, there are 87,000 dams that are six feet high or more, and an estimated 2 million smaller structures. As a result, only 2% of the nation\u2019s rivers remain free flowing, and many of these are now protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, a law that effectively gives certain scenic rivers the status of national parks. The United States and most developed countries have already brought their hydropower to capacity, and the trend is in the direction of removing many of the dams that impede the natural flow of rivers. Nonetheless, hydropower is expanding rapidly and may double in capacity in the next decade, largely because of the construction of new dams in the developing world.", "Proposals for new dams outside of the United States are embroiled in controversy over whether the projected benefits justify the ecological and sociological trade-offs. For example, the Nam Theun 2 Dam, a 1,075 MW project on a tributary of the Mekong River in Laos, is expected to help the economic development of that country. The project received final approval in 2005 from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank for guarantees and loans, and construction was completed in 2010. The project has displaced 6,200 people and has inundated 175 square miles (450 km2) of the Nakai Plateau. In addition, most of the power will be sold to Thailand (only 75 MW are to be channeled to Laos at first). International Rivers (IR) is monitoring the implementation of the project. Charges and countercharges have flown back and forth between the World Bank and IR concerning the impacts of the dam, especially on downstream communities. It is too soon to issue a verdict on the dam\u2019s overall effects, but the controversy highlights the concerns about dams and the sometimes negative impact of the World Bank. Another huge dam, completed in 2006, is the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China (see Chapter 10 ). The largest dam ever built (1.4 miles long), Three Gorges has displaced some 1.2 million people in order to generate 22,000 MW of electricity and control the flood-prone river. Offsetting the human and economic costs is the fact that it would take more than a dozen large coal-fired power plants to produce the same amount of electricity. A special World Commission on Dams, convened to examine the impacts and controversies surrounding large dams, reported its findings in 2000. The commission began with the assertion that dams are only a means to an end, the end being \u201cthe sustainable improvement of human welfare.\u201d The report found dams to be a mixed blessing, concluding that large dams should be built only if no other options exist. 3 Following up the World Commission work, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) established the Dams and Development Forum, which meets annually to participate in debate and decision making over dam development in various countries. Many more dams will be built, largely in the developing countries, especially China, Brazil, Turkey, and India. Despite their significant environmental costs, these dams will certainly play a role in the energy future of those countries. Wind Power Once a standard farm fixture, windmills fell into disuse as transmission lines brought abundant lower-cost power from central generating plants. Not until the energy crisis and rising energy costs of the 1970s did wind begin to be seriously considered again as a potential source of sustainable energy. Growing rapidly, wind power now supplies around 2.6% of the world\u2019s electricity, but there are no technical, economic, or resource limitations that would prevent wind power from supplying at least 12% of the world\u2019s electricity by 2020. In Denmark, which is hard pressed by a lack of fossil fuel energy, wind now supplies nearly 40% of the electricity. China is the world leader in wind energy, with almost 100 GW of capacity. A new feature of the landscape is the \u201cwind farm,\u201d a collection of wind turbines that can generate power while the land beneath them is being used for traditional agricultural purposes. Some of these installations are huge: the Horse Hollow Wind Farm near Abilene, Texas, consists of 421 turbines with a capacity of 735 MW (Figure 16\u201315) . The largest wind farms in the world are farm conglomerates in China. The Gansu Wind Farm in northwest China is expected to be producing 20 GW of electricity by 2020. In the past five years, global wind power capacity has increased at a rate of 20% per year, to 318 GW at the start of 2014. Wind is the second-largest component of renewable electricity in the world (behind hydropower), because it has become economically competitive with conventional energy 3Dams and Development: A New Framework for Decision-Making (The Report of the World Commission on Dams, Earthscan Publications, 2000). Figure 16\u201315 Horse Hollow Wind Farm. Located near Abilene, Texas, this wind farm consists of 421 turbines with a capacity of 735 MW. 16.3 Indirect Solar Energy 397 sources, and countries all over the world are encouraging the installation of wind turbines by setting targets and providing subsidies ( Figure 16\u201316). Design.", "Many different designs of wind machines have been proposed and tested, but the one that has proved most practical is the age-old concept of wind-driven propeller blades. The propeller shaft is geared directly to a generator. (A wind-driven generator is more properly called a wind turbine than a windmill.) As the reliability and efficiency of wind turbines have improved, the cost of wind-generated electricity has decreased. Wind farms are now producing pollution-free, sustainable power for around five cents per kilowatt-hour, a rate that is competitive with the rates of traditional sources. Moreover, the amount of wind that can be tapped is immense. The American Wind Energy Association calculates that wind farms located throughout the Midwest could meet the electrical needs of the entire country, while the land beneath the turbines could still be used for farming. Hundreds of new turbines are sprouting from Midwestern farms, and the farmers are paid royalties ($3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year) for leasing their land to wind developers. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is promoting a scenario where wind energy will provide 20% of U.S. electricity needs by 2030\u2014an ambitious, but by no means impossible, target. Drawbacks. Despite its advantages, wind power does have some drawbacks. First, wind is an intermittent source of 350 300 energy\u2014its intensity varies greatly\u2014so backup or storage must be considered. Turbines must be located where the wind is strongest and most even, but such areas may be far from users of electricity. Second is aesthetic considerations: One or two wind turbines can be charming, but a landscape covered with them can be visually unappealing to some. More importantly, wind turbines are noisy. The large turbines make enough noise that they are not best situated near residences or in relatively pristine environments. Third, wind turbines can kill birds and bats. These deaths are increasing with the rapid expansion of wind power. Taller turbines, more common in extremely large wind farms, kill more birds. The tens of thousands of birds and bats killed by wind turbines pales in comparison to the hundreds of millions of birds killed annually by cats, automotive traffic, and glass windows. However, in areas where turbines are concentrated, deaths from turbines can be high, especially for large soaring birds, such as hawks and condors. Locating wind farms on migratory routes or near critical habitats for endangered species can cause problems. Offshore Wind Farms. Plans for offshore wind farms are putting a new spin on wind energy. Denmark already has many offshore turbines, as do the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. Belgium, France, and Germany are also in the development stage. The primary lure of offshore 318 Global cumulative capacity (GW) 283 250 239 200 194 159 150 120 100 94 74 59 48 50 39 31 24 17 14 10 8 6 0 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Year Figure 16\u201316 Global development of wind energy. A s the cost of wind energy has dropped to the level of being very competitive with conventional energy sources, wind turbine capacity has risen dramatically. (Source: Data from Global Wind Energy Council.) wind is the dependability and strength of the maritime winds. Siting is perhaps easier, too, as the turbines are usually far enough offshore to have much less of a visual impact than onshore sites, and land does not have to be purchased. Whether offshore or onshore, the global drive to install wind power is generating electricity that is emission free; in fact, the 43,000 MW of new wind turbines installed in a single year displace 125 million tons of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to the emissions from 65 coal-fired power plants. Biomass Energy Firewood is the oldest source of energy; humans have been burning it for heat since the beginning of history. But there is nothing like a new name to put life into an old concept. Thus, \u201cburning firewood\u201d has become \u201cutilizing biomass energy.\u201d Biomass energy means energy derived from present-day photosynthesis. Like wind power and hydropower, biomass is an indirect form of solar energy. As Figure 16\u20131 indicates, biomass energy leads hydropower in renewable-energy production in the United States. (Most uses of biomass energy are for heat.)", "In addition to burning wood in a stove, major means of producing biomass energy include burning municipal wastepaper and other organic waste, generating methane from the anaerobic digestion of manure and sewage sludges, running power plants on wastes from timber operations, and producing alcohol from fermenting grains and other starchy materials. Burning Firewood. Wherever forests are ample relative to the human population, firewood\u2014or fuelwood, as it is called\u2014can be a sustainable energy resource. Fuelwood is the primary source of energy for heating and cooking for some 2.6 billion people, amounting to about 9% of total energy use from all sources. In the United States, woodstoves have become popular in recent years. About 2.5 million homes rely entirely on wood for heating, and another 9 million use wood for some heating. The most recent development in woodstoves is the pellet stove, a device that burns compressed wood pellets made from wood wastes ( Figure 16\u201317). The pellets are loaded into a hopper (controlled by computer chips) that feeds fuel when it is needed. The stove requires very little attention and burns efficiently, relying on one fan to draw air into it and another fan to distribute heated air to the room. Although the design of wood stoves has improved, they still emit greenhouse gases. If poorly ventilated, they can produce a great deal of smoke. EPA regulations of 2014 on particulates have limited the sale of wood stoves to more efficient designs, but this leaves many poor and rural people in the position of heating their homes with non-compliant stoves. Fuelwood Crisis? In developing counties, most people who burn fuelwood to meet their daily needs obtain the wood by foraging in local forests. Gathering wood, converting wood into charcoal, and selling the wood products in urban areas are important income-producing activities for many in developing countries. All these activities have the potential to degrade local forests and woodlands. Yet as development progresses, people have more disposable income and shift up the \u201cenergy ladder\u201d from wood to charcoal to fossil fuels. The use of fuelwood peaked in the 1990s and is now declining. This shift may protect forest resources in the short term, but it is not sustainable because the replacement fuels are usually fossil fuels. Highly efficient stoves made for rural areas are a part of the solution to the problem of the overuse of wood. They also help reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution, topics that are discussed elsewhere ( Chapter 17, Chapter 19 ). Another part of the solution is to burn waste materials rather than wood. Burning Wastes. Facilities that generate electrical power from the burning of municipal wastes (waste-to-energy conversion) are discussed in another chapter (Chapter 21). Many sawmills and woodworking companies are now burning wood wastes, and a number of sugar refineries are burning cane wastes to supply all or most of their power. In Virginia, three 63 MW coal-fired power plants are being converted to biomass power, burning primarily wood waste from timber operations; the first was converted in 2013. Power from these sources may not meet more than a small percentage of a country\u2019s total electrical needs, but it represents a productive and relatively inexpensive way to dispose of biological wastes as well as to prevent more fossil fuel combustion. Figure 16\u201317 Pellet stove. Pellet stoves use pelletized wood waste to achieve an efficient burn that requires much less care than burns from conventional woodstoves. 16.4 Renewable Energy for Transportation 399 Producing Methane. The anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge yields biogas, which is two-thirds methane, plus a nutrient-rich treated sludge that is a good organic fertil izer (examined further in Chapter 20). Animal manure can be digested likewise. When the disposal of manure, the production of energy, and the creation of fertilizer can be combined in an efficient cycle, great economic benefit can be achieved. In China and India, millions of small farmers maintain a simple digester in the form of an underground brick masonry fermentation chamber with a fixed dome on top for storing gas ( Figure 16\u201318). Agricultural wastes, such as pig manure and cattle dung, are put into the chamber and diluted with water. The anaerobic digestion of the wastes produces biogas, which is used for cooking, heating, and lighting. The residue slurry makes an excellent fertilizer. The concept has been expanded throughout the developing world to provide an alternative to fuelwood. Currently, some 34 million households employ these devices. Both India and China provide subsidies for these family-scale biogas plants.", "Large, regional biogas plants are used to generate electricity, especially in Asia. In Camellia, Australia, a suburb of Sydney, 80,000 tons of food waste are collected every year from supermarkets, restaurants, and households; this waste is digested to produce enough electricity to power 3,600 homes. In the United States, methane released from landfills and commercial composting operations is being captured and burned to produce electricity. A proposed food composting operation in Tulare, California, will use discarded food as a source of biogas for transportation, discussed next. What is one advantage and one disadvantage of wind power? Of biomass energy? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 Figure 16\u201318 Biogas power. Animal wastes are introduced to this unit in rural India and mixed with water. The wastes then decompose under anaerobic conditions, producing biogas. The dome over the concrete structure holds the gas. Biogas digesters can range from small ones used for rural families to large ones used to collect energy from wastes at huge livestock or regional composting operations. 16.4 Renewable Energy for Transportation Declining oil reserves and the enormous impact of transportation\u2019s demands for oil on our economy and on the global climate suggest that the most critical need for a sustainable energy future is a new way to fuel our vehicles. Renewable energy is already answering a small but growing part of this need in the form of biofuels. In the long term, the answer may come in the form of hydrogen and fuel cells. Biofuels Complex organic matter from plants and animal wastes can be processed to make fuels for vehicles. Currently, two fuels are seeing rapid expansion globally: ethyl alcohol (ethanol) and biodiesel. High oil prices, strong farmer support, government subsidies, and environmental concerns have led to a major expansion of global ethanol and biodiesel production since 2000. Although these two biofuels currently provide only 2.5% of global transportation fuels, this is just the beginning, as new technologies and government support promise to make biofuels a major competitor for fossil fuels. The current sources of biofuels are agricultural and food commodities. Ethanol. Ethanol is produced by the fermentation of starches or sugars. The usual starting material is corn, sugarcane, sugar beets, or other grains. Fermentation is the process used in the production of alcoholic beverages. The new part of the concept is that, instead of drinking the brew, we distill it and burn it in our cars. However, production costs make ethanol more expensive than gasoline unless oil sells for more than $55 a barrel. To stimulate the industry in the United States, federal tax credits have been extended to biofuels, which make them more competitive. Gasohol, which is 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, is now marketed in most parts of the country. Farm Products. In 2013, 14.3 billion gallons (340 million barrels) of ethanol for fuel, the equivalent of 194 million barrels of oil, were produced in the United States (ethanol contains about two-thirds the energy of regular gasoline, gallon for gallon). One-third of the nation\u2019s corn crop is dedicated to this use; however, an ethanol factory also produces corn oil and livestock feed. A variety of tax credits help ethanol compete with gasoline, and a renewable fuel standard (RFS) requires a minimum volume of renewable fuel in gasoline. The U.S. policy mandated a level of 9 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008 (all corn-based ethanol), to rise to a limit of 36 billion gallons in 2022, but the increase beyond 2015 must be met by using sources other than corn. Brazil has also invested heavily in fuel ethanol; there the feedstock is sugarcane, which is much less costly to grow than corn. Brazil used to lead the world in ethanol production, but has been surpassed by the United States, using corn as the basis of ethanol production. Can we expect ethanol production from corn to make serious inroads on the oil import and greenhouse gas emissions problems? Currently, biofuels represent about 8% of U.S. fuel consumption. This could rise to 20% if the country\u2019s entire corn crop were devoted to ethanol production\u2014 an impossible assumption, given the importance of corn for animal feed and export. With some 84 million acres devoted to corn harvest in the United States, there is little suitable farmland for significant expansion. Another issue is the energy efficiency of corn-based ethanol. Fossil fuel energy is required to produce the corn (fertilizer, pesticides, farm machinery), to transport it, and to operate the ethanol plant.", "Using ethanol instead of gasoline reduces greenhouse gas emissions, mile for mile, by only 12\u201318%. If new land is cleared of its forests or grasslands to plant corn for biofuels, the carbon emissions from the land-use change should be added to the debit from fossil-fuel greenhouse gas emissions. When this is done, corn-based ethanol is a net loser in its impact on climate change. 4 Thus the use of corn-based ethanol is more damaging to the environment than people initially thought it would be. In addition, the use of corn as fuel rather than as food for livestock and humans has contributed to rising food prices. Because 60 countries have RFS targets, diversion of food to fuel is a significant concern ( Chapter 12). Second-Generation Biofuel. A more likely long-run technology for producing ethanol is the use of cellulosic feedstocks such as agricultural crop residues, grasses (such as switchgrass), logging residues, fast-growing trees, and fuelwoods from forests. Ethanol produced this way is called second-generation biofuel (current starch-based processes 4Sims R., et al., \u201cTransport,\u201d in Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014). Figure 16\u201319 Miscanthus x giganteus. This hardy perennial grass grows to a height of four meters and is a prime candidate for a secondgeneration cellulosic biofuel. produce first-generation biofuel). One crop with exceptional potential is Miscanthus ( Figure 16\u201319), a giant perennial grass that can be grown in poor soils and that outproduces corn and other grasses. With the use of enzymes to break down the cellulose to sugars, demonstration facilities have shown that cellulosic feedstock technology can be a cheaper and more energy-efficient process than corn-based production. Although the technology is still in the initial stages, three large cellulosic biofuel plants opened in 2014 and others are planned. The RFS requires that all of the increase in the target biofuel after 2015 be derived from second-generation biofuel sources. The advancement of the industry depends on tax credits, which are necessary to research but can change with government budgeting priorities. Biodiesel. Imagine a truck exhaust that smells like french fries. That is not only an improvement over diesel exhaust, but also an indication that the truck is burning biodiesel, made largely from soybean oil. Sales of biodiesel have reached 1.8 billion gallons, which is competitive with petroleum diesel fuel because of a hefty $1-per-gallon production tax credit. Still, this is only 1% of the diesel fuel used for transportation in the United States. Standard biodiesel is a 20% mix of soybean oil in normal diesel fuel, but practically any natural oil or fat can be mixed with an alcohol to make the fuel; one excellent source is recycled vegetable oil from frying. However, there are competing uses for the vegetable oils. There are some offbeat technologies surfacing to produce biodiesel, such as a factory in Missouri that took in truckloads of turkey wastes from a turkey-processing plant and turned them into biofuels. Problems with odor made the plant owners switch to using other starting materials, such as used fryer oil, but the process can be done with almost any organic waste imaginable. In another technology, genetic engineering is being applied to algae to induce them to produce oils and complex alcohols. Significant money is being invested in these enterprises, and commercial-scale production is only a few years away. 16.4 Renewable Energy for Transportation 401 Hydrogen: Highway to the Future? Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in powering cars with hydrogen. Conventional cars with internal combustion engines can be adapted to run on hydrogen gas in the same manner as they can be adapted to run on natural gas. (Hydrogen is not really a fuel, but an energy carrier, like electricity; it must be generated using some other energy source.) Neither carbon dioxide nor hydrocarbon pollutants are produced during the burning of hydrogen. Indeed, the only major by-product of H2 combustion is water vapor: 2H2 + O2 \u2192 2H2O + energy (Some nitrogen oxides will be produced because the burning still uses air, which is nearly four-fifths nitrogen.) A Good Idea, but . . . If hydrogen gas is so great, why aren\u2019t we using it? The answer is that there is virtually no hydrogen gas on Earth. Any hydrogen gas in the atmosphere has long since been ignited by lightning and burned to form water.", "And although many bacteria in the soil produce hydrogen in fermentation reactions, other bacteria are quick to use the hydrogen because it is an excellent source of energy. Thus, there are abundant amounts of the element hydrogen, but it is all combined with oxygen in the form of water (H2O) or other compounds. Although hydrogen can be extracted from water via electrolysis (the reverse of the preceding reaction), electrolysis requires an input of energy. Hydrogen can also be derived chemically from hydrocarbon fuels such as methane, petroleum oil, and methyl alcohol, but these processes are also energy losers; that is, more energy is put into the process than is contained in the hydrogen. Moreover, because these compounds contain carbon, it would be better to use them directly than to obtain hydrogen from them and use it. Therefore, the use of hydrogen as a truly clean energy carrier must await an energy source that is itself suitably cheap, abundant, and nonpolluting\u2014like solar energy. Plants Do It. The \u201choly grail\u201d of research and eventual commercialization is to accomplish what plant cells do: produce fuel from water using solar energy. To date, two ways have been proposed for mimicking this process. The first is to employ a catalyst to do what the photosynthetic pathway does. Two elements are required: a collector that converts photons into electrical energy (electrons), and an electrolyzer that uses the electron energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Recently, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) described a process that employs a water-oxidizing electrolyzer catalyst made from cobalt and a heavy metal alloy, all common chemicals. 5 The process uses light energy captured by a silicon solar cell and generates hydrogen and 5Steven Y. Reece et al., \u201cWireless Solar Water Splitting Using Silicon-Based Semiconductors and Earth-Abundant Catalysts,\u201d Science 334: 645\u2013648. November 4, 2011. oxygen in either a wired or a wireless cell. It operates in neutral water and ambient temperature and pressure, and achieves a solar-to-fuels efficiency of 4.7% (wired) and 2.5% (wireless). This may be the key step needed to get to that holy grail. Electrolysis. The second approach is simply to pass an electrical current through water and cause the water molecules to dissociate. Hydrogen bubbles come off at the negative electrode (the cathode), while oxygen bubbles come off at the positive electrode (the anode). (You can demonstrate this process for yourself with a battery, some wire, and a dish of water. A small amount of salt placed in the water will facilitate the conduction of electricity and the release of hydrogen.) The hydrogen gas is collected, compressed, and stored in cylinders, which can then be transported or incorporated into a vehicle\u2019s chassis. One important drawback to this technology is that it is difficult to store enough hydrogen in a vehicle to allow it to operate over long distances. Also, compressing the hydrogen requires energy, thus reducing the energy efficiency involved. As an alternative, the hydrogen can be combined with metal hydrides, which can absorb the gas and release it when needed, but finding a hydride that is not too heavy has been a challenge. Another pathway that holds promise is to convert the hydrogen into liquid formic acid (HCOOH) by combining it with carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is then released by use of a catalyst. Solar Energy to Hydrogen. A rather elaborate plan has been suggested for taking solar energy\u2013produced hydrogen for vehicles to its logical conclusion. The plan would start by building arrays of solar-trough or photovoltaic generating facilities in the deserts of the southwestern United States, where land is cheap and sunlight plentiful. The electrical power produced by these methods would then be used to produce hydrogen gas by electrolysis. The most efficient way to move the hydrogen is through underground pipelines; there are already hundreds of miles of such pipelines through which hydrogen is transported for use in chemical industries. Although this would be an expensive part of a hydrogen infrastructure, the technology for it is already well known. Model U. The Ford Motor Company unveiled in the United States a \u201cconcept car\u201d it has dubbed the Model U. The Model U sports a 2.3-liter internal combustion engine that runs on hydrogen and is equipped with a hybrid electric drive. The car uses four 10,000 psi tanks to store hydrogen, enough to range 300 miles before a fill-up. And there\u2019s the problem: Before such cars can become feasible, there must be a hydrogen-fueling infrastructure.", "Once that infrastructure is in place, cars like the Model U would likely be replaced by a completely new way of moving a vehicle: by means of fuel cells. Fuel Cells. An alternative to burning hydrogen in conventional internal combustion engines uses hydrogen in fuel cells to produce electricity and power the vehicle with an electric motor. Fuel cells are devices in which hydrogen or some other fuel is chemically combined with oxygen in a manner that produces an electrical potential rather than initiating burning (Figure 16\u201320a) . Emissions from fuel cells consist solely of water and heat. Because fuel cells create much less waste heat than conventional engines do, energy is transferred more efficiently from the hydrogen to the vehicle\u2014at a rate of 45\u201360% versus the 20% for current combustion-engine vehicles. To power a vehicle, hundreds of fuel cells are combined into a fuel-cell stack. The vehicle must also include a hydrogen storage device, a device to force oxygen into the fuel cells, and a cooling Work +\u2212 Cathode O2 H2O (Water) Anode system (fuel cells generate heat). Fuel cells are now powering 150 buses in many cities in the United States and around the world. The fuel-cell stack develops more than 200 kW of power from hydrogen in tanks mounted on the roof of the bus. \u201cConcept\u201d vehicles operating on fuel cells have been developed by all the major car manufacturers. Honda, however, is the first manufacturer to commit to a dedicated fuel-cell vehicle assembly line. The Honda FCX Clarity (Figure 16\u201320b) is rolling off the assembly lines, but Figure 16\u201320 Hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. (a) Hydrogen gas flows into the cell and meets a catalytic electrode, where electrons are stripped from the hydrogen, leaving protons (hydrogen ions) behind. The protons diffuse through a proton exchange membrane, while electrons flow from the anode to the motor. A s the electrons then flow from the motor to the cathode of the fuel cell, they combine with the protons and oxygen to produce water. Thus, the chemical reaction pulls electrons through the circuit, producing electricity that runs the motor. Hydrogen is continuously supplied from an external tank, oxygen is drawn from the air, and the only byproduct is water. (b) Powered by a compact fuel cell stack, the Honda FCX Clarity has a range of 270 miles on a charge of hydrogen (4 kg), delivering the equivalent of 68 miles per gallon. The vehicle also has a battery for extra assist, similar to the battery in today\u2019s hybrid gaselectric vehicles. H2 (a) (b) 16.5 Additional Renewable-Energy Options 403 relatively few have been sold. Of course, we would need many fueling stations for hydrogen to be used widely. In the United States, California is leading the way by building hydrogen fueling stations. If a hydrogen infrastructure is put in place and vehicles powered by fuel cells are available, we will have entered a hydrogen economy\u2014one in which hydrogen becomes a major energy carrier. With solar- and wind-powered electricity also in place, we would no longer be tied to nonrenewable, polluting energy sources. Still, the obstacles in the way of the hydrogen economy are formidable, and many believe it will be decades before it even has a chance of happening. Global climate concerns convey an urgency to resolving this issue, and many believe that the best pathway is greater use of hybrid vehicles and other technologies that are already available. What is one advantage and one disadvantage of fuel cell technology? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 16.5 Additional Renewable-Energy Options In addition to water, wind, biomass, and hydrogen energy, several other renewable-energy options have been developed or are in the concept stage. Geothermal Energy In various locations in the world, such as the northwestern corner of Wyoming (Yellowstone National Park), there are springs that yield hot, almost boiling, water. Natural steam vents and other thermal features are also found in such areas. They occur where the hot, molten rock of Earth\u2019s interior is close enough to the surface to heat groundwater, particularly in volcanic regions. Geothermal energy uses such naturally heated water or steam to heat buildings or drive turbogenerators. In 2014, geothermal energy had more than 12,000 MW of electrical power capacity (equivalent to the output of 11 large nuclear or coal-fired power stations), in countries as diverse as Nicaragua, the Philippines, Kenya, Iceland, and New Zealand. The largest single facility is in the United States at The Geysers, 70 miles (110 km) north of San Francisco ( Figure 16\u201321).", "With more than 3,400 MW from geothermal energy, the United States is the world leader in the use of this energy source; new projects in the development stage will increase this to more than 4,500 MW. As impressive as this application of geothermal energy is, nearly double the amount is being used to directly heat homes and buildings, largely in Japan and China. In Australia, Europe, and Japan, enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are being used to generate electricity. EGS involves drilling holes several miles deep into granite that holds temperatures of 400 degrees or more. Pressurized water is then injected into one hole, where it absorbs heat from the rock. The heated water turns into steam and flows up another shaft to a power plant, where it generates electricity. This underground heat is widespread in the United States, unlike the present limited geothermal sources. An MIT team proposed a $1 billion investment to exploit the EGS potential in the United States, predicting that by 2050 some 100 GW of electrical power could be developed in this way. Heat Pumps. A less spectacular, but far more abundant, energy source than the large geothermal power plants exists anywhere pipes can be drilled into the Earth. Because the ground temperature below six feet or so remains constant, the Earth can be used as part of a heat exchange system that extracts heat in the winter and uses the ground as a heat sink in the summer. Thus, the system can be used for heating and cooling and does away with the need for separate furnace and Figure 16\u201321 Geothermal energy. The Geysers, located in northern California, is the largest complex of geothermal power plants in the world. Air handler, with indoor coil and fan connected to air ducts Heat exchange pipes Figure 16\u201322 Geothermal heat pump system. The pipes buried underground facilitate heat exchange between the house and the Earth. This system can either cool or heat a house and can be installed almost anywhere, though at a higher initial cost than a conventional heating, ventilation, and airconditioning system. air-conditioning systems. As Figure 16\u201322 shows, a geothermal heat pump (GHP) system involves loops of buried pipes filled with an antifreeze solution or a refrigerant, circulated by a pump connected to the air handler (a box containing a blower and a filter). The blower moves house air through the heat pump and distributes it throughout the house via ductwork. In most cases, the up-front costs of the heat pump system are repaid in six to eight years, and then the savings really begin. Four elementary schools in Lincoln, Nebraska, installed GHP systems for their heating and cooling. Their energy cost savings were 57% compared with the cost of conventional heating and cooling systems installed in two similar schools. Taxpayers will save an estimated $3.8 million over the next 20 years with the GHP systems. According to the EPA, GHP systems are by far the most cost-effective, energy-saving systems available. Although they are significantly more expensive to install than conventional heating and air-conditioning systems, they are trouble-free and save money over the long run. New heat pump installations in the United States are growing rapidly, with more than 1 million in operation in 2014. Energy from the Oceans Over the years, experts have considered the oceans as a possible source of energy. Energy might come from the movement of water in tides and waves or from thermal gradients in the water column. Unfortunately, these energy sources are little used because they are hard to harness or are only available in limited places. Tidal and Wave Power. A phenomenal amount of energy is inherent in the twice-daily rise and fall of the ocean tides, brought about by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun. Many imaginative schemes have been proposed for capturing this pollution-free source of energy. The most straightforward idea is the tidal barrage, in which a dam is built across the mouth of a bay and turbines are mounted in the structure. The incoming tide flowing through the turbines generates power. As the tide shifts, the blades are reversed so that the outflowing water continues to generate power. In about 30 locations in the world, the shoreline topography generates tides high enough\u201420 feet (6 m) or more\u2014 for this kind of use. Large tidal power plants already exist in two of those places: France and the Bay of Fundy in Canada.", "The Annapolis Tidal Generating Station in the Bay of Fundy, has operated since 1984, at 20 MW capacity. Thus, this application of tidal power has potential only in certain localities, and even there, it would not be without adverse environmental impacts. The barrage would trap sediments, impede the migration of fish and other organisms, prevent navigation, alter the circulation and mixing of saltwater and freshwater in estuaries, and perhaps have other, unforeseen ecological effects. Other techniques are being explored that harness the currents that flow with the tides. For example, in 2006, Verdant Power began a project to harness the tidal energy of the East River in New York City. The project has passed its first demonstration phase, connecting six turbines to local electric customers. Verdant plans to install 30 turbines that will connect to the grid and generate 1 MW of power. San Francisco is eyeing a similar scheme to tap the energy of the 400 billion gallons of water that flow under the Golden Gate Bridge with every tide. Standing on the shore of any ocean, an observer would have to be impressed with the energy arriving with each wave, generated by offshore winds. It might be possible to harness some of this energy, but the technological challenge is daunting. There are a number of proposed mechanisms for capturing wave energy, but this technology is only in the early research-and-development stage. Ocean Thermal-Energy Conversion. Over much of the world\u2019s oceans, there is a thermal gradient of about 20\u00b0C (36\u00b0F) between the surface water heated by the Sun and the colder deep water. Ocean thermal-energy conversion (OTEC) is an experimental technology that uses this temperature difference to produce power. Unfortunately, various studies indicate that OTEC power plants have little economic promise\u2014unless, perhaps, they can be coupled with other, cost-effective operations. For example, in Hawaii, a shore-based OTEC plant uses the cold, nutrient-rich water pumped from the ocean bottom to cool buildings and supply nutrients for vegetables in an aquaculture operation, in addition to cooling the condensers in the power cycle. Interest in duplicating such operations is minimal at present. CONCEPT CHECK Is it likely that tidal power and ocean thermal energy will ever provide us with a large amount of energy? Why or why not? \u2610\u2713 16.6 Policies for a Sustainable-Energy Future We have examined our planet\u2019s energy resources, requirements, and management options ( Chapters 14 \u2013 16). The global issues are clear: Fossil fuels, especially oil and natural gas, will not last long at the current (and increasing) rate of consumption. Even more important, every use of fossil fuels produces unhealthy pollutants and increases the atmospheric burden of carbon dioxide, accelerating the already-serious climate changes brought on by rising levels of greenhouse gases. A sustainable-energy future does not include significant fossil-fuel energy. Global targets, therefore, are (1) stable atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, and (2) a sustainable-energy development-and-consumption pattern that is based on renewable energy. Our main focus in this chapter has been on sustainable energy development, but there is another energy strategy that focuses on energy consumption\u2014namely, energy conservation and efficiency. Energy saved is energy that does not have to be developed or paid for. Earlier we laid out two policies that have energy conservation as a goal (Chapter 14 ). These were increasing the mileage standards for motor vehicles and increasing the energy efficiency of lighting, appliances, and buildings. The Energy Star program, described earlier in this chapter, encourages municipalities and businesses to achieve energy savings. We turn now to public policies regarding energy, including those that encourage the use of renewable energy and energy conservation. Energy policies are enacted at the national and international levels. U.S. Energy Policy The United States is heavily dependent on imported oil for transportation, although U.S. production of shale oil has in creased dramatically in recent years (Chapter 14). Importing oil hurts the economy and causes an energy security problem: Not only are we subject to the whims of oil producers, but we are also vulnerable to terrorist attacks on various facets of our energy infrastructure. In recent years, the U.S. government has responded to these concerns by enacting various laws and regulations. Previously we examined policies pertaining to fossil fuels and nuclear power in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Chapters 14 and 15). These laws have become the major expression of federal energy policy, though many other laws promoting renewable energy and conservation have been enacted.", "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 gave a huge boost ($43 billion) to renewable energy and energy conservation, with the intent of doubling the energy from renewable sources by 2012. Although this aggressive goal was not achieved, the use of renewable energy has increased dramatically. 16.6 Policies for a Sustainable-Energy Future 405 Supply-Side Provisions. A number of supply-side provi sions have been enacted into law (Chapter 14). These include: The federal government has not established a renewable portfolio standard (RPS). Such a standard would require utilities to provide an increasing percentage of power from non-hydroelectric renewable sources\u2014wind, solar, and biomass. However, 38 states and the District of Columbia have implemented RPS requirements. Demand-Side Provisions. A variety of provisions that focus on energy conservation and efficiency have also been enacted into federal law. These include: International Energy Policy Most energy policy is enacted by individual countries. At least 64 countries have a national target for renewable energy. As we have seen, Germany has a national energy policy with goals for several decades that are designed to move that country to a high use of renewables. International cooperation can also increase the use of renewable energy. At this point, there is no overarching international energy treaty, but treaties about limiting greenhouse gas emissions have been negotiated with varying degrees of success. Although most parts of the world do not have comprehensive multi-national energy policies, the world is working on international agreements about climate change, discussed later ( Chapter 18). The most organized group of countries on the issue of energy policy is the European Union. A 2007 treaty included language that empowered the EU to form a coherent plan for promoting energy efficiency, developing renewable energy, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and operating an energy market. Many European countries are concerned about their reliance on Russian natural gas. In 2014, EU member states and several other countries (together called the Energy Union) unveiled an energy plan to become more energy independent and diversified. Latin American and Caribbean countries have attempted to produce a joint energy policy similar to that of the EU. At present they have not reached an agreement, largely because their approaches to energy policies differ; the countries are divided on whether to promote fossil fuels or renewables. The Global Economy Whether the world moves to more sustainable energy use depends in part on the economics of energy. For the world to switch to more sustainable practices, the cost of wasting energy and using fossil fuels needs to be greater than the cost of conservation and renewable energy sources. When oil prices fell dramatically in 2014, consumers used more gasoline than before; as a result, the financial viability of renewables was in danger of collapse. Whether we move in a sustainable direction depends in part on how the rest of the world helps developing countries expand their energy sources. In some cases, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have supported projects such as large coal-burning power plants and hydropower structures that are very damaging to the environment. In the long term, such projects are not sustainable. In contrast, Germany provides us with an example of a country that is making a coordinated transition to a sustainable-energy future. Although all alternative energy sources have costs and benefits, a diversified energy plan, increased efficiency, and efforts to lessen the environmental costs of energy production are all necessary parts of a more sustainable world.

Environmental Hazards and Human Health You may have followed the story in the news.", "In early 2014, an outbreak of the Ebola virus spread through several West African nations. Ebola is a type of hemorrhagic fever\u2014a viral disease that causes bleeding from the mouth, nose, ears, and internal organs. It is a very serious, often fatal disease. Certain animals, particularly fruit bats, can carry the virus without becoming sick. occasionally the virus is transmitted to humans, who then transmit it to one another through bodily fluids such as sweat and blood. A Challenging Crisis. It is difficult to control the spread of the disease because the virus mutates rapidly, there is no vaccine, and there are no specific drugs for its cure. The death rate is so high that it is extremely difficult to study. Although Ebola does not kill the millions that malaria does, an outbreak is so serious that it requires the coordinated effort of the entire global health community. When the 2014 outbreak occurred, the World Health organization and national governments tried to stop it as soon as possible. This was difficult to do in the countries of Sierra leone, liberia, and Guinea, where the outbreak was the greatest because of the limited health care infrastructure: the countries had few medical clinics and health care workers and little medicine to treat the victims of the disease. An International Response. over the next several months, more than 22,000 people contracted the disease, and more than 8,800 died. doctors and nurses from around the world came to volunteer. Some died. Travel was restricted in the areas with the greatest infection rates, although some individuals who were infected, particularly volunteer health workers, were moved to Europe or the united States for treatment. The outbreak of Ebola also threatened the food security of millions of people living in the region. People bought food and hoarded it, driving up food prices. labor shortages on farms caused harvests to decline, and people in quarantined areas lost income. despite these disruptions, measures to Medical workers from the nonprofit Doctors Without Borders suit up to treat Ebola in Liberia. Chapter 17 Learning Objectives 17.1 Human Health, Hazards, and the Environment: Describe three types of hazards\u2014 biological, physical, and chemical\u2014and compare them with cultural hazards. 17.2 Pathways of Risk: Explain how risk factors including exposure to diseases, toxic chemicals, and physical hazards, as well as poverty and climate change, lead to human mortality. 17.3 Risk Assessment: Describe the process of risk assessment and management as the EPA and the World Health Organization apply it to human health. Identify the key elements that determine risk perception. control the infection were put in place. Because of the coordinated work of dedicated health workers, the outbreak was contained to only a few countries and did not spread across the globe. The Ebola outbreak demonstrates the close connection between human health and the environment. In this chapter we will examine the nature of environmental hazards and the 17.1 Human Health, Hazards, and the Environment The study of the connections between hazards in the environment and human disease and death is often called environmental health. Note that it is human health that is the issue here, not the health of the natural environment. Environmental health is a subset of public health, an endeavor to prevent disease, promote health, and protect the public from hazards. Measures of Public Health The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as \u201ca state of complete physical, social, and mental well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d 2 Health has many dimensions\u2014physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to measure all these dimensions of health for a society. Instead, our study of environmental health will focus on disease, and we will consider health to be simply the absence of disease. Epidemiology is the study of the presence, distribution, and prevention of disease in populations. Morbidity and Mortality. Two measures are used in studies of disease in societies: morbidity and mortality. Morbidity is the incidence of disease in a population; it is commonly used to trace the presence of a particular type of illness, such as Ebola or influenza. Mortality is the incidence of death in a population. Records are usually kept of the cause of death, making it possible to analyze the relative roles played by infectious diseases and noninfectious diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. Life Expectancy. One universal indicator of health is human life expectancy. In 1955, the average global life expectancy was 48 years.", "Today it is 70 years and continuing to rise; it is expected to reach 73 years by 2025. This progress is the result of social, medical, and economic advances in the past 60 years that have increased the well-being of larger and larger segments of the human population. Recall the epidemiologic transition: the trend of decreasing death rates that is seen in countries as they modernize ( Chapter 8) . As this transition occurred in the developed countries, it involved a 2 World Health Organization Glossary, available at www.who.int/health.systems performance/docs/glossary.htm. consequences of exposure to them. Then we will consider some of the pathways whereby humans encounter the hazards, interventions that can alleviate the risks to health, and how public policy and risk assessment can improve our management of environmental hazards. We begin with some basics about how public health officials measure health. shift from high mortality (due to infectious diseases) toward the present low mortality rates (due primarily to diseases of aging, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases). Figure 17.1 shows male and female life expectancies at birth for a range of countries. Some of the differential in life expectancies is due to the fact that the various countries have undergone the epidemiologic transition to different degrees, with very different consequences. Recently many countries have experienced an increase in life expectancy; part of this positive trend can be attributed to government actions taken to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals, including those regarding clean water and access to sanitation. Despite the progress indicated by the general rise in life expectancy, one-sixth (almost 9 million) of the world\u2019s annual deaths are those of children under the age of five in low-income countries. A high proportion (36%) of the mortality in low-income countries is caused by common infectious diseases (as opposed to 6% in the high-income countries). On the other hand, economic growth resulting from intensive agriculture and industrialization is usually accompanied by environmental hazards (see Chapters 12 , 19, and 22). Thus both poverty and affluence involve hazards that affect public health, a topic we will consider later in the chapter. Hazards and Risk In this chapter, we are concerned with the environment in the context of human life\u2014the physical, chemical, and biological setting where people live. Thus, the home, neighborhood, and workplace, as well as the air, water, food, and even the climate constitute elements of the human environment. Within the human environment, there are hazards that can make us sick, shorten our lives, or contribute to human misfortune in other ways. In the study of environmental health, a hazard is anything that can cause (1) injury, disease, or death to humans; (2) damage to personal or public property; or (3) deterioration or destruction of environmental components. The existence of a hazard does not mean that undesirable consequences inevitably follow. Instead, we speak of the connection between a hazard and something happening because of that hazard as a risk, defined as the probability of suffering injury, disease, death, or some other loss as a result of exposure to a hazard. The notion of vulnerability is also important; some people are more vulnerable to certain risks than are others. Therefore, an appropriate notation of risk should be Risk = Hazard * Vulnerability Female life expectancy at birth in years 95 90 85 80 75 70 65 60 55 50 45 40 35 For example, the presence of the Ebola virus in an area is a hazard that presents the risk of humans contracting the disease and dying. People working with the sick are much more vulnerable than are others. Risks are expressed as probabilities, so the analysis of the probability of suffering some harm from a hazard becomes a problem for scientists or other experts to address, and the assessment of risk becomes the basis of policy decisions. This chapter will focus on hazards in the environment. Environmental health practitioners often divide environmental hazards into three groups: chemical, physical, and biological. A fourth group\u2014cultural hazards\u2014is not always considered to be environmental, but is useful for comparison. We could also regard the lack of access to necessary resources such as food and water to be a hazard to public health, but such hazards are covered elsewhere (Chapters 9 and 12). As we will see, some health problems result from a combination of factors. Chemical Hazards Many different kinds of chemicals are hazardous to health. Some hazardous chemicals occur naturally, but many others are produced by humans.", "Industrialization has brought with it a host of technologies that employ chemicals such as 17.1 Human Health, Hazards, and the Environment 411 Figure 17\u20131 Life expectancies around the world. Average life expectancies vary from coun try to country. The size of the bubble indicates the relative size of a country\u2019s population. If males and females in a country have the same life expec tancy, the country\u2019s circle is centered on the line; a position above the line indicates that the life expectancy of females is greater than that of males. (Source: data from 2013 CIA factsheet, figure from Creative Commons.) cleaning agents, pesticides, fuels, paints, medicines, and those used directly in industrial processes such as tanning leather and refining oil. The manufacture, use, and disposal of these chemicals often bring humans into contact with them. People may be exposed to them by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water, by breathing contaminated air, by absorbing the chemicals through the skin, or by using the chemicals directly or accidentally. Toxicity. Toxicity is the condition of being harmful, deadly, or poisonous. Even though certain substances in the air, soil, and water may be toxic, the link between their presence and the development of a health problem is harder to establish than with infectious diseases. Often the best that can be done is to establish a statistical correlation between exposure levels and the development of an adverse effect. The science of toxicology studies the impacts of toxic substances on human health and investigates the relationships between the presence of such substances in the environment and health problems. (Chapter 22 discusses toxic substances and toxicol ogy in greater detail.) The toxicity of a substance depends on the degree of exposure and on the dose of the toxic substance\u2014the amount actually absorbed by a sensitive organ. Toxicologists distinguish between acute and chronic exposure to chemical (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 17\u20132 Industrial processes and hazards. Many industries produce chemicals that contribute to the impact of toxic substances on human health. Some examples of hazardous workshops are (a) a paper mill in Port Angeles, Washington; (b) a tannery in Fez, Morocco; (c) an oil refinery; and (d) a plastics factory in China. hazards. In acute exposure, a substance brings on life-threatening reactions within a period of hours or days. Chronic exposure occurs when a substance causes the gradual deterioration of a variety of physiological functions over a period of years. Many chemicals, such as heavy metals, organic solvents, and pesticides, are hazardous to human health at very low concentrations. Episodes of acute poisoning are easy to understand and are clearly preventable, but the long-term exposure to low levels of many substances presents the greatest challenge to our understanding. For most substances, there is a threshold below which no toxicity can be detected (see Figure 22\u20131). Different people have different thresholds of toxicity for given substances. For example, children are often at greater risk than adults because children are growing rapidly and are incorporating more of their food (and any contaminants that are in it) into new tissue. Embryos are even more sensitive. Substances transmitted across the mother\u2019s placenta can have grave impacts on the embryo\u2019s development, especially in the early stages. Some substances cause mutations and others disrupt development. These are called mutagens and teratogens respectively, and are most dangerous to developing fetuses, young children, or to reproductive-age adults. They cause birth defects and increase the rates of miscarriage. Carcinogens. Figure 17\u20132 shows a number of industrial processes that produce hazardous chemicals, including toxins and carcinogens. Carcinogens are cancer-causing agents. Because cancer often develops over a period of 10 to 40 years, it is frequently hard to connect the cause with the effect. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services lists 47 chemicals that are now known to be human carcinogens and 183 more chemicals that are \u201creasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens\u201d because of animal tests. 3 The agency also lists six biological agents and six types or sources of radiation that are known to be carcinogens. A cancer is a cell line that has lost its normal control over growth. In a malignancy, the cells grow out of control and form tumors that may spread to other parts of the body. Recent research has revealed the presence of as many as three dozen genes that can cause cancerous cells to develop.", "3U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Report on Carcinogens, Thirteenth Edition, October 2, 2014, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Toxicology Program. 17.1 Human Health, Hazards, and the Environment 413 These genes are like ticking time bombs that may or may not go off. Even if cancer develops, it can be a process with several steps, often with long periods of time in between. Environmental carcinogens are either chemicals that are able to bind to DNA and prevent it from functioning properly or agents, such as radiation, that can disrupt the structure of DNA. When such an agent initiates a mutation in a cell, it can take upward of 40 years for the cell to accumulate the sequence of mutations that leads to a malignancy. Cancer takes a very large toll in the developed countries, accounting for one-fourth of mortality (see Chapter 9 ). In 2014, an estimated 23% of the total deaths in the United States were traced to cancer. Even though it is largely a disease of older adults, cancer can strike people of all ages. Between 1991 and 2011, U.S. cancer deaths declined by 22%, largely because of a drop in smoking, early cancer detection, and better cancer treatments. The best strategy, however, is prevention, so great medical attention is now given to the environmental carcinogens and cultural habits, such as tobacco use, that are clearly related to cancer development. Heavy Metals. The heavy metals lead and mercury deserve special mention as environmental hazards. Both are quite toxic. Lead affects children more than adults, damaging their kidneys and brains, and impairing mental development. High lead levels can lead to coma and death. Unfortunately, prior to our modern knowledge of its danger, lead was widely added to paint and gasoline, and industries such as smelters spewed lead into the air. Today half a million children in the United States have elevated levels of lead in their blood, but this represents an improvement. Between 1980 and 1999, the EPA regulated the level of lead in gasoline so well that transportation-related emissions of lead dropped by 95%. During the same time, the level of lead in the air decreased by 94%. The Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988 allowed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. Lead is still found in contaminated soils and in paint in old houses, but lead levels in children are dropping with lowered lead exposure (Figure 17\u20133). Mercury poisoning can cause neurological dysfunction, developmental disabilities, and death; developing fetuses and young children are particularly vulnerable. Mercury occurs naturally in the soil and water; it is spread into the air by coal-burning power plants and industries, as well as by volcanoes. Mercury is also used in mining for gold and silver, especially in small mines. Worldwide, such mining is the leading cause of mercury pollution. One extremely toxic form of mercury, methyl mercury, can travel up the food chain; one of the primary ways people encounter it is by eating contaminated fish (see Chapter 22). The EPA regulates mercury pollution in order to lower U.S. emissions. Biological Hazards Human history can be told from the perspective of the battle with pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. It is a story of epidemics such as the black plague and typhus, which ravaged Europe in the Middle Ages, killing millions in every city, and of smallpox, which swept through the New World. The story takes a positive turn in the 19th century with the first vaccinations and the \u201cgolden age\u201d of bacteriology, when scientists discovered most of the major bacterial diseases and brought bacteria into laboratory culture. The 20th century brought the advent of virology (the study of viruses and the treatment of the diseases they cause), the discovery of antibiotics, and immunizations that led to victories over polio and many other childhood diseases and the global eradication of smallpox. During the last half of the 20th century, molecular biology became a powerful tool in the battle against disease. Diseases are inevitable components of our environment. Many are there regardless of our human presence, and others are uniquely human pathogens whose access to new, susceptible hosts is mediated by the environment. Today, approximately one-fifth of all human deaths are caused by Percentage of tested children with elevatedblood lead levels ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS FOR CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN 6 YEARS, 1997\u20132012 Figure 17\u20133 Elevated blood lead levels in U.S. children.", "The percent 10.0 age of children whose blood lead level is greater than or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter (\u03bc/dl) has dropped dramatically, 8.0 the result of regulations that have lowered children\u2019s exposure to lead. Worldwide, lead remains one of the most significant 6.0 causes of intellectual disability because of its effects on developing brains. (Source: CdC national Center for Environ mental Health national surveillance data, http://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/ uploads/2013/05/81_Blood_lead_levels.pdf. ) 4.0 2.0 0.0 infectious and parasitic diseases. Table 17\u20131 shows the leading infectious diseases; the greatest mortality is caused by respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, and malaria. Respiratory Infections. Acute respiratory infections, including pneumonia, diphtheria, influenza, and streptococcal infections, are the leading causes of death from infectious disease. Pneumonia is by far the most deadly of these. In developed countries, bacterial and viral respiratory infections represent the most common reasons for visits to the pediatrician. Influenza, or the \u201cflu,\u201d is a viral illness that affects the respiratory system. In 1918, a deadly strain of influenza spread around the world, eventually killing 50 million people. The virus that caused this worldwide epidemic, or pandemic, likely originated in pigs and spread to humans through farmers who had contact with infected pigs. Although we have not had an epidemic as serious since then, regular flu outbreaks continue to occur. (The connection between diseases and animals will be described further in Section 17.2.) Diarrheal Diseases. Each year, diarrheal diseases kill more than 760,000 children under age five. Some of these deaths are the consequence of ingesting food or water contaminated with bacterial pathogens from human wastes, such as Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacte, and Shigella. One-third of these deaths are traced to a highly contagious virus\u2014rotavirus\u2014that infects virtually every child between the ages of three months and five years. Rotavirus is rarely diagnosed, yet it causes most cases of severe diarrhea in young children. Rotavirus infections are more likely to be fatal in low-income countries than in wealthy countries because of differences in treatment: Severe diarrhea often leads to dehydration, which is quickly life threatening. Dehydration can be reversed with rehydration therapy, the replacement of lost fluids with balanced saline solutions. Such treatment is readily available in developed countries, but is often unavailable in developing countries. Fortunately, one rotavirus infection usually induces lifetime immunity, and vaccines are now able to prevent most severe rotavirus infections. HIV/AIDS. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The virus is spread in bodily fluids, including blood, semen, and breast milk. The virus leads to a compromised immune system, making its victims vulnerable to many other infections. This disease is taking a terrible toll in the developing world, where more than 90% of HIV-infected people live (Chapter 9). Even so, new treatments are enabling people with HIV to survive for years and lowering the rate of transmission from mothers to babies. Tuberculosis. Although AIDS has overtaken tuberculosis as the disease that causes the most adult deaths worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major killer. Today close to one-third of the world\u2019s people are infected with the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Figure 17\u20134) ; perhaps 10% of these will develop a life-threatening case of TB during their lifetime. Treatment with antibiotics reduced the incidence of TB during the mid-20th century, but in recent years it has reemerged. Some of the resurgence can be traced to the AIDS epidemic, which allows TB to flourish. Much of the disease\u2019s comeback, however, is the result of multi-drugresistant strains of the microbe. Figure 17\u20134 Tuberculosis. This patient in uzbekistan has a form of tuberculosis that is multi-drug resistant, requiring him to take as many as 20 pills at a time. 17.1 Human Health, Hazards, and the Environment 415 Malaria. Of the infectious diseases present in the tropics, malaria is by far the most serious, accounting for an estimated 198 million cases each year and 584,000 deaths. Caused by protozoans of the genus Plasmodium, malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles ( Figure 17\u20135). The disease begins with an infected mosquito biting a person. From there, the protozoans invade the liver and then the red blood cells, where they multiply, destroying the cells. The protozoans then invade other red blood cells. This chain of events occurs in cycles, leading to periodic episodes of fever, chills, and malaise. Those infected with the protozoans also suffer from severe anemia, high fever, headaches, and vomiting.", "Physical Hazards Many physical hazards, including natural disasters, are the outcome of meteorological, hydrological, or geological forces. Human activities can also cause physical hazards, such as traffic accidents and exposure to radiation. Natural Disasters. Natural disasters, including heat waves, severe storms, floods, landslides, forest fires, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, take a toll on human life and property. Every year, such disasters kill hundreds of thousands and cost millions or even billions of dollars. Table 17\u20132 records the mortality from the major natural disasters in just one year, 2013\u20132014. (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 17\u20136 Dangerous physical hazards. natural disasters bring death and destruction in their wake. (a) on May 22, 2011, the city of Joplin, Missouri, was almost leveled by an EF-5 tornado that killed 160. (b) Heavy winter storms in the Pacific northwest caused this tributary of the Columbia river to rampage. (c) A magnitude 7.0 earthquake destroyed the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince on January 12, 2010; more than 220,000 lives were lost. (d) A huge offshore earthquake triggered a devastating tsunami in Japan on March 1, 2011, killing more than 20,000. Tornadoes. Tornadoes are among the most destructive forces known in nature. Spawned from the severe weather accompanying thunderstorms, they may develop winds reaching as high as 300 miles per hour. Because of the tendency for cold, dry air masses from the north to mix with warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico, the central United States generates more tornadoes than anywhere else on Earth. Each year, an average of 780 tornadoes strike the United States. The year 2011 was particularly bad: In April, a series of tornadoes swept across the southeastern United States, killing 322 people; in May, another tornado nearly leveled Joplin, Missouri, killing 160 (Figure 17\u20136a) . Floods. Floods are often the result of intense storms, but may also result from a long period of steady rain (Figure 17\u20136b) . In 2010, huge floods covered one-fifth of Pakistan; 20 million people were affected and 2,000 died. In recent years, floods caused by Typhoon Haiyan (2012) and Typhoon Utor (2013) devastated the Philippines. Floods are often very costly. The year 2011 was a record year for insurance loss ($105 billion), when there were major floods in Thailand and Australia and a record flood in the Mississippi River basin. Floods are often accompanied by landslides, which can wipe out houses and roads. Fires. Forest fires and fires in human-built settings may be caused by lightning or human actions. Fires can have a significant impact on human health, particularly in causing respiratory illness. Fires are a common occurrence in certain ecosystems, such as pine woodlands and grasslands; the organisms that live in such ecosystems are usually adapted to the presence of fire (Chapter 5) . Earthquakes and Tsunamis. Most earthquakes are triggered by the movement of Earth\u2019s tectonic plates. Although they may occur in the interior of continents, earthquakes are most common along the edges of the oceanic and continental plates. Some earthquakes are the result of human activities, such as hydraulic fracturing (Chapter 14) and the building of dams ( Chapters 7, 16). The effects of large-scale earthquakes, such as one that hit Haiti in 2010, can last for years (Figure 17\u20136c) . When an earthquake occurs below the ocean, it can trigger a vast wave called a tsunami that hits coastal areas. A 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. The 2011 earthquake in Japan triggered a tsunami that killed nearly 20,000 people (Figure 17\u20136d) ; it also caused part of a nuclear power plant to collapse, allowing radiation to leak into the environment (Chapter 15). Volcanoes. Although volcanic eruptions are not common, the hot ash, lava, and noxious gases associated with some eruptions can be deadly and cause significant damage to property. Regions with active volcanoes, such as Iceland, Hawaii, and some Caribbean islands, need to have volcano disaster plans. Radiation. Radiation occurs in both high-energy (ionizing) and lower-energy (non-ionizing) forms. Ionizing radiation includes radiation from nuclear power, X-rays, and cancer treatments. In the last several decades, a decline in the ozone layer has allowed more of the Sun\u2019s ultraviolet radiation to reach Earth\u2019s surface; this increase has caused a dramatic increase in skin cancer. The effects of ionizing radiation from radon gas and the dangers of exposure to nuclear radiation are discussed in other chapters ( Chapters 15 and 19). Non-", "ionizing radiation, which is used in lasers, microwaves, and radio waves, poses less risk to human health. Cultural Hazards Some 35% of all deaths in the United States can be traced to cultural hazards (Figure 17\u20137) . People often engage in behaviors that expose them to hazards. They may, for example, smoke cigarettes, eat too much, drive too fast, sunbathe, consume alcoholic beverages, use harmful or addictive drugs, engage in risky sexual practices, get too little exercise, or choose hazardous occupations. Although the WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control do not consider most of these to be environmental health factors, many cultural hazards are closely connected with environmental health factors (see Stewardship, A Cultural Hazard Worsens Other Risks). Obesity is a cultural hazard that is linked to numerous health problems, including diabetes and heart disease. Currently, one-third of all U.S. adults are obese and another third are overweight. Obesity is a problem in poor nations as well as in the developed world. In 2014, more than 1.9 billion of the world\u2019s adults were overweight, 600 million of whom were obese. Worldwide, the conditions of obesity and overweight are linked to more deaths than the condition of underweight. The connection between behavior and risk is especially lethal in the case of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by the human immunodeficiency virus 17.1 Human Health, Hazards, and the Environment 417 Total 2010 deaths: 2,465,936 Total 2010 deaths from cultural hazards: 846,525 Figure 17\u20137 Deaths from various cultural hazards in the United States, 2010. Many hazards in the environment are a matter of culture\u2014lifestyle, personal choices, and society. other hazards are due to accidents and the lethal behavior of other people. (Sources: data from the national vital Statistics reports, January 11, 2012; smoking deaths and obesity deaths from the Centers for disease Control and Journal of the American Medical Association.) (HIV). High-risk sexual behavior and the use of intravenous drugs are risk factors for HIV/AIDS. Having HIV is, in turn, a risk factor for drug-resistant TB infection. TB infections are also more likely when people are exposed to indoor and outdoor air pollution, a connection that highlights the complex interactions between cultural and other hazards. Some cultural hazards, such as living in a high-crime area, are not really a function of individual choice. For other cultural hazards, individual choice is only a part of the picture. Being sedentary, for example, is linked with a number of negative health outcomes. Living in a place where it is unsafe to go outside, or having a job that requires long hours of sitting, can make healthy activity more difficult. Designing living places that support healthy behaviors is part of creat ing sustainable communities (Chapter 23). Pollution Many of the hazards we encounter, especially chemical and biological hazards, could be considered pollutants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines pollution as \u201cthe presence of a substance in the environment that, because of its chemical composition or quantity, prevents the functioning of natural processes and produces undesirable environmental and health effects.\u201d Any material that causes pollution is called a pollutant. Almost anything may be a pollutant, including mercury from mining operations, cholera in unsanitary water, or radiation from nuclear waste. Even light and noise can be pollutants. The only criterion is that the addition of a pollutant results in undesirable changes. The impact of an undesirable change may be largely aesthetic, such as the unsightliness of roadside litter. The impact may be on ecosystems as a whole\u2014the die-off of fish or forests, for example. Or the impact may be on human health, such as human wastes contaminating water supplies. The effect of a pollutant may be as direct as a poison, or as indirect as a chemical destroying ozone and indirectly increasing cancer rates. The effects of transportation, and manufacturing products. An overview pollution can range from very local (the contamination of an of the categories of pollutants that result from various ac-individual well) to global (adding ozone-depleting chemicals tivities is shown in Figure 17\u20138.

Pollution is an outcome of otherwise worthy human endeavors. Major categories of pollution and some activities that cause them are shown here. Protecting Environmental Health In the United States, the federal agency with the primary responsibility for protecting the health and safety of the public is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. The CDC gathers data and provides information on health issues to state and local health care providers. Each state has a health department, and most municipalities have health agents, too. The primary responsibility for health risk management and prevention resides with the CDC and the state public-health agencies. These agencies are responsible for monitoring certain diseases and environmental hazards and for controlling epidemics; for example, they may require public-health measures such as immunizations and quarantines. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plays a role in protecting food supplies, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plays a role by regulating environmental pollutants. STEWARDSHIP 17.1 Human Health, Hazards, and the Environment 419 Virtually every country has a ministry of health similar to the CDC that acts on behalf of its people to manage and minimize health risks. The health policies that are put into place, however, are subject to limitations of information and funding. Ideally, a health ministry should direct its limited resources toward strategies that will accomplish the greatest risk prevention. Fortunately, all countries have access to the programs and information of the World Health Organization (WHO), a UN agency established in 1948. The WHO is centered in Geneva, Switzerland, and maintains six regional offices around the world. The agency is staffed by health professionals and other experts and is governed by the UN member states through the World Health Assembly. Much of what the WHO does is related to public health, such as tracking diseases and monitoring trends in health. What is the difference between a hazard and a risk? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 17.2 Pathways of Risk The environmental hazards identified in Section 17.1 are responsible for untold human misery and death. But if many of the consequences of exposure to hazards are preventable, how is it that the hazards turn into mortality statistics? In other words, what are the pathways that lead to human deaths from risks of infection, exposure to chemicals, and vulnerability to physical hazards? If prevention is the goal\u2014 and it should be\u2014this knowledge is crucial. A report by the WHO identifies a small number of environmental risk factors that increase the probability of adverse health outcomes and need to be priorities for the future in public health. 4 Some major public-health risks are associated with the lack of an important resource such as food, clean water, or contraception. Several other public-health concerns, such as tobacco use, are associated with individual choices but interact with environmental variables. Figure 17\u20139 compares several of the top environmental risk factors to the cultural hazard of smoking, which by far outweighs the other risks. We will consider only a few examples of risk factors, because a thorough examination of this topic would take up volumes. Exposure to Biological Hazards Many biological hazards are infectious diseases. Depending on the pathogen causing them, infectious diseases may be transmitted through the air, by unclean water or contaminated food, by animals, by direct contact with other people, or by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood and semen. Such means of transmission can be described as pathways of risk. Unsafe Water. The WHO describes unsafe water as one of the greatest environmental risks.", "Many microbial diseases are transmitted through contaminated water, and some of these diseases, such as cholera and typhoid fever, are deadly. Smoking Natural disasters Climate change impacts Lead exposure Unintentional poisonings Urban air pollution Road traffic accidents Malaria Indoor smoke Unsafe water and sanitation Deaths (millions per year) Figure 17\u20139 Global risk factors. The World Health organization identified a number of environmental risk factors that were priorities for the future. The graph compares the worldwide deaths caused by these factors to those caused by the cultural hazard of smoking. (Source: World Health organization. \u201cPriority risks and Future Trends.\u201d In Environment and Health in Developing Countries. World Health organization, 2014. Available at http://www.who.int/heli/risks/ehindevcoun/en.) The contamination of water is usually the result of inadequate hygiene or inferior sewage treatment. These conditions, in turn, may be the result of a lack of education or a lack of the resources needed to build effective sanitation systems. According to the United Nations\u2019 2014 report on the Millennium Development Goals, an estimated 2.6 billion people are still without adequate sanitation, and 884 million lack access to safe drinking water. Industrial Food Production. Food- and water-borne illnesses are not unique to the developing world. Outbreaks of food-borne diseases are common in developed countries as well. The CDC estimates that every year 48 million Americans are sickened by contaminated food and 3,000 die. Species of Salmonella, bacteria that infect the intestinal tract and bring on diarrhea, fever, and cramps, are responsible for more cases of illness than any other food-borne pathogen ( Figure 17\u201310) . The factory-like conditions under which much of our food is processed provide an opportunity for Salmonella and other pathogens to contaminate food on a wide scale, resulting in diarrheal outbreaks and major recalls of food products. In 2010, an outbreak of Salmonella infections led to a nationwide recall of 500 million eggs. It was occurrences like this that brought about passage of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of 2010, expanding the FDA\u2019s authority over the food processing industry. Food safety continues to be a battle; a 2014 Salmonella outbreak connected to bean sprouts caused 115 cases of illness in 12 northeastern states. Tropical Conditions. If you picture life in the tropics as a blissful paradise, you might be surprised to learn that the tropics are home to a wide variety of biological hazards not found 4World Health Organization, \u201cPriority Risks and Future Trends,\u201d in Environment and Health in Developing Countries, World Health Organization, 2014, available at http://www.who.int/heli/risks/ehindevcoun/en.

Plasmodium falciparum is the most deadly and widespread of the three major species of malaria parasites. This map shows the rate of infection in 2- to 10-yearolds in 2010. That year there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria and 655,000 deaths. (Source: Malaria Atlas Project. used with permission. http://www.map.ox.ac.uk/about-map/open-access. Accessed January 16, 2012.) in temperate regions. For example, wet tropical climates provide ideal conditions for the year-round spread of insect-borne diseases. Mosquitoes are vectors (organisms that transmit infectious agents) for several deadly diseases, including malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile virus. The WHO describes the complex relationship between tropical diseases and the environment, saying \u201cPoorly designed irrigation and water systems, inadequate housing, poor waste disposal and water storage, deforestation and loss of biodiversity, all may be contributing factors to the most common vector-borne diseases.\u201d 5 Malaria. The most serious and widespread tropical disease is malaria, caused by protozoans of the genus Plasmodium. Figure 17\u201311 shows the global distribution of the most deadly of these protozoans. Because the pathway to malarial infection is through mosquito bites, most attempts to control the disease have been aimed at vector control, such as attacking the Anopheles mosquito with the use of insecticides. Unfortunately, some mosquitoes have developed resistance to all of the pesticides employed, so eradication has remained an elusive goal. In some countries, DDT is still sprayed on walls of huts and houses, but its use in this manner is highly controversial because of the pesticide\u2019s harmful environmental effects (see Stewardship, DDT for Malaria Control, in Chapter 13). One preventive measure that has been highly successful is the placement of insecticide-treated netting over beds.", "Children provided with such bed nets experience a substantial reduction in mortality from malaria and other diseases ( Figure 17\u201312). Efforts to combat malaria also include treatment strategies, or methods of curing people infected with the protozoans. Such treatment is difficult because Plasmodium protozoans have developed resistance to one treatment drug after another, so new ones have to be developed regularly. In 2002, molecular biologists successfully sequenced the genomes of the Anopheles mosquito and the most lethal malaria parasite, P. falciparum. Armed Figure 17\u201312 Insecticide-treated bed net. A home health worker 5Ibid. installs a bed net in a home in Kampala, uganda. with this information, researchers are now able to target both organisms in the search for new vaccines and drugs. A vaccine has been developed, but its efficacy is modest (55%). Effective control of the disease requires a combination of approaches. Using a combination of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor DDT spraying, and quick access to drug treatment, the southern Africa nation of Namibia has seen a huge decline in cases of malaria (83%), hospital admissions (92%), and deaths (96%) in just 10 years. The country is on track to be malaria-free by 2020. Over the years, a number of plans for conquering malaria have been developed; the latest of these is the Global Malaria Action Plan (GMAP). This plan had an extremely ambitious goal: reduce malaria deaths to near zero by 2015 and then gradually eliminate malaria everywhere until it is eradicated. Although the 2015 deadline was not reached, there has been great progress in the worldwide effort to conquer this most difficult disease. Since 2000, malaria mortality rates have fallen by 26% globally and by more than 54% in the WHO African region. Neglected Tropical Diseases. The tropics are home to a number of less well-known diseases called neglected tropical diseases (NTDs); they are called neglected because there has not been significant international funding for their control and treatment. Almost everyone in deep poverty in tropical regions is infected with at least one NTD. Even if people don\u2019t die from them, these diseases can cause tremendous suffering. The transmission of the NTDs is closely linked to the living conditions in many low-income tropical countries. People contract them by walking without shoes in places with human or animal feces, from drinking polluted water, and from bites from insect vectors. For example, schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms that live in the veins of the intestine and bladder, causing pain and internal bleeding. These flatworms also live in freshwater snails and their larvae swim in water; people contract Figure 17\u201313 Filtering water to eradicate Guinea worms. Maintaining clean water is critical to the eradication of Guinea worm disease. Here a Guinea worm eradication team teaches villagers in Ghana how to filter water. the flatworms by drinking, bathing, swimming, or doing laundry in contaminated water. Other tropical parasites include Ascariasis roundworms, Trichuriasis whipworms, and hookworms, all of which live in the human intestinal tract, causing malnutrition, anemia, and other symptoms. People get them from soil contaminated with the parasites\u2019 eggs. Lymphatic filariasis is caused by a roundworm spread by mosquitoes; the people who contract this parasite experience blocked lymphatic vessels and swollen limbs. Trachoma is a bacterial infection spread by poor hygiene and houseflies; this common infection often causes blindness. Onchocerciasis, which is spread by the bite of black flies, also causes blindness. Every one of these NTDs can be treated and prevented; the drugs for treatment are inexpensive and effective, but perhaps because these diseases infect people who are poor and do not often result in death, governments have not given them the attention they deserve. A recently formed partnership between donors and public agencies called the Global Network of NTDs is beginning to receive funding. It is estimated that it would cost $2\u2013$3 billion per year for the next seven years to make a serious impact on these diseases. 6 There is some very good news about one former scourge: Guinea worm disease. Just two decades ago, some 3.5 million people in 21 countries were infested with this roundworm, acquired by drinking water infested with larvae. Public-health efforts to keep Guinea worms out of drinking water have been instrumental in combatting the disease ( Figure 17\u201313). The Carter Center has carried out a successful campaign to eradicate this disease, now down to some 1,000 cases in four African countries.", "The disease is so close to eradication that many in public health would like to see a major effort to get rid of it once and for all. 6Peter Jay Hotez, \u201cA Plan to Defeat Neglected Tropical Diseases,\u201d Scientific American 302 (January 2010): 90\u201396. 17.2 Pathways of Risk 423 Interactions with Animals. Diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans are said to be zoonotic. One study found that out of 1,415 pathogens able to infect humans, 61% were zoonotic. Zoonotic pathogens are one source of new, or emerging, diseases. Humans that eat bush meat or live in close contact with wild animals may contract diseases from them. For example, the Nipah virus, first observed in Malaysia in 1999, is endemic in fruit bats (Figure 17\u201314) . People and pigs become infected by contact with fruit contaminated with bat urine and feces. The virus has killed more than 200 people and has shown signs of human-to-human transmission in some cases. As discussed in the chapter opener, some African fruit bats harbor the virus that causes Ebola. Modern intensive methods of rearing animals can also facilitate the transfer of diseases from animals to humans. The globalization of travel makes the movement of these diseases more rapid. In 2003, a strain of influenza called the avian flu first appeared in poultry. The disease eventually spread to 63 countries, killing or leading to the culling of 400 million domestic poultry and countless wild birds and causing $20 billion in losses. The disease also spread to humans through contact with infected birds, with 582 cases and 343 deaths. In 2009, the H1N1 strain of swine influenza initiated a pandemic in humans; although this strain of the flu was a relatively mild disease, it caused more than 18,000 deaths. Many other emerging diseases are connected to environmental changes that bring people into contact with animals. Exposure to Chemical Hazards Each year, unintentional poisonings kill 355,000 people globally, and many more people experience nonlethal poisoning effects. How are people exposed to chemical substances that can bring them harm? Let\u2019s look at several of the ways. Industrial Exposure. The extraction of minerals and industrial manufacturing are major routes of exposure to toxic substances, as is the use of toxic chemicals such as pesticides. The dumping of wastes exposes many to harmful chemicals. In low-income countries, people are exposed to airborne pollutants in occupations such as informal recycling, where plastics and metals are burned or melted over open fires. While this topic is covered elsewhere ( Chapters 12, 19), it would be hard to overemphasize how the spreading of chemicals throughout the environment has changed ecosystems and harmed human health. Lead is a good example of a widespread contaminant. The WHO estimates that lead poisoning kills 230,000 people globally each year and that one-third of all children experience cognitive effects from lead exposure. Mining is a particularly dangerous industry that exposes workers to both chemical and physical hazards, such as the collapse of structures (also see Chapter 22). The mercury used in mining is one hazard, but contamination from toxic mine tailings is a more common concern in large mines. For example, the town of Picher, Oklahoma, was once in the national center of lead and zinc mining. Underground cave-ins and piles of toxic mine tailings made it a danger zone. Figure 17\u201314 Animal vectors. Interaction with wild animals is one pathway for the transmission of human diseases. Fruit bats such as this one may carry the viruses for Ebola and nipah without dying. By 2009, many of its buildings were near collapse and 34% of its children were found to have lead poisoning. The site was evacuated and declared uninhabitable by the state of Oklahoma. The state purchased the town and the site was declared a Superfund site (Chapter 19). One newer concern stems from the chemicals in the water that is pumped into the ground during hydraulic fracturing, or fracking (see Chapter 14) . Several recent studies have suggested that fracking chemicals have negative health effects. Nevertheless, some companies involved in fracking have resisted reporting which chemicals they are pumping into the ground, claiming that this information is a trade secret. This means the EPA and local public-health officials do not know which chemicals may be contaminating the groundwater. This issue is sure to be the subject of legal actions in the future. Outdoor Air Pollution.", "Airborne pollutants are a particularly challenging set of chemical hazards to control, as they are difficult to measure and difficult to avoid. Humans breathe an average of 30 pounds (14 kg) of air into their lungs each day. Living in cities exposes people to industrial pollution and pollution from transportation such as carbon monoxide, ozone, smog, and particulates. Air pollution is estimated to kill 800,000 people annually and is discussed at length elsewhere (Chapter 19). Indoor Air Pollution. Much attention is given to air pollutants released into the atmosphere\u2014and rightly so. However, indoor air pollution can pose an even greater risk to health. The air inside the home and workplace often contains much higher levels of hazardous pollutants than outdoor air does. In the developed countries, the overall indoor air pollution problem is threefold. First, increasing numbers and types of products and equipment used in homes and offices give off hazardous fumes. Second, buildings have become increasingly well insulated and sealed; hence, pollutants are trapped inside. Third, people spend more time indoors than out. The average person spends 90% of his or her time indoors. The sources of indoor air pollution are quite varied, as evidenced in Figure 17\u201315. Sometimes mold and other pollutants accumulate to such an extent that a building is uninhabitable, a condition called \u201csick building syndrome.\u201d In the developing world, at least 3 billion people rely on biofuels such as wood and animal dung for cooking and heat. The WHO reports that the pollution from burning these fuels contributes to nearly 1.6 million deaths annually. Fireplaces, cooking fires, and stoves are often improperly ventilated (if at all), exposing the inhabitants to very high levels of pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, soot, and benzene. These exposures cause acute respiratory infections in children; chronic lung Figure 17\u201315 Indoor air pollution. Pollutants originate from many sources and can accumulate to unhealthy levels, leading to asthma and \u201csick-building syndrome\u201d (characterized by eye, nose, and throat irritations; nausea; irritability; and fatigue) as well as other serious problems. diseases, including asthma and bronchitis; lung cancer; and birth-related problems. One study in Mexico showed that women who were continually exposed to indoor smoke had 75 times the risk of developing a chronic lung disease as women who weren\u2019t exposed. Solutions to this problem include the use of ventilated stoves that burn more efficiently (see Chapter 1) and the conversion from biofuels to bottled gas or liquid fuels such as kerosene. Asthma and Air Pollution. Asthma is currently at epidemic proportions in the United States, afflicting 25 million people each year. Asthma attacks the respiratory system so that air passages tighten and constrict, causing wheezing, tightness in the chest, coughing, and shortness of breath. In acute attacks, the onset is sudden and sometimes life threatening. This condition is worsened by exposure to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Substances that can trigger asthma attacks include dust, animal dander, mold, secondhand smoke, swimming pool chlorine, and various gases and particles. About half of asthma is traced to allergies, but the remainder has other, unknown causes. Through its Indoor Environments Division Web site, the EPA provides helpful guidelines for controlling many of the substances that trigger asthma in schools, homes, and other indoor environments. Oddly, asthma is much more common in developed countries, in spite of the greater exposure to indoor air pollution in developing countries. Recent research has suggested that frequent parasitic worm infections stimulate a well-regulated anti-inflammatory network in the immune systems of most people in the developing countries, protecting them against many allergic diseases such as asthma. In the developed countries, where such parasitic infections are uncommon, this protection is lacking, so allergic disorders are much more common. It is interesting that children who grow up on farms in developed countries also experience much lower frequency of asthma and allergies. These observations have led to what is called the hygiene hypothesis: Immune systems need to encounter microbes (and worms!) when they are young in order to keep inflammatory responses such as asthma under control. Apparently, too much cleanliness can make you sick! 7 Exposure to Physical Hazards How are people exposed to physical hazards? They may encounter them anywhere, but are particularly at risk as they travel and in certain kinds of workplaces. Some of the greatest risks are associated with natural disasters. Fortunately, we can take action to minimize these risks. Collisions with Motor Vehicles.", "Our modern means of transportation move us quickly, but also pose significant risks to our safety. Every year collisions with motor vehicles kill 1.2 million people and injure many more. Pedestrians and bicyclists are particularly vulnerable to injuries from interactions with vehicles; crowded or narrow roads that lack safety features such as lights, wide shoulders, guard rails, biking or walking lanes, and smooth surfaces contribute to the risk. Much of the world lacks such structures, making travel a dangerous activity. Workplace Exposure. In many occupations, workers are exposed to physical hazards such as loud noises and radiation; they may also be at risk of accidental injury. In the United States, such workplace hazards are monitored by laws and subject to certain regulations. In countries that lack such laws, workers are exposed to more hazards with fewer protections. The dangers of the workplace environment are a subset of environmental hazards, which are discussed further in a later chapter (Chapter 22). Harm from Natural Disasters. Each year, natural disasters affect more than 100 million people. Disasters inevitably trigger emergency relief efforts and subsequent humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. The effects of natural disasters provide a good example of the difference between being exposed to a hazard and experiencing actual harm. 7Mitch Leslie, \u201cGut Microbes Keep Rare Immune Cells in Line,\u201d Science 335 (March 23, 2012): 1428. 17.2 Pathways of Risk 425 Location. Much of the loss brought on by natural disasters is a consequence of poor environmental stewardship and lack of planning. Hillsides and mountains are deforested, leaving the soil unprotected; people build homes and towns on floodplains; villages are nestled up to volcanic mountains; cities are constructed on known geological fault lines; and coastal marshes and mangrove forests are replaced by house lots. Populations along the U.S. \u201churricane coasts\u201d (Gulf of Mexico and southern Atlantic) continue to rise in spite of the many hurricane strikes. Living in floodplains is also risky, as is building in fire-prone areas. Risk-Reduction Strategies. Much of the human death and misery brought on by natural hazards could be prevented by rigorous disaster risk-reduction strategies. Such strategies include strong building codes and effective warning systems. Anyone who has lived in the American Midwest is probably familiar with the sirens and the radio, TV, and phone alerts that sound tornado warnings, and of the need to get to a place to shelter when the danger of tornadoes is high. These alerts are part of the region\u2019s strategy for reducing the harm caused by frequent tornadoes. Tsunami warning systems, consisting of a network of sensors and communications infrastructure, can also be very effective ( Figure 17\u201316). Such systems have existed for the Pacific Ocean since 1965, but they were not installed in the Indian Ocean until 2006, after the 2004 tsunami that devastated that region. In 2011, a tsunami warning was broadcast widely on Japan\u2019s east coast immediately following the offshore earthquake and saved many thousands of lives. Figure 17\u201316 Reducing the risks of natural disasters. This sensing buoy is part of a tsunami warning system off of the coast of Indonesia. data is beamed to satellites, and communicated to people in coastal zones. The Indian state of Odiasha has recently employed a wide range of strategies to protect the public from cyclones, which are tropical storms with hurricane-force winds. Among other actions, Odiasha has built cyclone shelters and coastal embankments, developed evacuation plans, and installed warning systems. This preparation has paid off. In both 1999 and 2013, the state experienced category 5 cyclones. But while the 1999 disaster cost 10,000 lives and $4.5 billion in damages, the more recent disaster cost only 40 lives and $700 million. This change was because of the state\u2019s concerted effort to reduce the risks associated with storms. The importance of risk-reduction strategies can be seen by comparing the outcomes of the Japanese earthquake of 2011 and the Haitian earthquake of 2010. Both were powerful earthquakes, but the damage they inflicted on the two countries was significantly different. Why? Earthquakes are common in Japan, a wealthy country that has been able to develop and enforce strong building codes. As a result, most Japanese buildings are designed and built to withstand the impact of severe earthquakes. When the magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck, most of the Japanese buildings swayed, but only a small portion of them collapsed. Most of the fatalities associated with the earthquake were due to the tsunami that accompanied it.", "In contrast, the city of Portau-Prince, Haiti, lacked earthquake-resistant buildings; more than 250,000 buildings were significantly damaged and more than 100,000 people died. A Framework for Action. In January 2005, 168 country delegations met in Kobe, Japan, for the UN World Conference on Disaster Reduction. At that conference, delegates adopted the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), a global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts for the coming decade. The framework identified five priorities for action: A midterm review of the HFA indicated that significant progress has been made, although that progress is uneven: the more vulnerable segments of society still lack the resilience to hazards called for by the plan, in part because risk reduction is more difficult in poor areas. The Risks of Being Poor Poverty increases the risk of a number of environmental hazards. In general, poor people are exposed to more environmental hazards than wealthy people, and thus are at greater risk of being harmed. Poor people are more likely than wealthy people to be exposed to toxic chemicals and disease organisms; they are also more likely to lack access to disaster warning systems. The people who are dying from infectious diseases are those who lack access to adequate health care, clean water, nutritious food, healthy air, sanitation, and shelter. The relationship between poverty and environmental hazards also moves in the other direction\u2014those who have been harmed by environmental hazards may be pushed into poverty (see the poverty cycle in Chapter 2). Poverty and Longevity. Overall, the wealthier a country becomes, the healthier its population. People in high-income countries tend to live longer, and when they die, the chief causes of death are the degenerative diseases of old age, such as cancer, heart disease, and stroke. By contrast, only one-third of the deaths in the low-income countries are indicative of people who are living out their life spans. The availability of medical treatment is one reason for this difference. In 2014, the WHO estimated that high-income countries had an average of 90 nurses and midwives for every 10,000 people, while low-income countries had only two such experts for the same number of people. Another reason for this discrepancy is that some parts of developing nations lack the resources to ensure safe drinking water and sanitation. In addition, many of the people in developing nations are exposed to the high levels of indoor air pollution associated with burning wood, dung, and coal in simple cooking stoves. Poverty and Malnutrition. Being underweight is a risk factor for many hazards. The leading reason for children being underweight is malnutrition, and the primary cause of malnutrition is poverty (see Chapter 12). Not surpris ingly, the poorest fifth of the world\u2019s population shows the highest prevalence of underweight children. (To learn about another cause of malnourishment, see Sound Science, Water Pollution Drives Malnutrition in India.) The Role of Education. Education plays a role in the relationship between wealth and health. Advances in socioeconomic development and advances in education are strongly correlated. As people\u2014especially women\u2014become more educated, they use their knowledge to secure relief from hazards. They may, for example, improve their hygiene, immunize their children, or recognize dangerous symptoms such as dehydration and seek oral rehydration therapy. Priorities and Inequalities. Nutrition, education, and the general level of wealth in a society do not tell the whole story, however. Even in developed countries, poor people may have less education, be more exposed to crime, have little access to healthy food, or have less access to health insurance. In addition, they may be more exposed to specific environmental hazards such as pollution (see Chapter 22) . 17.2 Pathways of Risk 427 SOUND SCIENCE CHILDHOOD STUNTING AND POOR SANITATION Percentage of children who are stunted 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Eighty-one percent of all childhood stunting occurs in 10 countries. While the main cause of stunting is a lack of food, water-borne diseases contribute to the problem, especially in countries where many people lack toilets and must defecate outdoors. (Source: open defecation data from Joint Monitoring Program WHo/unICEF Water and Sanitation country reports; stunting data from udAId Demographic and Health Surveys and unICEF Improving Child Nutrition, 2013; density data from WorldAtlas.com.) UNDERSTANDING THE DATA Compare the density of outdoor defecation in Bangladesh and Haiti with that in India. What is the relationship between these densities and the degree of stunting in these countries? villagers in Gujarat, India, wash their vessels in a stagnant pond that is also used by farm animals.", "sanitation; their bodies are weakened by disease, so they cannot use the food they eat. India is densely populated and more than half of the population lack access to toilets. open defecation is very common. no Indian city has a comprehensive sewage treatment system; waterways are full of human waste. The constant exposure of children to water-borne diseases causes many to suffer from diarrhea and vomiting. Even if they are fed nutritious food, the constancy of illness leaves them unable to absorb the nutrients they need. Malnutrition resulting from poor sanitation is a good example of the connectivity of environmental issues. In this case, the growth of children is affected by chronic illnesses, which in turn are affected by household economics and views about the importance of sanitation. Poor sanitation has other effects, too. A recent World Bank report estimated that in one year alone, India lost $53.8 billion in economic activity because of poor sanitation, nearly 7% of the nation\u2019s GdP. In 2014, the Indian government launched the \u201cClean India Campaign,\u201d an effort to provide every Indian household with access to a toilet by 2019. The building of infrastructure needs to be accompanied by a large-scale educational campaign emphasizing the connection between sanitation and health. Source: G. Harris, \u201cPoor sanitation in India may afflict well-fed children with malnutrition\u201d New York Times July 13, 2014. A study of American cities showed that income inequality, and not just average income, was a predictor of mortality rates. That is, cities with higher income inequality had worse health outcomes, even if they were wealthier on average. On the other hand, a nation with a modest per capita income may choose to put its resources into improving the health of its population rather than into other activities. Countries such as Costa Rica, China, and Sri Lanka have a much longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality than their gross domestic product would predict. They have accomplished this enviable record by focusing public resources on activities such as immunization, the upgrading of sewer and water systems, and land reform. The Effects of Climate Change The WHO identifies climate change as a major risk to public health, not only because of the direct effects of warming on people, but also because of its indirect effects on other health risk factors. People in a warmer world will experience more of the hazards of heat waves, which are particularly severe in crowded cities. As the world becomes warmer, tropical insect vectors will expand their ranges. Agricultural production may fall in some areas, affecting food availability. It is also likely that severe weather events will increase in frequency. Scientists are still determining to what extent global Figure 17\u201317 Loss of life expectancy from various risks. one way to illustrate the relative risks posed by different hazards is to rank them in terms of years of lost life associated with each risk. The data show the loss of life expectancy for men and women in denmark. (Source: Knud Juel, Jan Sorensen, and Henrik Bronnum-Hansen. risk Factors and Public Health in denmark, Summary report. Copenhagen: national Institute of Public Health and university of Southern denmark, 2007.) climate change is behind current natural disasters, especially intense hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and droughts. All the evidence suggests that climate change will intensify future natural disasters as temperatures and sea levels rise ( Chapter 18) . CONCEPT CHECK What are three pathways that increase the likelihood of a person being harmed by a chemical hazard? By a biological hazard? \u2610\u2713 17.3 Risk Assessment In the developed countries, our lives are freer of hazards than ever before. Even so, our society still faces many hazards and the risks that they present to our health. For our own self-interest, we should know about the risks to which we are subjected. Such knowledge enables us to make informed choices about these risks. When risks are thoroughly understood, strategies for reducing disease and death are far easier to identify and prioritize. If governments are to act as stewards of the health of their people, they desperately need the kind of information a thorough evaluation of health risks can bring them. Risk assessment is the process of evaluating the risks associated with a particular hazard. Figure 17\u201317 shows a number of risks, expressed as years of lost life expectancy, for men and women in Denmark. Risk may also be expressed as 17.3 Risk Assessment 429 the probability of dying from a given hazard.", "For example, the annual risk of dying from smoking may be expressed as 1.5 per 1,000 (Table 17\u20133) . That is, in the course of a year, 1.5 people out of every 1,000 who smoke will die as a result of their habit. For men, this is equivalent to about 3.5 years of lost life expectancy. In other words, men who never smoke will live an average of 3.5 years longer than those who do. Risk assessment is an important tool in the development of public policy. For the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), risk assessment is a major way of applying science to the hard problems of environmental regulation. Many other U.S. agencies use risk assessment to address a wide variety of hazards. The WHO now recommends risk assessment as an ideal way to promote the health of people everywhere. Risk Assessment by the EPA Risk assessment began at the EPA in the mid-1970s as a way of addressing the cancer risks associated with pesticides and toxic chemicals. It soon developed into a science-based methodology directed toward understanding how pollutants affect human health and the environment. As currently performed at the EPA, human health risk assessment has four steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization (Figure 17\u201318). The EPA also performs ecological risk assessment (ERA) in its responsibility for protecting natural organisms and ecosystems from the adverse effects of human activities. The process used for ERA is quite similar to that used for human health risk assessment. Hazard Identification: Is This Really a Hazard? Hazard identification is the process of examining evidence linking a potential hazard to its harmful effects. In the case of accidents, the link between car crashes and deaths is obvious. In these cases, historical data, such as the annual highway death toll, are useful for calculating risks. In other cases, the link is not so clear because there is a time delay between the first exposure and the final outcome. For example, it is often very difficult to establish a link between exposure to certain chemicals and the development of cancer some years later. In cases where the linkage is not obvious, researchers may need data from epidemiological studies or animal tests. An epidemiological study tracks how a sickness spreads through a community. To find a link between cancer and exposure to some chemical, an epidemiological study would examine all the people especially exposed to the chemical and determine whether that population has a statistically higher cancer rate than the general population. Ask the Rats. We do not want to wait 20 years to find out that a new food additive causes cancer, so we turn to animal testing to find out now what might happen in the future. A test involving several hundred animals (usually mice or rats) takes about three years. If a significant number of the animals develop tumors after having been fed the substance being tested, EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT How much of the pollutant are people exposed to during a specific time period? How many people are exposed? Figure 17\u201318 Risk assessment as performed by the EPA. The process of risk assessment involves four steps. (Source: EPA, http://epa.gov/risk/risk-characterization.htm. January 19, 2011.) then the substance is either a possible or a probable human carcinogen, depending on the strength of the results. Three objections to animal testing have been raised: (1) rodents and humans may have very different responses to a given chemical; (2) the doses used on the animals are often much higher than those to which humans may be exposed; and (3) some people believe it is unethical to use animals for such purposes. Although there are obvious differences between rodents and humans, all chemicals shown by epidemiological studies to be human carcinogens are also carcinogenic to test animals, suggesting that animal tests have some predictive value for humans. Just Test People? In the past, chemical manufacturers that were interested in assessing the safety of pesticides (in order to have their products approved for use) paid human subjects to test the products. Remarkably, such tests are far less expensive than the usual animal testing. A National Academy of Sciences panel addressed this topic, stating that the use of human volunteers \u201cto facilitate the interests of industry or of agriculture\u201d is unjustifiable. The EPA banned such tests on children and established new, more stringent ethical standards to protect adult subjects. 8 Other Tests. Information about the physical and chemical properties of a substance can be used to predict its toxicity.", "For example, ToxCastTM is an automated technology that exposes living human cells to chemicals and then screens them for any toxic effects; this rapid process is now being used to test up to 10,000 chemicals. Initial tests using chemicals already subjected to animal testing and epidemiological studies have indicated that this approach has great promise in reducing the time it takes to evaluate the risk posed by a chemical hazard. In the end, hazard identification takes a weight of the evidence approach to determining the potential ill effects of a chemical or process. Standard descriptors are used in its conclusions, such as \u201clikely to be carcinogenic to humans.\u201d Thus, hazard identification tells us that we may have a problem. human groups already exposed to the chemical, learning how their exposure came about, and calculating the doses and duration of their exposure. Risk Characterization: What Does the Science Say? The final step, risk characterization, is to pull together all the information gathered in the first three steps in order to determine the risk and its accompanying uncertainties. Here is where science is able to inform the risk manager. Commonly, risk is expressed as the probability of a fatal outcome due to the hazard, as in Table 17\u20133. The EPA conducts an evaluation of risk information on hazards that chemicals pose to human health. The agency employs its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) on science-based information gathered from assays and epidemiological studies and publishes IRIS assessments after they have been thoroughly reviewed in draft form. Information on more than 550 chemical substances can be found in the IRIS database. Another EPA agency, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) is the EPA\u2019s program for assessment of substances and processes that are widely released into the environment, such as common air pollutants. The NCEA has published 178 risk assessments on subjects from aerosols to watersheds. Public-Health Risk Assessment Until recently, most risk assessments were conducted as a function of environmental regulation. Then the WHO broke new ground in the area of risk assessment with its 2002 World Health Report. 9 A 2009 WHO report updated this 9World Health Organization, The World Health Report 2002: Reducing Risks, Promoting Healthy Life (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2002), www.who .int/whr/2002/en. 100 Dose-Response and Exposure Assessment: How Much for How Long? When animal tests or human studies show a link between exposure to a chemical and an ill effect, the next step is to analyze the relationship between the concentrations of the chemical in the test (the dose) and both the incidence and the severity of the response. This process is called dose-response assessment. The projected effects of different concentrations of the chemical are shown on a dose response curve ( Figure 17\u201319). It is at this point that vulnerability may be introduced; for example, it is known that children are more vulnerable to some cancer-causing chemicals because they are growing. From this information, projections are made about the number of cancers that may develop in a human popula tion exposed to different doses of the chemical. After completing a dose-response assessment, scientists carry out an exposure assessment, which considers the effect of the length of exposure. This procedure involves identifying 8EPA, \u201cExpanded Protections for Subjects in Human Research Studies,\u201d February 16, 2011, http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/guidance/human-test.htm, accessed January 19, 2012. Percentage of population affected 50 0 5 1015 Dose (mg, kg) 0 Figure 17\u201319 Dose response curves. The graph compares the toxicity of two chemicals. The line for each chemical shows the percentage of the population affected at various doses, or concentrations of the chemical. Ed50 is the dose at which 50% of the population is affected. Compound A is more toxic than Compound B, because the dose required for a response is lower. 17.3 Risk Assessment 431 effort. 10 The WHO effort began by looking at all of the risk factors commonly known to be responsible for poor health and mortality and then asking this question: Of all the disease burden in this population, how much could be caused by this [particular] risk? Criteria for Attention. The CDC tracks a number of risk factors in the United States, while the WHO tracks risk factors on a worldwide basis. Certain risk factors have been chosen for special attention, on the basis of the following criteria: The DALY. In addition to mortality, public-health experts consider other measures of public health, including longevity and the prevalence of disabilities. The WHO reports use a measurement called the disability-adjusted life year, or DALY.", "One DALY represents the loss of one healthy year of a person\u2019s life. This measure assesses the burden of a disease in terms of life lost due to premature mortality and time lived with a disability. The WHO reports reveal some remarkable differences in risk factors in different groups of countries ( Table 17\u20134). Stewards of Health. Public-health ministries and agencies are the primary stewards of the health and welfare of a country\u2019s people. In the United States, the prevention of exposure to hazards includes the efforts of agencies such as the EPA. To quote the 2002 World Health Report, \u201cGovernments are the stewards of health resources. This stewardship has been defined as \u2018a function of a government responsible for the welfare of the population and concerned about the trust and legitimacy with which its activities are viewed by the citizenry.\u2019\u201d 11 Governments can accomplish much in the arena of preventive health, but they must nurture their scarce resources carefully. Each risk factor calls for a different suite of interventions. As a country evaluates its highest health risks, it will often have to prioritize its risk-prevention strategies. Risk Management In human health and environmental risk assessment, the analysis of hazards and risks is a task that falls primarily to the scientific community. The task is incomplete, however, if no further consideration is given to the information gathered. Risk management involves (1) a thorough review of the information pertaining to the hazard in question and a risk 10World Health Organization, Global Health Risks 2009: Mortality and Burden of Disease (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2009). 11World Health Organization, World Health Report 2002. (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2002). characterization of that hazard and (2) a decision as to whether the weight of the evidence justifies a regulatory action. Public opinion can play a powerful role in both processes. In general, however, a regulatory decision will hinge on one or more of the following considerations: Risk management has been thoroughly incorporated into the EPA\u2019s policy-making process. Its most common use has been in the design of regulations. The process has enabled the agency to target appropriate hazards for regulation and to determine where to aim the regulations: at the source, at the point of use, or at the point of disposal of the hazardous agent. Policy makers often adopt a particular risk level as a standard against which they can measure new risks. Risk Perception The public\u2019s concern about environmental problems can be traced to the fear of hazards that pose a risk to human life and health. People may perceive that their lives are more hazardous than ever before, but that is not true. In fact, our society is freer from hazards than it ever has been, as is evidenced by increased longevity. Why, then, do people protest against nuclear power plants, waste sites, and pesticide residues in food when, according to experts, these hazards pose extremely small risks? The answer lies in people\u2019s risk perceptions\u2014their intuitive judgments about risks. In short, people\u2019s perceptions are not consistent with the results coming from a scientific analysis of risk. There are some good reasons for this discrepancy\u2014and some lessons to be learned from it. Hazard Versus Outrage. The reason for the inconsistency between public perception and actual risk calculations, according to Peter Sandman of Rutgers University, is that the public perception of risks is often more a matter of outrage than one of hazard. 12 Sandman holds that, while the term hazard expresses primarily a concern for morbidity and mortality, the term outrage expresses a number of additional concerns: The Media\u2019s Role. The public perception of risk is strongly influenced by the media, which are far better at communicating the outrage elements of a risk than they are at communicating the hazard elements. Public concern over mad cow disease received extensive media coverage and had a high \u201coutrage quotient,\u201d and beef from Canada was banned in 2003 when the disease was found in two animals. However, cigarette smoking, which causes 480,000 deaths a year in the United States alone, receives minimal media attention because it is not \u201cnews.\u201d Hence, there is no outrage factor. Indeed, it has been suggested that, if all the year\u2019s smoking fatalities occurred on one day, the media would go ballistic and smoking would be banned the next day! Public Concern and Public Policy. Generally speaking, public concern, rather than cost-benefit analysis or risk-benefit analysis conducted by scientists, often drives public policy.", "The EPA\u2019s funding priorities are set largely by Congress, which is supposed to be responsive to its constituency. 12Peter M. Sandman, \u201cRisky Business,\u201d Rutgers Magazine (April/June 1989): 36\u201337. 13V. Covello and P. Sandman, \u201cRisk Communication, Evolution and Revolution,\u201d in Solutions to an Environment in Peril, ed. A. Wolbarst (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 164\u2013178. Review Questions 433 Unfortunately, if public concern is the primary impetus for public policy, some serious risks may get less attention than they deserve. In particular, environmental concerns are commonly perceived as much less important than they really are because of the public\u2019s preoccupation with other, more immediate issues, such as the economy and jobs. This difference underscores the importance of risk communication, a task that should not be left to the media. For example, the value of ecosystems and their connections to human health and welfare need far greater emphasis in the public consciousness, and this responsibility falls to the scientific and educational communities as well as to government agencies. Studies have shown that the most effective risk communication occurs by starting with what people already know, discovering what they need to know, and then tailoring the message so that it provides people with the knowledge that helps them make a more informed evaluation of risks. To be successful, risk communication should also involve dialogue among all the parties involved\u2014 policy makers, the public, experts, and other interested groups. What are three reasons a person might perceive a risk to be greater than it is? To be less than it is?

Global Climate Change Mohamed Nasheed, then president of the Maldives, stood in front of the delegates to a UN meeting, speaking passionately about how climate change was already affecting his tiny nation. The Maldives is an archipelago of 1,190 islands in the Indian Ocean that some 320,000 people call home. Many of the islands are atolls (ring-shaped islands formed of coral), and others are little more than sandbars. The capital, Mal\u00e9, is a square mile of densely packed buildings surrounded by a seawall. The average elevation in the islands is a mere 1 meter (3 feet) above sea level; recently, seafront erosion has claimed many beaches and some buildings. The Maldives, Nasheed told the assembly, is like the proverbial canary in the coal mine. The impact of rising seas on these small, vulnerable islands should alert the world to an impending crisis. To prompt world action, Nasheed promised that his country would lead the way by becoming carbon neutral by 2020. Like many leaders, he had to help his people adapt to the warming climate and help them make changes to prevent further global effects. Nasheed was working on a sovereign-wealth fund that would enable the Maldivians to purchase land somewhere (India? Sri Lanka?); the fund was to be financed by the nation\u2019s tourism industry. Unfortunately, Nasheed\u2019s tenure was shortened by political unrest, so he was not able to attain all of his lofty goals. Rising Sea Level. Over in the South Pacific, residents of numerous island nations are bracing for the rising sea level that is already submerging parts of their lands. Kiribati and Tuvalu are two island nations whose existence is threatened by environmental changes linked to global warming; as saltwater encroaches on the limited freshwater that supports plant life on the islands, it is likely that the entire populations of these two countries\u2014some 110,000\u2014will, like the Maldivians, be forced to emigrate.

Scientists point out that the populations of these isolated islands will be merely the first wave of climate change refugees unless the global community of nations takes rapid steps to curb the fossil fuel emissions that are largely responsible for global climate change. There is scientific consensus that Earth\u2019s systems are already changing in response to the ever-increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The relentless rise of sea level, now at 3.2 millimeters per year, is accelerating as the oceans continue to warm and ice sheets and glaciers melt. Estimates of the total increase in sea level by the year 2100 range from a low of 26 centimeters to a high of 82 centimeters. 1 The warming climate is also increasing 1IPCC, \u201cSummary for Policymakers,\u201d in Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ed. T. F. Stocker, et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013). 18.1 Atmosphere, Weather, and Climate In 2013, after sifting through thousands of studies about global warming, scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) on climate change, an incredibly detailed and comprehensive study. In this report, the IPCC concluded that the warming of Earth\u2019s climate system is unequivocal. The warming of the globe has a ripple effect that results in an array of changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and land, including increased evaporation and precipitation, higher-energy storms, melting of ice, sea level rise, and other effects that we call climate change. Scientific evidence also indicates that a significant portion of these changes is anthropogenic, or the result of human activities. How can human activities have such a profound effect on global systems? To understand how this is happening, we will begin by examining the factors that control Earth\u2019s climate. the risk of extreme weather events, such as severe storms and droughts. Difficult Choices. We are in the predicament of having to make far-reaching decisions about how to protect ourselves, including the most vulnerable among us, and future generations from dangerous environmental conditions. To make these decisions, we need to understand what is happening with our climate. How do scientists study our climate? Indeed, what controls the climate? To answer these questions, we will first investigate the structure of the atmosphere and how it brings us our weather and climate. Then we will consider the scientific evidence for global climate change and examine projections of future conditions. We will conclude by looking at various actions that can be taken now and in coming decades to address global climate change. Layers of the Atmosphere You can think of the atmosphere-ocean-land system as an enormous weather engine, driven by solar power and strongly affected by the Earth\u2019s rotation and its tilted axis. The interactions of these factors produce the day-to-day changes in the atmosphere called weather as well as the longer-term patterns of Earth\u2019s climates. The atmosphere is a collection of gases that gravity holds in a thin envelope around Earth. Figure 18\u20131 shows the vertical structure of the atmosphere. Table 18\u20131 compares the characteristics of the lowest two layers\u2014the troposphere and the stratosphere. The lowest layer, the troposphere, ranges in thickness from 10 miles (16 km) in the tropics to 5 miles (8 km) in higher latitudes. The gases within the troposphere are responsible for moderating the flow of energy to Earth and are involved with the biogeochemical cycling of many elements and compounds\u2014oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, and water, to name the most crucial ones. This layer contains practically all 18.1 Atmosphere, Weather, and Climate 437 To mesosphere and thermosphere 50 Stratopause Altitude (km) 40 Stratosphere 30 Ozone shield 20 0 \u201350\u201325 025 Temperature (\u00b0C) Figure 18\u20131 Structure and temperature profile of the atmosphere. The diagram on the left shows the layers of the atmosphere and the ozone shield, while the plot on the right shows the vertical temperature profile.", "of the water vapor and clouds in the atmosphere; it is the site and source of our weather. Except for localized temperature inversions, the troposphere gets colder with altitude. Air masses in this layer are well mixed vertically, so pollutants can reach the top within a few days. Substances entering the troposphere\u2014 including pollutants\u2014may be changed chemically and washed back to Earth\u2019s surface by precipitation (Chapter 19). Capping the troposphere is the tropopause, a boundary region where air shifts from cooling with height and begins to warm. Above the tropopause is the stratosphere, a layer within which temperature increases with altitude, up to about 40 miles above the surface of Earth. The temperature increases primarily because the stratosphere contains ozone (O3), a form of oxygen that absorbs high-energy radiation emitted by the Sun. Because there is little vertical mixing of air masses in the stratosphere and no precipitation from it, substances that enter it can remain there for a long time. Beyond the stratosphere are two more layers, the mesosphere and the thermosphere, where the ozone concentration declines and only small amounts of oxygen and nitrogen are found. Weather and Climate The winter of 2015 brought record-breaking cold and snows to New England. Meanwhile the Pacific Northwest was experiencing unusual warmth. On a global scale, the National Climate Data Center reported that February 2015 was the second hottest February on record. That winter an unusually warm mass of Pacific Ocean water was controlling regional winds and altering weather patterns. The difference between local experience and long-term global patterns is the difference between weather and climate. The day-to-day variations in temperature, air pressure, wind, humidity, and precipitation\u2014all mediated by the atmosphere\u2014constitute weather. Weather is variable, short-term, and local, and may not represent larger regional or global trends. In contrast, climate is the average temperature and precipitation expected throughout a typical year in a given region; it is the result of long-term weather patterns in a region, patterns that involve decades or longer (Chapter 5). Climate is controlled by a number of factors including the amount of radiation from the Sun, the tilt of the Earth, the chemistry of the atmosphere, and the movement and mixing of ocean water. The scientific study of the atmosphere\u2014both of weather and of climate\u2014is meteorology. Earth\u2019s Energy Balance Energy from the Sun enters the atmosphere in the form of visible and ultraviolet light (shortwave radiation). It then takes a number of possible courses ( Figure 18\u20132). Some radiation (30%) is reflected by the atmosphere, clouds, and Earth\u2019s surface, but most is absorbed by the atmosphere, oceans, and land, which are heated in the process, producing long-wave, infrared radiation (heat). In the atmosphere, energy can be absorbed and interact with molecules of gases that bounce it back and forth before it is reradiated into space. If there were no atmosphere, Earth would be very cold because nothing would trap the energy from the Sun; heat would quickly be lost to space. Instead, molecules in the atmosphere trap energy by bouncing it in different directions; some of this energy bounces back and forth between the atmosphere and the surface of the land and water. This energy warms the Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere. This natural process is called the greenhouse effect. A similar process occurs in a car on a sunny day. When the car\u2019s windows are closed, sunlight coming in through the windows is absorbed by the car\u2019s seats and other interior surfaces. This light energy is converted into heat energy, which is given off in the form of infrared radiation. The infrared radiation is blocked by glass, so it cannot leave the car. The trapped heat energy causes the interior air temperature to rise. Forcing Factors. How warm the atmosphere becomes depends on the interactions of internal factors such as the oceans, the gaseous makeup of the atmosphere, snow cover, and sea ice, as well as external factors such as solar radiation, the Earth\u2019s rotation, and slow changes in our planet\u2019s orbit. Radiative forcing is the influence that any particular factor has on the energy balance of the atmosphere-ocean-land system. The effect of a forcing factor can be positive, leading to warming, or negative, leading to cooling. Forcing is expressed in units of watts per square meter (W/m2); averaged over the entire planet, solar radiation entering the atmosphere is about 340 W/m2. It is this radiation that is acted on by the various forcing factors. Greenhouse Gases.", "Water vapor, CO2, and certain other gases in the atmosphere serve as positive forcing factors. These gases play a role analogous to that of the windows in our car, or the glass roof in a greenhouse, hence the term greenhouse gases. Light energy that comes through the atmosphere is absorbed and converted to heat energy at the planet\u2019s surface. The infrared heat energy radiates back upward through the atmosphere and into space. The greenhouse gases in the troposphere absorb some of the infrared radiation and reradiate it back toward the surface; other gases (N2 and O2) in the troposphere do not. This greenhouse effect was first recognized in 1827 by the French scientist Jean-Baptiste Fourier and is now firmly established. The greenhouse gases are like a heat blanket, insulating Earth and delaying the loss of infrared energy (heat) to space. Without this insulation, average surface temperatures on Earth would be about -19\u00b0C instead of +14\u00b0C, and life as we know it would be impossible. Therefore, our global climate depends on Earth\u2019s concentrations of greenhouse gases. If these concentrations increase or decrease significantly, their influence as positive forcing agents will change, and our climate will change accordingly. Cooling Processes. Earth\u2019s atmosphere is also subject to negative forcing factors. For example, on average, clouds cover 50% of Earth\u2019s surface and reflect some 20% of solar radiation into space before it ever reaches the ground. The reflectivity of a surface to sunlight is called albedo. The albedo of the planet as a whole prevents a certain amount of warming in the first place. Clouds. The albedo effect of thick, low-lying clouds can be readily appreciated if you think of what happens when a large cloud passes between you and the Sun. The radiation that was heating you and your surroundings is suddenly intercepted higher up in the atmosphere, and you feel cooler. In contrast, high, wispy clouds have a positive forcing effect, absorbing some of the solar radiation and releasing some infrared radiation. Recent work indicates that the current net impact of clouds is a slightly positive forcing. The Cryosphere. Snow, glaciers, ice sheets, and sea ice (the cryosphere) reflect sunlight, contributing to the planetary albedo and cooling the planet. Arctic warming has reduced this effect in recent decades, as open water and darker, unfrozen ground absorb more sunlight than ice and snow. Aerosols. Aerosols are microscopic liquid or solid particles originating from land and water surfaces (Chapters 10, 19). Scientists have found that industrial aerosols (from ground-level pollution) play a significant role in canceling out some of the warming from greenhouse gases. Sulfates, nitrates, dust, and soot from industrial sources and forest fires enter the atmosphere and react with compounds there to form a high-level aerosol haze. This haze reflects and scatters some sunlight; the aerosols also contribute to the formation of clouds, which likewise increase the planetary albedo. Sooty aerosols (from fires) have an overall warming effect, but industrial sulfate aerosols create substantial cooling, mainly through their tendency to increase global cloud cover. Volcanoes. Volcanic activity can also lead to planetary cooling. When Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted in 18.1 Atmosphere, Weather, and Climate 439 1991, some 20 million tons of particles and aerosols entered the atmosphere, causing a significant drop in global temperature as radiation was reflected and scattered away. This global cooling effect lasted until the volcanic debris was finally cleansed from the atmosphere by chemical change and deposition, a process that took several years. Some sulfate aerosols from volcanic sources enter the stratosphere, where they have a longer-term cooling effect; these aerosols have increased since 2000, effectively reducing some of the global warming that otherwise might have occurred. 2 Solar Variability. Because the Sun is the source of radiant energy that heats Earth, any variability in the Sun\u2019s radiation reaching Earth is likely to influence the climate. Direct monitoring of solar irradiance goes back only a few decades, but it has confirmed that there is an 11-year cycle involving solar radiation increases during times of high sunspot activity. Sunspots are known to block cosmic ray intensity, and because cosmic rays help seed clouds, the diminished cloud cover allows more solar radiation to reach Earth\u2019s surface. Variations in solar forcing are thought to be partly responsible for the warming trend in the early 20th century. The Net Result . . .", "Global atmospheric temperatures are a balance between the positive and negative forcing from natural causes (natural greenhouse gases, clouds, volcanoes, solar irradiance) and anthropogenic causes (sulfate aerosols, soot, ozone, increases in greenhouse gases). The net result varies, depending on one\u2019s location. The various forcing agents bring us year-to-year fluctuations in climate and make it difficult to attribute any one event or extreme season to human causation. Moving Air Some of the energy that is released from Earth\u2019s surface is transferred to the atmosphere. Thus, air masses grow warmer at the surface of Earth and tend to expand, becoming lighter. The lighter air then rises, creating vertical air currents. On a large scale, this movement creates major convection currents (Chapter 10, Figure 10\u20135). Air must flow in to replace the rising warm air, and the inflow leads to horizontal airflows, or wind. The ultimate source of the horizontal flow is cooler, denser air that sinks, gains heat, and reduces relative humidity as it descends. Global Convection Cells. The natural movement of air that derives from the uneven heating of Earth\u2019s surface at different latitudes produces the large-scale convection cells called the Hadley cells (Figure 10\u20135). These major flows of air create regions of high rainfall (equatorial) and deserts (25\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 north and south of the equator). Together with the rotation of the Earth, the Hadley cells produce the prevailing easterly and westerly winds in different areas of the globe. Local Convection Currents. On a smaller scale, convection currents bring us the day-to-day changes in our weather. 2S. Solomon et al., \u201cThe Persistently Variable \u2018Background\u2019 Stratospheric Aerosol Layer and Global Climate Change,\u201d Science 333, no. 6044 (2011): 866\u201370, doi:10.1126/science.1206027. Figure 18\u20133 A convection cell. Driven by solar energy, convection cells produce the main components of our weather as evaporation and condensation occur in rising air and precipitation results, followed by the sinking of dry air. This process moves masses of air poleward. Combined with the rotation of Earth, these movements produce global winds. Heat release as infrared radiation Low High pressure pressure Cool, dry air Heat release Sinks Warm, and warms humid air Warm, dry Flows toward low pressure air Picks up moisture, heats up High Low pressure pressure Moist surface warmed by solar radiation Weather reports inform us of regions of high and low pressure, but where do these come from? Rising air (due to solar heating) creates high pressure up in the atmosphere, leaving behind a region of lower pressure close to Earth. Conversely, once the moist, high-pressure air has cooled by reradiating heat to space and losing heat through condensation (thereby generating precipitation), it flows horizontally toward regions of sinking, cool, dry air (where the pressure is lower). There the air is warmed at the surface and creates a region of higher pressure ( Figure 18\u20133). The differences in pressure lead to airflows, which are the winds we experience. Winds tend to flow from high-pressure regions toward low-pressure regions. Jet Streams. The large-scale air movements of Hadley cells are influenced by Earth\u2019s rotation from west to east. This creates the trade winds and the general flow of weather from west to east in temperate regions. Higher in the troposphere, Earth\u2019s rotation and air-pressure gradients generate veritable rivers of air, called jet streams, that flow eastward at speeds of more than 300 mph and meander considerably. Jet streams are able to steer major air masses in the lower troposphere. One example is the polar jet stream, which steers cold air masses into North America when it dips downward in latitude. Put Together . . . Air masses of different temperatures and pressures meet at boundaries we call fronts, which are regions of rapid weather change. Other movements of air masses due to differences in pressure and temperature include hurricanes and typhoons and local, but very destructive, tornadoes. There are also major seasonal airflows called monsoons, which are created by major differences in cooling and heating between oceans and continents. The summer monsoons of the Indian subcontinent are famous for the beneficial rains they bring and notorious for the devastating floods that can occur when the rains are heavy. Putting these movements all together\u2014the general atmospheric circulation patterns and the resulting precipitation, the wind and weather systems generating them, and finally the rotation of Earth and the tilt of the planet on its axis, which creates the seasons\u2014yields the general patterns of climate that characterize different regions of the world, and ultimately, the biomes and ecosystems in each region.", "Oceans, Atmosphere, and Climate More than two-thirds of Earth is covered by oceans, making ours mostly a water planet. Because we live on land, it is hard for us to imagine the dominant role the oceans play in determining both our weather and climate. Nevertheless, the oceans are the major source of water for the hydrologic cycle and the main source of heat entering the atmosphere. The evaporation of ocean water supplies the atmosphere with water vapor, and when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses, it supplies the atmosphere with heat\u2014the latent heat of condensation ( Figure 10\u20134). The oceans also play a vital role in climate because of their innate heat capacity\u2014their ability to absorb energy when water is heated. Indeed, the entire heat capacity of the atmosphere is equal to that of just the top 3 meters of ocean water. It is this property that makes the climate in coastal areas milder than that in areas inland. Finally, through the movement of currents, the oceans convey heat energy throughout the globe. Thermohaline Circulation. Large-scale ocean currents are driven by a pattern of thermohaline circulation, where thermohaline refers to the effects that temperature (thermo-) and salinity (-haline) have on the density of seawater. This pattern, called the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), is like a giant, complex conveyor belt, moving water masses from the surface to deep oceans and back again ( Figure 18\u20134). A key part of this circulation is in the high-latitude North Atlantic, where salty water from the Gulf Stream moves northward on the surface and is cooled by Arctic air currents. This cooling increases the density of the water. As water evaporates, the salinity of the surface water increases, a process that also increases its density. Eventually the denser water sinks to depths of up to 4,000 meters, forming the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). This cold, deep-water current spreads southward through the Atlantic to the southern tip of Africa, where it is joined by cold Antarctic waters. Together, the two streams spread northward into the Indian and Pacific Oceans as deep currents. Gradually, the currents slow down and warm, becoming less dense and welling up to the surface, where they are further warmed and begin to move as surface waters back again toward the North Atlantic. This movement transfers enormous quantities of heat toward Europe, Shallow ocean currents Rising ocean currents Deep ocean currents Descending ocean currents Figure 18\u20134 The Meridional Overturning Circulation. Salty water flowing to the North Atlantic is cooled and sinks, forming the North Atlantic Deep Water system. This deep flow extends southward and is joined by Antarctic water, whereupon it extends into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Surface currents then proceed in the opposite direction, returning the water to the North Atlantic. (Source: Adapted from Figure 3.15 from Our Changing Planet, 2nd ed., by Fred T. MacKenzie.

The circulation of ocean water is actually more complex than the simple conveyor-belt model. Eddies and oceanic winds inject and subtract water masses at many points in the overall circulation. Yet it is clear that the turnover does occur\u2014sinking at the poles forms deep waters, and warm water does return northward to affect the climate of northern Europe. If large amounts of cold freshwater (from ice melt or precipitation) were to enter Arctic waters, the thermohaline circulation could slow or stop; fortunately, there is scant evidence that such an event is likely to occur. Ocean-Atmosphere Oscillations. Regional weather is notoriously erratic on time scales from a few days to decades. Studies of a number of ocean-atmosphere processes\u2014processes that produce erratic weather on a global scale\u2014have provided new insights into natural climate variability. These processes are becoming better understood, and are beginning to provide explanations for some previously puzzling developments. One such process is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), in which atmospheric pressure centers switch back and forth across the Atlantic, altering the patterns of winds and storms. Researchers have found evidence that a mid-century cooling was the result of shifting ocean circulation linked to the NAO. There is also a warm-cool cycle, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), that swings back and forth across the Pacific over periods of several decades.", "In the El Ni/La Ni Southern Oscillation (ENSO), major shifts in atmospheric pressure over the central equatorial Pacific Ocean lead to a reversal of the trade winds. El Nis tend to encourage warming, while La Nis do the opposite. Incredibly, these reversals dominate the weather over much of the planet, and their effects can last for a year or two. The 1997\u20132000 ENSO was the most intense of recent decades, spawning powerful global weather patterns that caused more than $36 billion in damages and more than 22,000 deaths. The year 2010 had a strong El Ni, but 2011 was a strong La Ni year, with corresponding warmer and cooler global temperatures. In the following years, these cycles declined. CONCEPT CHECK What two processes increase the density of ocean water in the North Atlantic? How does this higher density affect the movement of ocean water? \u2610\u2713 18.2 The Science of Climate Change Over Earth\u2019s long history, global and regional climates have changed many times. Today, however, the best evidence tells us that climates are being changed by human actions. Scientists have concluded that the atmosphere is warmer, the oceans are warmer, there is more precipitation, there are more extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and heat waves, glaciers are melting, and the sea level is rising. The IPCC report stated that it is very likely (a 90\u2013100% probability) that most of the warming is caused by increased Parts per million ATMOSPHERIC CO2 AT MAUNA LOA OBSERVATORY 400 380 360 340 320 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Year Figure 18\u20135 Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere fluctuates between winter and summer because of seasonal variation in photosynthesis. The average concentration is increasing due to human activities\u2014in particular, burning fossil fuels and deforestation. (Source: NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, 2011.) concentrations of anthropogenic (human-made) greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The most significant anthropogenic greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2), which has risen by 40%\u2014from 280 parts per million (ppm) to over 400 ppm\u2014 since the Industrial Revolution began, much of it since 1960 ( Figure 18\u20135). The source of this added CO2 is no surprise: Most of it comes from burning fossil fuels, although some also comes from agricultural wastes, deforestation, and other sources. Let\u2019s examine how the IPCC reached these conclusions. How to Get Expert Information The scientific investigation of climate change is a worldwide endeavor involving thousands of scientists. Climatologists, the scientists who study climate, study the atmosphere, but they also study ocean currents, ice, rocks, and other natural features to find evidence of the many processes that determine climate. Because the field of climate change is relatively young and because new technologies are being invented that allow us to measure temperatures and other factors more precisely and to model complex climate systems more accurately, the field is exciting and ever changing. The large scale of this endeavor means that it requires funding from governments and tracking across national boundaries. As the evidence of climate change began to grow, the scientific community realized that there was a critical need for climate research to be consolidated and synthesized so scientists around the world could access consistent and accurate data. In response to this need, the UN Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Society established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. The mission of the IPCC has been to provide accurate information that will lead to an understanding of human-induced climate change. The work of the IPCC has been guided by two basic questions: Risk assessment\u2014How much is the climate system changing, and how do the changes affect society and ecosystems? Risk management\u2014How can we manage the climate system through adaptation and mitigation? The IPCC has three working groups: one to assess the scientific issues (Working Group I), another to evaluate the impact of global climate change and the prospects for adapting to it (Working Group II), and a third to investigate ways of mitigating the effects (Working Group III). 3 The latest IPCC assessment working groups consist of more than 850 authors and review editors representing 85 countries. These experts are unpaid and participate at the cost of their own research and other professional activities. The IPCC reports contain user-friendly summaries that are useful places to start reading. They also contain much longer reviews of all the scientific literature and are a valuable tool for those wanting more detailed information.", "The IPCC released the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) during 2013\u2013 2014. Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report was the final volume, and contained key findings of the working groups. There are other places to look for expert information. In 2014, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the largest professional scientific society in the United States, released a report on climate change entitled What We Know. 4 Written for the public, this short report addresses many of the concepts in the longer IPCC report. Many of the concepts are also covered in the National Climate Assessment 3, published by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. 5 The following discussion of climate change makes use of the reports from the IPCC and other expert groups. We begin with a look into the past, which harbors \u201crecords\u201d of climate change. Climates in the Past Searching the past for evidence of climate change is a major scientific enterprise, one that becomes more difficult the farther into the past we try to search. Systematic records of the factors making up weather, including temperature, precipitation, and storms, have been kept for little more than 130 years. Nevertheless, these records clearly inform us that our climate is far from constant. The record of surface temperatures, from weather stations around the world and from literally millions of observations of temperatures at the surface of the sea, tells an interesting story (Figure 18\u20136). Since 1880, the global average temperature has shown periods of cooling and warming. During the 20th century, two warming trends occurred, one from 1910 to 1945 3See, for example, Susan Solomon et al., Eds., Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007). 4Mario Molina et al., What We Know: The Reality, Risks and Response to Climate Change (Washington, DC: AAAS, 2014). 5J.

This was followed by the \u201cLittle Ice Age,\u201d between AD 1400 and 1850. Additional proxies include tree rings, pollen deposits, changes in landscapes, marine sediments, corals, and ice cores. Some recent research on ice cores has provided a startling view of a global climate that oscillates according to several cycles. This work has also afforded evidence that remarkable changes in the climate can occur within as little as a few decades. Ice cores in Greenland and the Antarctic have been analyzed for thickness and gas content, especially the content of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), two greenhouse gases. Ice cores have also been tested for the relative proportions of the isotopes of certain elements; isotopes are forms of an element in which the atoms have more or less than the usual number of neutrons. Isotopes of oxygen, as well as isotopes of hydrogen, behave differently at different tempera tures when condensed in clouds and incorporated into ice. (Source: National Climatic Data Center, 2015) and a second from 1976 until the present. In each decade since 1976, the global average temperature has increased an average of 0.28\u00b0C (0.50\u00b0F) over land and 0.11\u00b0C (0.20\u00b0F) over the ocean. Every year since 1976 has had an average global temperature higher than the long-term global average. Further Back. Observations on climatic changes can be extended much further back in time with the use of proxies\u2014 measurable records that can provide data on factors such as temperature, ice cover, and precipitation. For example, historical accounts suggest that the Northern Hemisphere enjoyed a 400 380 360 The long-term record based on these analyses indicates that Earth\u2019s climate has oscillated between ice ages and warm periods (Figure 18\u20137a) . During major ice ages, huge amounts of water were tied up in glaciers and ice sheets, and the sea level was lower by as much as 400 feet (120 m).", "Ice cores from Antarctica show eight glacial periods and eight interglacial periods over the past 800,000 years. During the glacial periods, temperatures and greenhouse gases were low; during the warm interglacial periods, just the opposite was true. The greenhouse gas and temperature data match exactly. Carbon dioxide levels ranged between 150 and 280 ppm.

These periodic oscillations, called Milankovitch cycles (after the Serbian scientist who first described them), take place at intervals of 100,000, 41,000, and 23,000 years. Rapid Changes. Superimposed on the major oscillations is a record of rapid climatic fluctuations during periods of glaciation and warmer times (Figure 18\u20137b) . One such rapid change, called the Younger Dryas event (Dryas is a genus of Arctic flower), occurred toward the end of the last ice age. Earth had been warming up for 6,000 years and then plunged again into 1,150 years of cold weather. At the end of this event, 11,700 years ago, Arctic temperatures rose 7\u00b0C in 50 years. The impact on living systems must have been enormous. One of the reasons scientists study ancient climates is to figure out whether such rapid changes could occur today. Scientists hypothesize the Younger Dryas event may have been triggered by a change in ocean currents, volcanoes, or an impact or giant burst of air from a near-Earth comet. It is still difficult to know whether such dramatic change is likely in our future. Evidence of Climate Change Today There is much natural variation in weather from year to year, and local temperatures do not necessarily follow globally averaged ones. Since the mid-1970s, the average global temperature has risen about 0.6\u00b0C (1.1\u00b0F), almost 0.2\u00b0C per decade ( Figure 18\u20136). The warming is happen ing everywhere, but is greatest at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Because of the continued increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the observed warming is considered to be the consequence of an enhanced greenhouse effect. Ocean Heat Content. The upper 3,000 meters of the ocean have warmed measurably since 1955, a warming that dwarfs the observed warming of the atmosphere, accounting for 90% of the heat increase of Earth systems in the past several decades. In a key analysis of Earth\u2019s energy imbalance, researchers found that at the end of the 20th century, heat was stored near the surface of the ocean. 6 By the first decade and a half of the 21st century, that heat had moved to lower layers in the Atlantic and southern oceans, making the warming at the surface of the ocean less dramatic. Over the past decade, the ocean has absorbed essentially all of the heat not yet seen in the atmosphere. A fascinating story about the measurement of ocean heat content is described in Sound Science, Getting It Right. This ocean\u2019s absorption of heat energy has long-term and short-term consequences. One long-term consequence is the impact of this stored heat as it eventually comes into equilibrium with the atmosphere, raising temperatures over land and in the atmosphere even more.

Used with permission.) consequence is the rise in sea level that occurs because of thermal expansion. Sea level rose about 15 cm (6 inches) during the 20th century, a rate of 1.5 millimeters per year. It is now rising more rapidly, at a rate of 3.2 millimeters per year (Figure 18\u20138) . About half of this rise is due to thermal expansion, and the remainder results from the melting of glaciers and ice caps. The IPCC AR5 documents a general loss of land ice as glaciers and ice caps have thinned and melted. Sea ice is also melting. However, because it is already floating on the ocean, melting sea ice does not cause the sea level to rise, except through thermal expansion. Significantly, historical sea level data indicate that the sea level was relatively stable until 100 years ago; the modern rise in sea level is a new phenomenon that is consistent with the known pattern of anthropogenic climate warming. Other Observed Changes. The IPCC AR5, the National Climate Assessment, and other reports document a number of recent changes, all of which are consistent with the picture of climate change caused by an increase in greenhouse gases. Many of these changes are listed here; note that most of them have potentially serious consequences for human and natural systems. 18.2 The Science of Climate Change 445 (a) EXTENT OF SEA ICE, SEPTEMBER, 2014 was in 2012\u20132013.

But in doing so, the oceans are experiencing a decrease in pH, a process known as ocean acidification (Chapter 20 ). Although the decrease is only about 0.1 pH unit to date, there is serious concern about the future state of seawater pH in light of continued anthropogenic CO2 production. At some level, ocean acidification will make the warm oceans inhospitable to coral reefs; the coral animals depend on an equilibrium for carbon minerals that is affected by acidic conditions. The bottom line: Human use of fossil fuels has begun to change not only the temperature, but also the chemistry of the surface oceans. Given the accumulating evidence that the climate is changing and that the change is already causing an array of changes in biological, physical, and chemical systems on Earth, it is time to consider the causes of these changes in more detail. Rising Greenhouse Gases According to the IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report, \u201cIt is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.\u201d 7 Greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to increase. 8 The most important of these anthropogenic greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon Dioxide.", "More than 100 years ago, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius reasoned that differences in 7R. K. Pachauri and A. Reisinger, eds., Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report (contribution of Working Groups I, II, and III to the Fifth Assessment, Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, Geneva, Switzerland, 2014). 8S. A. Montzka et al., \u201cNon-CO2 Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change,\u201d Nature 476 (August 4, 2011): 43\u201350. CO2 levels in the atmosphere could greatly affect Earth\u2019s energy budget. Arrhenius suggested that, in time, the burning of fossil fuels might change the atmospheric CO2 concentration, though he believed that it would take centuries before the associated warming would be noticeable. He was not concerned about the impacts of this warming, arguing that such an increase would be beneficial. (He lived in Sweden!) Monitoring Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide. How do scientists know that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is rising? In 1958, Charles Keeling began measuring CO2 levels on Mauna Loa, in Hawaii. Measurements there have been recorded continuously, and they reveal a striking increase in atmospheric levels of the gas ( Figure 18\u20135). The concentrations increased exponentially until the energy crisis in the mid-1970s, rose at a rate of 1.5 ppm/year for several decades, and in the 2000s began rising at a rate of 2.0 ppm/year and higher. The data also reveal an annual oscillation of 5\u20137 ppm, which reflects seasonal changes of photosynthesis and respiration in terrestrial ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere. When respiration predominates (late fall through spring), CO2 levels rise; when photosynthesis predominates (late spring through early fall), CO2 levels fall. Most salient, however, is the relentless rise in CO2. As of the end of 2014, atmospheric CO2 levels were at 400 ppm, 40% higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution and higher than they have been for more than 800,000 years (Figure 18\u20137a). Thus, our insulat ing blanket is thickening, and it is reasonable to expect that this will have a warming effect. Sources of Carbon Dioxide. As Arrhenius suggested, the obvious place to look for the source of increasing CO2 levels is our use of fossil fuels. Every kilogram of fossil carbon burned produces 3.7 kilograms of CO2 that enters the atmosphere (each carbon atom in the fuel picks up two oxygen atoms in the course of burning and becoming CO2). In 2013, almost 10 billion metric tons (gigatons, or Gt) of fossil fuel carbon (GtC) was released, an annual increase ESTIMATES OF GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL-SOURCES OF CARBON EMISSIONS FUEL COMBUSTION AND CEMENT MANUFACTURE 10,000 Asia and Oceana 49% North America 18% 9,000 8,000 1850 1870 1890 1910 1930 1950 1970 1990 2010 Million Metric Tons of Carbon 7,000 Europe 17% Middle East 6% 6,000 Central and South America 4% 5,000 Africa 3% 4,000 Aviation and marine shipping 3% 3,000 2,000 Figure 18\u201312 Sources of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil 1,000 fuel burning.

Year (Source: Data from U.S. Energy Information Administration, December 2014.) Figure 18\u201311 Global carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Data from 1850 to 2013, from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC). The rise in last two decades is conspicuous. (Source: CDIAC, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 2014.) of 2.5% (Figure 18\u201311) . This carbon was added to the atmosphere as CO2. About half of this CO2 comes from industrialized countries; about 5% comes from cement production and is usually included in figures reported for fossil fuel emissions (Figure 18\u201312) . Carbon dioxide is estimated to account for about 20% of greenhouse warming, at current levels. Climate change skeptics sometimes claim that much of the new CO2 comes from natural sources. This claim can be put to rest by considering the 14C signature of atmospheric CO2. 14C is a radioactive isotope of carbon that is formed in the atmosphere by the bombardment of nitrogen atoms by cosmic rays; it decays over time to form nitrogen atoms. Fossil fuels contain no 14C because of radioactive decay (the half-life of 14C is 5,730 years). If significant amounts of CO2 originating from fossil fuel combustion are added to the atmosphere, the 14C in the atmosphere should be declining, and it clearly is ( Figure 18\u201313). It is estimated that land use changes such as deforestain direct contact with the atmosphere.", "(Deep ocean layers do mix with the upper layers, but the mixing time is more than 1,000 years.) And, as the oceans acidify (because they are absorbing CO2), their capacity to continue this absorption will diminish. The seasonal swings illustrated in Figure 18\u20135 show that biota can influence atmospheric CO2 levels. Measurements indicate that terrestrial ecosystems also serve as carbon sinks. Indeed, these land ecosystems apparently have stored a net 15%, a figure that includes the losses from deforestation. As a result, terrestrial ecosystems, and especially forests, are increasingly valued for their ability to sequester carbon. A simple model of the major dynamic pools and fluxes of carbon is presented in Figure 18\u201314. Other Greenhouse Gases. Water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) also absorb CLEAN AIR MEASUREMENTS AT NIWOT RIDGE, COLORADO 80 tion add another 0.9 GtC annually to the carbon already 70 coming from fossil fuel combustion. Over the past 50 years, the release of carbon from the use of fossil fuels and defores tation has more than tripled. Fortunately, sinks remove more than half of these annual carbon emissions. Carbon Sinks. Careful calculations show that if all the CO2 emitted from burning fossil fuels accumulated in the atmosphere, the concentration would rise by 3 ppm or Observed change in 14C 60 50 40 30 more per year, not the actual 2 ppm charted in Figure 18\u20135. Thus, there must be carbon sinks that absorb CO2 and keep it from accumulating at a more rapid rate in the atmosphere. There is broad agreement that the oceans serve as a sink for about 30% of the CO2 emitted; some of this is due to the uptake of CO2 by phytoplankton, and some is a consequence of the undersaturation of CO2 in seawater. There are limitations to the ocean\u2019s ability to absorb CO2, however, because only the top 300 meters of the ocean are 20 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 Year Figure 18\u201313 14C trend in the atmosphere. The change in 14C is the ratio of 14C to normal 12C. The smaller the ratio, the fewer 14C atoms are in the air. The decreasing trend is due to 14C depleted CO2 emitted from burning fossil fuels.

Most of these gases are increasing in concentration, raising the concern that future warming will extend well beyond the calculated effects of CO2 alone. Water Vapor and Clouds. Water as vapor (a gas) or in clouds (an aerosol) absorbs infrared energy and is the most abundant greenhouse gas. Water vapor accounts for about 50% of the greenhouse effect, and clouds an additional 20%. Although water vapor plays an important role in the greenhouse effect, its concentration in the troposphere is quite variable. Through evaporation and precipitation (the hydrologic cycle), water undergoes rapid turnover in the lower atmo sphere (see Chapter 10). In the last several decades, however, meteorologists have found a general increase in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. Methane. Methane (CH4) is the third-most-important greenhouse gas. A molecule of methane is 25 times more effective at absorbing infrared radiation than is a molecule of CO2 (Chapter 14 ). In natural ecosystems, methane is a byproduct of the microbial fermentation of plant material, largely in wetlands; it is also generated by the microbial digestion of plant material in the stomachs of ruminants. Anthropogenic sources of methane include livestock (particularly cattle, which are ruminants), manure, rice cultivation, landfills, coal mines, and the production and transmission of natural gas. Although methane is gradually destroyed in reactions with other gases in the atmosphere, it is being added to the atmosphere faster than it can be broken down. Like CO2, methane is more abundant than it has been for at least the past 800,000 years. Nitrous Oxide. Nitrous oxide (N2O) levels have increased some 19% during the past 200 years and are still rising at a rate of 0.7 ppb per year ( Chapters 12 , 14).", "Sources of the gas include agriculture, the oceans, and the burning of biomass; lesser quantities come from industry and the burning of fossil fuels. N2O is produced in agriculture via anaerobic denitrification processes, which occur wherever high levels of nitrogen (a major component of fertilizers) are available in soils (see Chapter 3 ). The buildup of N2O is particularly unwelcome because its long residence time (114 years) makes the gas a problem not only in the troposphere, where it contributes to warming, but also in the stratosphere, where it contributes to the destruction of ozone. Ozone. Depending on its location in the atmosphere, ozone (O3) can have either a warming or cooling effect. In the troposphere, ozone acts as a greenhouse gas, but in the stratosphere it has a cooling effect. However, the warming effect predominates. The greatest source of tropospheric ozone is anthropogenic, through the action of sunlight on pollutants (Chapter 19). Major sources are automotive traf fic and burning forests and agricultural wastes. Scientists estimate that the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere has increased 36% since 1750. CFCs and Other Halocarbons. Emissions of halocarbons (Chapter 19) are entirely anthropogenic. Like nitrous oxide, halocarbons are long lived and contribute to both global warming in the troposphere and ozone destruction in the stratosphere. Used as refrigerants, solvents, and fire retardants, some halocarbons have 10,000 times the capacity to absorb infrared radiation that CO2 does. The rate of production of halocarbons has declined due to adherence to the Montreal Protocol, and the concentration of halocarbons in the troposphere began declining in 1990 and is now only one-tenth of its former level. The Atmosphere\u2019s Control Knob. A report from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies examined the role of the different greenhouse gases in maintaining temperatures on Earth. 9 Water vapor, which contributes the lion\u2019s share of the greenhouse effect, readily condenses and can be removed from the atmosphere. In contrast, CO2 and the other noncondensing gases are the essential components of global warming because their \u201cforcing\u201d role sustains the current levels of water vapor and clouds. Without the stability of these noncondensing greenhouse gases, the water vapor and clouds could not maintain our current greenhouse conditions. Thus, CO2, because it is the most abundant noncondensing gas, is the key gas, the \u201ccontrol knob\u201d that governs Earth\u2019s temperature. Changes in Other Forcing Factors Human activities also affect several other forcing factors. For example, the aerosols in air pollution have a cooling effect because they reflect the Sun\u2019s radiation. Because human activities are releasing more than double the amount of sulfate that is coming from natural sources, its effect is substantial and persistent. Climatologists estimate that the cooling effect of these pollutants has counteracted much of the potential global warming in recent decades. Progress in curbing industrial pollutants in the United States and Europe has caused the impact of anthropogenic aerosols to decline over those regions. However, industrial growth in China and India has created a major rise in aerosols over Asia, causing cooling there. Black soot from anthropogenic sources, largely fires and exhaust from diesel engines, reduces the albedo of the cryosphere, including glaciers and ice sheets. By darkening snow and ice, soot promotes the absorption of radiant energy rather than its reflection. Changes in land use, such as deforestation, also affect albedo. Solar radiation also varies over time, and increases are thought to contribute to global warming. Figure 18\u201315 shows our understanding of the relative impacts of the various radiative forcing factors. Positive forcing factors include a variety of greenhouse gases and black carbon on snow, which decreases the albedo, or reflectivity of Earth\u2019s surface. Ozone in the troposphere is a positive forcing factor, but ozone in the stratosphere is a negative forcing factor. It is evident that the effect of anthropogenic forcing is far greater than the effect of natural changes in solar radiation. What human activities are the major sources of CO2 emissions? What other human activities contrib 9Andrew A.

The International Energy Agency projects a growing demand for fossil fuels as populations and economies grow. If global fossil fuel use continues on its present trajectory, emissions of greenhouse gases will increase 35% by 2030. By 2050, emissions will increase 100%. Given the huge reserves of coal, ample supplies of natural gas, and remaining oil reserves, there is no reason to doubt this projection. However, it is clear that commitment to this future use of fossil fuels also will commit us to greater changes in climate. How much change, and when, would be a matter of guesswork if it were not for the use of climate models. Modeling Global Climate Computer models are essential tools for exploring Earth\u2019s weather and climate. Modern weather forecasting employs powerful computers that are capable of handling large amounts of atmospheric data and applying mathematical equations to model the processes taking place in the atmosphere, oceans, and land. Forecasts of conditions for 72 hours model Earth\u2019s weather. Climatologists employ similarly powerful computers to explore Earth\u2019s climate. Their computer models combine global atmospheric circulation patterns with ocean circulation, radiation feedback from clouds, and land surface processes to produce atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) that are capable of simulating long-term climatic conditions. Climatologists use AOGCMs to explore the potential effects of rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. How accurate are these AOGCMs? The best test of such models is the degree to which they can simulate the present-day climate. One study compared some 50 climate models developed over the past two decades, concluding that the most recent models have reached an unprecedented level of realism. 10 AOGCMs are now able to reproduce changes in surface temperatures over continents and over time scales of decades. The models used for the IPCC AR5 are able to model the effects of large volcanoes accurately as well. Yet while these models can present global patterns realistically, the details of regional changes from these models are very uncertain. Figure 18\u201316 contrasts the data generated by computer models with actual data for the period from 1860 to 2010. Note that models using anthropogenic forcing factors are much closer to the actual measurements, showing the impact of human activities on the climate. 10Thomas Reichler and Junsu Kim, \u201cHow Well Do Coupled Models Simulate Today\u2019s Climate?\u201d Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society 89, No. 3 (March 2008): 303\u2013331. 1.5\u00b0C 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) (2.7\u00b0F) 1.0\u00b0C 1.0\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) (1.8\u00b0F) Temperature anomaly Temperature anomaly 0.5\u00b0C (0.9\u00b0F) 0.5\u00b0C (0.9\u00b0F) 0\u00b0C 0\u00b0C (0\u00b0F) (0\u00b0F) \u20130.5\u00b0C (\u20130.9\u00b0F) \u20130.5\u00b0C (\u20130.9\u00b0F) 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 Year Year (a) (b) Figure 18\u201316 Comparing results of computer models with actual data.

Pearson: London, 68\u201369) Different Pathways to 2100 Climatologists use AOGCMs to project how changing concentrations of greenhouse gases will affect the climate in the 21st century and beyond. In IPCC AR5, researchers investigated scenarios representing four different sets of assumptions about the level of anthropogenic emissions. These scenarios, called representative concentration pathways (RPCs), projected significantly different levels of radiative forcing by the year 2100. (Recall that radiative forcing is the amount of additional energy taken up by Earth\u2019s system as a result of changes to the greenhouse effect, expressed in watts per square meter, W/m2.) The RCP representing the lowest increase in the emissions of greenhouse gases projected that radiative forcing in 2100 would be 2.6 W/m2 more than preindustrial levels.", "The other three scenarios projected additional radiative forcing of 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 W/m2. All four scenarios projected a rise in CO2 concentrations and a corresponding rise in mean global temperature. Figure 18\u201317 compares the world of today with the expected outcomes of RCP 2.6 W/m2 and 8.5 W/m2 by the year 2100. RCP 2.6 assumes that we keep greenhouse gas emissions very low. To reach no higher than that level, we would need to stop increasing emissions immediately. RCP 8.5 assumes a high rate of population growth and little technological change. In each scenario, the uncertainty of the predictions is represented by a colored band around the line. After mid-century, the two scenarios diverge so that their uncertainties do not overlap, meaning that these are truly different trajectories. Note that in RCP 8.5, the world is much warmer by the end of the century. This shows how small differences in the next few decades result in much greater differences in the following years. Right now, our emissions are on track with RCP 8.5. Regardless of the amount of warming, the pattern will be uneven across the globe. Future warming is expected to occur in geographical patterns similar to those of recent years: The warming will be greatest at higher latitudes and in the interior of continents and least over the North Atlantic and the southern oceans. However, it will be warmer everywhere. Stopping at 450 ppm. Rising global temperatures are linked to two major impacts: regional climatic changes and a rise in sea level. Earth\u2019s history tells us that with 3\u00b0C global warming, equilibrium sea level could be at least 80 feet (25 m) higher than today. This is clearly dangerous to human civilization and should be avoided. However, with current warming at about 0.8\u00b0C above preindustrial levels and more warming already in the pipeline, we could get to 2\u00b0C in a couple of decades, which corresponds to a stable concentration of CO2 (with the other greenhouse gases included) in the atmosphere of around 450 ppm. To achieve stabilization at 450 ppm will require major changes in our energy systems. The current carbon emissions of 36 GtCO2 per year will have to fall to 7 GtCO2 per year by 2100 and then drop even further. In order to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, emissions need to peak and decline. Climate Commitment. Even if there were no increase at all in greenhouse gases, the current greenhouse gas concentration represents a commitment to further temperature increase and sea level rise due to the delay in the release into the atmosphere of energy stored in the oceans. That climate commitment is on the order of about 0.1\u00b0C per decade for the next several decades. The expected continued rise in sea level would cause disasters in most coastal areas, which are home to half the world\u2019s population and its business and commerce. The Impact of Climate Change on Ecosystems The changing climate will affect all of Earth\u2019s ecosystems. An understanding of these effects is vital because we depend on natural and agricultural ecosystems for a host of goods and services (see Chapter 7). The particular temperature and moisture regimes in different parts of the world have generated various types of ecosystems, reflecting the adaptations of plants, animals, and microbes to the prevailing weather patterns of a region. Changes in climate trigger changes in plant and animal behavior, such as the timing of flowering, migration, and dormancy. As the climate changes, can ecosystems change with it in such a way that the crucial support they provide us is not interrupted? Some of the projected outcomes of climate change include: (a) 6 4 Observed RCP8.5 2 Overlap RCP2.6 0 \u20132 1900 1950 2000 2050 2100 (b) Projected Temperature Change Very strong Strong Solid Color White Dots Difference from agreement agreement 1986\u20132005 mean (\u00b0 C) Divergent Little or Gray Diagonal Lines \u20130.5 11.7 02 46 changes no change RCP2.6 2081\u20132100 RCP8.5 2081\u20132100 Global mean temperature change(\u00b0C relative to 1986\u20132005) (c) Figure 18\u201317 Observed and projected changes in annual average surface temperature.

Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2014, figure SPM. 4.) In general, global climate change will have a profound impact on Earth\u2019s ecosystems and individual species, the impacts accruing as the temperature warms over time ( Figure 18\u201318). Outcomes will include damage to polar ecosystems, bleached and dying coral reefs, major loss of Amazon rain forests, widespread extinctions of species, and loss of ecosystem resilience. Impact of Climate Change in the United States The U.S. Global Change Research Program integrates the efforts of many federal agencies involved in the scientific effort to understand global climate change. One of the tasks of the Global Change Research Program has been to communicate the findings of the scientific community to policy makers and the broader public. The 2014 report, Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States, is the third National Climate Assessment and is available as an interactive document on Figure 18\u201318 Impact 4.5 of global warming on biological systems. As temperatures increase over time, the harm to biological systems will become 3.5 greater. The optimistic scenario reflects emissions between the RCP 2.6 and 4.5 W/m2 scenarios of the IPCC AR5.

Tipping Points? Recall that risk is composed of both the likelihood that an event will occur and the severity of harm from that occurrence ( Chapter 17). The AAAS report, What We Know, Figure 18\u201320 Regional impacts of climate change. Alaska is already experiencing the effects of climate change, including the collapse of permafrost, rising sea levels, and increased damage from storms. Residents of Shishmaref, Alaska, are trying to move their village after storms have caused destruction, such as the collapse of this house. described some rapid changes that would cause tremendous damage but have a low likelihood of occurring. The authors made the case that, just like a house fire, which you don\u2019t expect to occur but take actions to prevent and to insure yourself against, abrupt climate change deserves our attention. The main features of such abrupt change would be the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, the slowing of the deep ocean conveyor belt, and the dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice. Several of these events would trigger large-scale positive feedback loops. In the Arctic, up to 90% of the upper layer of permafrost would thaw, allowing vast areas of peat to decay, releasing methane and CO2.", "Such warming could also release the methane that is now held in frozen hydrate crystals on the sea floor. The greenhouse gases released from both of these sources would cause the warming cycle to continue. The idea that we could be close to a tipping point that would change the way large-scale cycles work is one of the reasons researchers have concluded that we have passed a planetary boundary on climate change (Chapter 2). This does not mean there is nothing we can do about it; it does mean that the solution has to involve burning less fossil fuel. In conclusion, if nothing is done to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases, computer modeling tells us that the 21st century will see climate changes that are dangerous, possibly catastrophic. Sea levels will keep rising, and there will be more frequent heat waves, changed weather patterns, and threats to natural ecosystems. In fact, these changes will go on for hundreds of years. Needless to say, this is not good news, and it has gotten the attention of the world. Efforts are under way to respond to these changes by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and by finding ways to adapt to the effects of the coming climate changes. However, our civilization has no experience with a problem like this, and the way forward is still being debated. CONCEPT CHECK 1. What is a climate commitment? \u2610\u2713 18.4 Controversy and Ethics Today many people agree that we need a global response to climate change. But before we deal with these responses, we will consider two questions: Why is there still so much doubt about climate change? and What ethical concerns does climate change raise? Why So Much Doubt? The scientific consensus on global climate change is clear: Global warming is well under way, and the consequences of further climate change are potentially catastrophic. In the United States, however, public opinion polls reveal a high level of skepticism about global warming. 12 This attitude has puzzled scientists, who have seen the evidence for global warming growing stronger all the time. 13 Figure 18\u201321 illustrates the gap between the scientific consensus and public perception. Some of this discrepancy is caused by the fact that most people do not spend time examining the scientific evidence but instead form their opinions based on the views of organizations and media sources they trust. The high degree of public skepticism, then, can be traced to several factors: 12Pew Research Center, More Say There Is Evidence of Global Warming (2012), http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/10-15-12%20Global%20Warming%20 Release.pdf. 13John Cook et al., \u201cQuantifying the Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming in the Scientific Literature,\u201d Environmental Research Letters 8, no. 2 (2014), doi:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024. 14Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway, Merchants of Doubt (New York: Bloomsbury Press, 2010). and by a desire for \u201cbalanced reporting\u201d that gives voice to fringe speakers. If the stakes were not so high, one could pass off this skepticism as an aberration. However, given the high stakes, the denial of climate change lands us firmly in the domain of ethics. Ethical Concerns In a recent book, philosopher Stephen Gardiner refers to our flawed attempts to address climate change as an ethical failure\u2014a \u201cperfect moral storm.\u201d 15 Gardiner describes three converging factors as having deep moral significance: 1) Climate change is a global \u201cstorm,\u201d one where the wealthy nations are able to shape what is done about it, possibly to the detriment of the poorer nations. 2) Climate change is an intergenerational storm, where the present generation has the power to affect future generations, who have no voice in the matter. 3) Climate change is a theoretical storm, in that the threat of climate change is unprecedented and we lack adequate moral theories to give guidance for appropriate actions. The convergence of these three interacting \u201cstorms,\u201d says Gardiner, has led to our present lack of real progress in addressing the looming threat of global climate change. Here are four ethical principles that speak to the issue: The Precautionary Principle. As articulated by the 1992 Rio Declaration, the precautionary principle states, \u201cIn order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. 15Stephen M. Gardiner, A Perfect Moral Storm: The Ethical Tragedy of Climate Change (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011).", "ACTUAL CONSENSUS AMONG UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENTIFIC CLIMATE SCIENTISTS CONSENSUS AMONG U.S. PUBLIC 45% Agree that human Think scientists activities are causing largely agree global warming Think the scientific Do not agree or community is divided do not know or does not know Figure 18\u201321 A communication gap. Although 97% of climate scientists are convinced by evidence that Earth is warming and that this process is largely the result of human activities, in a 2012 poll, only about 45% of U.S. respondents thought this was the position of scientists. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.\u201d 16 Employing this principle is like taking out insurance: We are taking measures to avoid a highly costly, but uncertain, situation (albeit one that is appearing quite likely). The risk of serious harmful consequences is real, the scientific consensus is strong, but the political response, as we will see, is still inadequate. Polluter Pays Principle. According to the polluter pays principle, polluters should pay for the damage their pollution causes. This principle has long been part of environmental legislation. CO2 is where it is because the developed countries (and now many developing countries) have burned so much fossil fuel since the beginning of the industrial era. It has become clear that CO2 is a pollutant. The Equity Principle. The people who produce the most greenhouse gas emissions are not the people who bear the bulk of the burden from climate change. This represents a fundamental inequity, generally divided by wealth and time. Currently, the richest 1 billion people produce 55% of CO2 emissions, while the poorest 1 billion produce only 3%. In addition, our choices today limit the ability of future generations to make decisions about their standard of living. International equity and intergenerational equity are ethical principles that should compel the rich and privileged to care about those generations that follow\u2014especially those in the poor countries who are even now experiencing the consequences of global climate change. Care of the Most Vulnerable Principle. One ethical principle is provision for the most vulnerable, sometimes called a preferential option for the poor. If climate change is unchecked, every country will be affected, but the effects will be most disastrous for the world\u2019s poorest countries and people. Climate change will be much harder on the poor, because they are already struggling to meet their needs for shelter, food, employment, and health care. Thus climate change acts as a risk multiplier for other problems, making the effects of other risks greater. Here are some of the reasons: 16UNEP. Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Principle 15. 1992. 18.5 Responding to Climate Change 457 flood of environmental refugees will challenge the ability of the international community to provide aid. \u2022 The lack of resources, especially water and arable land, will lead to greater internal and international conflicts. The U.S. Department of Defense has identified climate change as a significant national security issue, since climate change may act as an accelerant of conflict. Environmental Protection: A Human Right. The concept of treating environmental protection as a human right comes out of some of these ethical frameworks and is beginning to appear in international law. The 1998 Aarhus Convention, a treaty signed by the European Union and 46 other nations, gives rights to people to have access to information, participate in decision making, and have justice in issues of environmental quality. The treaty doesn\u2019t guarantee environmental quality, but it does say that if environmental laws are broken, people have a right to have redress. This is an important foundation for a just society. What are two reasons that people have trouble believing climate change is real or needs attention? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 18.5 Responding to Climate Change If we are convinced that climate change is a significant global problem that demands our attention, there are a number of actions that can be taken by individuals, nations, and the international community. We can take steps to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases; this is the mitigation response. Mitigation efforts will reduce the magnitude of future climate change. However, since some climate change is already underway, we will also need to take steps to adjust to the coming climate change; this is the adaptation response. Mitigation", "The goal of mitigation is to reduce the rate at which greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere and, eventually, to bring about a sustainable balance. Table 18\u20133, on the following page, presents a summary of the leading mitigation tools, many of which are already in place in the United States and globally. The majority of the options address the energy sector, where most of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases originate. What is needed, of course, is to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d the energy economy, so that energy needs are met without fossil fuels. Every provision that promotes greater energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources is going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Recent legislation in the United States has made progress in energy efficiency and renewable energy (Chapters 14 and 16). One way to reduce emissions is to stop burning fossil fuels at their source. Oil wells often have pockets of natural gas on top of them. This gas is routinely released and burned, a process called flaring. 17 Every year, routine gas 17World Bank, Countries and Oil Companies Agree to End Routine Gas Flaring, April 17, 2015, http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/04/17/ countries-and-oil-companies-agree-to-end-routine-gas-flaring. flaring burns about 140 billion cubic meters of natural gas, emitting more than 300 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, equivalent to the emissions of 77 million cars. The World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative is an attempt to eliminate the waste of natural gas. Another way to mitigate emissions is to stop deforestation and the burning of tropical forests. An international program called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) rewards developing countries for maintaining their forests. Costs and Benefits. There are economic costs and benefits to mitigation efforts. The benefits come in the form of new industries and the jobs they create, savings from efficiency measures, and the ecosystem benefits from forests that are preserved and regrown. The costs include the costs of the infrastructure needed to increase efficiencies of energy use and to switch to lower-carbon technologies for power, heat, and transportation; there are also costs involved in slowing or stopping deforestation. As calculated by the Stern Review, the net costs for stabilization at 550 ppm CO2 will amount to around 2% of global GDP by 2050. However, the Stern Review also calculated the costs of inaction to be from 5% to 20% of GDP. Contract and Converge. The phrase contract and converge describes a process by which the world will move from the current high emissions and high level of energy inequality to a future with lower emissions and greater energy equality. Our total use of fossil fuels needs to contract, so we leave much of our fossil fuels underground. We also need to converge\u2014 heavy emitters need to cut their fossil fuel use more and the poorest need to be allowed to increase theirs. This concept speaks to concerns about fairness: The developing countries\u2019 first priority should be to alleviate poverty, whereas the developed countries should be focusing on lowering environmental impact. Adaptation While mitigation strategies reduce the effects of climate change, adaptation strategies aim to reduce the risk associated with the various hazards likely to be caused by climate change. In adaptation, we anticipate harm to natural and human systems and plan responses to lessen the vulnerability of people, their property, and the biosphere to the coming changes. Thus, climate adaptation involves making adjustments in anticipation of changes that are likely to occur in the next decades, such as increasing drought and water shortages, increasingly severe storms, and rising sea level. For example, a city might recognize the risks associated with rising sea levels and rebuild its seaport to prepare for the changes. Preparing for climate change will involve a wide range of actions, from planting mangroves in order to protect coastal zones to investing in infrastructure that can withstand rising temperatures. There are also social adaptations, such as increasing the availability of insurance for the severe storms and droughts expected to accompany climate change. Table 18\u20134 presents a number of adaptations appropriate for developed and developing countries. International Efforts. One example of effective adaptation has already occurred in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray province, a hot, drought-prone region once known for its frequent famines. Today, however, the desert is greener and food more abundant because of widespread community efforts to build check dams, which are small rock dams that terrace hillsides and allow water to seep into the ground, refilling aquifers.", "The numerous check dams reduce the region\u2019s vulnerability to the predicted impacts of climate change, such as rising temperatures and increasing drought ( Figure 18\u201322). 18.5 Responding to Climate Change 459 Figure 18\u201322 Adapting to climate change in dry regions. These Ethiopian men are building small check dams, which will help to slow the flow of water, stop erosion, and increase the supply of groundwater. Adaptations can increase the resilience of societies and decrease the negative outcomes of the changing climate. Even so, adaptation is a difficult process because it is aimed at a moving target\u2014and one that is uncertain at best. The Green Climate Fund is one of a number of international funds that have been established to help the poorest countries address the need for climate adaptation. Co-Benefits. Some climate mitigation and adaptation strategies solve other problems as well, a phenomenon called co-benefits. For example, reducing the use of inefficient small cook stoves, coal-fired power plants, and gas flaring at oil wells will also reduce the brown cloud pollution that harms crops and human health ( Chapters 14, 17, 19). It is reasonable to start by pursuing efficiencies and solutions with co-benefits. But we may also have to take more dramatic steps, such as altering basic climate functions. Geoengineering A number of people have suggested that the problems associated with climate change could be addressed by altering Earth\u2019s processes. Such strategies are called geoengineering or, more narrowly, climate intervention. Most suggested geoengineering activities would either remove CO2 from the atmosphere or modify Earth\u2019s albedo. Sequestering Carbon Dioxide. Some geoengineering strategies involve removing CO2 from the atmosphere and sequestering it, or storing it where it cannot easily return to the atmosphere. For example, scrubbers on power plants can sequester CO2 released by burning fossil fuels before it is released into the atmosphere ( Figure 18\u201323). One proposed method of sequestration would be to erect devices that would directly absorb CO2 from the atmosphere so that it could be stored in deep reservoirs. Changes in land management to enhance the value of forests and agricultural lands as carbon sinks would also sequester carbon. Charcoal or biochar\u2014partially burned wood or other organic material\u2014decays very slowly. After discovering that indigenous Amazonian peoples use biochar to enrich the soil in their fields, some researchers have suggested burying biochar as a way of sequestering carbon in soil. The newest research, however, suggests that biochar may be less effective than first hoped. Because the natural weathering of rocks binds carbon dioxide, enhancing the rate at which rocks weather could be another way to sequester carbon. Combining direct removal from air with biomass burning results in another strategy: bio-energy with carbon capture and sequestration. For example, people suggest growing algae in the ocean, burning it for energy, and capturing the carbon for underground storage before it escapes into the atmosphere. Another idea is to fertilize vast areas of the ocean with iron, thereby stimulating phytoplankton growth, which would remove CO2 and sink to the depths. Figure 18\u201323 Carbon sequestration. These workers are using equipment that is capturing carbon dioxide from emissions at a power plant in Germany. Modifying Earth\u2019s Albedo. Other geoengineering strategies would reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth\u2019s surface or cause the Earth\u2019s surface to reflect more light; both of these strategies would alter Earth\u2019s albedo, or reflectivity. Proposed approaches include injecting sulfate particles into the stratosphere, where they would act as reflective clouds; using satellites to release particles that would deflect the Sun\u2019s radiation; and increasing the reflectivity of marine clouds. Such approaches would be extremely expensive and would be likely to have unintended consequences, such as the alteration of weather patterns or the destruction of ecosystems. For example, injecting sulfate particles into the atmosphere would lower temperatures in the short term, but not in the long term. Sulfur oxides would also cause acid rain; in the long term, they might even increase global warming. In 2015, the National Research Council released a report evaluating the promise of such climate interventions. 18 It concluded that some of the ideas are serious proposals, while others are clearly unworkable. According to that report, some strategies for sequestering carbon dioxide could be effective, but they would require international cooperation and are likely to be costly. In contrast, strategies for modifying Earth\u2019s albedo could be carried out by nations or even individual companies, but they would involve larger risks and thus present an array of ethical concerns.", "The report concluded, \u201cclimate intervention is no substitute for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and adaptation efforts aimed at reducing the negative consequences of climate change.\u201d International Efforts Because climate change is global, any effective response to it must involve international cooperation. Mitigation in particular cannot be done by individual countries alone. In addition, funding for climate adaptation in the poorest countries will have to come from high-income countries. The international community is trying to reach agreement on how to proceed, an extremely difficult process. Consequently, we have a long history of international meetings that have led to a number of critical agreements. National representatives meet annually or more often to plan, negotiate, and agree to treaties about climate change. Some of these meetings are listed in Table 18\u20135. As the table shows, the process of inter national decision making does not always result in binding agreements, but that is the goal. 18NAS, Climat Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration (Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2015); NAS, Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth (Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2015). 18.5 Responding to Climate Change 461 Framework Convention on Climate Change. One of the five documents signed by heads of state at the UN Conference on Environment and Development\u2019s Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 was the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). This framework serves as the foundation of international agreement about climate change. Its stated objective is to stabilize the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere at levels and on a time scale that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. In the FCCC, countries agreed to the goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, with all industrialized nations reducing their emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Countries were to achieve the goal by voluntary means. Five years later, all the developed countries except those of the European Union had increased their greenhouse gas emissions by 7% to 9%, while the developing countries had increased theirs by 25%. It was obvious that the voluntary approach was failing. Agreements to Cut Emissions. Prompted by a coalition of island nations threatened by rising sea levels, another international meeting was convened in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, to craft a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the meeting, 38 industrial and former Eastern Bloc nations agreed to reduce emissions of six greenhouse gases to 5.2% below 1990 levels, to be achieved by 2012; this agreement was called the Kyoto Protocol. However, the developing countries refused to agree to any reductions, arguing that the developed countries had created the problem and that it was only fair that the developing countries continue on their path to development as the developed countries had, energized by fossil fuels. This stance was in accord with the FCCC principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities.\u201d Under this principle, each nation must address climate change, but its priorities and efforts may differ according to national circumstances. Even the targeted reductions of the Kyoto Protocol would have been insufficient to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. The IPCC calculates that it would take immediate reductions in emissions of at least 60% worldwide to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at today\u2019s levels. Since there is no chance that reductions of this size will occur, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will continue to rise. The major weakness of the Kyoto Protocol is that the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitters\u2014India, China, and the United States\u2014are not participating. The United States withdrew from the treaty in 2001. Recently Canada, Japan, and Russia also withdrew, with the result that Kyoto now only covers 13% of global emissions. Nevertheless, Kyoto was an important first step toward binding agreements to stabilize the atmosphere. In 2000 in Copenhagen, Denmark, 187 countries committed to setting emissions targets in the Copenhagen Accord. In 2011, at Durban, South Africa, delegates reached an agreement to begin negotiations that would lead to a legally binding agreement by 2015, to take effect by 2020. The agreement, called the Durban Platform, aims at ensuring that emissions reductions will meet the goal of keeping global temperature rise below 2\u00b0C. In 2012 in Doha, Qatar, the Kyoto Protocol was extended until 2020. The Pledge Gap.", "At the Durban meeting, the United Nations Environment Program released a report that showed that the pledges of countries under the Copenhagen Accord were falling short of the target; thus, there is a climate emissions gap to be addressed, a gap of between 6 and 11 GtCO2, depending on how well the pledges are kept (Figure 18\u201324) . 19 The report states that to stay within the 2\u00b0C limit, emissions would have to peak before 2020, and that won\u2019t happen unless new emissions targets are established. It is possible to close the gap, but current pledges are insufficient. Funding Low-Income Countries. As already described, low-income countries lack the resources to mitigate or adapt to climate change. Furthermore, they already suffer losses from the current effects of climate change. Consequently, developing countries have repeatedly asked for climate change\u2013related aid. In 2010 in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, nations agreed to a Green Climate Fund of $30 billion to help the developing countries, and in 2012 in Doha, Qatar, developing nations lobbied for funds to help them pay for loss and damage due to climate change. However, by 2013, in a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, the developing nations were not being given the promised climate aid and 132 nations walked out of negotiations. Funding for climate change\u2013related costs will continue to be a part of aid 19United Nations Environment Program, Bridging the Emissions Gap: A UNEP Synthesis Report (November 2011), accessed June 14, 2015, www.unep.org/ publications/ebooks/bridgingemissionsgap/ .

Bilateral Meetings. Some discussions about climate change involve just a few nations. In 2014, the United States and China held separate climate talks, announcing a plan for both countries to curb emissions by 2030. Later in 2014, the United States and India had top-level discussions about climate change. Because India has a much higher percentage of people in poverty and lower per capita greenhouse gas emissions than the United States and even China, Indian leaders were unwilling to promise cuts in emissions. National Legislation. Legislative action at the national level is critical to the reduction of emissions. A research team from the United Kingdom recently analyzed legislation in 66 countries that emit 90% of greenhouse gas emissions, including 155 laws related to climate change that were in effect in those countries. 20 The study was encouraging, finding that countries are using many approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate change. This brings us to the question: What has the United States been doing about global climate change? U.S. Policy on Climate Change Climate change policy in the United States comprises scientific research, national legislation, regulatory action, and state and local action. One major policy move was made in 2001 when President George W. Bush announced that the United States would withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol agreement. In June 2013, President Obama announced a Climate Action Plan to better prepare America for the effects of climate change. Scientific Research. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 established a policy of support for research on climate change; the act mandates an interagency approach, where all of the agencies and departments that might be involved in climate change research are to coordinate their activities and programs as part of the official Global Change Research Program (GCRP). Lead agencies in this effort have been the NOAA, NASA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the EPA. One example of the GCRP\u2019s effort has been the 20 reports of the Climate Change Science Program. Hundreds of U.S. scientists have been in the lead in conducting research on climate change and publishing their work, especially as they have participated in the IPCC assessments. National Legislation. While 66 countries have over 500 greenhouse gas emissions laws, the United States lags in climate-change legislation.", "In 2009, the House passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act, which would have established an emissions reduction and trading plan called cap-and-trade (see Table 18\u20134). Unfortunately, the bill died in the Senate. However, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has invested more than $43 billion in the support of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, 20Terry Townshend et al., \u201cLegislating Climate Change on a National Level,\u201d Environment 53 (September/October 2011): 5\u201317. Review Questions 463 which will certainly have an impact in lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Other legislative actions include laws that established subsidies and rebates for renewable energy sources. Disagreement within the U.S. Congress has made it difficult to accomplish more through legislation. Regulatory Action. Under the Copenhagen Accord, the White House has committed the United States to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 17% below 2005 levels, to be achieved by 2020. Major tools to accomplish this include all of the policies to promote renewable energy and energy conservation, especially the regulations that raise the corporate average fuel economy standards (Chapter 16 ). Most important, however, is the role of the EPA. In 2009, taking its cue from a 2007 Supreme Court ruling, the EPA determined that six key greenhouse gases pose a danger to public health and welfare, thus giving the agency a green light to regulate CO2 and other greenhouse gases. This move has infuriated many industry groups and their political allies, but their efforts to block the EPA from this role have so far failed. The EPA began its regulatory efforts with the New Source Performance Standards, which regulate the emissions of greenhouse gases from new fossil fuel\u2013burning power plants (starting in 2013) and from existing power plants (starting in 2014). This permitting rule requires all new power plants to hold emissions to 1,000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt hour, something that natural gas plants can accomplish but coal plants cannot easily do without new technology. State and Local Action. Individual states are also taking action to address global climate change. Many states have set quantitative goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Some states are adopting renewable portfolio standards and mandating the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions (see Chapter 16). Several regions have established emissions cap and-trade programs similar to the Clean Air Act program that was successful in bringing down sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition, more than 1,000 mayors have pledged to move their cities to make greenhouse gas reductions under the Climate Protection Agreement. In conclusion, global climate change is perhaps the greatest challenge facing human civilization in the 21st century. We all need to put our effort into finding solutions to the problems it presents. CONCEPT CHECK Mitigation, adaptation, and bioengineering are three ways of addressing climate change. Give an example of each. \u2610\u2713 REVIEW QUESTIONS THINKING ENVIRONMENTALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE Anything you can do to cut energy use will cut your CO2 output.

Atmospheric Pollution On Tuesday morning, October 26, 1948, the people of Donora, Pennsylvania (population 13,000), awoke to a dense fog. Donora lies in an industrialized valley along the Monongahela River, south of Pittsburgh. On the outskirts of town, a sooty sign read, \u201cDONORA: NEXT TO YOURS, THE BEST TOWN IN THE U.S.A.\u201d The town had a large steel mill that used high-sulfur coal and a zinc-reduction plant that roasted ores laden with sulfur. At the time, most homes in the area were heated with coal. At first, the fog did not seem unusual: Most of Donora\u2019s fogs lifted by noon, as the Sun warmed the upper atmosphere and then the land. This one, however, didn\u2019t lift for five days. Sickness and Death. Through Wednesday and Thursday, the air began to smell of sulfur dioxide\u2014an acrid, penetrating odor. By Friday morning, the town\u2019s physicians began to get calls from people in trouble. At first, the calls were from elderly citizens and those with asthmatic conditions. They were having difficulty breathing. The calls continued into Friday afternoon. People young and old were complaining of stomach pain, headaches, nausea, and choking. Work at the mills went on, however. The first deaths occurred on Saturday morning.", "By 10 AM, one mortician had nine bodies; two other morticians had one each. On Sunday morning, the mills were shut down. Even so, the owners were certain that their plants had nothing to do with the trouble. Mercifully, the rain came on Sunday and cleared the air\u2014but not before more than 6,000 townspeople were stricken and 20 elderly people had died. During the next month, 50 more people died. Memorial. Eventually it was determined that the deaths had been caused by a combination of polluting gases and particles, a thermal inversion in the lower atmosphere, and a stagnant weather system that, together, brought home the deadly potential of air pollution. Today, a historical marker in the town and a small storefront museum commemorate the Donora Smog of 1948. The lasting legacy of the smog and of those who suffered sickness and death are the state and national laws to control air pollution. Donora was a landmark event. Nurses treat victims of the lethal smog in Donora, Pennsylvania, in 1948. Chapter 19 Learning Objectives 19.1 Air-Pollution Essentials: Describe normal atmospheric cleansing and the formation of industrial and photochemical smog. Identify global trends in air pollution. 19.2 Major Air Pollutants and Their Sources: Identify the variety and sources of the major air pollutants, and classify them as primary or secondary pollutants. 19.3 Impacts of Air Pollutants: Explain how air pollutants impact human health and cause damage to agricultural crops and natural ecosystems. 19.4 Bringing Air Pollution Under Control: Compare trends in air pollution in the United States and the EU with those in developing nations. Explain how U.S. laws such as the Clean Air Act have helped reduce air pollution; describe the role of the Environmental Protection Agency in controlling air pollution. 19.5 Destruction of the Ozone Layer: Assess how chlorofluorocarbons and other gases have been implicated in the destruction of stratospheric ozone, and review the steps taken to bring back the ozone layer. During the last half century, air pollution in the United States and some other regions has decreased, while in other areas it has become considerably worse. A 2012 report by the World Health Organization attributed 4.3 million deaths per year to air pollution. Many of these deaths were the result of indoor air pollution, which is discussed elsewhere 19.1 Air-Pollution Essentials For a long time, we have known that the atmosphere contains numerous gases. The major constituents of the atmosphere are nitrogen (N2), at a level of 78.08%; oxygen (O2), at 20.95%; water vapor, ranging from 0% to 4%; argon (Ar), at 0.93%; and carbon dioxide (CO2), at 0.04%. Smaller amounts of at least 40 trace gases are normally present as well, including ozone, helium, hydrogen, methane, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and neon. In addition, the atmosphere contains aerosols: microscopic liquid and solid particles such as dust, carbon particles, pollen, sea salts, and microorganisms, originating primarily from land and water surfaces and carried up into the atmosphere. Outdoor air is a valuable and essential resource, provid ing gases that sustain life and maintain warmth (Chapter 18). It also shields the Earth from harmful radiation. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the mixture of gases and (Chapter 17). Earlier, we looked at the structure and function of the atmosphere and its links to weather and climate, and examined the effects of greenhouse gases on climate change (Chapter 18) . In this chapter, we will consider the impacts of a host of other air pollutants on human health and the environment. particles in our atmosphere began to change, and we learned the hard way about air pollution. Pollutants and Atmospheric Cleansing Air pollutants are substances in the atmosphere\u2014certain gases and aerosols\u2014that have harmful effects. Three factors determine the level of air pollution: The lower atmosphere, called the troposphere (Figure 19\u20131), is the site and source of our weather and contains almost all of the water vapor and clouds of the atmosphere (Chapter 18) . Pollutants that enter the troposphere are usually removed within hours or a few days unless they are carried up into the Figure 19\u20131 Layers of the atmosphere closest to Earth\u2019s surface. The troposphere extends from the surface to roughly 6 miles 1 above the surface, and the stratosphere is above that. The colored band shows the average temperature of the atmosphere at different altitudes. In the troposphere, temperatures generally decrease with height, while in the stratosphere temperatures increase with height. (Source: CCSP 1.1.", "Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere: Steps for Understanding and Reconciling Differences. Thomas R. Karl, Susan J. Hassol, Christopher D. Miller, and William L.

If that happens, they can be carried far and persist for many days before they, too, are removed by cleansing agents. Some pollutants are resistant to most of the cleansing mechanisms and can be carried up into the next higher layer of the atmosphere, the stratosphere. The most notorious of these are the ozone-depleting chemicals (chlorine and bromine compounds), which we will consider in Section 19.5. Atmospheric Cleansing. Environmental scientists distinguish between natural and anthropogenic (human-caused) air pollutants. For millions of years, volcanoes, fires, and dust storms have sent smoke, gases, and particles into the atmosphere. Trees and other plants also emit volatile organic compounds into the air around them. However, there are mechanisms in the biosphere that remove, assimilate, and recycle these natural pollutants. First, a naturally occurring compound, the hydroxyl radical (OH), oxidizes many gaseous pollutants into products that are harmless or that can be brought down to the ground or water by precipitation ( Figure 19\u20132). Sea salts\u2014picked up from sea spray as air masses move over the oceans\u2014are a second cleansing agent. These salts, now aerosols, act as excellent nuclei for the formation of raindrops. The rain then brings down many particulate pollutants (other aerosols) from the atmosphere to the ocean, cleansing pollutant-laden air. Third, sunlight breaks organic molecules apart. These three processes hold natural pollutants below toxic levels (except in the immediate area of a source, such as around an erupting volcano). Many of the pollutants oxidized by the hydroxyl radical are of concern because human activities have raised their concentrations far above normal levels. Recent studies have shown that the hydroxyl radical plays a key role in the removal of anthropogenic pollutants from the atmosphere. Formation of Hydroxyl Radical Reactions of Hydroxyl Radical with Pollutants Highly reactive hydrocarbons are oxidized within an hour of their appearance in the atmosphere, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are converted to nitric acid (HNO3) within a day. It takes months, however, for carbon monoxide (CO) to be oxidized by hydroxyl and years in the case of methane (CH4 ). As Figure 19\u20132 shows, the photochemical breakdown of tropospheric ozone is the major source of the hydroxyl radical (not shown is a newly discovered additional source of the hydroxyl radical, from the photoexcitation of nitrogen dioxide). As we will see, higher levels of ozone result from higher concentrations of other polluting gases. Recent research indicates that the atmospheric levels of hydroxyl are quite stable, suggesting that formation and breakdown are balanced. 1 Some hydroxyl is used up during reactions with CO and CH4, but hydroxyl is recycled as it reacts with most other pollutants. This is good news for now, but researchers are concerned that future pollutants and climate change could affect the hydroxyl balance. Smogs and Brown Clouds Down through the centuries, the practice of venting the products of combustion and other fumes into the atmosphere remained the natural way to avoid their noxious effects within buildings. With the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s came crowded cities and the use of coal for heating and energy. It was then that air pollution began in earnest. Industrial Smog. In Hard Times, Charles Dickens described a typical English scene: \u201cCoketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which appeared impervious to the sun\u2019s rays. You 1S. A. Montzka et al., \u201cSmall Interannual Variability of Global Atmospheric Hydroxyl,\u201d Science 331 (January 7, 2011): 67\u201369. Figure 19\u20132 The hydroxyl radical. This is a simplified model of atmospheric cleansing by the hydroxyl radical (OH). The first step is the photochemical destruction of ozone, which is the major process leading to ozone breakdown in the troposphere. The second step produces hydroxyl radicals, which react rapidly with many pollutants, converting them to substances that are less harmful (CO2) or that can be returned to Earth via precipitation (HNO3, H2SO4). UV Radiation 1. O3 O2 + O * Photochemical breakdown of tropospheric ozone releases an oxygen molecule and a free oxygen atom. 2.

(b) Photochemical smog occurs when sunlight acts on vehicle pollutants. only knew the town was there because there could be no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town.\u201d This shrouding haze became known as industrial smog (a combination of smoke and fog), an irritating, grayish mixture of soot, sulfurous compounds, and water vapor (Figure 19\u20133a) . This kind of smog continues to be found wherever industries are concentrated and where coal is the primary energy source; such smog is most likely to form in winter or in cool, foggy weather. The Donora incident is classic example. Currently, industrial smog can be found in the cities of China, India, Korea, and some eastern European countries. Photochemical Smog. After World War II, the booming economy in the United States led to the creation of vast suburbs and a mushrooming use of cars for commuting to and from work. As other fossil fuels were used in place of coal for heating, industry, and transportation, industrial smog was largely replaced by another kind of smog. Increasingly, Los Angeles and other cities served by huge freeway systems began to be enshrouded daily in a brownish, irritating haze that was different from the more familiar industrial smog ( Figure 19\u20134). Weather conditions were usually warm and sunny rather than cool and foggy, and, typically, the new haze would arise during the morning commute and begin to dissipate only by the time of the evening commute. This photochemical smog, as it came to be called, is produced when several pollutants from automobile exhausts\u2014nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbon compounds\u2014are acted on by sunlight (Figure 19\u20133b) . Inversions. Certain weather conditions intensify levels of both industrial and photochemical smogs. Under normal conditions, the daytime air temperature is highest near the ground, because sunlight strikes Earth and the absorbed heat radiates to the air near the surface. The warm air continues to rise, carrying pollutants upward and dispersing them at higher altitudes (Figure 19\u20135a) . At times, however, a warm air layer occurs above a cooler layer. This condition of cooler air below and warmer air above is called a temperature inversion (Figure 19\u20135b) . Inversions often occur at night, when the surface air is cooled by radiative heat loss. Such inversions are usually short lived, as the next morning\u2019s (a) (b) Figure 19\u20134 Los Angeles air. (a) Los Angeles on a good day. (b) LA under a blanket of photochemical smog. 19.2 Major Air Pollutants and Their Sources 469 Figure 19\u20135 Temperature inversion. A temperature inversion may cause episodes of high concentrations of air pollutants. (a) Normally, air temperatures are highest at ground level and decrease at higher elevations. (b) In a temperature inversion, a layer of warmer air overlies cooler air at ground level. sunlight begins the heating process anew and any pollutants that accumulated overnight are carried up and away. During cloudy weather, however, the Sun may not be strong enough to break up the inversion for hours or even days. A mass of high-pressure air may move in and sit above the cool surface air, trapping it. Topography can also intensify smog as cool ocean air flows into valleys and is trapped there by nearby mountain ranges. Los Angeles has both topographical features. When such long-term temperature inversions occur, pollutants can build up to dangerous levels, prompting local health officials to urge people with breathing problems to stay indoors. For many people, smog causes headaches, nausea, and eye and throat irritation. It may aggravate preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma and emphysema. In some industrial cities (such as Donora), air pollution reached lethal levels under severe temperature inversions. These cases became known as air-pollution disasters. London experienced repeated episodes of inversion-related disasters in the mid-1900s. One episode in 1952 resulted in 4,000 pollution-related deaths. Atmospheric Brown Clouds. A relative newcomer on the air-pollution scene is the atmospheric brown cloud (ABC), a 1- to 3-kilometer-thick blanket of pollution. These vast, murky clouds are caused by pollution from forest fires, the burning of fossil fuels and farm wastes, and millions of small, inefficient household stoves.", "ABCs are found in regional hot spots in East Asia, South Asia, Southern Africa, and the Amazon Basin. The large quantities of black carbon and soot in ABCs reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, a phenomenon called global dimming (see Sound Science, Complex Clouds and Co-Benefits of Solutions). Ozone and acid rain accompany ABCs. The impacts of ABCs are serious: major dimming, reductions in rainfall, solar heating of the atmosphere and decreased reflection by snow and ice (both of which are contributing to a shrinking of the Hindu Kush\u2013Himalaya\u2013 Tibetan glaciers). These polluted air masses also cause a weakening of the Indian summer monsoon; reduced crop yields due to the dimming and to ozone levels; and heightened acute and chronic health effects typical of exposure to industrial and urban air pollution. ABCs contribute to a global trend: increasing air pollution in many urban areas, especially in Asia. India in particular is suffering from the effects of air pollution. Thirteen of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in India. Several of the others are in China (see Chapter 2). Industrial smog from coal burning, photochemical smog from vehicular exhaust, and atmospheric brown clouds are all caused by the release of pollutants, and we now turn our attention to those pollutants. CONCEPT CHECK What are the key characteristics of industrial smog, photochemical smog, and atmospheric brown smog? How does each form? \u2610\u2713 19.2 Major Air Pollutants and Their Sources In large measure, anthropogenic air pollutants are direct and indirect products of the combustion of coal, gasoline, other liquid fuels, and refuse such as waste paper, food, and plastics. These fuels and wastes are organic compounds. With complete combustion, the products of burning organic compounds are carbon dioxide and water vapor. Unfortunately, combustion is seldom complete, and many complex chemical substances are involved. The combustion of fuels and refuse creates a host of gaseous and particulate products that in turn create unwanted problems before they are cleansed from the air. Other processes producing air pollutants are the evaporation of volatile substances and strong winds that pick up dust and other particles. Primary Pollutants Table 19\u20131 presents the major sources, characteristics, and general effects of the major air pollutants. The first seven (particulates, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, lead, and air toxics) are called primary air pollutants because they are the direct products of combustion and evaporation. Some primary pollutants may undergo further reactions in the atmosphere and produce additional undesirable compounds, called secondary air pollutants (ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrates, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid). Sources of air pollution are summarized in Figure 19\u20136. Power plants are the major source of sulfur dioxide, particulates originate from all sorts of combustion, and transportation accounts for the lion\u2019s share of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. This diversity suggests that strategies for controlling air pollutants will be different for the different sources. When fuels and wastes are burned, particles consisting mainly of carbon are emitted into the air; these are the particulates we see as soot and smoke ( Figure 19\u20137). In addition, various unburned fragments of fuel molecules are given off; these are the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. When carbon is not completely oxidized, it produces carbon 19.2 Major Air Pollutants and Their Sources 471 PRIMARY POLLUTANTS SECONDARY POLLUTANTS + Light Particulates Ozone, PANs Acids\u2013 Hydrocarbons Sulfuric Nitric Nitrogen oxides Sulfur dioxide Refuse incinerators Industrial stacks Carbon monoxide Motor vehicles Coal-burning power plants Figure 19\u20136 The prime sources of the major anthropogenic air pollutants. Industrial processes and transportation generate a toxic brew of primary and secondary air pollutants. monoxide (CO) rather than carbon dioxide (CO2), which explains why dangerous carbon monoxide fumes form when burning is inefficient. Combustion takes place in the air, a mixture of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. At high combustion temperatures, some of the atmospheric nitrogen gas is oxidized to form the gas nitric oxide (NO). In the air, nitric oxide immediately reacts with additional oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). These compounds are collectively referred to as the nitrogen oxides, or NOx. Nitrogen dioxide absorbs light and is largely responsible for the brownish color of photochemical smog. Figure 19\u20137 Industrial pollution. Because the stack of this wood-products mill in New Richmond, Quebec Province, Canada, lacks electrostatic precipitators, the plume contains substantial amounts of suspended particulate matter that can be seen from a great distance.", "In addition to organic matter, fuels and refuse contain impurities and additives, and these substances are also emitted into the air during burning. Coal, for example, contains from 0.2% to 5.5% sulfur. In combustion, this sulfur is oxidized, giving rise to several gaseous oxides, the most common being sulfur dioxide (SO2). Coal also contains heavy-metal impurities such as mercury, and refuse contains an endless array of impurities. Tracking Pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) operates the Clearinghouse for Inventories and Emissions Factors, which tracks trends in national emissions of the primary pollutants from all sources. The EPA also follows air quality by measuring ambient concentrations (where ambient means \u201cpresent in the air\u201d) of the pollutants at thousands of monitoring stations across the country. According to EPA data, 2013 emissions in the United States of the first five primary pollutants amounted to 116 million tons. By comparison, in 1970, when the first Clean Air Act became law, these same five pollutants totaled 301 million tons. The relative amounts emitted Figure 19\u20138 U.S. emissions of Millions of metric tons Sources five primary air pollutants, by source, for 2013.

In general, there has been a remarkable improvement in the rate of emissions over the past 40 years (Figure 19\u20139), reflecting the effectiveness of Clean Air Act regulations. This progressive improvement over time has occurred in spite of large increases in the gross domestic product, vehicular miles traveled, population, and energy consumption (Figure 19\u201310) . Getting the Lead Out. The sixth type of primary pollutant\u2014 lead and other heavy metals\u2014is discussed separately because the quantities emitted are far less than the levels for the first five. Before the EPA-directed phaseout in the 1980s and 1990s, lead was added to gasoline as an inexpensive way to prevent engine knock. Emitted with the exhaust from gasoline-burning vehicles, lead remained airborne and traveled great distances before settling as far away as the glaciers of Greenland. Since the phaseout, concentrations of lead in the air of cities in the United States have declined remarkably. However, lead levels are elevated around airports where piston-engine aircraft operate, because aviation gasoline still uses leaded gasoline (jet fuel has no added lead). Between 1980 and 2013, lead levels in air fell 99%. At the same time, levels of lead in children\u2019s blood have dropped 92% (some children still get lead from dust and paint chips). Lead concentrations in Greenland ice have also decreased significantly. All these declines indicate that lead restrictions in the United States and most other Northern Hemisphere nations have had a global impact.

Lead smelters and battery manufacturers also add to the burden of lead. Toxics and Radon.", "As with lead, the concentrations of toxic chemicals and radon in the air are small compared with those of the other primary pollutants. Some of the air\u2019s toxic compounds\u2014benzene, for example\u2014originate with transportation fuels. Most, however, are traceable to industries and small businesses. Radon, by contrast, is produced by the spontaneous decay of fissionable material in rocks and soils. Radon levels are highest in areas with certain types of bedrock, such as granite and shale. Radon escapes naturally to the surface and seeps into buildings through cracks in foundations and basement floors, sometimes collecting in the structures. Basements can be tested for the level of radon; the EPA standards limit radon exposure to 4 picocuries (a measure of radioactivity) per cubic liter. While radon can cause cancer, overexposure is avoidable with some simple changes, such as providing adequate ventilation in basements and sealing foundation cracks. Secondary Pollutants Ozone and numerous reactive organic compounds are formed as a result of chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons. Because sunlight provides the energy necessary to propel the reactions, these products are also known as photochemical oxidants. Note that these reactions and the ozone they produce are entirely in the troposphere; ozone in the stratosphere is \u201cgood\u201d ozone, protecting life from damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In preindustrial times, ozone concentrations ranged from 10 to 15 parts per billion (ppb), well below harmful levels. Summer concentrations of ozone in unpolluted air in North America now range from 20 to 50 ppb. Polluted air may contain ozone concentrations of 150 ppb or more, a level considered quite unhealthy if encountered for extended periods. EPA data indicate that ambient ozone levels, monitored across the United States at some 1,100 sites, have declined more than 30% since 1980. Los Angeles, the U.S. city with the highest level of ozone pollution, now has one third fewer days of unhealthy ozone levels than it had fifteen years ago. Even so, 108 million people in the U.S live in counties that still do not meet ozone standards. Ozone Formation. A simplified view of the major reactions in the formation of ozone and other photochemical oxidants is shown in Figure 19\u201311, on the following page. Nitrogen dioxide absorbs light energy and splits to form nitric oxide and atomic oxygen; the oxygen atoms rapidly combine with oxygen gas to form ozone. If other factors are not involved, ozone and nitric oxide then react to form nitrogen dioxide and oxygen gas. A steady-state concentration of ozone results, and there is no appreciable accumulation of the gas (Figure 19\u201311a). When VOCs are present, however, the nitric oxide reacts with them instead of with the ozone, causing several serious problems. First, the reaction between nitric oxide and the VOCs leads to highly reactive and damaging compounds known as peroxyacetyl nitrates, or PANs (Figure 19\u201311b). Second, numerous aldehyde and ketone compounds are produced as the VOCs are oxidized by atomic oxygen, and these compounds are also noxious. Finally, with the nitric oxide tied up in this way, the ozone tends to accumulate. Because of the complex air chemistry involved, ozone concentrations may peak 30 to 100 miles (50 to 160 km) downwind of urban centers where the primary pollutants were generated. As a result, ozone concentrations above the air quality standards are sometimes found in rural and wilderness areas. Sulfuric acid and nitric acid are considered secondary pollutants because they are products of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, respectively, reacting with atmospheric moisture and oxidants such as hydroxyl. Sulfuric and nitric acids are the acids in acid precipitation. We now turn our attention to this important and widespread problem. Figure 19\u201311 Formation of ozone and other photochemical oxidants. (a) Nitrogen oxides, by themselves, would not cause ozone and other oxidants to reach damaging levels, because reactions involving nitrogen oxides are cyclical. (b) When VOCs are also present, however, reactions occur that lead to the accumulation of numerous damaging compounds\u2014most significantly, ozone, the most injurious. Acid Precipitation and Deposition Acid precipitation refers to any precipitation\u2014rain, fog, mist, or snow\u2014that is more acidic than usual. Because dry acidic particles are also found in the atmosphere, the combination of precipitation and dry-particle fallout is called acid deposition. In the late 1960s, Swedish scientist Svante Od\u00e9n first documented the acidification of lakes in Scandinavia and traced it to air pollutants originating in other parts of Europe and Great Britain.", "Since then, careful monitoring has shown that broad areas of North America, as well as most of Europe and other industrialized regions of the world, have been experiencing precipitation that is between 10 and 1,000 times more acidic than usual. This has affected ecosystems in diverse ways, as illustrated in Figure 19\u201312. To understand the full extent of the problem, we must first understand some principles about acids and how we measure their concentration. Acids, Bases, and pH. Acidic properties (for example, a sour taste and corrosiveness) are due to the presence of hydrogen ions (H+, hydrogen atoms without their electron), which are highly reactive. Therefore, an acid is any chemical that releases hydrogen ions when dissolved in water. The chemical formulas of a few common acids are shown in Table 19\u20132. Note that all of them ionize\u2014that is, their 19.2 Major Air Pollutants and Their Sources 475 Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) Nitric acid (HNO3) Water vapor and cloud chemistry Acid snow Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides Dry fallout emissions Acid rain Acid fog Dry fallout Damage to vegetation Water condensation Acid dew Acid snow melt Die-off of aquatic life Figure 19\u201312 Acid deposition. Emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with hydroxyl radicals and water vapor in the atmosphere to form their respective acids, which return to the surface either as dry acid deposition or, mixed with water, as acid precipitation. Various effects of acid deposition are noted. Figure 19\u201313 The pH scale. Each unit on the scale represents a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration. components separate\u2014to create hydrogen ions plus a negative ion. The higher the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution, the more acidic the solution. A base is any chemical that releases hydroxide ions (OH-, oxygen-hydrogen groups with an extra electron) when dissolved in water. (See Table 19\u20132.) The bitter taste and caustic properties of alkaline, or basic, solutions are due to the presence of hydroxide ions. The concentration of hydrogen ions is expressed as pH. The pH scale goes from 0 (highly acidic) through 7 (neutral) to 14 (highly basic) ( Figure 19\u201313). As the pH scale numbers go from 0 to 7, the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) decreases, and the solution becomes less acidic and more neutral. As the numbers go from 7 to 14, the concentration of hydrogen ions gets lower, but the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) increases, and the solution becomes more basic. The numbers on the scale (0\u201314) represent the negative logarithm (power of 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration, expressed in grams per liter (g/L). For example, a solution with a pH of 1 has an H+ concentration of 10-1 g/L, a pH of 2 has a concentration of 10-2 g/L, and so on. Because numbers on the pH scale represent powers of 10, there is a tenfold difference between each unit and the next. For example, pH 5 is 10 times as acidic (has 10 times as many H+ ions) as pH 6, and pH 4 is 10 times as acidic as pH 5. Extent and Potency of Acid Precipitation. In the absence of any pollution, rainfall is normally somewhat acidic, with a pH of 5.6, because carbon dioxide in the air readily dissolves in, and combines with, water to produce carbonic acid. Acid precipitation, then, is any precipitation with a pH less than 5.5. Since the middle of the 20th century, acid precipitation has been the norm over most of the Western world. The pH of rain and snowfall over a large portion of eastern North America used to be quite acidic, reflecting the west-to-east movement of polluted air from the Midwest and industrial Canada. Many areas in this region once regularly received precipitation having a pH of 4.0 and, occasionally, as low as 3.0 (Figure 19\u201314a) . Acid precipitation has not disappeared in eastern North America, but pH values lower than 4.6 are now uncommon (Figure 19\u201314b) . Acid precipitation was heavy in Europe in the latter half of the 20th century, from the British Isles to central Russia. Like North America, acid precipitation has declined greatly in these regions. It is on the rise in China and India as these countries increasingly exploit their coal resources. Sources of Acid Deposition. Chemical analysis of acid precipitation reveals the presence of two acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). As we have seen, burning fuels produce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, so one source of the acid deposition problem is evident.", "These oxides enter the troposphere in large quantities from both anthropogenic and natural sources. Once in the tro posphere, hydroxyl radicals (Figure 19\u20132) react with them to form sulfuric and nitric acids, which dissolve readily in water or adsorb to particles and are brought down to Earth in acid deposition. This usually occurs within a week of the oxides entering the atmosphere. Another important source of acidification is traced to the use of nitrogen fertilizers, made by the Haber-Bosch process, whereby atmospheric N2 (a nonreactive form of nitrogen) is converted into other nitrogen compounds that can be used by plants (Chapter 3). As a result of this process, ammonia (NH3) can escape into the atmosphere. Whether in the atmosphere, soil, or natural waters, ammonia is eventually oxidized to nitrate (NO3 -) by bacterial action, a process that generates acidity. Natural sources contribute substantial quantities of pollutants to the air, including 50 million to 70 million tons per year of sulfur dioxide (from volcanoes, sea spray, and microbial processes) and 30 million to 40 million tons per year of nitrogen oxides (from lightning, the burning of biomass, and microbial processes). Anthropogenic sources per year are estimated at 115 million tons of sulfur dioxide, 60 million to 70 million tons of nitrogen oxides, and 50 million tons of ammonia .2 The vital difference between natural and anthropogenic sources is that anthropogenic sources are strongly concentrated in industrialized and agricultural regions, whereas the emissions from natural sources are spread out and are a part of the global environment. Levels of anthropogenic oxides have increased sixfold 2Karen C. Rice and Janet S.

(Source: National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NRSP-3). 2014. NADP Program Office, Illinois State Water Survey. 2204 Griffith Dr., Champaign, IL 61820.) UNDERSTANDING THE DATA In 2012, which states still had some regions where pH levels were lower than 4.5? since 1900, while levels of natural emissions have remained fairly constant. 3 As Figure 19\u20138 indicates, 5.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide were released into the air in 2013 in the United States; 92% was from fuel combustion (mostly from coal-burning power plants). Some 12.0 million tons of nitrogen oxides were released, 51% of which can be traced to transportation emissions and 41% to fuel combustion at fixed sites. In addition, 4.1 million tons of ammonia were released into the atmosphere from fertilizer use and livestock. Nitrogen oxides and ammonia are doubly damaging because the nitrogen contributes to eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems (Chapter 20). In the eastern United States, the source of much of the acid deposition was identified as the tall stacks of 50 huge, older coal-burning power plants located primarily in the Midwest. The tall stacks were built to alleviate local sulfur dioxide pollution at ground level. The good news is that many of these same plants are now reducing their emissions as a result of the Clean Air Act. Acid-generating emissions have decreased by 65% over the past 20 years, but there is obviously more that can be done. Of great significance, the pattern of sources has shifted from predominantly sulfur dioxide to nitrogen oxides and ammonia. On a global scale, air quality is improving in some countries, or even some parts of countries, and worsening in others. Figure 19\u201315 illustrates changes in fine particulates, 3S. J. Smith et al., \u201cAnthropogenic Sulfur Dioxide Emissions: 1850\u20132005,\u201d Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics 11 (2011): 1101\u20131116. one pollutant that represents a real danger to human health, a consideration we will discuss next as we look at the impacts of air pollution. Explain how secondary pollutants form. How do they differ from primary pollutants?

Data from the WHO show how the concentration of small particulate air pollutants in five countries changed between 2000 and 2012.", "(Source: Yale University Environmental Performance Index\u2014Air Pollution Map. 2014.) 19.3 Impacts of Air Pollutants Air pollution is an alphabet soup of gases and particles, mixed with the normal constituents of air. The amount of each pollutant present varies greatly, depending on its proximity to the source and various conditions of wind and weather. As a result, we are exposed to a mixture that varies in makeup and concentration from day to day\u2014even from hour to hour\u2014 and from place to place. Consequently, the effects we feel or observe are rarely, if ever, the effects of a single pollutant. Instead, they are the combined impact of the whole mixture of pollutants acting over our life span up to that point. For example, plants may be so stressed by pollution that they become more vulnerable to other environmental factors, such as drought or attack by insects. Humans may develop lung disease due to the combined effects of ozone and NOx. Given the complexity of this situation, it is often difficult to determine the role of any particular pollutant in causing an observed result. Nevertheless, some significant progress has been made in linking cause and effect. Figure 19\u201315 com pares the recent changes in air quality in several countries. Human Health The air-pollution disasters in Donora and London demonstrated that exposure to air pollution can be deadly. Every one of the primary and secondary air pollutants ( Table 19\u20131) is a threat to human health, particularly the health of the respiratory system (Figure 19\u201316). Health impacts of air pollution include asthma, chronic bronchitis, and cardiovascular problems. Acute exposure to some pollutants can be life threatening, but many effects are chronic, acting over a period of years to cause a gradual deterioration of physiological functions and eventual premature mortality. Moreover, some pollutants are carcinogenic, adding significantly to the risk of lung cancer as they are breathed into the lungs. Chronic Effects. Many people living in areas of urban air pollution suffer from chronic effects. Long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide can lead to bronchitis (inflammation of the bronchi). Chronic inhalation of ozone can cause inflammation and, ultimately, fibrosis of the lungs, a scarring that permanently impairs lung function. Carbon monoxide reduces the capacity of the blood to carry oxygen, and extended exposure to carbon monoxide can contribute to heart disease. Chronic exposure to nitrogen oxides impairs lung function and is known to affect the immune system, leaving the lungs open to attack by bacteria and viruses. Exposure to airborne particulate matter can bring on a broad range of health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular pathology. Other factors\u2014such as poor diet, lack of exercise, preexisting diseases, and individual genetic makeup\u2014may add to the effects of pollution to bring on adverse health outcomes. Those most sensitive to air pollution are small children, asthmatics, people with chronic pulmonary or heart disease, and the elderly. COPD. Exposure to one or a combination of these pollutants can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a slowly progressive lung disease that makes it increasingly hard to breathe. Close to 24 million people in the United States have impaired lung function, and COPD is the fourth leading cause of death (134,000 deaths/year). Worldwide, COPD afflicts up to 10% of adults ages 40 and older. The leading cause of this disease is smoking, but in many developing countries, the burning of wood and dung in indoor stoves for heating and cooking delivers much the same burden of pollutants as smoking to the women who tend the stoves and the children who are with them. COPD involves three separate disease processes: emphysema (destruction of the lung alveoli\u2014see Figure 19\u201316), bronchitis (inflammation and obstruction of the airways), and asthma. Asthma. Asthma is an immune-system disorder characterized by impaired breathing caused by constricted air passageways. Asthma episodes are triggered by contact with allergens (dust mites, molds, pet dander) and compounds in polluted air (ozone, particulate matter, SO2). According to the National Center for Health Statistics, almost 439,000 hospitalizations for asthma occur yearly, together with 2.1 million visits to hospital emergency departments. The highest prevalence is among children from birth to 4 years of age. The incidence of asthma in the United States peaked in 2003 and has since been dropping; currently it affects 26 million people (including 7 million children). Strong Evidence. Two key studies recently analyzed by the Health Effects Institute provide strong evidence of the harmful effects of fine particles and sulfur pollution.", "These studies followed thousands of adult subjects living in 154 U.S. cities for as long as 16 years. In the studies, higher concentrations of fine particles were correlated with increased mortality, especially from cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer. The more polluted the city, the higher the mortality. The studies were used by the EPA to step up its regulatory attention to fine particles. The United Nations Environmental Program has identified air pollution as the greatest worldwide environmental health hazard. Researchers at MIT estimated that health care expenses related to air pollution cost China $112 billion annually. Another report found that meeting EPA standards would save the United States $28 billion annually in reduced health care costs, missed work, school absences, and premature deaths. Mercury. One of the heavy-metal pollutants, mercury, deserves special attention. It is a toxic element, one that binds to key proteins in the body and can lead to many neurological disorders. In fetuses and small children, mercury impairs brain development. Power plants are the major source of mercury reaching the environment. Once it is present in aquatic ecosystems, mercury is converted into a highly toxic form, methylmercury, which accumulates in fish as a consequence of bioaccumulation (Chapter 13). In tests, the EPA reported methylmercury concentrations that exceeded recommendations in the game fish of 49% of lakes and reservoirs. Every state has advisories warning consumers about the dangers of mercury in locally caught fish. As we will see, the EPA has recently stepped up the regulatory restrictions on mercury releases from power plants. Worldwide, mercury pollution is a significant problem (Chapters 17, 21 ). 19.3 Impacts of Air Pollutants 479 alveolus Bronchiole with artery and vein Bronchus Right lung Blood capillary with red blood cells CO2 Bronchiole O2 Magnification about 250x (a) (b) Acute Effects. In severe cases, air pollution reaches levels that cause death, though such deaths usually occur among people already suffering from critical respiratory or heart disease. The gases present in air pollution are known to be lethal in high concentrations, but nowadays such concentrations occur only in cases of accidental poisoning. Nevertheless, intense air pollution puts an additional stress on the body, and if a person is already in a weakened condition (as are, for example, the elderly or asthmatics), this Trachea Pharynx Figure 19\u201316 The respiratory system. (a) In the lungs, air passages branch and rebranch and finally end in millions of tiny sacs called alveoli. These sacs are surrounded by capillaries. As blood passes through the capillaries, oxygen from inhaled air diffuses into the blood from the alveoli. Carbon dioxide diffuses in the reverse direction and leaves the body in the exhaled air. (b) On the left is normal lung tissue, and on the right is lung tissue from a person who suffered from emphysema, a chronic lung disease in which some of the structure of the lungs has broken down. Cigarette smoking and heavy air pollution are associated with the development of emphysema and other chronic lung diseases. additional stress may be fatal. Most of the deaths in air-pollution disasters reflect the acute effects of air pollution. However, recent research shows that even moderate air pollution can cause changes in the cardiac rhythms of people with heart disease, triggering fatal heart attacks. Carcinogenic Effects. The heavy-metal and organic constituents of air pollution include many chemicals known to be carcinogenic in high doses. According to the industrial reporting required by the EPA, 4.7 million tons of hazardous air pollutants (the air toxics\u2014see Table 19\u20131) are released annually into the air in the United States. The presence of trace amounts of these chemicals in the air may be responsible for a significant portion of the cancer observed in humans. One major source of such carcinogens is diesel exhaust (Figure 19\u201317). The EPA has classified diesel exhaust as a likely human carcinogen and has established the National Clean Diesel Campaign to reduce emissions from the current fleet of diesel trucks and establish standards for new diesel-powered engines. Figure 19\u201317 Diesel truck exhaust. Diesel truck exhaust is a major source of hazardous air pollutants as well as particulates, and the exhaust from diesel engines has been classified as a probable human carcinogen. In some cases, exposure to a pollutant can be linked directly to cancer and other health problems by way of epidemiological evidence. One pollutant that clearly and indisputably is correlated with cancer and other disorders is benzene.", "This organic chemical is present in motor fuels and is also used as a solvent for fatty substances and in the manufacture of detergents, explosives, and pharmaceuticals. Benzene is released into the environment by the combustion of fossil fuels, particularly by the burning of coal and oil and in the emissions of motor vehicles. Benzene is also present in tobacco smoke, which accounts for half of the public\u2019s exposure to the chemical. The EPA has classified benzene as a known human carcinogen, linked to leukemia in persons encountering the chemical through occupational exposure. Chronic exposure to benzene can also lead to numerous blood disorders and damage to the immune system. The Environment Experiments show that plants are even more sensitive to air pollutants than are humans. Before emissions were controlled, it was common to see wide areas of totally barren land or severely damaged vegetation downwind from smelters and coal-burning power plants. The pollutant responsible was usually sulfur dioxide. Crop Damage. Nowadays, damage to crops, orchards, and forests downwind of urban centers is caused mainly by exposure to ozone. The ozone gains access to plants through their stomata, the respiratory pores in all plant leaves. Symptoms of ozone damage include black flecking and yellowing of leaves (Figure 19\u201318). Crops vary in their susceptibility to ozone, but damage to many important crops (such as soybeans, corn, and wheat) is observed at common ambient levels of ozone (Figure 19\u201319). Unfortunately, ozone levels are highest in summer, when crops are growing, and rural areas often experience high ozone levels as ozone forms downwind of pollution sources. In the United States, ozone causes crop losses of $1\u20133 billion annually. Worldwide, ozone exposure destroys 8\u201314% of the soybean crop. Much of the world\u2019s grain production occurs in regions that receive enough ozone pollution to reduce crop yields. India is experiencing severe ozone pollution. In 2005, ozone damaged an estimated 6.7 million tons of Indian rice, wheat, soybeans, and cotton; that wheat and rice alone would have been enough to feed 94 million people. 4 Forest Damage. The negative impact of air pollution on wild plants and forest trees may be even greater than on agricultural crops. 4Sachin D. Ghude et al., \u201cReductions in India\u2019s Crop Yield Due to Ozone,\u201d Geophysical Research Letters (2014) 41: 5685\u20135691. Figure 19\u201318 Ambient ozone injury. This potato leaf shows the black flecking symptomatic of ozone damage. (Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service. Effects of Ozone Air Pollution on Plants. 2009. www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm? docid=12462. ) 19.3 Impacts of Air Pollutants 481 PROPORTIONAL YIELD RESPONSE Crop Yield (%) 100% 80% 60% 40% Ozone Damage. Studies have shown that ozone damage to forest trees begins at about 40 ppb and gets more intense with higher levels. In California and southern Appalachian forests, ozone levels often reached 60 ppb and above, and seasonal losses in tree stem growth in the latter were measured at 30\u201350% for most species. Studies in European forests found that ozone stress affects photosynthetic carbon uptake, increases respiration of foliage, amplifies water loss, and generally disrupts carbon and nutrient metabolism. In sum, research has suggested that as temperatures climb and moisture is less predictable under conditions of expected global climate change, ozone levels will have an increasingly serious impact on forest growth. Damage from Acid Deposition. From the Green Mountains of Vermont to the San Bernardino Mountains of California, the die-off of forest trees in the 1980s caused great concern. Red spruce forests were especially vulnerable. In New England, 1.3 million acres of high-elevation forests were devastated. Commonly, the damaged trees lost needles as acidic water drew calcium from them, rendering them more susceptible to winter freezing. Sugar maples, important forest trees in the Northeast, have shown extensive mortality, ranging from 20\u201380% of all trees in some forests. Much of the damage to forests from acid precipitation is due to chemical interactions within the forest soils. Sustained acid precipitation at first adds nitrogen and sulfur to the soils, which stimulate tree growth. In time, though, these chemicals leach out large quantities of the buffering chemicals (usually calcium and magnesium salts). When these buffering salts no longer neutralize the acid rain, aluminum ions, which are toxic, are dissolved from minerals in the soil. The combination of aluminum and the increasing scarcity of calcium, which is essential to plant growth, leads to reduced tree growth.", "Research at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire has shown a marked reduction in calcium and magnesium in 20 40 60 80100 Seasonal Ozone Concentration (ppb) Figure 19\u201319 Ozone impact on crop yields. Some crop species react more strongly to ozone than others. (Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service: Effects of Ozone Air Pollution on Plants. 2009. www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=12462.) the forest soils from the 1960s on, which is reflected in the amount of calcium in tree rings over the same period. The net result of these changes has been a decline in forest growth. Experimental liming of soils in forests showing maple tree dieback was able to restore the trees to health, and aluminum ion concentrations were seen to decrease greatly. Although acid deposition has declined since the 1980s, few studies have tracked the recovery of terrestrial ecosystems. Impacts on Aquatic Ecosystems. Some 50 years ago, anglers started noticing sharp declines in fish populations in many lakes in Sweden, Ontario, and the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. As the ecological damage continued to spread, scientists looked for the cause. Since that time, studies have revealed many ways in which air pollution\u2014especially acid deposition\u2014alters and may destroy aquatic ecosystems. The pH of an environment is extremely critical because it affects the function of virtually all enzymes, hormones, and other proteins in the bodies of all organisms living in that environment. Ordinarily, organisms are able to regulate their internal pH within the narrow limits necessary to function properly. A consistently low environmental pH, however, often overwhelms the regulatory mechanisms in many life forms, thus weakening or killing them. Most freshwater lakes, ponds, and streams have a natural pH in the range from 6 to 8, and organisms have adapted accordingly. The eggs, sperm, and developing young of these organisms are especially sensitive to changes in pH. Most are severely stressed, and many die, if the environmental pH shifts as little as one unit from the optimum. As aquatic ecosystems become acidified, a shift occurs from acid-sensitive to acid-tolerant species. The acid-sensitive species die off, either because the acidified water kills them or because it keeps them from reproducing. Figure 19\u201312 shows that acid precipitation may leach aluminum and various heavy metals from the soil as the water percolates through it. Normally, the presence of these elements in the soil does not pose a problem because they are bound in insoluble mineral compounds and, therefore, are not absorbed by organisms. As the compounds are dissolved by low-pH water, however, the metals are freed. They may then be absorbed by and are highly toxic to both plants and animals. For example, mercury tends to accumulate in fish as lake waters become more acidic. Acid deposition hit some regions especially hard in the latter part of the 20th century. In Ontario, Canada, approximately 1,200 lakes lost their fish life. In the Adirondacks, 346 lakes were without fish in 1990. In New England and the eastern Catskills, more than 1,000 lakes have suffered from recent acidification. The physical appearance of highly acidified lakes is deceiving. From the surface, they are clear and blue, the outward signs of a healthy condition. However, the only life found below the surface is acid-loving mosses growing on the bottom. Neutralizing Capacity. As Figure 19\u201314a indicates, wide regions of eastern North America receive substantial amounts of acid precipitation, yet not all areas have acidified lakes. Apparently, many areas remain healthy, whereas others have become acidified to the point of becoming lifeless. How is this possible? The key lies in the system\u2019s acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). Despite the addition of acid, a system may be protected from changes in pH by a neutralizer\u2014a buffer that, when present in a solution, has a large capacity to absorb hydrogen ions and thus maintain the pH at a relatively constant value. Limestone (CaCO3) is a natural acid neutralizer ( Figure 19\u201320) that protects lakes from the effects of acid precipitation in many areas of the North American continent, particularly in the Midwest. Lakes and streams receiving their water from rain and melted snow that have percolated through soils derived from limestone will contain dissolved limestone. The regions that are sensitive to acid precipitation are those containing much granitic rock, which does not yield good ANC. The good news is that the sensitive regions Figure 19\u201320 Acid neutralizing. Acids may be neutralized by certain nonbasic compounds.", "A chemical such as limestone (calcium carbonate) reacts with hydrogen ions as shown. Hence, the pH of a lake or river remains close to neutral, despite the additional acid, when it contains adequate acid neutralizing capacity. (New England, the Adirondacks, the Northern Appalachian Plateau) are recovering their ANC, and the percentage of acidic lakes has declined in the past 18 years. 5 The decline is consistent with the decrease in acid deposition in these regions, which has been brought about by the reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions mandated by the Clean Air Act. Effects on Materials and Aesthetics. Walls, windows, and other exposed surfaces turn gray and dingy as particulates settle on them. Paints and fabrics deteriorate more rapidly, and the sidewalls of tires and other rubber products become hard and checkered with cracks because of oxidation by ozone. Metal corrosion is increased dramatically by sulfur dioxide and acids derived from sulfur and nitrogen oxides, as are weathering and the deterioration of stonework. Limestone and marble (which forms from limestone) are favored materials for the outsides of buildings and for monuments. The reaction between acid deposition and limestone is causing these structures to erode at a tremendously accelerated pace. Monuments that have stood for hundreds or even thousands of years with little change are now crumbling away ( Figure 19\u201321). The corrosion of buildings, monuments, and outdoor equipment by acid precipitation costs billions of dollars for replacement and 5Executive Office of the President, National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program Report to Congress 2011: An Integrated Assessment, USGS, 2011, http:// ny.water.usgs.gov.

The corrosive effects of acids from air pollutants are dissolving away the features of many monuments and statues, as seen in the angel perched on the flying buttress of this church. repair each year in the United States. In an extreme case of corrosion, a 37-foot bronze Buddha in Kamakura, Japan, is slowly dissolving away as precipitation from Korea and China bathes the statue in highly acidic rain. Visibility. A clear blue sky and good visibility can have a deep psychological impact on people. Can a value be put on these benefits? Many of us spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours commuting long distances to work so that we can live in a less polluted environment than the one in which we work. Ironically, the resulting traffic and congestion cause much of the very pollution we are trying to escape. In an encouraging move, the EPA established a Regional Haze Rule in 1999, aimed at improving the visibility at 156 national parks and wilderness areas. The regulations call on all 50 states to establish goals for improving visibility and to develop long-term strategies for reducing the emissions (especially particles) that cause the problem. International Effects. Although atmospheric oxides in the United States have dropped significantly, pollutants still come back down as acid deposition, generally to the east of their origin because of the way weather systems flow. The deposits cross national boundaries, too. As a result, Canada receives half of its acid deposition from the United States, and Scandinavia gets it mostly from Great Britain and other western European nations. Japan receives the wind-borne pollution from widespread coal burning in Korea and China. For good reason, the problem of acid deposition has been addressed at national and international levels. Accordingly, we turn next to the efforts made to curb air pollution. CONCEPT CHECK Would you expect the effects of acid rain to be greater in an area where the bedrock is limestone (calcium carbonate) or where it is granite? Why? \u2610\u2713 19.4 Bringing Air Pollution Under Control By the 1960s, it was obvious that pollutants produced by humans were overloading natural cleansing processes in the atmosphere. The unrestricted discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere could no longer be tolerated. As a result, Congress produced several important regulations to control air pollution. Those regulations were highly effective. By 2014, scientists were finding that several critical air pollutants, including those that cause acid rain, were declining in the United States. The changes were so dramatic that rain was increasing over cities where smog had dampened it, and the waters of the Chesapeake Bay were getting cleaner. Although air pollution remains a problem, the improvement in air quality in much of the United States over the last few decades is one of the success stories of the modern environmental movement.", "Let\u2019s begin by looking at some of the public policies that brought about that improvement. 19.4 Bringing Air Pollution Under Control 483 Clean Air Act Federal legislation regarding air pollution was first introduced in 1955 as the Air Pollution Control Act. Several minor amendments followed until, under grassroots pressure from citizens, the U.S. Congress enacted a major bill, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 (CAA). Together with amendments passed in 1977 and 1990, this law, administered by the EPA, represents the foundation of U.S. air-pollution control efforts. The act called for identifying the most widespread pollutants, setting ambient standards (levels that need to be achieved to protect environmental and human health), and establishing control methods and timetables to meet standards. Air Quality Standards. The CAA mandated the setting of standards for four of the primary pollutants\u2014particulates, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides\u2014 and for the secondary pollutant ozone. At the time, these five pollutants were recognized as the most widespread and objectionable ones. Today, with the addition of lead, they are known as the criteria pollutants and are covered by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) ( Table 19\u20133) . The primary standard for each pollutant is based on the presumed highest level that can be tolerated by humans without noticeable ill effects, minus a 10\u201350% margin of safety. For some of the pollutants, long-term and short-term levels are set. The short-term levels are designed to protect against acute effects, while the long-term standards are designed to protect against chronic effects and damage to crops, animals, vegetation, and buildings. The EPA is required to review the pollutants every five years and make adjustments if the science justifies changes. Emission Standards. In addition, the CAA required the EPA to establish National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for a number of toxic substances (the air toxics). The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 greatly extended this section of the EPA\u2019s regulatory work by specifically naming 187 toxic air pollutants for the agency to track and regulate. The EPA tracks both the criteria pollutants and the hazardous air pollutants in a database, the National Emissions Inventory. This database serves as an essential source of information for the EPA in carrying out its regulatory responsibilities. Control Strategy. The basic strategy of the 1970 Clean Air Act was to regulate the emissions of air pollutants so that the ambient criteria pollutants would remain below the primary standard levels. This approach is called commandand-control because regulations were enacted requiring industry to achieve a set limit on each pollutant through the use of specific control equipment. The assumption was that human and environmental health could be significantly improved by a reduction in the output of pollutants. If a particular region was in violation for a given pollutant, a local government agency would track down the source(s) and order reductions in emissions until the region came into compliance. Unfortunately, this strategy proved difficult to implement. Most of the regulatory responsibility fell on the states and cities, which were often unable or unwilling to enforce control. In spite of these difficulties, however, total air pollutants were reduced by some 25% during a time when both population and economic activity increased substantially, and even in the noncompliant regions, the severity of air-pollution episodes lessened. Accordingly, some significant changes were made in the law and in the regulations that followed. 1990 Amendments. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) targeted specific pollutants more directly and enforced compliance more aggressively, through such means as the imposition of sanctions. As with the earlier law, the states do much of the work in carrying out the mandates of the 1990 act. Each state must develop a State Implementation Plan (SIP) that is designed to reduce the emissions of every NAAQS pollutant whose control stan dard (Table 19\u20133) has not been attained. One major change was the addition of a permit application process: Polluters must apply for a permit that identifies the kinds of pollutants they release, the quantities of those pollutants, and the steps they are taking to reduce pollution. Permit fees provide funds the states can use to support their air-pollution control activities. Under the CAAA, regions of the United States that have failed to attain the required levels must submit attainment plans based on reasonably available control technology (RACT) measures. Offending regions must convince the EPA that the standards will be reached within a certain time frame.", "The state SIPs and attainment performances are enforced by EPA sanctions that impose costly withholding of federal funds in case of failures. Dealing with the Pollutants The Clean Air Act and its amendments give the EPA broad authority to write regulations for reducing air pollutants, using a process known as rulemaking. The process involves a proposed rule stage and a final rule stage. The EPA will give notice first of a proposed rule, which allows a period of one to three months for public review and comments. Next, the agency is required to consider the comments received. When the final rule is published, responses to the comments are usually discussed, and any changes made on the basis of the comments are noted. Then the final rule is published in the Federal Register (available on the Internet), the official daily publication for a host of federal notices, regulations, executive orders, and other presidential documents. Once published, a final rule has the force of law until it is amended or repealed. We will consider the air pollution regulations by the different categories of pollutants. Reducing Particulates. Prior to the 1970s, the major sources of particulates were industrial stacks and the open burning of refuse. The CAA mandated the phaseout of open burning of refuse and required that particulates from industrial stacks be reduced to \u201cno visible emissions.\u201d To reduce stack emissions, industries were required to install filters, electrostatic precipitators, and other devices (though many facilities in place before the 1970 CAA were exempted). These measures markedly reduced the levels of particulates since the 1970s, but particulates continued to be released from steel mills, power plants, cement plants, smelters, construction sites, and diesel engines. Wood-burning stoves and wood and grass fires also contribute to the particulate load, making regulation even more difficult. Before 1987, the NAAQS particulate standard was \u201ctotal suspended particulates.\u201d In 1987, this was replaced by the PM10 standard (all particles 10 micrometers or less in diameter), based on the understanding at the time of particles that could reach the interior regions of the respiratory tract. The EPA added a new ambient air quality standard for particulates\u2014PM2.5\u2014in 1997, on the basis of information indicating that smaller particulate matter (less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) has the greatest effect on health. The coarser material (PM10) is still regulated but is not considered to play as significant a role in health problems as do the finer particles. There is overwhelming evidence that the finer particles (2.5 microns or less) go right into the lungs when breathed. In response to this evidence, the EPA revised the particulate standard in 2006, reducing the amount of PM2.5 to which a person could be exposed in 24 hours to 35 \u03bcg/m3. In 2012, the EPA lowered the annual exposure standard to 12\u201313 \u03bcg/m3. 19.4 Bringing Air Pollution Under Control 485 SOUND SCIENCE Figure 19\u201322 Air toxics monitoring station. A radiation monitor-ing device has been added to this air toxics monitoring station located on the grounds of a school in Anaheim, California. Controlling Air Toxics. By EPA estimates, the amount of air toxics emitted annually into the air in the United States is around 4.7 million tons. These come from stationary sources (factories, refineries, power plants), mobile sources (cars, trucks, buses), and indoor sources (solvents, building materials). Cancer and other adverse health effects, environmental contamination, and catastrophic chemical accidents are the major concerns associated with this category of pollutants. Under the CAAA, Congress identified 187 toxic pollutants. It then directed the EPA to identify major sources of these pollutants and to develop maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards, the NESHAPs. Besides affecting control technologies, the standards include options for substituting nontoxic chemicals, giving industry some flexibility in meeting MACT goals. State and local air-pollution authorities are responsible for seeing that industrial plants achieve the goals. In response to the CAAA, the EPA has mobilized more than 300 monitoring sites to track emissions of the affected substances (Figure 19\u201322). To reduce the contribution from vehicles, the agency requires cleaner burning fuels (reformulated gasoline) in urban areas. Industrial sources are being addressed by setting emission standards for some 82 categories of stationary sources, such as paper mills and oil refineries. After years of piecemeal and delayed regulations, the EPA published final rules in December 2011 that for the first time forced the older coal- and oil-fired power plants to control their pollutants.", "The major focus of these new standards is mercury, a contaminant in coal and oil that is released into the air when these fuels are burned. The standards\u2014the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards\u2014require all coal- and oil-fired power plants to limit their emissions of mercury, acid gases, and other metallic toxic pollutants, preventing 90% of the mercury and 88% of acid gases from being emitted. Because of the controls needed to accomplish these reductions, emissions of SO2 and fine particles are also greatly reduced. These new controls are estimated to save between $37\u2013$90 billion and prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths per year; the estimated cost to industry to effect these controls is $9.6 billion per year. There have been a series of appeals to these rules, but as of 2014 the rules had been upheld. Limiting Pollutants from Motor Vehicles. Cars, trucks, and buses release nearly half of the pollutants that foul our air. Vehicle exhaust sends out VOCs, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides that lead to ground-level ozone and peroxyacetyl nitrates (PANs). Additional VOCs come from the evaporation of gasoline and oil vapors from fuel tanks and engine systems. The 1970 CAA mandated a 90% reduction in these emissions by 1975. This timing proved to be unrealistic, but enough improvements have been made over the years that today\u2019s new cars have actually achieved a 90% emissions reduction. This improvement is fortunate because driving in the United States has been increasing much more rapidly than the population has. Between 1970 and 2011, the number of vehicle miles increased from 1 trillion to 3 trillion miles per year, and between 1980 and 2010, the number of registered vehicles increased more than 56%. It is hard to imagine what the air would be like without the improvements mandated by the CAA. Emissions. The reductions in automobile emissions have been achieved with a general reduction in the size of passenger vehicles, along with a considerable array of pollution-control devices, among which is one that affords the computerized control of fuel mixture and ignition timing, allowing more complete combustion of fuel and decreasing VOC emissions. To this day, however, the most significant control device on cars is the catalytic converter ( Figure 19\u201323). As exhaust passes through this device, two different catalysts are at work: a reduction catalyst that converts NOx emissions to harmless nitrogen gas and an oxidation catalyst that oxidizes unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. All vehicles used for personal transportation, up to larger SUVs and passenger vans, are subject to specific emissions standards. These are the emissions that are tested by state-certified inspection stations, now required in most states. Gases Heat shield from engine To exhaust pipe Air from air pump Oxidation catalyst to remove CO and hydrocarbons Figure 19\u201323 Cutaway of a catalytic converter. Engine gas is routed through the converter, where catalysts promote chemical reactions that change the harmful hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides into less harmful gases, such as carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen.

Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends: 1975 Through 2011. EPA-420-R-12-001a, March 2012.) Efficiency. Although the Clean Air Act does not address fuel efficiency, it is obvious that less fuel burned means fewer pollutants emitted. Two negative factors have affected fuel efficiency and consumption rates. First, the elimination of federal speed limits in 1996 reduced fuel efficiencies because of the higher speeds. Second, the sale of light trucks, including sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), minivans, and pickup trucks, surged in the 1990s and early 2000s. The EPA adjusts its estimate of the fuel economy of each model year based on real-world values for different types of vehicles, such as automobiles and light trucks. These fuel efficiencies have been increasing, in part because of government standards (Figure 19\u201324). CAFE Standards. Under the authority of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 and its amendments, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was given the authority to set corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for motor vehicles. The intention of the law was to conserve oil and promote energy security.", "The standard set in 1984 for passenger cars required a fleet average of 27.5 mpg. The standard for light trucks (pickups, SUVs, minivans) was set at 20.7 mpg and eventually raised to 22.2 mpg. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated a new CAFE fuel economy standard of 35 mpg for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks, to be achieved by 2020. In 2009, the EPA set more stringent standards with an expectation that fuel economy standards would increase yearly. Greenhouse gas emission standards were also set and a new set of CAFE standards was rolled out: the combined fleet would have to achieve a 54.5 mpg and 163 g/mile CO2 emissions target by 2025. Getting Around. Even though many Americans continue to drive SUVs and larger automobiles, there are definite signs of change. One option for drivers who want better mileage is the hybrid electric vehicle, which combines a 19.4 Bringing Air Pollution Under Control 487 conventional gasoline engine and a battery-powered electric motor to achieve substantial improvements in fuel economy. Such vehicles have been marketed by car manufacturers, including Honda, Toyota, Ford, and GM, for more than a decade and are the most fuel-efficient cars in the United States. The Toyota Prius averages 46 mpg, while the Honda Insight gets 43 mpg, according to EPA figures. As more and more of the new hybrids are sold, prices are expected to drop substantially. For a time, a federal tax credit was available for hybrid buyers that offset much of the cost differential. Many states still offer tax incentives for hybrid buyers. Another trend is the development of plug-in hybrid cars and electric cars. The plug-in hybrid has a larger battery pack than the conventional hybrid and can be driven up to 40 miles on a charge; after that, a down-sized gasoline engine either recharges the battery or serves as the source of propulsion. Electric vehicles are just that\u2014all electric, with rechargeable batteries that give the vehicle a range up to 100 miles, depending on the speed of driving. Both in-home and commercial charging stations are becoming available to enable speedy recharging of the batteries. Managing Ozone. Because ozone is a secondary pollutant, the only way to control ozone levels is to address the compounds that lead to ozone formation. For a long time, it was assumed that the best way to reduce these levels was simply to reduce emissions of VOCs. The steps pertaining to motor vehicles in the CAAA addressed the sources of about half of the VOC emissions. Point sources (industries) accounted for another 45% of such emissions, and area sources (numerous small emitters, such as dry cleaners, print shops, and users of household products) represented the remaining 5%. These efforts have been effective. Since passage of the CAAA, VOC emissions have declined by 50%. However, recent understanding of the complex chemical reactions involving NOx, VOCs, and oxygen has thrown some uncertainty into the strategy of simply emphasizing a reduction in VOCs. The problem is that both NOx and VOC concentrations are crucial to the generation of ozone ( Figure 19\u201311). Either one can become the rate-limiting factor in the reaction that forms ozone. Thus, as the ratio of VOCs to NOx changes, the concentration of NOx can become the controlling chemical factor, pointing to the need to reduce NOx emissions as well. New Ozone Standards? A revised ozone standard was proposed in 1997, but a court battle delayed its implementation until 2004. Cost-benefit estimates indicated that the anticipated health benefits would far outweigh the costs of compliance. In 2008 the EPA lowered the ozone exposure standard, and in 2015 there was a proposal to lower it still further. As we find out more about the impact of ground-level ozone, our understanding of its dangers increases. Down with NOx. In a response to petitions from states in the Northeast that were having trouble achieving the ambient standards for ozone and particulates because of outof-state emissions, the EPA has implemented regulations to reduce NOx emissions from mobile sources, power plants, and large industrial boilers and turbines. These regulations require SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks to be held to the same emissions criteria as passenger cars. In all, these changes represent an 83% reduction over the 2003 standards. Protecting Downwind States.", "States in the eastern half of the country continue to bear the burden of pollutants that are carried long distances by wind and weather, making it more difficult for them to attain the NAAQS levels for ozone and particulate matter. To address this, the EPA announced a new rule in 2005 to accomplish further reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) set lower caps on SO2 and NOx in 28 states in the Midwest and East, many of which are upwind of states that have not attained the emissions standards for ozone and particulate matter. CAIR was expected to reduce SO2 emissions by 50% beginning in 2010 and by 65% beginning in 2015. NOx emissions were expected to be reduced by similar percentages. By 2012, SO2 emissions had been reduced by 68% and NOx emissions by 53%. CAIR received a legal setback when a federal appeals court overturned the CAIR regulations. In response, the EPA, numerous states, and the Environmental Defense Fund successfully petitioned the court to reconsider its decision. In 2008, the court reversed its ruling and kept CAIR in force. The Next Generation Legislation. In 2011, the EPA announced the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to replace CAIR. This rule addresses the same pollutants as CAIR and several additional states in the Midwest ( Figure 19\u201325). The rule required reductions in NOx and SO2 to begin in 2012 and tighten further in 2014, with the final reductions in power plant SO2 emissions of 73% from 2005 levels and NOx reductions of 54%. The rule involves some significant improvements in the manner in which upwind states are required to protect downwind states. The ruling States controlled for both fine particles (annual SO2 and NOX) and ozone (ozone season NOX) (20 States) States controlled for fine particles only (annual SO2 and NOX) (3 States) States controlled for ozone only (ozone season NOX) (5 States) States not covered by the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Figure 19\u201325 Map of states covered by the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). The CSAPR is the 2011 EPA rule that replaces the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), designed to prevent downwind states from suffering from NOx and SO2 pollutants. (Source: EPA CSAPR Fact Sheet. www.epa.gov/airtransport/statesmap.html. May 2, 2011.) was challenged in 2012 and briefly suspended but ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court. In 2015, the EPA rolled out a new schedule for power plant compliance. Cap-and-Trade. To accomplish the emissions reductions, both CAIR and CSAPR involve a system that was first implemented with the Acid Rain Program (ARP), called cap-and-trade. A target cap, or budget, is set by EPA for SO2 or NOx, in units of millions of tons of emissions. At the start, power plants are granted emission allowances based on formulas in the regulations. The plants are free to choose how they will achieve their allowances, whether by installing emissions control systems or purchasing allowances from utilities that are under their budgeted allowance. The impacts of these regulations for human health are significant. The EPA projected that the regulations would prevent 13,000 to 34,000 premature deaths, 15,000 nonfatal heart attacks, and 400,000 cases of aggravated asthma in 2014. The monetary benefits were estimated at $120 billion to $280 billion per year, while the costs of implementation were projected to be approximately $2.4 billion per year. 6 Coping with Acid Deposition Scientists working on acid-rain issues in the 1980s calculated that a 50% reduction in acid-causing emissions in the United States would effectively prevent further acidification of the environment. This reduction was not expected to correct the already bad situations, but together with natural buffering processes, it was estimated to be capable of preventing further environmental deterioration. Because about 50% of acid-producing emissions came from coal-burning power plants, control strategies focused on these sources. Political Developments. Although evidence of the link between power-plant emissions and acid deposition was well established by the early 1980s, no legislative action was taken until 1990. The problem was one of different regional interests. Throughout the 1980s, a coalition of politicians from the Midwestern states, representatives of high-sulfur coal producers, and representatives from the electric power industry effectively blocked all attempts at passing legislation that would take action on acid deposition.", "On the other side were New York and the New England states, as well as most of the environmental and scientific communities, which argued that it was necessary to address acid deposition and that the best way to do so was to control emissions from power plants. Also, since 70% of Canada\u2019s acid-deposition problem came from the United States, diplomatic pressure toward a resolution was applied. With the passage of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, the controversy became history. However, two decades of action were lost because of political delays. Eventually, Canada and the United States signed a treaty stipulating that Canada would cut its power plant SO2 emissions by half and cap them at 3.5 million tons by the year 2000. Canada has done well; its 6EPA, Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), www.epa.gov/airtransport/. February 27, 2015. emissions are now about 1.8 million tons and are expected to stay down. So has the United States. Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. One of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, Title IV, addressed the acid-deposition problem by mandating reductions in both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide levels. The major provisions of the Title IV Acid Rain Program (ARP) included the following: Accomplishments of Title IV. The utilities industry has responded to the new law with three actions: SO2 EMISSIONS FROM CAIR SO2 ANNUAL PROGRAM AND ACID RAIN PROGRAM SOURCES, 1980\u20132010 1980 1990 1995 2000 2005 2008 2009 2010 19.4 Bringing Air Pollution Under Control 489 containing lime. SO2 reacts with the lime and is precipitated as calcium sulfate (CaSO4). Because the technology for high-efficiency scrubbing is well established, more and more power plants are installing scrubbers, which have been required for all coal-burning power plants built after 1977. 3. Many utilities are trading their emission allowances. The purchase of allowances often represents a less costly way to achieve compliance than by purchasing low-sulfur coal or adding a scrubber. A typical transaction might involve a trade in the rights to emit 10,000 tons of sulfur dioxide at a cost of $19 a ton. The combination of approaches has created so many efficiencies that it has cut compliance costs to 10% of what was expected. To carry out Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments, the EPA initiated a two-phase approach. Phase I aimed at a reduction of 3.5 million tons of SO2 by 2000. Remarkably, the goal was met and even exceeded\u2014at a cost far below the gloomy industry predictions ( Figure 19\u201326). Phase II began in 2000 and targeted the remaining sources of SO2 in order to reach the 8.9-million-ton cap by 2010. This goal was met for the first time in 2007, when power plant SO2 emissions totaled 8.9 million tons of SO2. The emissions continue to drop, falling to 5.17 million tons in 2010, as CAIR reductions have been implemented and as more and more power plants have switched from coal to natural gas. This is a decrease of 67% from 1990 levels ( Figure 19\u201326). The 2001 goal for a 2-million-ton reduction in NOx emissions by fixed sources was met in 2000 and every year since; in fact, reductions in emissions of NOx are more than double the Title IV reduction objective. The Acid Rain Reduction Program was responsible for a large portion of these reductions, but the CAIR has also played a significant role in recent years, as we have seen. Figure 19\u201326 Power plant SO2 emissions covered under the Acid Rain and CAIR programs. Emissions from all power plants were under ARP allowances for the first time in 2006 and even more so in 2007. (Source: Executive Office of the President. National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program Report to Congress 2011: An Integrated Assessment. USGS, 2011. http://ny.water.usgs.gov.) Field News. The news from the field reflects the trends. Under the Acid Rain Program, air quality has improved, with significant benefits to human health, reductions in acid deposition, some recovery of freshwater lakes and streams, and improved forest conditions. Concentrations of sulfate in rain and deposition on the land have shown a significant decline (41\u201369%) over a large part of the eastern United States in the past 18 years. The acidified streams and lakes of the Adirondacks and New England have seen some recovery, in the form of pH increases and increases in acid neutralizing capacity. One reason for the slow recovery is the continued impact of nitrogen deposition.", "Apparently, nitrogen plays a much larger role in acid deposition than was once believed. In passing the CAAA, Congress did not set curbs on nitrogen emissions, but simply opted to reduce the emissions from fixed sources. The other reason for the slow recovery is the long-term buildup of sulfur deposits in soils. It takes a long time for residual sulfur to be flushed from natural ecosystems. Accordingly, most scientists believe that the recovery of the affected ecosystems will require further reductions in both sulfur and nitrogen emissions. Acid rain still falls on eastern forests, as Figure 19\u201314b indicates. International Regulation of Air Pollution Overall, the Clean Air Act has been a tremendous success in the United States. The Acid Rain Program alone reduced SO2 by 40% over 20 years, as well as reducing NOx, PM2.5 particulates, and ozone. This occurred while output from coal-fired power plants increased by 25%. Yet as we have seen, global air pollution has skyrocketed. Air pollution problems cross boundaries and clearly affect people worldwide. Many countries lack the strong environmental regulations we have (although some have stronger regulations). International treaties are one way of coordinating efforts to care for the global commons of the atmosphere. There are international treaties about climate change (Chapter 18 ) and the loss of the ozone layer (discussed shortly). The most important other air pollution treaty is The Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Pollution (LRTAP), which was rolled out in 1979. Forty-four countries, including the United States, have signed this treaty, which includes some recently added provisions limiting specific pollutants. In 1981, an existing international agreement about aviation (from 1944) was amended to limit aircraft engine emissions. The European Union. Since the 1970s, the European Union has made air pollution a priority. Research there found that poor air quality is the leading environmental cause of premature death in the EU. While European countries are sovereign nations, they act in concert on many issues. For years they have had joint emissions standards and expectations that individual countries will monitor their own air and make plans to meet air quality standards. In 2013, the EU adopted a new Clean Air Programme for Europe, which includes plans to lower air pollution to specific targets by 2030. Regional Air Pollution Networks. The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has helped countries in several regions form networks to protect air quality. These include the Lusaka Agreement on air quality in southern Africa and similar agreements for eastern Africa and the combined region of central and western Africa. In Asia, the UNEP helped bring about the Mal\u00e9 Declaration on Air Pollution and a treaty on the control of haze pollution caused by clearing forests. In central Asia, the UNEP worked with countries to produce an environmental treaty considering air pollution as a major issue. In Latin America, it worked with the environmental ministers of countries to produce a joint statement on preventing air pollution. These international collaborations are moving air pollution out of the realm of separate nations and into the arena of coordination and cooperation among states. Sustainable Development Goals and Air Quality. Air pollution comes up in larger international planning efforts as well. Chapter 9 of Agenda 21, the 1992 document from the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, was titled \u201cProtection of the Atmosphere.\u201d Although the Sustainable Development Goals do not have a specific goal for the protection of the atmosphere, Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) has this target: \u201cBy 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination.\u201d Achieving the targets for at least six of the other Sustainable Development Goals will require improved air quality. What evidence do we have that the Clean Air Act was successful? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 19.5 Destruction of the Ozone Layer The stratospheric ozone layer protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. The depletion of this layer is another major atmospheric challenge that is the result of human technology. Environmental scientists have traced the problem to a widely used group of chemicals: the chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. As with global warming, there were skeptics who were unconvinced that the problem was serious. However, scientists have achieved a strong consensus on the ozone depletion problem, reflected in the work of the Scientific Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol.", "In 2010, this panel concluded that the Montreal Protocol is working as intended: There is clear evidence of a decrease in the atmospheric concentration of ozone-depleting substances and some early signs of stratospheric ozone recovery. Antarctic ozone levels are projected to return to normal levels around 2060\u20132075. 7 Radiation and Importance of the Shield Solar radiation emits electromagnetic waves with a wide range of energies and wavelengths ( Figure 19\u201327) .

Ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths are slightly shorter than the wavelengths of violet light, which are the shortest wavelengths visible to the human eye. UVB radiation consists of wavelengths that range from 280 to 315 nanometers (0.28 \u03bcm to 0.32 \u03bcm), whereas UVA radiation is from 315 to 400 nanometers (0.32 \u03bcm to 0.40 mm). Because energy is inversely related to wavelength, UVB is more energetic and, therefore, more dangerous, but UVA can also cause damage. Upon penetrating the atmosphere and being absorbed The effects of chronic exposure to the Sun are heightened by the loss of the ozone layer. The EPA publishes daily forecasts of UV exposure, issued by the Weather Service for regions across the country. The goal of this service is to remind people of the dangers of UV radiation and to prompt them to take appropriate actions, such as wearing sunglasses, protective clothing, and sunscreen, to avoid acute UV exposure. Ozone in the Atmosphere by biological tissues, UV radiation damages protein and 35 DNA molecules at the surfaces of all living things. (This damage is what occurs when you get a sunburn.) If the full amount of UV radiation falling on the stratosphere reached 30 Earth\u2019s surface, it is doubtful that any life could survive. We are spared the more damaging effects from UV rays because 25 most UV radiation (more than 99%) is absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere. For that reason, stratospheric ozone is com monly referred to as the ozone shield ( Figure 19\u201328).

So are eye damage, cataracts, and blindness. The most serious impact of chronic exposure to the Sun is skin cancer; more than 1 million new cases occur each year in the United States, according to the National 5 Ozone Concentration Cancer Institute. Melanoma is the most deadly of the three Figure 19\u201328 Ozone in the atmosphere. The vertical distribution of ozone in the troposphere (green) and stratosphere (red), showing the forms of skin cancer attributable to UV exposure, as it location of the stratospheric ozone layer that absorbs 99% of UV radiation. metastasizes (spreads) easily. Melanoma is often traced to (Source: Synthesis and Assessment Product 2.4. Report by the U.S. Climate occasional sunburns during childhood or adolescence or to Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research. sunburns in people who normally stay out of the sun. November 2008.) Formation and Breakdown of the Shield Ozone is formed in the stratosphere when UV radiation acts on oxygen (O2) molecules.", "The high-energy UV radiation first causes some molecular oxygen (O2) to split apart into free oxygen (O) atoms, and these atoms then combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone via the following reactions: O2 + UVB S O + O (1) O + O2 S O3 (2) Not all of the molecular oxygen is converted to ozone, however, because free oxygen atoms may also combine with ozone molecules to form two oxygen molecules in the following reaction: O + O3 S O2 + O2 (3) Finally, when ozone absorbs UVB, it is converted back to free oxygen and molecular oxygen: O3 + UVB S O + O2 (4) Thus, the amount of ozone in the stratosphere is dynamic. There is an equilibrium due to the continual cycle of reactions of formation (Eqs. 1 and 2) and reactions of destruction (Eqs. 3 and 4). Because of seasonal changes in solar radiation, ozone concentration in the Northern Hemisphere is highest in summer and lowest in winter. Also, in general, ozone concentrations are highest at the equator and diminish as latitude increases\u2014again, a function of higher overall amounts of solar radiation. However, the presence of other chemicals in the stratosphere can upset the normal ozone equilibrium and promote undesirable reactions there. Halogens in the Atmosphere. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are a type of halogenated hydrocarbon (see Chapter 22) . CFCs are nonreactive, nonflammable, nontoxic organic molecules in which both chlorine and fluorine atoms have replaced some hydrogen atoms. At room temperature, CFCs are gases under normal (atmospheric) pressure, but they liquefy under modest pressure, giving off heat in the process and becoming cold. When they revaporize, they reabsorb the heat and become hot. These attributes led to the widespread use of CFCs (more than 1 million tons per year in the 1980s) for the following applications: Rowland and Molina. All of the preceding uses led to the release of CFCs into the atmosphere, where they mixed with the normal atmospheric gases and eventually reached the stratosphere. In 1974, chemists Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina published a classic paper (for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995) concluding that CFCs could damage the stratospheric ozone layer through the release of chlorine atoms and, as a result, UV radiation would increase and cause more skin cancer (their story is described in Chapter 2 to illustrate the public-policy life cycle). 8 Rowland and Molina reasoned that, although CFCs would be stable in the troposphere (where they have been found to last 70 to 110 years), in the stratosphere they would be subjected to intense UV radiation, which would break them apart, releasing free chlorine atoms via the following reaction: CFCl3 + UV S Cl + CFCl2 (5) Ultimately, all of the chlorine of a CFC molecule would be released as a result of further photochemical breakdown. The free chlorine atoms would then attack stratospheric ozone to form chlorine monoxide (ClO) and molecular oxygen: Cl + O3 S ClO + O2 (6) Furthermore, two molecules of chlorine monoxide may react to release more chlorine and an oxygen molecule: ClO + ClO S 2Cl + O2 (7) Reactions 6 and 7 are called the chlorine catalytic cycle because chlorine is continuously regenerated as it reacts with ozone. Thus, chlorine acts as a catalyst, a chemical that promotes a chemical reaction without itself being used up in the reaction. Because every chlorine atom in the stratosphere can last from 40 to 100 years, it has the potential to break down 100,000 molecules of ozone. Thus, CFCs are judged to be damaging because they act as transport agents that continuously move chlorine atoms into the stratosphere. The damage persists because the chlorine atoms are removed from the stratosphere only very slowly. Figure 19\u201329 shows the basic processes of ozone formation and destruction, including recent refinements to our knowledge of those processes that will be explained shortly. EPA Action. After studying the evidence, the EPA became convinced that CFCs were a threat and, in 1978, banned their use in aerosol cans in the United States. Manufacturers quickly switched to nondamaging substitutes, such as butane, and things were quiet for several years. CFCs continued to be used in applications other than aerosols, however, and skeptics demanded more convincing evidence of their harmfulness. Atmospheric scientists reasoned that any substance carrying reactive halogens to the stratosphere had the potential to deplete ozone. These substances include halons, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrafluoride, and methyl bromide.", "Chemically similar to chlorine, bromine also attacks ozone and forms a monoxide (BrO) in a catalytic cycle. Because of its extensive use as a soil fumigant and pesticide, bromine plays a major role in ozone depletion. (Bromine is 16 times as potent as chlorine in ozone destruction.) 8M. J. Molina and F. S. Rowland, \u201cStratospheric Sink for Chlorofluoro-Methanes: Chlorine-Atom Catalyzed Distribution of Ozone,\u201d Nature 249 (1974): 810\u2013812. 19.5 Destruction of the Ozone Layer 493 Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun ozone to produce chlorine usually inert. Figure 19\u201329 Stratospheric ozone formation and destruction. UV radiation stimulates ozone production at the lower latitudes, and ozone-rich air migrates to high latitudes. At the same time, CFCs and other compounds carry halogens into the stratosphere, where they are broken down by UV radiation, releasing chlorine and bromine. Ozone is subject to high-latitude loss during winter, as the chlorine cycle is enhanced by the polar stratospheric clouds. Midlatitude losses occur as chlorine reservoirs are stimulated to release chlorine by reacting with stratospheric sulfate aerosol. The Ozone \u201cHole.\u201d In the fall of 1985, British atmospheric scientists working in Antarctica reported a gaping \u201chole\u201d (actually, a serious thinning) in the stratospheric ozone layer over the South Pole. There, in an area the size of the United States, ozone levels were 50% lower than normal. The hole would have been discovered earlier by NASA satellites monitoring ozone levels except that computers were programmed to reject data showing a drop as large as 30% as being due to instrument anomalies. Scientists had assumed that the loss of ozone, if it occurred, would be slow, gradual, and uniform over the whole planet. The ozone hole came as a surprise, and if it had occurred anywhere but over the South Pole, the UV damage would have been extensive. As it is, the limited time and area of ozone depletion there have not apparently brought on any catastrophic ecological events so far. News of the ozone hole stimulated an enormous scientific research effort. A unique set of conditions was found to be responsible for the hole. In the summer, gases such as nitrogen dioxide and methane react with chlorine monoxide and chlorine to trap the chlorine, forming so-called chlorine reservoirs ( Figure 19\u201329) and preventing much ozone depletion. When the Antarctic winter arrives in June, it creates a tightly swirling wind current in the stratosphere, with cold temperatures that promote clouds. The cloud particles provide surfaces on which chemical reactions release molecular chlorine (Cl2) from the chlorine reservoirs. When sunlight returns to the Antarctic in the spring, the Sun\u2019s warmth breaks up the clouds. UV light then attacks the molecular chlorine, releasing free chlorine and initiating the chlorine cycle, which rapidly destroys ozone. Eventually the wind current disperses, and ozone-rich air returns to the area. Patches of ozone-depleted air move around, causing UV radiation to increase to 20% above normal in Australia. Television stations there now report daily UV readings and warnings for Australians to stay out of the sun. Scientists estimate that in Queensland, where the ozone shield is thinnest, two out of three Australians will develop skin cancer by the age of 70. People living in other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, such as New Zealand and Chile, also experience the effects of the thinner ozone shield. The ozone hole intensified during the 1990s and has leveled off between 22 million and 27 million square kilometers, an area as large as North America ( Figure 19\u201330). Depletion of stratospheric ozone can occur in the Arctic as well, especially during cold winters. Further Ozone Depletion. Ozone losses have not been confined to Earth\u2019s polar regions, though they are most spectacular there. A worldwide network of ozone-measuring stations sends data to the World Ozone Data Center in Toronto, Canada. Reports from the center reveal ozone depletion levels of 3.5% and 6% over the period 2006\u20132009 in the midlatitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. Polar ozone depletion and the subsequent mixing of air masses are responsible for much of this loss. There is virtually no ozone depletion over tropical regions. The good news from the network is that ozone levels are improving. Is the ozone loss significant to our future? The EPA has calculated that the ozone losses of the 1980s will eventually Figure 19\u201330 Ozone loss and extent of ozone 200 have caused 12 million people in the United States to develop skin cancers over their lifetime and that 93,000 of these cancers will be fatal.", "Americans are estimated to have developed more than 900,000 new cases of skin cancer a year in the 1990s. The ozone losses of that decade allowed more UVB radiation than ever to reach Earth. Coming to Grips with Ozone Depletion. The dramatic growth of the hole in the ozone layer ( Figure 19\u201330) galva nized a response around the world. Scientists and politicians in the United States and other countries worked together to develop treaties designed to avert a UV disaster. The Montreal Protocol. In 1987, under the auspices of its environmental program, the United Nations convened a meeting in Montreal, Canada, to address ozone depletion. Member nations reached an agreement, known as the Montreal Protocol, to scale back CFC production 50% by 2000. All 196 United Nations member countries have ratified the agreement. The Montreal Protocol was written even before CFCs were so clearly implicated in driving the destruction of ozone and before the threat to Arctic and temperate-zone ozone was recognized. Because ozone losses during the late 1980s were greater than expected, an amendment to the protocol was adopted in June 1990. The amendment required participating nations to phase out the major hole.

In the face of evidence that ozone depletion was accelerating even more, another amendment to the protocol was adopted in November 1992, moving the target date for the complete phaseout of CFCs to January 1, 1996. Timetables for phasing out all of the suspected ozone-depleting halogens were shortened at the 1992 meeting. Quantities of CFCs were still being manufactured after 1992 to satisfy legitimate demand in the developing countries. However, according to the Montreal Protocol, all manufacturing of CFCs was to have been halted by December 31, 2005. The results of the protocol can be seen clearly in Figure 19\u201331, which shows the time course of production of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and the abundance of those chemicals in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion continues to occur because the ODS are long-lived in the stratosphere. Action in the United States. The United States was the leader in the production and use of CFCs and other ODS, with DuPont Chemical Company being the major producer. Following years of resistance, DuPont pledged in 1988 to phase out CFC production by 2000. In late 1991, a company spokesperson announced that, in response to new data on ozone loss, DuPont would accelerate its phaseout. Many of the large corporate users of CFCs (AT&T, IBM, and Northern Telecom, for example) phased out their CFC use by 1994. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 also address this problem\u2014in Title VI, Protecting Stratospheric Ozone. Title VI is a comprehensive program that restricts the production, use, emissions, and disposal of an entire family of chemicals identified as ozone depleting. For example, the program calls for a phaseout schedule for the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), a family of chemicals being used as less damaging substitutes for CFCs until nonchlorine substitutes are available. Halons\u2014used in chemical fire extinguishers\u2014 were banned in 1994. Title VI also regulates the servicing of refrigeration and air-conditioning units. Ozone-depletingchlorine and bromine ODS in the stratosphere production The Montreal Protocol had its 25th anniversary in 2012. As a result of this and subsequent agreements, CFCs are no longer being produced or used. Substitutes for CFCs are readily available and, in some cases, are even less expensive than CFCs. The most commonly used substitutes are HCFCs, which still contain some chlorine and are scheduled for a gradual phaseout (by 2030). Although they contain chlorine, HCFCs are largely destroyed in the troposphere and are much less capable of destroying stratospheric ozone than CFCs.", "The most promising substitutes are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which contain no chlorine and are judged to have no ozone-depleting potential. They do, however, have significant global warming potential. Because CFCs are potent greenhouse gases, phasing out CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances is helping the efforts to slow down global climate change (Chapter 18 ). Ironically, HFCs are likely to have a marked influence on global climate change if their use increases in the future. Additional Ozone-Depleting Substances. Other ozone-depleting substances are still a concern. Methyl bromide continues to be produced and released into the atmosphere; the compound is employed as a soil fumigant to control agricultural pests. Under the Montreal Protocol, it was scheduled to be completely phased out by 2005 in the developed countries and 10 years later in the developing countries. In the meantime, bromine is likely to play a greater role in ozone depletion relative to chlorine. Responding to requests from the agricultural industry, the United States has repeatedly received \u201ccritical use\u201d exemptions to the ban for use of this ozone-depleting chemical. However, the EPA is phasing out these uses; the 2012 level of use was just 4.6% of 1991. Another ODS is nitrous oxide (N2O). Figure 19\u201311a shows how nitric oxides are able to destroy ground-level ozone. This can also happen in the stratosphere, where N2O is broken down into NOx and the nitrogen oxides deplete ozone there, along with the chlorine and bromine Figure 19\u201331 Production and presence of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere: Past, present, and future. (a) Production of ozone-depleting substances (ODS); CFCs are shown in green, and HCFCs, being used to replace CFCs, are shown in blue. (b) Relative abundances of ozone-depleting chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere. The impact of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments is clear. (Source: UN Environmental Program, Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2006.) 1980 Now ~2100 compounds. Even though the current ozone depletion in the stratosphere is largely due to accumulated chlorine and bromine compounds from past releases, nitrous oxide is the predominant anthropogenic ODS currently being released and is expected to remain the largest throughout the 21st century. Oddly, this substance is not yet addressed by the Montreal Protocol and its amendments. 9 Final Thoughts. The ozone story is a remarkable episode in human history. From the first warnings in 1974 that something might be amiss in the stratosphere because of a practically 9A. R. Ravishankara et al., \u201cNitrous Oxide (N2O): The Dominant Ozone-Depleting Substance Emitted in the 21st Century,\u201d Science 326 (October 2, 2009): 123\u2013125. inert and highly useful industrial chemical, through the development of the Montreal Protocol and the final steps of CFC phaseout, the world has shown that it can respond collectively and effectively to a clearly perceived threat. The ozone layer is expected to recover completely by mid-century in the midlatitudes and a couple of decades later in the polar regions. The scientific community has played a crucial role in this episode, first alerting the world and then plunging into intense research programs to ascertain the validity of the threat. This is a most encouraging development as we look forward to the actions that must be taken during the rest of 21st century to prevent catastrophic global climate change.

Water Pollution and Its Prevention The Mississippi River watershed encompasses 40% of the land area of the United States; the river collects water from this huge area and eventually delivers it to the Gulf of Mexico. Because much of the watershed is in America\u2019s agricultural heartland, the Mississippi River is a reflection of what happens on the nation\u2019s farms. During the latter half of the 20th century, more and more fertilizers were spread on agricultural fields, and more animals were raised on feedlots. At the same time, wetlands bordering river tributaries were drained and no longer intercepted agricultural runoff. The result was a tripling of soluble nitrogen delivered to the river and, eventually, to the Gulf of Mexico. Dead Zone. The impact of this major flow of nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico was first detected in 1974 by marine scientists who found areas in the gulf where oxygen had disappeared from bottom sediments and much of the water column above them. This absence of oxygen was deadly to the bottom-dwelling animals and any oxygen-breathing creatures in the water column that were not able to escape. At first, the hypoxic (lacking oxygen) area was thought to be a minor disturbance that would disappear seasonally. But then the hypoxic area suddenly doubled in size following the 1993 floods in the Midwest, and it continues to grow. The shrimpers and fishers who work these waters have learned to avoid the hypoxic area. The Culprit. To the scientists working on the problem, the connection between nitrogen and hypoxia was clear. Nitrogen is a common limiting factor in coastal marine waters. Where abundant, it promotes the dense growth of phytoplankton\u2014 photosynthetic microorganisms that float in the water. Zooplankton\u2014microscopic Sediment and nutrients from the Mississippi River watershed pour into the Gulf of Mexico. animals in the water\u2014rapidly consume the phytoplankton and multiply. As the abundant phytoplankton and zooplankton (and their fecal pellets) die or sink toward the bottom, they are decomposed by bacteria, a process that consumes dissolved oxygen. Eventually, the oxygen is used up, creating a dead zone that can extend up from the bottom of the sea to within a few meters of the surface. Because the gulf\u2019s fishery is a $2.8 billion dollar enterprise, the problem eventually got national attention. In 1998, Congress passed the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, establishing an interagency task force of scientists charged with assessing the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force released its first report in May 2000, confirming the connection between nitrogen and the dead zone and laying out options for reducing the nitrogen load coming downriver. Two key strategies were the reduction of fertilizer use to greatly 20.1 Perspectives on Water Pollution In the early days of the Industrial Revolution, little attention was given to the pollution of lakes, rivers, and the coastal ocean. Industries emptied their wastes into the closest waterway, and the general means of disposing of human excrement was the outdoor privy (or behind the nearest bush). Seepage from the privy frequently contaminated drinking water and caused disease, especially in places where privies and wells were located near one another. In the late 1800s, Louis Pasteur and other scientists showed that sewage-borne bacteria were responsible for many infectious diseases. This important discovery led to intensive efforts to rid cities of human excrement as expediently as possible. Cities already had drain systems for storm water, but using these systems for human wastes had been prohibited. With the urgency of the situation, however, minds quickly changed. The flush toilet was introduced, and sewers were tapped into storm drains. Thus, Western civilization adopted the one-way flow of flushing domestic and industrial wastewater into natural waterways. Introducing sewage into a waterway was symptomatic of an approach that believed \u201cthe solution to pollution is dilution.\u201d", "As a result of this practice, receiving waters that had limited capacity for dilution became open cesspools of foul odors and filth as the overload of organic matter depleted dissolved oxygen and most aquatic life suffocated. For increasing distances around or downstream from the sewage outfall, the water became unfit for any recreational use. Any use of the water for human consumption required extensive treatment to remove pathogens. Industrial wastes only added insult to injury. From the dawn of the Industrial Age to the relatively recent past, it was common practice to flush all waste liquids and contaminated water into sewer systems or directly into natural waterways. Many human health problems followed, but they 20.1 Perspectives on Water Pollution 499 reduce farm runoff, and the restoration and promotion of nitrogen retention and denitrification processes in the basin. In 2001, the task force proposed an action plan with the goal of reducing the size of the hypoxic area to 1900 square miles (5000 km2) by 2015. Unfortunately, this goal was not met. In 2014, the dead zone occupied about 5,700 square miles (14,800 km2). The Gulf of Mexico dead zone shows that it is unreasonable to allow vital water resources to receive pollutants and then expect those resources to continue to provide us with their usual bounty of goods and services. Since the 1960s, the number of coastal dead zones has doubled every decade; worldwide, more than 550 are now known. In this chapter, we will focus on water quality. ( Chapter 10 dealt with water quantity\u2014the global water cycle and water resources.) We will discuss eutrophication and other forms of water pollution and take a close look at wastewater treatment. either were not recognized as being caused by the pollution or were accepted as the \u201cprice of progress.\u201d In the United States, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 was the first federal water pollution legislation, providing technical assistance to state and local governments, but otherwise leaving things up to the states and local municipalities. In the 1950s, as industrial production expanded and synthetic organics came into widespread use, many streams and rivers essentially became open chemical sewers as well as sewers for human waste. These waters not only were devoid of life, but also were themselves hazardous. Finally, in 1969, the Cuyahoga River, which flows through Cleveland, Ohio, was carrying so much flammable material that it actually caught fire, which destroyed seven bridges before the fire burned itself out ( Figure 20\u20131). Figure 20\u20131 Cuyahoga River on fire. In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, caught fire, burning seven bridges. This incident captured national attention and contributed to the public outrage over water pollution, leading to the Clean Water Act of 1972. Worsening pollution (from both chemicals and sewage) and the increasing recognition of its adverse health effects finally created a degree of public outrage that pushed Congress to pass the Clean Water Act of 1972 (CWA). This legislation gave the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the responsibility to carry out a very ambitious goal\u2014to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation\u2019s waters. The CWA was to achieve zero discharge of pollutants by 1985, a totally na\u00efve (and impossible) task, given the nature of the pollutants involved. However, imperfect as it is, the Clean Water Act (including its amendments) is one of the most far-reaching and effective environmental laws ever enacted. Water Pollution: Sources and Types Water pollutants originate from a host of human activities and reach surface water or groundwater through an equally diverse host of pathways. Regulators distinguish between point sources and nonpoint sources of pollutants ( Figure 20\u20132). Point sources involve the discharge of substances from factories, sewage systems, power plants, underground coal mines, and oil wells. These sources are relatively easy to identify and, therefore, easier to monitor and regulate than nonpoint sources, which are poorly defined and scattered over broad areas. Some of the most prominent non-point sources of pollution are agricultural runoff (from farm animals and croplands), storm-water drainage (from streets, parking lots, and lawns), and atmospheric deposition (from air pollutants washed to or deposited as dry particles on Earth). Pollution occurs as rainfall and snowmelt flow over and through the ground, picking up pollutants as they go.", "Two basic strategies are employed in attempting to bring water pollution under control: (1) reduce or remove the sources and (2) treat the water before it is released so as to remove pollutants or convert them to harmless forms. Water treatment is the best option for point sources. Source reduction is the best option for nonpoint sources, although it can also be used for point sources. Pathogens. The most serious and widespread water pollutants are infectious agents that cause sickness and death (see Chapter 17) . The excrement from humans and other animals infected with certain pathogens (disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and other parasitic organisms) contains large numbers of these organisms or their eggs. Table 20\u20131 lists the most common waterborne pathogens. Even after symptoms of disease disappear, an infected person or animal may still harbor low populations of the pathogen, thus continuing to act as a carrier of disease. If wastes from carriers contaminate drinking water, food, or water used for swimming or bathing, the pathogens can infect other individuals ( Figure 20\u20133). Public Health. Before the connection between disease and sewage-carried pathogens was recognized in the mid-1800s, disastrous epidemics were common in cities. 20.1 Perspectives on Water Pollution 501 Figure 20\u20133 The Ganges River in India. In many places, the river is used simultaneously for drinking, washing, and the disposal of sewage, resulting in a high incidence of disease. Epidemics of typhoid fever and cholera often killed thousands of people. Today public-health measures that prevent this disease cycle have been adopted throughout much of the world. The following measures are essential to the control of waterborne diseases: Standards regarding these measures are set and enforced by government public-health departments. A variety of other measures are enforced as well. For example, if bathing areas are contaminated with raw sewage, health departments close them to swimming. Sanitation = Good Medicine. Many people attribute good health in a population to modern medicine, but good health is primarily a result of the prevention of disease through public-health measures. According to the 2014 report Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation, 1 since 1990, 2 billion people have gained access to improved sanitation; 77 countries met the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation ( Figure 20\u20134). Yet many regions still need to make significant progress. Every year, more than 2 million deaths (mostly among children under five) are traced to waterborne diseases. The Sustainable Development Goals about agriculture, cities, and management of resources all include targets to prevent water pollution. Moving forward toward 2030 will require providing 1Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation: 2014 Update.

(a)(b)(c)(d) sanitation for the nearly one quarter of the world\u2019s people who currently lack toilets and must relieve themselves out doors. (See Chapter 17, Sound Science, Water Contamination Drives Malnutrition in India.) Largely because of poor sanitation regarding water and sewage, a significant portion of the world\u2019s population is chronically infected with various pathogens. Moreover, populations in areas where there is little or no sewage treatment are extremely vulnerable to deadly epidemics of diseases spread by sewage, especially cholera. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports numerous cholera outbreaks annually, and cases frequently number in the thousands, with hundreds of deaths. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti created huge refugee camps, where an outbreak of cholera brought 180,000 cases and 5,000 deaths. The source of the cholera there was traced to UN peacekeepers from Nepal, where the disease is endemic. Wastes from the peacekeepers\u2019 camps were simply emptied into the nearest watercourse. Monitoring Pathogens. An important aspect of public health is the detection of sewage-borne pathogens in water. It is impossible to test for every pathogen that might be present; instead, scientists use an indirect method called the fecal coliform test.", "This test is based on the fact that large numbers of a bacterium called Escherichia coli (E. coli) are excreted with fecal material. In most situations, E. coli is not a pathogen, but it does serve as an indicator organism: Its presence indicates that water is contaminated with fecal wastes and that sewage-borne pathogens also may be present. The fecal coliform test detects and counts the number of E. coli in a sample of water ( Figure 20\u20135). To be safe for drinking, a 100 milliliter (0.4 cup) sample of water may not contain any E. coli. The same sample with up to 200 E. coli is considered safe for swimming. Beyond that level, a river or beach may be posted as polluted, and swimming and other direct contact should be avoided. By contrast, raw sewage (99.9% water, 0.1% waste) has E. coli counts in the millions. Organic Wastes. Along with pathogens, human and animal wastes contain organic matter that creates serious problems if it enters bodies of water untreated. Other kinds of organic matter, such as leaves and trash, can enter bodies of water as a consequence of runoff. With the exception of plastics and some human-made chemicals, these wastes are biodegradable. As in the Gulf of Mexico dead zone ( Figure 20\u20136), when bacteria and detritus feeders decompose organic matter in Figure 20\u20136 The 2014 dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Each year oxygen disappears from middle depths to the bottom over thousands of square miles of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2014 the dead zone was 5,708 square miles, an area almost the size of Connecticut. (Source: NOAA News, Aug. 4, 2014. With permission from LUMCON.) 20.1 Perspectives on Water Pollution 503 water, they consume oxygen gas dissolved in the water. The amount of oxygen that water can hold in solution is severely limited. In cold water, dissolved oxygen (DO) can reach concentrations up to 10 parts per million (ppm); much less can be held in warm water. Compare this ratio with that of oxygen in air, which is 200,000 ppm (20%), and you can understand why even a moderate amount of organic matter decomposing in water can deplete the water of its DO. Bacteria keep the oxygen supply depleted as long as there is dead organic matter to support their growth and oxygen replenishment is inadequate. BOD. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is a measure of the amount of organic material in water, stated in terms of how much oxygen will be required to break it down biologically, chemically, or both. The higher the BOD measure, the greater the likelihood that dissolved oxygen will be depleted in the course of breaking down the organic material. A high BOD causes so much oxygen depletion that animal life is severely limited or precluded, as in the bottom waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Fish and shellfish are killed when the DO drops below 2 or 3 ppm, though some are unable to tolerate even higher DO levels. If all of the oxygen in the system is depleted, only bacteria can survive, using their abilities to switch to fermentation or anaerobic respiration (metabolic pathways that do not require oxygen). A typical BOD value for raw sewage would be around 250 ppm. Even a moderate amount of sewage added to natural waters containing at most 10 ppm DO can deplete the water of its oxygen and produce highly undesirable consequences well beyond those caused by the introduction of pathogens ( Figure 20\u20137) . 8 Saturation DO 6 Dissolved Oxygen (DO) 4 ppm 2 Dissolved oxygen (DO) Physical Appearance Fish Life Bottom Organisms Clean water, rocky or sandy bottom Trout, dace, bass Mayfly larvae, stonefly larvae, caddis fly larvae Cloudy water, bottom sludge, foul smells No fish Blackfly larvae, sludge worms Cloudy water, bottom sludge, foul smells No fish Sludge worms, rat-tailed maggots Clearer, green water, bottom sludge Bullheads, carp, suckers Blackfly larvae, sludge worms, filamentous algae Clear water, rocky or sandy bottom Trout, dace, bass Mayfly larvae, stonefly larvae, caddis fly larvae Figure 20\u20137 The oxygen sag curve. When sewage with a high BOD is discharged into a stream or small river, it creates an oxygen deficit and severely affects the stream\u2019s biology. UNDERSTANDING THE DATA When you sample the water in a river, your dissolved-oxygen meter reads 5 ppm. What aspects of the environment tell you whether the river is in the decline or recovery stage of the oxygen sag curve? Chemical Pollutants.", "Because water is such an excellent solvent, it is able to hold many chemical substances in solution. Water-soluble inorganic chemicals constitute an important class of pollutants that include heavy metals (such as lead, mercury, arsenic, and nickel), acids from mine drainage (sulfuric acid) and acid precipitation (sulfuric and nitric acids), and road salts employed to melt snow and ice in the colder climates (sodium and calcium chlorides). The organic chemicals are another group of substances found in polluted waters. Petroleum products pollute many bodies of water, from the major oil spills in the ocean to the small streams receiving runoff from parking lots. Other organic substances with serious impacts are the pesticides that drift down from aerial spraying or that run off from agricultural fields and lawns, as well as the various industrial chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), cleaning solvents, and detergents (Chapter 13 ). Many of these pollutants are toxic even at low concentrations (Chapter 22). Some may become concentrated as they are passed up the food chain in a process called biomagnification (Chapter 13). Even at very low concentrations, they can render water unpalatable to humans and dangerous to aquatic life. At higher concentrations, they can change the properties of bodies of water so as to prevent them from serving any useful purpose except perhaps navigation. Acid mine drainage, for example, pollutes thousands of miles of streams in regions of the United States where coal and minerals are mined ( Figure 20\u20138). Stream bottoms are coated with orange deposits of iron, and the water is so acidic that only a few hardy bacteria and algae can tolerate it. Sediments. As natural landforms weather, especially during storms, a certain amount of sediment enters streams and rivers. However, erosion from farmlands, deforested slopes, overgrazed rangelands, construction sites, mining sites, stream banks, and roads can greatly increase the load of sediment Figure 20\u20138 Acid mine waste. In August 2015, EPA workers who were attempting to clean up a closed gold mine in Colorado accidentally broke through a barrier, releasing three million gallons of acidic water into the Animas River. Here kayakers paddle across the polluted river. Acid mine drainage contains high concentrations of cadmium, lead, arsenic, sulfides, and iron. entering waterways. Frequently, storm drains simply lead to the nearest depression or some natural streambed. Sediments (sand, silt, and clay) have direct and extreme physical impacts on streams and rivers. When erosion is slight, streams and rivers of the watershed run clear and support algae and other aquatic plants that attach to rocks or take root in the bottom. These producers, plus miscellaneous detritus from fallen leaves, support a complex food web of bacteria, protozoa, worms, insect larvae, snails, fish, crayfish, and other organisms, which keep themselves from being carried downstream by attaching to rocks or seeking shelter behind or under rocks. Even fish that maintain their position by active swimming occasionally need such shelter to rest (Figure 20\u20139a) . Suspended Load. Sediment entering waterways in large amounts has an array of impacts. Sand, silt, clay, and humus are quickly separated by the agitation of flowing water and are carried at different rates. Clay and humus are carried in suspension, making the water turbid and reducing the amount of light penetrating the water and, hence, reducing photosynthesis as well. As the material settles, it coats everything and continues to block photosynthesis. It also kills the animals by clogging their gills and feeding structures. The eggs of fish and other aquatic organisms are particularly vulnerable being smothered by sediment. Bed Load. Especially destructive is the bed load of sand and silt, which is not readily carried in suspension, but is gradually washed along the bottom. As particles roll and tumble along, they scour organisms from the rocks. They also bury and smother the bottom life and fill in the hiding and resting places of fish and crayfish. Aquatic plants and other organisms are unable to reestablish themselves because the bottom is a constantly shifting bed of sand (Figure 20\u20139b and c). Modern storm-water management is designed to reduce the bed load, usually via storm drains that are periodically emptied of their sediment. Many newer housing developments include a storm-water retention reservoir, which 20.1 Perspectives on Water Pollution 505 Figure 20\u20139 Impact of sediment on streams and rivers. (a) The ecosystem of a stream that is not subjected to a Hiding places large sediment bed load.

Rather than letting excessive runoff from developed areas cause flooding and other environmental damage, runoff can be funneled into a retention pond, as shown here. Then it can drain away slowly, maintaining natural stream flow, or it can recharge groundwater. The retention pond may be designed to retain a certain amount of water and thus create a pocket of wildlife habitat in an otherwise urban or suburban setting. is simply a pond that receives and holds runoff from the area during storms. Water may infiltrate the soil or may create a pocket of natural wetland habitat supporting wildlife ( Figure 20\u201310). Sediments do not receive the attention the news media give to hazardous wastes and certain other pollution problems, but erosion is so widespread throughout the world that few streams and rivers escape the harsh impact of excessive sediment loads. Nutrients. Some of the inorganic chemicals carried in solution in all bodies of water are nutrients\u2014essential elements required by plants. The two most important nutrient elements for aquatic plant growth are phosphorus and nitrogen, and they are often in such low concentrations in water that they are the limiting factors for phytoplankton or other aquatic plants. More nutrients mean more plant growth, so nutrients become water pollutants when they are added from point or nonpoint sources and stimulate undesirable plant growth in bodies of water. The most obvious point sources of excessive nutrients are sewage outfalls. As we will see in Section 20.2, it is costly to remove nutrients from sewage during the treatment process, so that is not always done. If sewage is not treated at all, higher levels of nutrients will enter the water, which is what\u2019s happening in much of the developing world. Agricultural runoff is the most notorious nonpoint source of nutrients. The nutrients are applied to agricultural crops as chemical fertilizers and manure, are dissolved in irrigation water, and are present in crop residues. When nutrients are applied in excess of the needs of plants or when runoff from agricultural fields and feedlots is heavy, the nutrients are picked up by water that eventually enters streams, rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Other nonpoint sources of nutrients include acid rain and snow, lawns and gardens, golf courses, and storm drains. Earlier we discussed the concept of safe planetary boundaries, the zone in which humans need to live in order to have a sustainable future (Chapter 1). Experts have identi fied the processes of the nitrogen cycle as one area in which human activities have already crossed a planetary boundary; we will need to back-track in order to be sustainable. Water Quality Standards. When is water considered polluted? Many water pollutants\u2014such as pesticides, cleaning solvents, and detergents\u2014are substances that are found in water only because of human activities. Others, such as nutrients and sediments, are always found in natural waters, and they are a problem only under certain conditions. In both cases, pollution means any quantity that is harmful to human health or the environment or prevents full use of the environment by humans or natural species. The mere presence of a substance in water does not necessarily pose a problem. Rather, it is the concentration of the pollutant that must be of primary concern. Criteria Pollutants. But what concentration is worrisome? To provide standards for assessing water pollution, the EPA has established the National Recommended Water Quality Criteria. On the basis of the latest scientific knowledge, the EPA has listed 167 chemicals and substances as criteria pollutants. The majority of these are toxic chemicals, but many are also natural chemicals or conditions that describe the state of water, such as nutrients, hardness (a general measure of dissolved calcium and magnesium salts), and pH (a measure of the acidity of the water). The list identifies the pollutant and then recommends concentrations for freshwater, saltwater, and human consumption (usually of fish and shellfish). Values are given for the criteria maximum concentration (CMC), the highest single concentration beyond which environmental impacts may be expected, and the criterion continuous concentration (CCC), the highest sustained concentration beyond which undesirable impacts may be expected.", "The criteria are recommendations meant to be used by the states, which are given the primary responsibility for upholding water-pollution laws. States and Native American tribes may revise these criteria, but their revisions are subject to EPA approval. Drinking water standards are much stricter. For these, the EPA has established the Drinking Water Standards and Health Advisories, a set of tables that are updated periodically. These standards, covering some 94 contaminants, are enforceable under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974. They are presented as maximum contaminant levels (MCLs). To see how these two sets of standards work, consider the heavy metal arsenic. Arsenic. Arsenic is listed as a known human carcinogen by the Department of Health and Human Services; it occurs naturally in groundwater, reaching high concentrations in some parts of the world. The CMC and CCC values for arsenic are 340 \u03bcg/L and 150 \u03bcg/L (1 \u03bcg/L = 1 part per billion) for freshwater bodies and 69 \u03bcg/L and 36 \u03bcg/L for saltwater bodies. The drinking-water MCL concentration, however, is 10 \u03bcg/L, and therein lies a story. For years, the MCL concentration for arsenic was 50 \u03bcg/L, despite warnings by the U.S. Public Health Service and the WHO that this level was much too high because of the risk of cancer. (Both bodies recommended 10 \u03bcg/L.) From standard risk assessment processes, the cancer mortality risk was assessed at 1 in 100 for people drinking water regularly at the 50 \u03bcg/L level. This ratio is more than 100 times higher than the permitted risk for any other contaminant. There was a good deal of controversy about changing the MCL because of the cost of attaining lower concentrations, but in October 2001, EPA administrator Christine Whitman set the arsenic MCL at 10 \u03bcg/L. Other Applications. Two important applications of water quality criteria are the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) programs. The NPDES program addresses point-source pollution and issues permits that regulate discharges from wastewater-treatment plants and industrial sources. The TMDL program, by contrast, evaluates all sources of pollutants entering a body of water, especially nonpoint sources, according to the water body\u2019s ability to assimilate the pollutant. For both of these programs, water quality criteria provide an essential means of assessing the condition of the receiving body of water as well as evaluating the levels of the various pollutant discharges. We will examine these two programs in more detail when we consider the problem of eutrophication. The good news is that, according to the EPA, 92% of the people in the United States have access to drinking water that meets the drinking water standards. However, on the basis of data supplied to the EPA by the states, more than 42,000 rivers, lakes, and estuaries are not meeting the recommended water quality standards, and this excludes more than 60% of U.S. waters that have not been assessed at all. The major problems (in order) are pathogens, mercury, nutrients, other heavy metals, sediments, and oxygen depletion. As we proceed, we will address the specifics of public-policy responses to this serious national problem. We turn now to ways of dealing with the biological wastes that are a large part of our pollution problem. What are three problems caused by the spillage of sewage into waterways? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 20.2 Wastewater Treatment and Management The first wastewater-treatment plants in the United States were built around 1900. To alleviate the problem of sewage-polluted waterways, facilities were designed and constructed to treat the outflow before it entered the receiving waterway. However, the combined volumes of sewage and storm water soon proved impossible to handle. During heavy rains, wastewater would overflow the treatment plant and carry raw sewage into the receiving waterway. Gradually, regulations were passed requiring municipalities to install separate systems\u2014storm drains to collect 20.2 Wastewater Treatment and Management 507 and drain runoff from precipitation and sanitary sewers to receive all the wastewater from sinks, tubs, and toilets in homes and other buildings. (Note the distinction between the two terms; it is incorrect to speak of storm drains as sewers.) The ideal modern system, then, is one in which all wastewater is collected separately from storm water and is fully treated to remove pollutants before the water finally is released. But progress toward this goal has been extremely uneven.", "Up through the 1970s, even in the United States and other developed countries, thousands of communities still discharged untreated sewage directly into waterways, and for many more, the degree of treatment was minimal. Indeed, the increasing sewage pollution of waterways and beaches was the major impetus behind the passage of the Clean Water Act. Before addressing methods of treating wastewater, let us clarify which contaminants and pollutants we are talking about. The Pollutants in Raw Wastewater A sewer system brings the outflow from all tub, sink, and toilet drains in homes and buildings together into larger and larger sewer pipes, just as the branches of a tree eventually come together into the trunk. The mixture that flows from the end of the \u201ctrunk\u201d of the collection system is called raw sewage or raw wastewater. Because we use such large amounts of water to flush away small amounts of dirt, especially as we stand under the shower or just run the water, most of what goes down sewer drains is water. In the United States, raw wastewater is about 1,000 parts water for every 1 part waste\u201499.9% water to 0.1% waste. Given our voluminous use of water, an average community of 10,000 persons will produce 1.5 million to 2.0 million gallons (6\u20138 million L) of wastewater each day. With the addition of storm water, raw wastewater is diluted still more. Nevertheless, the pollutants are sufficient to make the water brown and foul smelling. The pollutants in wastewater generally are divided into the following four categories, which correspond to the techniques used to remove them: In addition to these four categories of pollutants, raw wastewater may contain variable amounts of pesticides, heavy metals, and other toxic compounds. Removing the Pollutants from Wastewater The challenge of treating wastewater is more than installing a technology that will do the job; it is also finding one that will do the job at a reasonable cost. A diagram of wastewater treatment procedures is shown in Figure 20\u201311. Note that the diagram shows both primary and secondary treatment. Primary Treatment. Because debris and grit will damage or clog pumps and further treatment processes, removing this material is a necessary first step. Usually, removal involves two steps: the screening out of debris and the settling of grit. Debris is removed by letting raw sewage flow PRIMARY TREATMENT Debris and grit removal 1 Bar screen removes debris. Debris is then incinerated. 2 Grit chambers allow grit to settle so it can be removed and Grit settles to bottom taken to landfills. Grit chamber In primary clarifiers, organic matter settles to the bottom and fat Fat and oil float to top floats to the top. This organic Water enters at center andmatter and fat (raw sludge) is then flows out over weir at edge removed and treated separately. Organic matter settles SECONDARY TREATMENT Colloidal and dissolved organic Clarified water is matter removal sprinkled onto rock bed 4 The trickling-filter system allows water to percolate through a bed of rocks hosting various bacteria and other detritus. OR 4 In the activated-sludge system, detritus-feeding organisms consume most of the biomass as Trickling-filter water percolates over rocks. 5 In the secondary clarifier tank organisms settle and become the next batch of activated sludge. through a bar screen, a row of bars mounted about 1 inch apart. Debris is mechanically raked from the screen and taken to an incinerator. After passing through the screen, the water flows through a grit chamber\u2014a swimming pool\u2013like tank\u2014in which velocity is slowed just enough to permit the grit to settle. The settled grit is mechanically removed from these tanks and taken to landfills. After debris and grit are removed, the water then flows very slowly through large tanks called primary clarifiers. Because its flow is slow, the water is nearly motionless for several hours. The particulate organic material, about 30\u201350% of the total organic material, settles to the bottom, where it can be removed. At the same time, fatty or RAW SEWAGE Bar screen Primary clarifier Clarified water OR Secondary clarifier DISINFECTION RELEASE Debris removed and incinerated Grit removed and sent to landfill Raw sludge removed for further treatment Air bubbling system or paddles keep tank well-aerated Activated-sludge Figure 20\u201311 A diagram of wastewater treatment. Raw sewage moves from the grit chamber to undergo primary treatment, in which sludge is removed. The clarified water then undergoes secondary treatment (shown here as activated-sludge or trickling-filter treatment).", "20.2 Wastewater Treatment and Management 509 oily material floats to the top, where it is skimmed from the surface. All the material that is removed, both particulate organic material and fatty material, is combined into what is referred to as raw sludge, which must be treated separately. Primary treatment involves nothing more complicated than putting polluted water into a tank, letting material settle, and pouring off the water. Nevertheless, such treatment removes much of the particulate organic matter at minimal cost. Secondary Treatment. Secondary treatment is also called biological treatment because it uses organisms\u2014natural decomposers and detritus feeders. Basically, an environment is created that enables these organisms to feed on the colloidal and dissolved organic material and break it down to carbon dioxide, mineral nutrients, and water via their cell respiration. The wastewater from primary treatment is a food- and water-rich medium for the decomposers and detritus feeders. The only thing that needs to be added to the water is oxygen to enhance the organisms\u2019 respiration and growth. Either of two systems may be used to add oxygen to the water: a trickling-filter system or an activated-sludge system. In the trickling-filter system, the water exiting from primary treatment is sprinkled onto, and allowed to percolate through, a bed of fist-sized rocks 6\u20138 feet (2\u20133 m) deep ( Figure 20\u201312) . The spaces between the rocks provide good aeration. The organic material in the water, including pathogenic organisms, is absorbed and digested by decomposers and detritus feeders as it trickles by. This type of secondary treatment works best for small and medium-sized communities with large tracts of land. The activated-sludge system ( Figure 20\u201311 , bottom) is a more efficient, and the most common, secondary-treatment system. Water from primary treatment enters a large tank that is equipped with an air-bubbling system or a rapidly churning system of paddles. A mixture of detritus-feeding organisms, referred to as activated sludge, is added to the water as it enters the tank, and the water is vigorously aerated as it moves through the tank. Organisms in this well-aerated environment reduce the biomass of organic material, including pathogens, as they feed. As the organisms feed they tend to form into clumps, called floc, that settle readily when the water is stilled. Then, from the aeration tank, the water is passed into a secondary clarifier tank, where the organisms settle out, and the water\u2014now with more than 90% of the organic material removed\u2014flows on. The settled organisms are pumped back into the aeration tank. (They are the activated sludge that is added at the beginning of the process.) Surplus amounts of activated sludge, which occur as populations of organisms grow, are removed and added to the raw sludge. This process removes the organisms and organic material, but leaves nutrients in the water. Biological Nutrient Removal. The nutrient-rich water from activated-sludge systems has the potential to cause eutrophication if it is released into natural bodies of water. To avoid the problems of eutrophication, treatment plants can be upgraded to use a process of removing nutrients and oxidizing detritus called biological nutrient removal (BNR). BNR removes both nitrogen and phosphorus. (a) (b) Figure 20\u201312 Trickling filters for secondary treatment. (a) The water from primary clarifiers is sprinkled onto, and trickles through, a bed of rocks 6\u20138 feet deep. (b) Various bacteria and other detritus feeders adhering to the rocks consume and digest organic matter as it trickles by in the water, which is collected at the bottom of the filters and goes on for final clarification and disinfection. Nitrogen. Recall that, in the natural nitrogen cycle, various bacteria convert nutrient forms of nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate) back to non-nutritive nitrogen gas in the atmo sphere through denitrification (Chapter 3, Figure 3\u201321). For the biological removal of nitrogen, then, the activated-sludge system is partitioned into zones, and the environment in each zone is controlled in a manner that promotes the denitrifying process, as shown in Figure 20\u201313, on the following page. The resulting inert nitrogen gas is vented into the air. Phosphorus. In an environment that is rich in oxygen but relatively lacking in food (the environment of zone 3 in Figure 20\u201313), bacteria take up phosphate from the solution and store it in their bodies. Thus, phosphate is removed as the excess organisms are removed from the system. These organisms, together with the phosphate they contain, are Zone 1 Zone 2 Zone 3", "Secondary anaerobic anoxic oxygen-rich clarifier Effluent from Clarified water Removal of excess sludge with organic phosphate Activated sludge return Sludge treatment Figure 20\u201313 Biological nutrient removal (BNR). Secondary treatment\u2014the activated-sludge process\u2014may be modified to remove nitrogen and phosphate, while at the same time breaking down organic matter. For this BNR process, the aeration tank is partitioned into three zones; only zone 3 is aerated. As seen in the diagram, ammonium (NH4 +) is converted to nitrate (NO3\u2013) in zone 3. Recycled to zone 2, which is without oxygen gas (anoxic), the nitrate supplies the oxygen for cell respiration. In the process, the nitrate is converted to nitrogen gas, which is released into the atmosphere. Phosphate is taken up by bacteria in zone 3 and removed with the excess sludge. added to, and treated with, the raw sludge, ultimately producing a more nutrient-rich, treated sludge product. Various chemical treatments are often used as an alternative to BNR. One such process is simply to pass the effluent from standard secondary treatment through a filter of lime, which causes the phosphate to precipitate out as insoluble calcium phosphate. Another is to treat the effluent with ferric chloride, which produces insoluble ferric phosphate, or with an organic polymer, which gives rise to a floc. With these methods, most of the phosphorus is removed along with the sludge. Final Cleansing and Disinfection. With or without BNR, the wastewater is subjected to a final clarification and disinfection. Although few pathogens survive the combined stages of treatment, public-health rigors still demand that the water be disinfected before being discharged into natural waterways. The most widely used disinfecting agent is chlorine gas because it is both effective and relatively inexpensive. However, chlorine gas is dangerous to work with. Sodium hypochlorite (Clorox\u00ae) provides a safer way of adding chlorine. Because chlorine reacts with organic chemicals, all chlorine treatments produce a variety of toxic disinfection by-products, such as chlorinated hydrocarbons. Some municipalities disinfect with chloramines, which produce fewer toxic by-products. Residual chlorine introduced to waterways is itself toxic and can harm natural biota. These impacts are minimized if the effluent is well diluted by natural water. Other disinfecting techniques are coming into use. One alternative is ozone gas, which kills microorganisms and breaks down to oxygen gas, improving water quality in the process. Ozone is unstable and, hence, explosive, so it must be generated at the point of use, a step that demands considerable capital investment and energy. Another disinfection technique is to pass the effluent through an array of ultraviolet lights mounted in the water. The ultraviolet radiation kills microorganisms but does not otherwise affect the water. Final Effluent. After all these steps, the wastewater from a modern treatment plant has a lower organic and nutrient content than many bodies of water into which it is discharged. BOD values are commonly 10 to 20 ppm, as opposed to 200 ppm in the incoming sewage. In other words, discharging the wastewater may actually help to improve the water quality in the receiving body. In water-short areas, there is every reason to believe that the treated water itself, with minimal additional treatment, could be recycled into the municipal water-supply system. Bear in mind that the techniques we have described here represent the state of the art. Many cities, even in the developed world, are still operating with antiquated systems that provide lower-quality treatment. A few coastal cities still persist in discharging sewage that has received only primary treatment directly into the ocean, although in the United States this practice has almost disappeared. 20.2 Wastewater Treatment and Management 511 Treatment of Sludge Recall that the particulate organic matter that settles out or floats to the surface of sewage water in primary treatment forms the bulk of raw sludge, though the sewage also contains excesses from activated-sludge and BNR systems. Raw sludge is a gray, foul-smelling, syrupy liquid with a water content of 97\u201398%. Pathogens are certain to be present in raw sludge because it includes material directly from toilets. Indeed, raw sludge is considered to be a biologically hazardous material. However, as nutrient-rich organic material, it has the potential to be used as organic fertilizer if it is suitably treated to kill pathogens and if it does not contain other toxic contaminants. Three commonly used methods for treating sludge and converting it into organic fertilizer are anaerobic digestion, pasteurization, and composting.", "Because this is a developing industry, it is unclear which method will prove most cost effective and environmentally acceptable over the long run. Also, none of these methods is capable of removing toxic substances such as heavy metals and nonbiodegradable synthetic organic compounds. The presence of such toxins can preclude the use of sludge as fertilizer. Anaerobic Digestion. Anaerobic digestion is a process that allows bacteria to feed on the sludge in the absence of oxygen. The raw sludge is put into large airtight tanks called sludge digesters ( Figure 20\u201314) . In the absence of oxygen, a consortium of anaerobic bacteria breaks down the organic matter. The end products of this decomposition are carbon dioxide, methane, and water. Thus, a major by-product of anaerobic processes is biogas, a gaseous mixture that is about two-thirds methane. The other third is made up of carbon dioxide and various foul-smelling organic compounds that give sewage its characteristic odor. Because of its methane content, biogas is flammable and can be used for fuel. In fact, it is commonly collected and burned to heat the sludge digesters because the bacteria working on the sludge do best when maintained at about 104\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Figure 20\u201314 Anaerobic sludge digesters. In these tanks at the Deer Island Sewage Treatment Plant, Boston, the bacterial digestion of raw sludge in the absence of oxygen leads to the production of meth-ane gas, which is tapped from the tops of the tanks, and humus-like organic matter, which can be used as a soil conditioner. The egg-like shape of the tanks facilitates mixing and digestion. After four to six weeks, anaerobic digestion is more or less complete, and what remains is called treated sludge or biosolids, consisting of the remaining organic matter, which is now a relatively stable, nutrient-rich, humus-like material suspended in water. Pathogens have been largely, if not entirely, eliminated. Such treated sludge makes an excellent organic fertilizer that can be applied directly to lawns and agricultural fields in the liquid state in which it comes from the digesters, providing the benefit of both the humus and the nutrient-rich water. Alternatively, the sludge may be dewatered by means of belt presses, whereby the sludge is passed between rollers that squeeze out most of the water (Figure 20\u201315a) . This leaves the organic material as a semisolid sludge cake (Figure 20\u201315b) , which, after disinfection, is easy to store and to spread on fields with traditional manure spreaders. (b) (a) Figure 20\u201315 Dewatering treated sludge. (a) In a belt press, liquid sludge is run between canvas belts going over and between rollers, so that much of the water is pressed out. (b) The resulting \u201csludge cake\u201d is a semisolid humus-like material that can be used as an organic fertilizer. Pasteurization. After the raw sludge is dewatered, the resulting sludge cake may be put through ovens that operate like oversized laundry dryers. In the dryers, the sludge is pasteurized\u2014that is, heated sufficiently to kill any pathogens (exactly the same process that makes milk safe to drink). The product is dry, odorless organic pellets. Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which has a particularly rich sludge resulting from the brewing industry, has been using this process for more than 60 years. The city bags and sells the pellets throughout the country as an organic fertilizer under the trade name Milorganite\u00ae. Composting. Another process sometimes used to treat sewage sludge is composting. Raw sludge is mixed with wood chips or some other water-absorbing material to reduce the water content. It is then placed in windrows\u2014long, narrow piles that allow air to circulate easily through the material and that can be turned with machinery. Bacteria and other decomposers break down the organic material to rich humus-like material that makes an excellent treatment for poor soil. Alternative Treatment Systems Despite the expansion of sewage collection systems, many homes in rural and suburban areas lie outside the reach of a municipal system. For these homes, on-site treatment systems are required. Currently, 25% of the U.S. population is served by such systems. The traditional and still most common on-site system is the septic system ( Figure 20\u201316) . Wastewater flows into the tank, where particulate organic material settles to the bottom. The tank acts like a primary clarifier in a municipal system. Water containing colloidal and dissolved organic material, as well as dissolved nutrients, flows into the gravel or crushed stone lining the leaching field and gradually percolates into the Manhole (for cleanout) Septic tank Household wastewater", "Nonperforated pipe Figure 20\u201316 Septic system. Sewage treatment for a private home, using a septic tank and leaching field. Normally, the pipes and the tank are buried underground. They are shown uncovered here only for illustration. (Source: http://www.catawbariverkeeper.org/issues/library-of-documents-on sewage-issues-and-treatment/septictankdiagram.jpg/view?searchterm=septic+ system.) soil. Organic material that settles in the tank is digested by bacteria, but accumulations still must be pumped out regularly. Soil bacteria decompose the colloidal and dissolved organic material that comes through the leaching field. Prerequisites for this traditional system are suitable land area for the drain field and subsoil that allows sufficient percolation of water. Unfortunately, on-site systems frequently fail, resulting in unpleasant sewage backup into homes and pollution of groundwater and surface waters. Homeowners are often unaware of how the systems work, and most local regulatory programs do not require homeowners to be accountable for them. Substantial nutrient and pathogen pollution of groundwater and surface waters is traced to failed on-site systems. For this reason, the EPA has made several resources available to local and state agencies responsible for maintaining water quality: voluntary national guidelines, a handbook for management, and a manual for on-site wastewater systems. Septic System Primer. The following are some simple suggestions for successful septic system maintenance: Composting Toilet Systems. A viable and relatively inexpensive alternative to septic systems, especially for more remote and occasional use, is the composting toilet system ( Figure 20\u201317) . The objective of the system is to provide a sanitary means of treating human wastes that will destroy human pathogens and produce a stable humus-like end product that can be safely disposed of. These systems require active management, and the end product must legally be buried or removed by a licensed septage hauler. They are capable of reducing toilet wastes to 10\u201330% of their original volume. Their most common use is in vacation cottages, roadside rest stops, and parks, but where building codes permit, they can also be employed in urban settings. The Institute of Asian Research in Vancouver, British Columbia, is a 30,000-square-foot office complex that is not connected to the city sewer system and uses only composting toilets to handle human wastes. Dry leaves Bad smells Ventilation pipe Exhaust fan Pipe for leachate Composting chamber: leaves drainage and waste mix Figure 20\u201317 Composting toilet system. Composting toilets use little or no water. Leaves or hay are added to the solid and liquid wastes from the toilet, and the mixture decomposes to form a clean, safe compost that is later removed. Using Effluents for Irrigation. The nutrient-rich water coming from the standard secondary-treatment process is beneficial for growing plants. The problem is that we don\u2019t want to put that water into waterways, where it will stimulate the growth of undesirable algae. But why not use it for irrigating plants we do want to grow? This is a way of completing the nutrient cycle. Indeed, the concept has been put into practice in a considerable number of locations as an alternative to upgrading the treatment to remove nutrients. The nutrient-rich effluent from standard secondary treatment from St. Petersburg, Florida, was causing cultural eutrophication in Tampa Bay. Now, St. Petersburg uses the effluent to irrigate 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares) of urban open space, from parks and residential lawns to a golf course. Revenues from the water sales help offset operating costs. Similarly, Bakersfield, California, receives a $30,000 annual income from a 5,000-acre (2,000-hectare) farm irrigated with its treated effluent. And Clayton County, Georgia, is irrigating 2,500 acres (1,000 hectares) of woodland with partially treated sewage. Hundreds of similar projects are under way around the country. A number of developing countries irrigate croplands with raw (untreated) sewage effluents. The crops respond well, but parasites and disease organisms can easily be transferred to farmworkers and consumers. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that only treated effluents should 20.3 Eutrophication 513 be used for irrigation. In Matimangwe, Mozambique, sewage is treated in dry pits and turned into a rich fertilizer that dramatically increases the food harvest, using a latrine system called EcoSan. The wastes are mixed with soil and ash and left for eight months, while the lack of moisture and long incubation kill off pathogens and turn the wastes into a rich compost. Reconstructed Wetland Systems. In treating wastewater, it is also possible to make use of the nutrient-absorbing capacity of wetlands in suitable areas and under suitable climatic conditions. The project may be part of a wetlands recovery program, or artificial wetlands may be constructed.", "In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, much of the land around Orlando, Florida, which was originally wetlands, was drained and converted to cattle pasture. At the time, Orlando was discharging 20 million gallons (75 million L) per day of nutrient-rich effluent into the St. Johns River following secondary treatment. Through the Orlando Easterly Wetlands Reclamation Project, 1,200 acres (480 hectares) of pastureland were converted back to wetlands. The project involved scooping soil from pastures and building berms (mounds of earth) around them to create a chain of shallow lakes and ponds. In addition, 2 million wetland plants ranging from bulrushes and cattails to various trees were planted. The effluent entering the upper end now percolates through the wetlands for about 30 days before entering the St. Johns River virtually pure. The project has recreated a wildlife habitat that supports some threatened and endangered species, such as the snail kite. Wetland systems can be designed for small as well as large areas and are becoming an increasingly popular alternative for small communities. The key to success for such systems is to ensure that they are kept in balance and not provided more input than they are able to handle. Many aquatic systems are simply not able to act like wetlands and absorb extra nutrients without major changes in ecosystem function. This response, called eutrophication, is the most widespread water-pollution problem in the United States. CONCEPT CHECK Why is the removal of pathogens and the breakdown of organic molecules insufficient in sewage treatment? \u2610\u2713 20.3 Eutrophication Recall that the term trophic refers to feeding (Chapter 5). Literally, eutrophic means \u201cwell nourished.\u201d Eutrophication is part of the process of natural succession (discussed in Chapter 5 ). Over periods of hundreds or thousands of years, ponds and lakes are gradually enriched with nutrients, leading to changes in the composition of the ecosystem. This natural eutrophication is a normal process. In contrast, the accelerated eutrophication caused by human activities is called cultural eutrophication. Different Kinds of Aquatic Plants To understand eutrophication, you need to be able to distinguish between benthic plants and phytoplankton. Benthic Plants. Benthic plants (from the Greek benthos, meaning \u201cdeep\u201d) are aquatic plants that grow attached to, or are rooted in, the bottom of a body of water. As shown in Figure 20\u201318a, benthic plants may be categorized as submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), which generally grows totally under water, or emergent vegetation, which grows in water but with the upper parts emerging from the water. To thrive, SAV requires water that is clear enough to allow sufficient light to penetrate to allow photosynthesis. As water becomes more turbid (cloudy), light is diminished. In extreme situations, it may penetrate to just a few centimeters beneath the water\u2019s surface. Thus, increasing turbidity decreases the depth at which SAV can survive. Another important feature of SAV is that it absorbs its required mineral nutrients from the bottom sediments through the roots, just as land plants do. SAV is not limited by water that is low in nutrients. Indeed, enrichment of the water with nutrients is counterproductive for SAV because it stimulates the growth of phytoplankton. Phytoplankton. Phytoplankton consist of numerous species of photosynthetic algae, protists, and chlorophyll-containing bacteria (cyanobacteria, formerly referred to as blue-green algae) that grow as microscopic single cells or in small groups, or \u201cthreads,\u201d of cells. Phytoplankton live suspended in the water and are found wherever light and nutrients are available (Figure 20\u201318b ). In extreme situations, water may become pea-soup green (or tea colored, depending on the species involved), and a scum of phytoplankton may float on the surface and absorb essentially all the light. However, phytoplankton reach such densities only in nutrient-rich water, because, not being connected to the bottom, they must absorb nutrients from the water. A low level of nutrients in the water limits the growth of phytoplankton accordingly. Considering the different requirements of SAV and phytoplankton, the balance between them is altered when nutrient levels in the water are changed. As long as water remains low in nutrients, populations of phytoplankton are suppressed, the water is clear, and light can penetrate to support the growth of SAV. As nutrient levels increase, phytoplankton can grow more prolifically, making the water turbid and thus shading out the SAV. Filamentous green algae Green algae Diatoms Cyanobacteria Figure 20\u201318 Aquatic photosynthesizers. (a) Benthic, or bottom-rooted, plants. These are subdivided into submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and emergent vegetation.", "(b) Phytoplankton, various photosynthetic organisms that are either single cells or small groups or filaments of cells, float freely in the water. 20.3 Eutrophication 515 The Impacts of Nutrient Enrichment A lake in which light penetrates deeply\u2014one in which the bottom is visible beyond the immediate shoreline\u2014is oligotrophic (low in nutrients). Such a lake is fed by a watershed that holds its nutrients well. A forested watershed, for example, holds nitrogen and phosphorus tightly and allows very little of those elements to enter the water draining into the streams and rivers. If the streams feed into a lake, it will reflect their low nutrient content. In an oligotrophic lake, the low nutrient levels limit the growth of phytoplankton and allow enough light to penetrate to support the growth of SAV, which draws its nutrients from the bottom sediments. In turn, the benthic plants support the rest of a diverse aquatic ecosystem by providing food, habitats, and dissolved oxygen. Oligotrophic lakes are prized for their aesthetic and recreational qualities as well as for their production of game fish. The Process of Eutrophication. As the water of an oligotrophic body becomes enriched with nutrients, numerous changes are set in motion. First, the nutrient enrichment allows the rapid growth and multiplication of phytoplankton, increasing the turbidity of the water. The increasing turbidity shades out the SAV that lives in the water. With the die-off of SAV, there is a loss of food, habitats, and dissolved oxygen from their photosynthesis. Phytoplankton have remarkably high growth and reproduction rates. Under optimal conditions, phytoplankton biomass may double every 24 hours, a capacity far beyond that of benthic plants. Thus, phytoplankton soon reach a maximum population density, and continuing growth and reproduction are balanced by die-off. Dead phytoplankton settle out, resulting in heavy deposits of detritus on the lake or river bottom. In turn, the abundance of detritus supports an abundance of decomposers, mainly bacteria. The explosive growth of bacteria, consuming oxygen via respiration, creates an additional demand for dissolved oxygen. The result is the depletion of dissolved oxygen, creating hypoxic conditions, with the consequent suffocation of fish and shellfish. A dead zone has been created. A dead zone can be as limited as a small lake basin or as extensive as the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, but the cause is always nutrient enrichment. (The addition of nutrients may also have deleterious effects on wetlands such as salt marshes, as described in Sound Science, Can Salt Marshes Absorb Our Nutrients?) In sum, eutrophication refers to this whole sequence of events, starting with nutrient enrichment and proceeding to the growth and die-off of phytoplankton, the accumulation of detritus, the growth of bacteria, and, finally, the depletion of dissolved oxygen and the suffocation of higher organisms ( Figure 20\u201319) . For humans, a eutrophic body of water is unappealing for swimming, boating, and sportfishing. If the lake is a source of drinking water, its value may be greatly impaired because phytoplankton rapidly clog water filters and may cause a foul taste. Even worse, some species of phytoplankton secrete toxins into the water that may kill other aquatic life and be injurious to human health as well. Shallow Lakes and Ponds. In lakes and ponds whose water depth is 6 feet (2 m) or less, eutrophication takes a somewhat different course. There, SAV may grow to a height of a meter or more, reaching the surface. Thus, with nutrient enrichment, the SAV is not shaded out but grows abundantly, sprawling over and often totally covering the water surface with dense mats of vegetation that make boating, fishing, or swimming impossible. Any vegetation beneath these mats is shaded out. As the mats of vegetation die and sink to the bottom, they create a BOD that often depletes the water of dissolved oxygen, causing the death of aquatic organisms other than bacteria. Harmful Algal Blooms. In 1988, a researcher identified a new organism, a kind of microscopic algae called a dinoflagellate, which she named Pfiesteria piscicida. Under certain conditions, some members of this genus secrete a toxin that harms fish. Pfiesteria species have been implicated in at least 50 major fish kills in North Carolina. These fish kills and other problems caused by large concentrations of Pfiestreria are examples of harmful algal blooms. Red tides are harmful Figure 20\u201319 Eutrophication. A s nutrients are added from sources of pollution, an oligotrophic system rapidly becomes eutrophic and undesirable.", "20.3 Eutrophication 517 algal blooms consisting of high concentrations of various species of toxic dinoflagellates. Red tides occur in coastal waters around the world, often in dead zones. Scientists believe that nutrient pollution\u2014especially of nitrogen and phosphorus\u2014is the basic culprit in feeding the growth of the algae in estuaries and coastal waters. Recently, five federal agencies joined to sponsor the Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms, a national research program studying algal blooms in U.S. coastal waters. Combating Eutrophication There are two approaches to combating the problem of cultural eutrophication. One is to attack the symptoms\u2014the growth of vegetation, the lack of dissolved oxygen, or both. The other is to get at the root cause\u2014excessive inputs of nutrients and sediments. Attacking the Symptoms. Attacking the symptoms is appropriate in certain situations where immediate remediation is the goal and costs are not prohibitive. Methods of attacking the symptoms of eutrophication include applying herbicides, aerating, harvesting aquatic weeds, and drawing water down. Applying Herbicides. Herbicides are often applied to ponds and lakes to control the growth of nuisance plants. To control phytoplankton growth, copper sulfate and diquat are frequently used. For controlling SAV and emergent vegetation, fluridone, glyphosate, and 2,4-D are employed. However, at the concentrations required to bring the vegetation under control, these compounds are sometimes toxic to fish and aquatic animals. Also, fish are often killed after herbicide is applied, because the rotting vegetation depletes the water of dissolved oxygen. In sum, herbicides provide only cosmetic treatment, and as soon as they wear off, the vegetation grows back rapidly. Aerating. In the final and most destructive stage of eutrophication, decomposers deplete the water of dissolved oxygen, thus suffocating other aquatic life. Artificial aeration of the water can avert this terminal stage. An aeration technique currently gaining in popularity is to lay a network of plastic tubes with microscopic pores on the bottom of the waterway to be treated. High-pressure air pumps force microbubbles from the pores, and the bubbles dissolve directly into the water. The method is proving effective in speeding up the breakdown of accumulated detritus, improving water quality, and enabling the return of more desirable aquatic life. Despite its high cost, the technique is applicable to harbors, marinas, and some water-supply reservoirs, where the demand for better water quality justifies the cost. Harvesting. In shallow lakes or ponds, where the problem is bottom-rooted vegetation reaching and sprawling over the surface, harvesting the aquatic weeds (see Figure 20\u201320) may be an expedient way to improve the water\u2019s recreational potential and aesthetics. Commercial mechanical harvesters are used, and nearby residents sometimes get together to remove the vegetation by hand. Figure 20\u201320 Eutrophication in a shallow pond. In shallow water, sufficient light for photosynthesis continues to reach the submerged aquatic vegetation. The oversupply of nutrients stimulates growth, so that vegetation reaches the surface and forms mats. Here, vegetation has been raked into piles for harvesting. The harvested vegetation makes good organic fertilizer and mulch. But even harvesting has a limited effect: The vegetation soon grows back because roots are left in the nutrient-rich sediments. Harvesting can be labor intensive. Because China is so densely populated, its economy and pollution have a significant effect on coastal waters. When Beijing hosted the 2008 Olympics, the sailing competitions were held in the coastal town of Qingdao. Just a few weeks before the competitions, agricultural waste, sewage, warmer-thanusual water, and heavy rains combined to provide the perfect conditions for the growth of green algae, resulting in a record-breaking algal bloom that affected 5,000 square miles (more than 13,000 km2) of seawater. To clean up the coast, 10,000 Chinese soldiers and volunteers and 1,400 boats were employed to remove more than a million metric tons of algae. Drawing Water Down. Because many recreational lakes are dammed, another option for shallow-water weed control is to draw the lake down for a period each year. This process kills most of the rooted aquatic plants along the shore, although they grow back in time. All of these approaches are only temporary fixes for the problem and have to be repeated often, at significant cost, to keep the unwanted plant growth under control. Getting at the Root Cause. Controlling eutrophication requires long-term strategies for correcting the problem, which ultimately means reducing the inputs of nutrients and sediments\u2014two of the types of pollution discussed at the beginning of this chapter. The first step is to identify the major point and nonpoint sources of nutrients and sediments.", "Then it is a matter of developing and implementing strategies for correction. Which source or factor is most significant will depend on the human population and the land uses within the particular watershed. Therefore, each watershed must be analyzed as a separate entity, and appropriate measures must be taken to reduce the levels of nutrients and sediments exiting from that watershed. In the sections that follow, we shall discuss major strategies used to control the root causes of eutrophication. First, consider the concept of limiting factors, in which the lack of only one nutrient can suppress growth (Chapter 3). In natural freshwater systems, phosphorus is the most common limiting factor. In marine systems (like the coastal Gulf of Mexico), the limiting nutrient is most often nitrogen. Both in the environment and in biological systems, phosphorus (P) is present as phosphate (PO43\u2212), and nitrogen is present in a variety of compounds, most commonly as nitrate (NO3\u2212) or the ammonium ion (NH4+). Ecoregional Nutrient Criteria. Beginning in 2001, the EPA began publishing water-quality nutrient criteria aimed at preventing and reducing the eutrophication that affects so many bodies of water. The agency listed its recommended criteria for causative factors\u2014nitrogen and phosphorus\u2014 and for response factors\u2014chlorophyll a as a measure of both phytoplankton density and water clarity. The EPA divided the country into ecoregions and determined criteria levels for each specific region. Like the other water quality criteria, the nutrient criteria are provided as targets for the states as they address their water-pollution (and especially their eutrophication) problems. National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES): Control Strategy for Point Sources. In the past, discharges from sewage-treatment plants were major sources of nutrients entering waterways. The levels of phosphate in effluents from these plants were elevated even more in areas where laundry detergents containing phosphate were used. Phosphate contained in detergents moved through the system and out with the discharge unless the system had a nutrient removal component. In regions where eutrophication had been identified as a problem, a key step toward prevention was to ban the sale of phosphate-based laundry detergents. Because many states established bans on the use of these products, the major laundry detergent manufacturers voluntarily ended their manufacture in 1994. However, these bans do not usually cover dishwashing detergents, some brands of which contain as much as 8.7% phosphate. Bans on detergents with phosphate and upgrades of sewage-treatment plants have brought about marked improvements in waterways that were heavily damaged by effluents from these plants. In a sense, however, these are the easy measures, as the target for correction (the effluent) is an obvious point source, and methods for correcting the problem are clear cut. The NPDES permitting process is the basic regulatory tool for reducing point-source pollutants. Under the Clean Water Act, \u201canyone discharging pollutants from any point source into waters of the U.S. [must] obtain an NPDES permit from EPA or an authorized state.\u201d More than 140,000 facilities are now regulated by way of NPDES permits. The permit must be drawn up in the context of the total pollutant sources (point and nonpoint) affecting a watershed or body of water. Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL): Control Strategy for Nonpoint Sources. Correction becomes more difficult, but no less important, when the source is diffuse, as in the case of farm and urban runoff. Remediation of such nonpoint sources will require thousands\u2014perhaps millions\u2014of individual property owners to adopt new practices regarding land management and the use of fertilizer and other chemicals on their properties. Nevertheless, that is the challenge. Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires states to develop management programs to address nonpoint sources of pollution. Thus, there is a legal mandate to address the issues of agricultural and urban runoff. The EPA has opted to develop regulations via the TMDL program. The concept is straightforward: As with most attempts at solving environmental problems, the devil is in the details. The states are responsible for administering TMDL pollution abatement, but the EPA maintains oversight and approval of the results. State administrators have a number of options for managing nonpoint-source pollution, including regulatory programs, technical assistance, financial assistance, education and training, and demonstration projects. By 2015, the states had listed more than 42,000 water bodies as being impaired. More than 7,700 were on the list because of nutrient overload. The EPA has approved more than 68,000 TMDLs submitted by the states to correct the impairments and has substantially closed the gap between the state listings and the approved TMDLs.", "Best Management Practices. Reducing or eliminating pollution from nonpoint sources will involve different strategies for different sources. For example, where a significant portion of the watershed is devoted to agricultural activities, the major sources of nutrients and sediments are likely to be (1) erosion and leaching of fertilizer from croplands and (2) runoff of animal wastes from barns and feedlots. All the practices that can be used to minimize such erosion, runoff, and leaching are lumped under a single term, best management practices. This includes all the methods of soil conservation available (discussed in Chapter 11). Table 20\u20132 lists examples of these practices for a variety of nonpoint sources. Once control measures have been put in place, the polluted body of water must be monitored to determine whether water quality standards are being attained. Several years of data collection may be necessary to detect genuine trends in quality. When water quality standards are reached and sustained, the body of water is removed from the list of impaired waters. To date, 1,125 bodies of water have improved enough to be removed from the list. If standards are not met, the TMDL process must be revisited and new pollution allowances allocated. Recovery. The good news is that cultural eutrophication and other forms of water pollution can be controlled and often reversed, provided that a total watershed management approach is undertaken. For a small lake fed from 20.3 Eutrophication 519 a modest-sized watershed, the task may be quite straightforward because major sources of nutrients can be identified and addressed. For large bodies of water, such as the Chesapeake Bay\u2014with a watershed of 63,700 square miles (165,000 km2) in six states and the District of Columbia\u2014 the task is enormous. The Chesapeake Bay has suffered from heavy nutrient pollution, with cultural eutrophication destroying all but a tenth of the 600,000 acres of vital sea grasses that once formed the basis of the bay\u2019s rich ecosystem. A dead zone involving up to 40% of the main bay appears for 10 months of every year. The Chesapeake Bay Program, a state-federal partnership begun in 1987, set the ambitious goal of achieving federal clean water standards by 2010. Unfortunately, new development in the watershed contributed nutrients and sediments as fast as the restoration efforts reduced them. Although there have been signs that the dead zone has been decreasing, other water quality indicators have shown little change. In 2010, the EPA designed a longer-term, tributary-based strategy to restore the bay by 2025, with several stages of action to reduce pollution. 2 Lake Washington. One remarkable success story is Lake Washington, east of Seattle ( Figure 20\u201321) . This 34-squaremile lake is at the center of a large metropolitan area. During the 1940s and 1950s, 11 sewage-treatment plants were sending state-of-the-art treated water into the lake at a rate of 20 million gallons per day. At the same time, phosphate-based detergents came into wide use. The lake responded to the massive input of nutrients by developing unpleasant \u201cblooms\u201d of noxious blue-green algae. The water lost its clarity, the desirable fish populations declined, and masses of dead algae accumulated on the shores of the lake. 2Juliet Eilperin, \u201cEPA UnveilsMassive Restoration Plan for Chesapeake Bay,\u201d The Washington Post, December 30, 2010. Figure 20\u201321 Lake Washington. A testimony to the fact that bod-ies of water can recover from cultural eutrophication, Lake Washington is now thriving because sources of nutrients enriching the lake have been removed. Citizen concern led to the creation of a system that diverted the treatment-plant effluents into nearby Puget Sound, where tidal flushing would mix them with open-ocean water. The diversion was complete by 1968, and the lake responded quickly. The algal blooms diminished, the water regained its clarity, and by 1975, recovery was complete. Before the diversion, the lake was receiving 220 tons of phosphate per year from all sources. Afterward, the total dropped to 40 tons per year, well within the lake\u2019s normal capacity to absorb phosphate by depositing it in deep bottom sediments. One clear lesson learned was that sewage-treatment effluent must never be allowed to enter a lake unless nutrients are removed as part of the treatment. The major lesson, however, was that eutrophication can be reversed by paying attention to nutrient inputs and addressing the various sources. Lake management, in other words, is a matter of controlling the phosphate loading into a lake from all sources: human and animal sewage, agricultural and yard fertilizers, street runoff, and failing septic systems.", "Many lakes are now protected by associations of concerned citizens who see themselves as stewards of their lake. What strategies can be used to decrease the amount of nonpoint-source pollution entering a river? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 20.4 National and International Policy and Water Pollution Water pollution policy is primarily a national responsibility, although there are also international treaties designed to protect water quality. First we will consider the key U.S. policies relating to water pollution. Then we will consider the key international policies. U.S. Water Quality Policies. In the United States, the responsibility for overseeing the health of the nation\u2019s waters rests with the EPA. However, the EPA can develop regulations only if Congress gives it the authority to do so. Hence, the foundation for public policy must be the laws passed by Congress. Some major legislative milestones in protecting the nation\u2019s waters are listed in Table 20\u20133. The landmark legislation is the Clean Water Act of 1972 (CWA), which gave the EPA jurisdiction over (and for the first time required permits for) all point-source discharges of pollutants; simply put, all discharges into U.S. waters are unlawful unless authorized by a permit. This act and subsequent amendments have provided $85 billion to help cities and towns build treatment plants to meet the federal requirement for secondary treatment of all sewage. As the table shows, the 1987 amendments to the CWA established a revolving loan fund\u2014the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) program\u2014to replace the direct-grants program. To build treatment facilities, local governments borrow at low interest rates, and as they repay the loans, the funds received are used for more loans. The fund may also be used to control nonpoint-source pollution. To date, more than $100 billion in SRF loans have been made, funding more than 33,000 projects. Reauthorization of the Clean Water Act is long overdue. Congress has been hung up on debates over whether regulations should be strengthened or weakened, whether federal regulations in the wetlands permit program intrude on private land-use rights, and how regulatory relief should be provided to industries, states, cities, and individuals required to take actions to comply with the regulations. Its approach for the past two decades has been to reauthorize the provisions of the CWA and its amendments, usually maintaining a status quo in the EPA\u2019s annual appropriations for CWA programs. The EPA has identified nonpoint-source pollution as the nation\u2019s number-one water-pollution problem, with the construction of new wastewater-treatment facilities not far behind. Other significant issues\u2014including storm-water discharges, combined and separate sewer overflows, wetland protection, mountaintop mining filling of streams, and animal feeding operations\u2014are also receiving the EPA\u2019s attention in the form of new regulations. Overall, much progress has been made in the 45 years since the enactment of the Clean Water Act. This act is seen as one of the most successful of our nation\u2019s environmental laws. The number of people in the United States served by adequate sewage-treatment plants has risen from 85 million to 223 million. Soil erosion has been reduced by 1 billion tons annually, and two-thirds of the nation\u2019s waterways are safe for fishing and swimming\u2014double the number from 1972. Many of the nation\u2019s most heavily used rivers, lakes, and bays\u2014including the Androscoggin River in Maine, Boston Harbor, the upper Mississippi River, the South Platte River, the upper Arkansas River, Lake Erie, the Illinois River, and the Delaware River\u2014have been cleaned up and restored. Fish now swim in rivers once so polluted that only bacteria and sludge worms could survive. Levels of toxic chemicals in the Great Lakes have been greatly reduced. International Water Policy. Agreements about lakes and rivers that cross national boundaries, or transboundary waters, are critical to the protection of shared resources. The water in many rivers, seas, and oceans arises from watersheds in several countries. Regional treaties are commonly used to protect such bodies of water. For example, more than 143 countries participate in regional seas programs, a part of the UN Regional Seas Programme. Such programs encourage countries to work together to protect specific oceans, seas, and coasts, including the Caribbean, East and South Asian Seas, and southeast Pacific. The Mediterranean Sea is a good example of a body of water under stress. It is heavily polluted by the many cities, villages, and farms along its coast, while the large amount of international shipping on its waters poses the threat of water-borne diseases and the introduction of exotic species.", "To protect the Mediterranean, the nations along its coast 20.4 National and International Policy and Water Pollution 521 have agreed to control dumping and the run-off of pollution, provide protected areas, and otherwise protect its waters. There have been several treaties dealing with oil pollution, especially from ships. The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter was implemented in 1975. In 1982, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea increased the amount of control countries had over the waters off their coastlines, in part to give them ways to prevent pollution. The Global Ocean Commission report of 2014 made recommendations for the protection of ocean waters from hazardous waste (Chapter 22) and solid wastes ( Chapter 21 ). To highlight the importance of water, the United Nations declared 2005\u20132015 the International Decade of Action: Water for Life. Energy was focused on providing both a higher quality and a greater quantity of water to those who lacked it. Actions to improve water quality included efforts to decrease chemical pollution, agricultural runoff, and the contamination of water by sewage; such efforts require coordination between potential polluters and watershed managers. In conclusion, we need to apply a sense of stewardship to our rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans. The United States and other countries have demonstrated that it is possible to restore waters from a previously polluted condition.

Chapter 21 Learning Objectives 21.1 Solid Waste: A Global Problem: Describe global trends in the production of municipal solid waste (MSW); identify the problems caused by disposable products and escaped trash. 21.2 Disposal of Waste in the United States: Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the disposal of MSW in landfills and combustion facilities. 21.3 Better Solutions: Source Reduction and Recycling: Evaluate these two options for reducing the amount of MSW that must be managed. 21.4 Public Policy and Waste Management: Compare the roles of U.S. federal, state, and local governments in the management of MSW. Explain how international cooperation can help resolve global issues related to waste. Municipal Solid Waste: Disposal and Recovery If there were a race for the most sustainable waste management, the country of Sweden would be the frontrunner! Today less than 1% of Sweden\u2019s trash ends up in landfills. (In the United States, nearly 70% goes to landfills.) One reason for the Swedes\u2019 success is that they actively promote waste reduction when producing and using products; they also recycle, which removes much of the material from their waste stream. But a great deal of their success is the result of 32 power plants that burn trash for fuel. A s the huge incinerators burn waste, they heat water, producing steam that turns turbines and generates electricity. The air given off by the incinerators is scrubbed and the ashes are treated to remove metals, gravel, and other components so only a tiny fraction of the ash ends up in landfills. Every year, Sweden\u2019s waste-to-energy plants burn two million tons of trash, producing enough electricity for one quarter of a million homes. In addition, the excess heat from the plants is used to heat one million homes (Chapter 14) . Sweden has been so successful with its waste-to-power plants that it imports trash from other countries; as much as 700,000 tons a year.", "The beauty of the system is that other countries, including the United Kingdom, pay Sweden to take their waste, which Sweden then uses for energy. Sweden may be the world\u2019s best example of waste efficiency, but the Swedes envision still better\u2014reducing and recycling even more before materials are disposed of permanently. Reusing Landfills. Even when materials are used efficiently, some landfills are inevitable, and once a landfill is full, cities must determine how to use the land above it. In the United States, some municipalities are finding that closed landfills can be sustainable-energy goldmines, places where solar arrays, wind turbines, and trapped methane can be used to generate electricity. For example, the town These young Swedes are recycling; only 1% of the household trash in Sweden ends up in landfills. 21.1 Solid Waste: A Global Problem 525 of Canton, Massachusetts, worked with Boston-based Southern Sky Renewable Energy to erect an array of 24,000 solar panels on a capped landfill. The 15-acre solar array generates 5.6 megawatts of power, enough to supply 5,600 homes. It is also projected to generate some $16 million in revenues for the town over the next 25 years. Lagos Forges Forward. In the developing world, the country of Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous nation, is also facing challenges related to waste management. Its rapidly growing capital, Lagos, a city of 20 million, is known as the \u201cgarbage capital of the world.\u201d Every day its residents throw away 11,000 tons of waste. At the same time, the city struggles to produce electrical power, sometimes surviving with only four hours of electricity a day. Recently city planners have designed a power plant that would burn the methane produced by the decomposition of the city\u2019s waste, providing the city with greatly needed electricity and reducing its 21.1 Solid Waste: A Global Problem From Sweden to Lagos, the disposal of trash is an increasingly critical issue. Over the years, the amount of MSW generated by people around the world has grown steadily, in part because of growing populations, but also because of changing lifestyles and the increasing use of disposable materials and excessive packaging. The term used to describe all of the materials thrown away from homes and small commercial establishments is municipal solid waste (MSW). It is also called trash, refuse, or garbage. MSW does not include hazardous waste and nonhazardous industrial waste, which are covered elsewhere (Chapter 22) . Waste Production in the United States We produce a lot of trash. In 1960, the average American generated 2.7 pounds (1.2 kg) of MSW per day. In 2012, each of us generated an average of 4.4 pounds (2 kg) of such waste per day. The total MSW that year was 251 million tons (230 million metric tons)\u2014enough waste to fill 95,000 garbage trucks each day. Composition of Waste. What does all this waste consist of? Figure 21\u20131 shows the overall composition of MSW in the United States. However, the proportions of the components of waste vary greatly, depending on whether the source of the trash is commercial or residential, as well as the nature of the neighborhood. The composition of waste also varies throughout the year; during certain seasons, yard wastes, such as grass clippings and raked leaves, add greatly to the solid-waste burden. In many places, little attention is given to what people put in their trash. Even if there are restrictions and prohibitions, many hazardous substances\u2014paint, used motor oil, electronic equipment, and so on\u2014are discarded in trash. greenhouse gas emissions. City planners are also focusing on changing the way waste is recycled. At present, most recycling is done by people who survive by picking through trash, looking for items to use or sell. The new plan would formalize the recycling process, greatly reducing the amount of waste going into landfills and providing much-needed jobs for the city\u2019s residents. A s we will see in this chapter, the issues related to solid waste disposal vary around the world. Developed countries have the resources to invest in innovative technologies, such as waste-to-energy power plants and solar arrays on old landfills, while lower-income countries have difficulty affording such solutions. In this chapter we will explore the problems related to waste disposal and the connections between waste disposal and energy, as well as ways to reduce the amount of waste we discard. We will also consider the kinds of local, national, and international policies that are needed for sustainable waste disposal. Modern Disposables.", "Much of the increase in our production of waste stems from our use of disposable products. It is much more common today than in earlier generations to throw away single-use objects such as paper cups and plates. Paper and cardboard also pose a problem as they represent a resource that is wasted when put into a dump or landfill. When they decay, they produce greenhouse gases. Such materials can easily be reused or recycled. Other difficulties arise from the use of modern materials, especially plastics. Plastics are cheap and easy to make but chemically complex, so they do not decay easily. They can also release toxic chemicals when placed in landfills or when burned. In developing countries, where the open burning of trash is common, burning plastics are a health hazard to those living nearby. The United States provides an example of the waste produced in one wealthy, developed nation. As we will see next, the composition of waste in developing countries is quite different. Paper, paperboard 27.4% Food wastes 14.5% Yard waste 13.5% Plastics 12.7% Metals 8.9% Rubber, leather, textiles 8.7% Wood 6.3% Glass 4.6% Other 3.3% Figure 21\u20131 Composition of U.S. municipal waste. Paper and cardboard are the largest component of solid waste in the United States. Plastics and food and yard wastes are also significant components of the waste stream.

These graphs compare the amount of waste generated by countries of different income levels in 2010 and 2025. (a) The total amount of waste produced by all groups of countries is expected to increase by 2025, although the rate of increase depends upon the economic level of the country. (b) The average amount of waste produced per person is greatest in the high-income countries, but is expected to increase in countries of all income levels. Worldwide Trends The total amount of waste produced and the components of that waste vary greatly from country to country, as does the ultimate fate of that waste. In 2012, the World Bank released a report on solid waste disposal around the world that highlighted a number of patterns and trends. 1 One major pattern is that wealthy countries produce more trash per person than lower-income countries, as shown in Figure 21\u20132a. For example, the wealthiest countries of the world, those of the 1D. Hoornweg and P. Bhada-Tata, What a Waste: A Global Review of Solid Waste Management (Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 2012). Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), have a total population similar to that of the continent of Africa, home to many of the poorest countries, and yet the OECD countries produce 100 times as much waste as the countries of Africa. As countries become wealthier or more urbanized, their per capita waste production increases. Over time, the people in all groups of nations have been producing more trash, a trend that is expected to continue (Figure 21\u20132b) . Because the lower-middle income countries have rapidly growing populations and economies, that group of countries is expected to produce the largest total volume of trash by 2025. The types of waste materials also vary by region and income level ( Figure 21\u20133) . People in wealthy countries put less Organic 28% Paper 31% Plastic 11% Glass 7% Metal 6% Other 17% Lower-Middle Income (396 MT) Low-Income Upper-Middle Income High Income (75 MT) (243 MT) (602 MT) Figure 21\u20133 Composition of MSW in countries of various income levels. There are significant differences in the kinds of wastes produced by countries of different income levels. Low-income countries produce less solid waste than high-income countries, but a greater percentage of that waste is organic matter. Totals are in metric tons (MT). 21.1 Solid Waste: A Global Problem 527 organic material, such as yard waste, into the MSW stream. People in wealthy countries discard more paper than those in lower-income countries, but they also recycle more. The World Bank also found that the fate of collected waste varies by economy.", "Low- and middle-income countries spend a greater proportion of their waste-management resources on waste collection, while high-income countries spend a greater proportion on waste disposal. Lower-income countries often do not have the resources to invest in modern methods of MSW disposal. As urbanization increases in lower-income countries, the problems associated with waste disposal also increase. Both within nations and between nations, waste is often shipped from higher-income areas to lower-income areas where there are fewer environmental regulations and little protection for those who work with waste. When Trash Escapes Trash that is not disposed of properly can cause endless environmental trouble. Often it makes its way through storm sewers and rivers until it reaches beaches or ocean water. Trash in the ocean is now a significant environmental problem (also discussed in Chapters 7 and 20). Even remote patches of the ocean have been found to contain trash. About 70% of all marine litter sinks onto the seabed, where it damages bottom communities. Swirling currents move the trash that remains floating into endlessly cycling garbage patches, or garbage gyres. There are six of these gyres in the oceans. The largest, the Pacific garbage gyre, actually comprises two smaller patches (Figure 21\u20134) . One report estimated that the plastic near the surface of the Pacific gyre weighed six times as much as the plankton in that part of the ocean. The plastic trash in the ocean has a number of features that make it dangerous. Some plastics can leach chemicals into the water or absorb chemicals such as DDT and PCBs. Most plastic objects float, so aquatic animals may become entangled in them ( Figure 21\u20135) . Discarded, abandoned, and lost fishing gear alone accounts for about 10% of marine debris. This gear often continues to trap organisms, a process called \u201cghost fishing\u201d. Scientists estimate that 70% of the endangered North Atlantic right whales have been entangled in fishing gear. Plastics can also break into small pieces; in fact, 90% of the plastic in the ocean is in pieces smaller than a fingernail. Aquatic animals can mistake these plastic pieces for food; unfortunately, the plastic pieces often kill the animals that swallow them. CONCEPT CHECK How does the kind and amount of MSW produced in high-income countries differ from that produced in low-income countries? How does the disposal of MSW differ between these two groups of countries? \u2610\u2713 Figure 21\u20135 A plastic hazard. Solid waste in the ocean often kills animals that eat it or become entangled in it. 21.2 Disposal of Waste in the United States In the United States, local governments have the primary responsibility for collecting and disposing of MSW. The local jurisdiction may own trucks and employ workers, or it may contract with a private firm to provide the collection service. Traditionally, the cost of waste pickup is passed along to households via taxes. More recently, many municipalities have opted for pay-as-you-throw systems, in which households are charged for waste collection on the basis of the amount of trash they throw away. Some municipalities put all trash collection and disposal in the private sector, with the collectors billing each home by the volume and weight of trash. The MSW that is collected is then disposed of in a variety of ways. It is at the point of disposal that state and federal regulations begin to apply. Past Practices During America\u2019s early years, many city dwellers simply threw their refuse into alleys or public streets. In coastal cities, wastes were often dumped into the ocean, a common practice in New York Harbor throughout the nineteenth century. By the 1920s, many cities had begun to collect municipal waste and remove it to dumps, largely in response to growing concerns about the spread of disease. Until the 1960s, most MSW in the United States was disposed of in open dumps, although many homes had a barrel in the backyard for burning paper and wood trash. Older residents of smaller towns and cities can remember gathering at the dump to look through discarded items and socialize. In most dumps, the waste was burned to reduce its volume and lengthen the life span of the dumpsite. Because refuse does not burn well, smoldering dumps produced clouds of smoke that could be seen from miles away, smelled bad, and created a breeding ground for flies and rats. Some cities began to use incinerators, or combustion facilities\u2014huge furnaces in which high temperatures allow the waste to burn more completely than in open dumps.", "Without controls, however, incinerators were prime sources of air pollution. During the 1960s and early 1970s, public objections and air pollution laws forced the phase-out of private burning barrels, public open dumps, and many incinerators. Open dumps were then converted to landfills. In 2012, 54% of the MSW in the United States was disposed of in landfills, 35% was recovered for recycling and composting, and the remainder (12%) was burned or incinerated. Over the past 10 years, the landfill and combustion components have been declining, while recycling has shown a steady increase. Landfills In a landfill, the waste is put on or in the ground and is covered with earth. Because there is no burning and because each day\u2019s fill is covered with at least six inches of earth, air pollution and populations of vermin are kept down. Unfortunately, aside from those concerns and the minimizing of cost, no other factors were given real consideration when the first landfills were opened. Municipal waste managers generally had little understanding of ecology, the water cycle, or what products decomposing wastes would generate, and they had no regulations to guide them. Therefore, in general, any cheap, conveniently located piece of land on the outskirts of town became the site for a landfill. Frequently, this site was a natural gully or ravine, an abandoned stone quarry, a section of wetlands, or a previous dump. Once the municipality acquired the land, dumping commenced without any precautions. After the site was full, it would be covered with earth and ignored. Only recently have abandoned landfills been seen as a valuable open-space resource. Problems of Landfills. Landfills are subjected to biological and physical factors in the environment and will undergo change over time as a consequence of the operation of those factors on the waste that is deposited. Several of the changes are undesirable because, if they are not dealt with effectively, they present the following problems: Leachate Generation and Groundwater Contamination. The most serious problem by far is groundwater contamination. As water percolates through a landfill, various chemicals in the materials may dissolve in the water and get carried along in a process called leaching (Chapter 10). The water with various pollutants in it is called leachate. A leachate consists of residues of decomposing organic matter combined with iron, mercury, lead, zinc, and other metals from rusting cans, discarded batteries, and appliances\u2014all generously \u201cspiced\u201d with paints, pesticides, cleaning fluids, newspaper inks, and other chemicals. Poor disposal in landfills can funnel this toxic brew directly into groundwater aquifers. Leachates from landfills that are near the water table can contaminate water supplies. The flat, wet state of Florida has had particular problems with landfills. No matter where Florida\u2019s landfills were located, they were either in wetlands or just a few feet above the water table. As a result, more than 145 former municipal landfill sites in Florida appear on the Superfund list, a national list of heavily polluted sites that jeopardize human health and must be cleaned up ( Chapter 22) . Methane Production. Because it is about two-thirds organic material, MSW is subject to natural decomposition. Buried wastes do not have access to oxygen, however, so their decomposition is anaerobic. A major by-product of the process is biogas, which is about two-thirds methane and one-third hydrogen and carbon dioxide, a highly flammable mixture (see Chapter 20). Produced deep in a landfill, biogas may seep horizontally through the soil and rock, enter basements, and even cause explosions if it accumulates and is ignited. Homes at distances up to 1,000 feet from landfills have been destroyed, and some deaths have occurred as a result of such explosions. Also, gases seeping to the surface kill vegetation by poisoning the roots. Without vegetation, erosion occurs, exposing the unsightly waste. Figure 21\u20136 Landfill gas project. A well collects biogas from the Smith Creek landfill in St. Clair County, Michigan. There are now more than 635 landfill gas energy systems in operation in the United States. Yet the production of biogas also presents an opportunity. There is a thriving industry that is exploiting the problem by installing \u201cgas wells\u201d in existing landfills. The wells tap the landfill gas, and the methane is purified and used as fuel. There are now more than 635 such landfill-gas projects in the United States.", "In 2014, commercial landfill gas in the nation produced 1,600 megawatts of electricity and 100 billion cubic feet of gas for direct-use applications, powering or heating more than 1.7 million homes ( Figure 21\u20136) . The recovery of landfill gas has significant environmental benefits, especially in combating climate change. It directly reduces greenhouse gas emissions because methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and landfills are the largest anthropogenic source of methane emissions in the United States. Methane recovery also reduces the use of coal and oil, which are nonrenewable and highly polluting energy resources. Incomplete Decomposition. The commonly used plastics in MSW resist natural decomposition because of their molecular structure. Chemically, they are polymers of petroleum-based compounds that microbes are unable to digest. Biodegradable plastic polymers have been developed from sources such as cornstarch, cellulose, lactic acid, and soybean protein as well as petroleum. Two kinds of bioplastics based on corn sugars\u2014 polyhydroxyalkanoate and polylactic acid\u2014are in commercial production; a recent estimate from NatureWorks indicates a coming demand for up to 50 billion pounds of bioplastics a year in the next five years. Currently, bioplastics are more expensive than petroleum-based plastics and tend to be used by companies manufacturing natural and certified organic products. They are indeed biodegradable, but some of the corn-based plastics must go to a commercial composting plant to be decomposed. Studying Trash. A team of \u201cgarbologists\u201d from the University of Arizona, led by William Rathje, has been 21.2 Disposal of Waste in the United States 529 carrying out research on old landfills. The research has shown that even materials formerly assumed to be biodegradable, such as newspapers and wood, often decompose very slowly, if at all, in landfills. In one landfill, 30-year-old newspapers were recovered in a readable state, and layers of telephone directories, practically intact, were found marking each year. Because paper materials are 28% of MSW, this is a serious matter. The reason paper and other organic materials decompose so slowly is the absence of suitable amounts of moisture. The more water percolating through a landfill, the faster the paper materials biodegrade. Unfortunately, the more percolation there is, the greater the amount of toxic leachate produced. Settling. Waste settles as it compacts and decomposes. Luckily, this eventuality was recognized from the beginning, so buildings are never constructed on landfills. Settling does present a problem in landfills that have been converted to playgrounds and golf courses because of the creation of shallow depressions (and sometimes deep holes) that collect and hold water. This problem can be addressed by continually monitoring the facility and using fill to restore a level surface. Improving Landfills. Recognizing the foregoing problems, the EPA upgraded siting and construction requirements for new landfills, based on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) and subsequent amendments. Under current regulations, These design features are summarized in Figure 21\u20137 , on the following page. Most landfills currently in operation have these improved technologies, which protect both human health and the environment. The landfill pyramids may well last as long as the Egyptian pyramids. Fortunately, the creative siting and construction of landfills have the potential to address some highly significant future needs, because abandoned landfills can become attractive golf courses, recreational facilities, wildlife preserves, or renewable energy sites.

Between 1988 and 2014, the number of municipal landfills declined from around 8,000 to around 1,900. Because the size of landfills has increased and because recycling is on the rise, the EPA does not believe that landfill capacity is a problem. However, as the agency puts it, \u201cregional dislocations\u201d may be expected. These are due to the one problem associated with landfills that gets more attention than any other: siting. It is not that landfills take up enormous amounts of land. One particular landfill occupying 230 acres (Central Landfill) serves the entire state of Rhode Island, and Fresh Kills, which served much of New York City and its environs for many years, was only 2,200 acres. But as old landfills are closed, it has become increasingly difficult to find land for the new ones needed to take their place. People in residential communities (where the MSW is generated) invariably reject proposals to site landfills anywhere near where they live, and those who already live close to existing landfills are anxious to close them down.", "Weary of the odor and heavy truck traffic, residents of Staten Island, New York, pressured the city of New York to shut down the huge Fresh Kills landfill, once the recipient of 27,000 tons of garbage per day (Figure 21\u20138a) . The city fulfilled its promise to phase out the landfill in 2001, (a) (b) Figure 21\u20138 Fresh Kills landfill before and after. (a) Until 2001, Fresh Kills on Staten Island served as the landfill for the entire city of New York. (b) Since its closure, the land has been developed for recreation and other uses. and Staten Islanders are now enjoying the early stages of the development of Fresh Kills Park, which will eventually include soccer fields, mountain bike and jogging trails, natural areas, and a golf course (Figure 21\u20138b) . Gas from the capped landfill is providing the area with a new energy source. New York City now transports its MSW outside of the city by truck, barge, and rail. Protests against landfills have been repeated in so many parts of the country (and globe!) that it has given rise to some inventive acronyms: LULU (\u201clocally unwanted land use\u201d), NIMBY (\u201cnot in my backyard\u201d), NIMTOO (\u201cnot in my term of office\u201d), and BANANA (build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything)! You can well imagine how these attitudes apply to the landfill-siting problem. Outsourcing. The siting problem has some undesirable consequences. First, it drives up the costs of waste disposal. Second, it leads to the inefficient and equally objectionable practice of the long-distance transfer of trash as waste generators look for private landfills whose owners are anxious to receive trash (and cash). Often, this transfer occurs across state and even national lines, leading to resentment and opposition on the part of citizens of the recipient state or nation. Led by Pennsylvania, 11 states import more than 1 million tons of MSW a year (Table 21\u20131) , while 13 states export more than 1 million tons per year, led by New York. Not surprisingly, the heaviest importing states are adjacent to the heaviest exporting states. 21.2 Disposal of Waste in the United States 531 One positive result of the siting problem is that it encourages residents to reduce their waste and recycle as much as possible. The siting problem also stimulates the use of combustion for waste disposal. Combustion: Waste to Energy Because it has a high organic content, refuse can be burned. Currently, 84 combustion facilities are operating in the United States, burning about 30 million tons of MSW annually\u201412% of the waste stream. This process is really waste reduction, not waste disposal, because after incineration the ash must still be disposed of. Advantages of Combustion. The combustion of MSW has a number of advantages: equipment) contains most of the toxic substances and can be safely put into a landfill. The bottom ash (from the bottom of the boiler) can be used as fill in some construction sites and roadbeds. Some combustion facilities process the bottom ash further to recover metals and then convert the remainder into concrete blocks. Drawbacks of Combustion. Combustion has some drawbacks, too: wants to live near one. Most combustion facilities are located in industrial areas for this reason. An Operating Facility. Let us look at the operation of a typical modern WTE facility, which might serve a number of communities or a large metropolitan area. Servicing a population of 1 million or more, the plant receives about 3,000 tons of MSW per day. The waste comes in by rail and truck, and the communities pay disposal fees. Waste processing is efficient because, overall, about 80% of the MSW is burned for energy, 12% is recovered, and 8% is put in landfills. The process, pictured in Figure 21\u20139, is as follows: Electric power to utility 5 Steam piped to turbine generator Steam drumFerrous metals to market Ferrous metals Lime reagent 12 Spray dryer Inspection Shredder Magnet station Boiler ash Tipping floor Vibrating 6 To metals Induced StackFly ash feeder recovery system 8 draft fan Figure 21\u20139 Waste-to-energy combustion facility. Schematic flow for the separation of materials and combustion in a typical, modern WTE combustion facility. Numbers refer to steps in the process as described in the text. An appreciation for the impact of such a facility can be gained from looking at the outcome of a year\u2019s operation.", "In one year, 1 million tons of MSW are processed, 40,000 tons of metal are recycled, and 65 megawatts of power are generated\u2014 the equivalent of more than 60 million gallons of fuel oil and enough electricity to power 65,000 homes. All this comes from stuff that people have thrown away! Costs of Municipal Solid-Waste Disposal The costs of disposing of MSW are escalating, and not just because of the new design features of landfills. More and more, they reflect the expenses of acquiring a site and providing transportation. Landfill disposal fees average about $44 a ton (they are lower than those at WTE facilities because of the high capital costs at WTE facilities). The waste collector must recover this cost, as well as the costs of transporting materials to the site, and generate a profit (if the facility is privately operated). With the closing of the Fresh Kills landfill, the total cost (including sanitation vehicles and workers) of disposing of New York City\u2019s MSW rose to $260 a ton. At 12,900 tons per day, this amounts to more than $1 billion a year. Getting rid of all trash is becoming more expensive, and one sad consequence of this increasing expense is illegal dumping. Some towns are charging up to $5 a bag for MSW disposal, and it now costs several dollars to get rid of an automobile tire and $30 or more to dispose of a refrigerator. As a result, tires, refrigerators, yard waste, car parts, and construction waste are appearing all over the landscape. Institutions and apartments that operate with dumpsters often put padlocks on them in order to prevent their unauthorized use by people trying to avoid disposal costs. Many states have established a corps of environmental police to track down midnight dumpers and bring them to justice. What are the advantages of disposing of trash in waste-to-energy facilities rather than landfills? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 21.3 Better Solutions: Source Reduction and Recycling 533 21.3 Better Solutions: Source Reduction and Recycling Our domestic wastes and their disposal represent a huge stream of material that flows in one direction: from our resource base to disposal sites. The economic and environmental costs of this stream of waste are high, causing us to consider ways to reduce the flow. In general, we can reduce our production of waste by reducing the amount of materials consumed, by reusing materials in the form they were made, and by recycling or composting materials into new products. The best of these strategies is to reduce waste at its source\u2014called source reduction. In EPA\u2019s waste management hierarchy, source reduction is right at the top ( Figure 21\u201310) . Source Reduction The EPA defines source reduction as \u201cthe practice of designing, manufacturing, purchasing, or using materials (such as products and packaging) in ways that reduce the amount or toxicity of trash created.\u201d Source reduction accomplishes two goals: It reduces the amount of waste that must be managed, and it conserves resources by preventing the use of virgin materials. It is noteworthy that, after rising rapidly during the latter decades of the 20th century, the amount of waste per capita in the United States peaked at 4.5 pounds in 1990 and has since leveled off. Source reduction is difficult to measure because it means trying to measure something that no longer exists. The EPA measures source reduction by measuring consumer spending, which reflects the goods and products that ultimately make their way to the trash bin. For example, after 1990, consumer spending continued to grow, but the MSW stream slowed down. If the MSW had grown at the same pace as consumer spending, some 287 million tons would have been generated in 2000 instead of 232 million. Thus, some 55 million tons never made it into the waste stream in 2000, and the EPA considers this to be due to source-reduction activities. Waste Management Hierarchy Most preferred Least preferred Figure 21\u201310 EPA waste management hierarchy. This inverted triangle shows the preferable waste management options from most preferred at the top to least at the bottom. (Source: EPA. Non-Hazardous Waste Management Hierarchy. www.epa.gov/ epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/wte/nonhaz.htm. March 19, 2012.) Source reduction can involve a broad range of activities on the part of homeowners, businesses, communities, manufacturers, and institutions. Consider the following examples: SUSTAINABILITY Figure 21\u201311 Waste reduction by reuse. Yard sales and flea mar-kets are keeping many materials from becoming MSW after a single use.", "The Recycling Solution Just as natural ecosystems recycle nutrients, we can move in the direction of sustainability by recycling more of the materials in our wastes. Recycling involves reducing the original products to scrap material and remaking them into new products. The process of recycling requires an input of energy and can produce pollutants, which is why it is lower on the EPA\u2019s hierarchy than reduction and reuse. More than 75% of MSW is recyclable material. There are two levels of recycling. In primary recycling, the original 21.3 Better Solutions: Source Reduction and Recycling 535 waste material is made back into the same material\u2014for example, newspapers recycled to make newsprint. In secondary recycling, waste materials are made into different products that may or may not be recyclable\u2014for instance, plastic bottles recycled into fleece jackets. Why Recycle? Recycling is a hands-down winner in terms of energy and resource use and pollution: What Gets Recycled? The primary items from MSW that are currently being actively recycled are cans (both aluminum and steel), bottles, plastic containers, newspapers, and yard wastes. Yet there are many alternatives for reprocessing various components of refuse, and people are coming up with new ideas and techniques all the time. A few of the major established techniques, together with their current percentages of recovery by recycling, are as follows: Figure 21\u201312 Deck made from Trex\u00ae decking and railing. Trex is made primarily with recycled plastic grocery bags, and plastic film, and waste wood. (Source: www.trex.com.) in the 45% figure are more than a million tons of tires burned annually in special waste-to-energy facilities. \u2022 Yard wastes (leaves, grass, and plant trimmings\u201458% recovery) can be composted to produce a humus that can be used to enrich soil. Recycling is both an environmental and an economic issue. Many people are motivated to recycle because of environmental concern, but the use of recyclable and recycled materials is also driven by economic factors. The Global Recycling Network ( www.grn.com) is an Internet information exchange that promotes the trade of recyclables from MSW and the marketing of \u201cecofriendly\u201d products made from recyclable materials. Is Recycling Cost Effective? Recycling has its critics, who base their arguments primarily on economics. If the costs of recycling (from pickup to disposal of recyclable components) are compared with the costs of combusting waste or placing it in landfills, recycling frequently comes out second best. Markets for recyclable materials fluctuate wildly, and residents often end up subsidizing the recycling effort. Competition between landfills and combustion facilities often lowers disposal fees, creating an even greater disincentive to recycle. Thus, critics of current recycling practices argue that, unless recycling pays for itself through the sale of the materials recovered, it should not be done. However, a true environmental assessment should compare the energy costs of recycling with the energy costs of landfill or combustion disposal, as well as comparing the energy costs of making products from recyclable goods with the energy costs of making new products from scratch\u2014called a life-cycle analysis. Performed this way, the energy saved by recycling aluminum, for example, is 96%; for newsprint, 45%; for two kinds of plastic, 76\u201388%; and for glass, 21%. Figure 21\u201313 MSW recycling in 90 50% the United States. MSW recycled 80 from 1960 to 2012, as total waste and 40% percentage recycled. 70 (Source: EPA, Office of Solid Waste and 60 Emergency Response, Municipal Solid 30% Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States: Facts and Figures for 2012 (Washington, DC: EPA).) Total MSW recycling (million tons) 50 40 30 20 10 0 20% 10% Percent of generation recycled 0% 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 Municipal Recycling Recycling is probably the most direct way that most people can become involved in environmental issues. If you recycle, you save natural resources from being used and prevent landfills from becoming \u201clandfulls.\u201d Recycling\u2019s popularity is well established: Virtually every state has specific recycling goals, met with varying degrees of success. EPA sources report that only 6.4% of MSW was recycled in 1960 versus 34.5% in 2012 (Figure 21\u201313) . There is a great diversity of approaches to recycling in municipalities, from recycling centers requiring miles of driving to curbside recycling with sophisticated separation processes. The most successful programs have the following characteristics: Figure 21\u201314 Curbside recycling. Recyclable materials are picked up in a San Francisco neighborhood, where residents are issued three bins: one for trash, one for recycling, and one for compostable materials.", "The city now recycles 77% of its waste. recycling rose rapidly and then plateaued. Currently, 71% of the U.S. population is served via 9,066 curbside programs.) Nevertheless, municipalities experience very different recycling rates. New York City, for example, has made great progress\u2014from recycling only 5% to recycling 16%\u2014by mandating curbside recycling for all of its 3 million households. New York\u2019s commercial recycling is at 40%; reports suggest it could reach as high as 90% if it were better planned. The national prize goes to San Francisco, a city that has achieved a recycling rate of 77%. Paper Recycling. Newspapers are by far the most important item that is recycled because of their predominance in the waste stream. It is a simple matter to tie up or bag household newspapers, and the amount recovered by recycling is increasing dramatically. Currently, far more newspaper is being recycled (72%) than discarded. Because more than 25% of the trees harvested in the United States are used to make paper, recycling paper saves trees: A 1-meter stack of newspapers equals the amount of pulp from one tree. The market for used newspapers has fluctuated greatly over the past several decades, rising and then falling. But whatever the price, recycling newspaper is still more sustainable than putting it into a landfill. Today there is a lively international trade in used paper. Forest-poor countries in Europe and Asia purchase wastepaper from the United States and other countries, where there continues to be a surplus of such paper. The technology for producing high-quality paper from recyclable stock has improved greatly, to the point where it is virtually impossible to distinguish the recycled product from \u201cvirgin\u201d paper. There is often some confusion about what is meant by \u201crecycled paper.\u201d The key is the amount of postconsumer recycled paper in a given product. In manufacturing processes, much paper is \u201cwasted\u201d; paper that is routinely recovered and rerouted back into processing is called \u201crecycled paper.\u201d Thus, the total recycled content of a paper can be 50%, although the actual postconsumer amount recovered by recycling might be only 10% of the total amount of paper. Glass Recycling and Bottle Laws. The glass in MSW is primarily in the form of containers, most of which held beverages. The average person drinks about a quart of liquid each day. Much of this volume is packaged in single-serving containers that are used once and then thrown away. Nonreturnable glass containers constitute 3.7% of the solid-waste stream in the United States and about 50% of the nonburnable portion; they also make up a large proportion of roadside litter. Broken bottles along roads, beaches, and parklands are responsible for innumerable cuts and other injuries. Both the mining of the materials and the process used to manufacture the beverage containers create pollution. All of these factors produce hidden costs that do not appear on the price tag of the item; however, we pay for them with taxes to clean up litter as well as with our injuries, flat tires, and environmental degradation. In an attempt to reverse these trends, environmental and consumer groups have promoted bottle laws that facilitate the recycling or reuse of beverage containers. Such laws generally call for a deposit on beverage containers, both reusable and throwaway and both glass and plastic. Retailers are required to accept the used containers and pass them along for recycling or reuse. Bottle laws have been proposed in virtually all state legislatures over the past decade. Nevertheless, in every case, the proposals have met with fierce opposition from the beverage and container industries and certain other groups. The reason for their opposition is economic loss to their operations. The container industry contends that bottle laws will result in the loss of jobs and higher beverage costs for the consumer. As of 2015, 11 states had passed some kind of bottle law. Delaware had such a law and repealed it, and several other states had attempted to pass bottle bills without success. The experience of the states with bottle laws has proved the beverage and bottle industry\u2019s claims to be false. In fact, more jobs are gained than lost, costs to the consumer have not risen, a high percentage of bottles are returned, and there is a marked reduction in the can and bottle portion of litter. A final measure of the success of bottle laws is continued public approval. Repeated attempts have been made to get a national bottle law through Congress\u2014to date, unsuccessfully.", "Opponents argue that such a law would threaten the continued success of curbside recycling, of which beverage containers represent an important source of revenue. However, as curbside recycling 21.3 Better Solutions: Source Reduction and Recycling 537 currently reaches only 71% of the U.S. population, a national bottle law would undoubtedly recover a greater proportion of beverage containers. (States with bottle laws report that 75% of containers are returned, a significant proportion from the curbside collections from people who don\u2019t bother to redeem the containers.) In 2012, recycling and bottle laws resulted in the recovery of 34% of glass containers, 55% of aluminum containers, 71% of steel containers, and 31% of plastic containers. Plastics Recycling. Plastics have a bad reputation in the environmental debate for several reasons. First, plastics have many uses that involve rapid throughput\u2014for example, packaging, bottling, the manufacture of disposable diapers, and the incorporation of plastics into a host of cheap consumer goods. Second, plastics are conspicuous in MSW and litter. Ironically, most trash is disposed of in plastic bags manufactured just for that purpose. Finally, plastics do not decompose in the environment because no microbes (or any other organisms) are able to digest them. (Imagine plastics in landfills delighting archaeologists hundreds of years from now.) Therefore, the possibility of recycling at least some of the plastic in products\u2014containers of liquid, for example\u2014 interests the environmental community. Plastic Bags. Hanging from trees and bushes, blowing along highways, clogging sewer pipes, drifting on ocean currents, plastic bags are everywhere on the planet\u2014everywhere, that is, but the trash or recycling barrel. They cause thousands of deaths of marine mammals and turtles each year. Convenient? Indeed they are, as anyone who has shopped in a supermarket knows. A hundred billion of them are distributed in the United States every year, and close to a trillion are used annually worldwide. Made of low-density polyethylene, plastic bags are difficult to recycle and, like all petroleum-based plastics, are virtually indestructible. China, once a user of 100 billion plastic bags a year, has cracked down on them, banning the production of ultrathin bags\u2014bringing China in line with a number of other countries. In the United States, San Francisco initiated the first citywide ban on plastic grocery bags in 2007; many other cities are instituting similar bans. Instead of using thin plastic bags, customers are encouraged to carry their own cloth bags or to use paper bags or larger, thicker reusable plastic bags that hold five times as much as the standard flimsy bag. Some poverty advocates are concerned that bag laws will make it difficult for the poor, who may not be able to afford reusable bags, but there may be solutions to this problem. Bottled Water. Throughout the world, the number one \u201cnew\u201d drink is bottled water. Health consciousness and suspicions about the safety of tap water have made the plastic water bottle the new symbol of healthy living. More than 10 billion gallons of bottled water were sold in the United States in 2013, making us the world leader in the consumption of bottled water. As a consequence, discarded plastic water bottles now litter our highways and beaches. Only two states have bottle laws that include bottled water and other noncarbonated beverages. People often pay more for bottled water than for gasoline and as much as 10,000 times more Figure 21\u201315 Plastic recycling codes. The numbers on plastic and resin products identify the kind of plastic and are used to sort the products for recycling. Unlike glass and metal, plastics degrade somewhat in the recycling process, so they often cannot be recycled into the same material. Some plastics cannot be recycled. than for water from the tap. Only one in six plastic water bottles is recycled, and the rest end up in litter, landfills, or combustion facilities. For these and other reasons, opposition to bottled water is growing; more than 90 colleges and universities and several states and municipalities have either banned or restricted the distribution of bottled water. Plastics Recycling Codes. If you look on the bottom of a plastic container, you will see a number or some letters inside the little triangle of arrows that represents recyclability (Figure 21\u201315) . The number or the letters are used to differentiate between and sort the many kinds of plastic polymers. The two recyclable plastics in most common use are high-density polyethylene (HDPE, code 2) and polyethylene terephthalate (PETE, code 1).", "In the recycling process, plastics must be melted down and poured into molds, and some contaminants from the original containers may carry over, making it difficult to reuse some plastics for food containers. While this somewhat restricts uses for recyclable plastic, some interesting uses are appearing, with more in the development stage. PETE, for example, is turned into carpets, jackets, film, strapping, and new PETE bottles; HDPE becomes irrigation drainage tiles, sheet plastic, and, appropriately, recycling bins. There are, however, some limits to plastic recycling. Certain plastic products, including rugs, lawn furniture, and polyester clothing, cannot be recycled. Food containers such as water bottles and margarine tubs cannot be made into similar products; instead, they are recycled into less valuable products that may not be recycled. Thus reducing the use of disposable plastics is still the best option for reducing trash. Recycling Tires. During most of the 20th century, used tires were abandoned in dumps, ravines, and empty lots, where they often trapped water and provided breeding grounds for mosquitoes or caught fires and caused pollution ( Figure 21\u201316) . By 1991, there were an estimated 2 billion waste tires in the United States and 242 million scrap tires being produced each year. At that point, 36 states had legislation regulating the disposal of scrap tires and the EPA was promoting longer life for tires, retreading tires, and various ways of recycling tires as well as using them for fuel. Today tire recycling is a global industry that makes use of the scrap tires from millions of vehicles all over the world. Some building projects reuse whole tires. In other cases, tires are cut, shredded, or ground into \u201ccrumb rubber.\u201d The crumb material is incorporated into roadways, synthetic turf, playgrounds, building products, flooring, and noise insulation. Nonetheless, more scrap tires are 21.3 Better Solutions: Source Reduction and Recycling 539 Figure 21\u201316 Tire recycling. Tires can be recycled by shredding them into a lightweight, well-draining material that can be used in many construction projects. Here recycled tires are being used to repair a road after a landslide. Figure 21\u201317 Composting. In large facilities such as this one in Seattle, Washington, organic materials such as grass and yard clippings are piled into long heaps called windrows, where the action of bacteria causes them to decompose. The windrows are turned periodically, allowing more oxy-gen to reach the bacteria and speeding up the decomposition process. being produced than recycled, so tire recycling remains a growth business. Despite the success of tire recycling, the majority of used tires are now burned rather than recycled. When burned, tires contain more energy per weight than coal; they are often burned in WTE plants or in kilns used to manufacture cement. By the early 2000s, there was a market for up to 80 percent of scrap tires in the United States; about 130 million were burned as fuel. The Composting Option. An increasingly popular way of treating yard waste and food residuals (currently 13% of MSW) is composting. Composting, the natural biological decomposition (rotting) of organic matter in the presence of air, can be carried out in the backyard by homeowners, or it can be promoted by municipalities as a way of dealing with a large fraction of MSW. In addition to diverting wastes away from landfills and combustion facilities, composting provides a product that can be used to amend poor soils, fertilize yards and gardens, and promote higher yields to agricultural crops. In 2012, 58% of yard trimmings were recovered from the waste stream. Small-scale composting can be done in backyards, either by making piles of organic waste or by placing it in bins that are specially made for this use. Large-scale composting is carried out by recycling facilities and municipalities. Wastes brought into the facility are usually ground up into smaller pieces and then placed outdoors into rows of long piles called windrows (Figure 21\u201317) . The windrows are turned regularly to allow oxygen to penetrate the piles, promoting natural biological decomposition. In dry regions, water is added to maintain moisture in the windrows. After several months of this treatment, the compost may be screened for different final uses: finely screened for lawns or more coarsely for garden and landscape beds. Recycling Electronics. The volume of e-waste, or discarded electronic devices such as computers, cell phones, game consoles, and television sets, is growing far more rapidly than our ability to deal with it.", "The United States leads the world in e-waste, producing 3.3 million tons a year. One estimate puts the global generation of e-waste at 50 million tons a year. To date, most of this e-waste has been placed in landfills, but an increasing proportion is being recycled. Because e-waste has numerous toxic components, it is classified as hazardous waste. Heavy metals, including lead, mercury, barium, chromium, arsenic, and copper, are found in the wiring and circuit boards and other components of electronic devices. In a landfill, these substances can leach into groundwater. If e-waste is incinerated, these substances are sent into the air. Federal law regulates the transport, treatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes, but not from small businesses and households, so the disposal of this e-waste is left up to the states and municipalities. The states that have laws for e-waste are trying to make sure this waste is not incinerated or placed in landfills. There is broad consensus on the need for federal legislation to manage e-waste. The ideal destination for e-waste is a recycling company that will dismantle the devices, recover the useful materials, and dispose of the rest according to RCRA rules (see Chapter 22) . E-waste contains valuable materials such as indium and palladium, which are quite scarce. Precious metals including gold, silver, and copper can also be recovered, but recovery of these materials is labor intensive. Unfortunately, many recycling companies pack the e-waste into large containers and ship it to China, India, or African countries. An estimated 80% of \u201crecycled\u201d e-waste takes this route, ending up in one of the thousands of small shops in developing countries where laborers pull apart the devices, burn wiring to recover copper, fry circuit boards to free the chips, and dip the chips in buckets of acid to extract gold and silver. Such workers usually have no protection from the hazardous chemicals. Although EU regulations do not allow the transfer of e-waste to poor countries, a black market promotes its smuggling, to the detriment of workers who are too poor to protect themselves. In contrast, legitimate recycling companies use responsible processes for recycling e-waste. In 2013, the U.S. recycling industry supported a proposed bill to restrict the export of e-waste to countries that are not in the EU or OECD, in order to prevent e-waste dumping. Recently, the nation\u2019s largest electronics recycler, Electronics Recyclers International, joined with others to form the e-Stewards Initiative. This initiative certifies e-waste recyclers, assuring consumers and businesses that their e-waste will not be deposited in landfills, incinerated, or exported to developing countries. The regulation of e-waste and the intelligent use of its valuable raw materials demands more attention, but this is a promising start. Regional Recycling Options As landfills close down and MSW is transferred out of cities and towns, transfer stations are set up to receive the wastes from collection trucks and transfer them to larger vehicles for long-distance hauling to their final destination. It is an encouraging sign that a number of these transfer stations are being converted into materials recovery facilities, referred to in the trade as MRFs, or \u201cmurfs.\u201d In 2014, there were 1,622 MRFs operating in the United States, handling over 100,000 tons of MSW a day. More and more, these facilities are designed to receive the collections of single-stream recycling, where all possible recyclable components are commingled. Alternatively, some sorting takes place when waste is collected, either through curbside collection or by town recycling stations (sites to which residents can bring wastes to be recycled). In either case, the waste is trucked to the MRF, where it is moved through the facility by escalators and conveyor belts, tended by workers who inspect and sort the items collected ( Figure 21\u201318) . The objective of the process is to prepare materials for the recyclable-goods market. Glass is sorted by color, cleaned, crushed into small pebbles, and then shipped Figure 21\u201318 Materials recovery facility. Single-stream recycling at a modern MRF in Baltimore. Its purpose is to sort a mixed stream of waste material (cans, bottles, newspapers, etc.) for eventual recycling. to glass companies, where it replaces the raw materials that go into glass manufacture\u2014sand and soda ash\u2014and saves substantially on energy costs. Cans are sorted, flattened, and sent either to detinning plants or to aluminum-processing facilities. Paper is sorted, baled, and sent to reprocessing mills or exporters. Plastics are sorted, depending on their color and type of polymer, and then sold.", "The facility\u2019s advantages are its economy of scale and its ability to produce a useful end product for the recyclable-materials market. Some MRFs have gone to high technology, replacing the manual sorting with magnetic pulleys, optical sensors, and air sorters. As the movement grows, it is likely that technology will continue to improve the efficiency of operations and cut costs. Less common than conventional MRFs are mixed-waste processing facilities, sometimes called \u201cdirty MRFs,\u201d which receive unsorted MSW just as if it were going to a landfill or a WTE facility. The waste is loaded on a conveyer and is sorted for recovery of recyclable materials before being landfilled or combusted. Because of extensive contamination of potentially recyclable waste, this method is less desirable. CONCEPT CHECK Does a law prohibiting single-use bags encourage source reduction or recycling? Which does a bottle bill encourage? \u2610\u2713 21.4 Public Policy and Waste Management The management of MSW used to be entirely under the control of local governments. In recent years, however, state and federal agencies have played an increasingly important role in waste management, partly through regulation and partly through encouragement and facilitation. Because a great deal of waste eventually makes its way to the ocean, and because the import of waste from wealthier countries into poor countries raises ethical concerns about dumping, there is increased interest in international coordination about waste. The U.S. Regulatory Perspective At the federal level, the following legislation has been passed: facilities were covered by air-pollution and hazardous-waste regulations, again under the EPA\u2019s jurisdiction. RCRA also required the states to develop comprehensive solid-waste management plans. Largely in response to these federal mandates, the states have been putting pressure on local governments to develop integrated waste management plans, with goals for recycling, source reduction, and landfill performance. Integrated Waste Management It is not necessary to fasten onto just one method of handling wastes, as the example of Sweden demonstrates. Source reduction, waste-to-energy combustion, recycling, materials recovery facilities, landfills, and composting all have roles to play in waste management. Different combinations of these options will work in different regions of the country. A system having several processes in operation is called integrated waste management. Waste Reduction. Today the United States leads the world in per capita waste production and per capita energy consumption\u2014we really are a \u201cthrowaway society.\u201d How can we turn this situation around? True management of MSW begins in the home (or dorm room). Materialistic lifestyles, affluence, and overconsumption can pack our homes and our trash cans with stuff we simply do not need. Thousands of public storage facilities with interesting names (Stor-U-Self, for example) are packed with stuff that people can\u2019t fit into their homes but can\u2019t part with. WasteWise. Several incentives have been put in place on the government level to encourage waste reduction. For example, the EPA sponsors the WasteWise program, targeting the reduction of MSW by establishing partnerships with local governments, schools, and organizations, as well as multinational corporations. WasteWise is a voluntary partnership that allows the partners to design their own solid-waste reduction programs. More than 2,700 organizations throughout the country have partnered with the EPA to reduce and recycle waste and, in a new focus of the program, to calculate their reductions of waste-related greenhouse gas emissions. Pay As You Throw (PAYT). The EPA\u2019s PAYT program brings attention to a national trend of unit pricing, or charging households and other customers for the waste they dispose of. Instead of using local taxes to pay for trash collection and disposal, which provides no incentive to reduce waste, communities levy curbside charges for all unsorted 21.4 Public Policy and Waste Management 541 Figure 21\u201319 Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) trash pickup. Curbside trash pickup in Hamilton, Massachusetts, features free pickup for single-stream recycling (blue crate) and compost (green bin); bags for other trash are purchased at local stores (blue trash bag) for $2.00. MSW\u2014perhaps $1\u2013$5 per container ( Figure 21\u201319) . PAYT capitalizes on the common sentiment that people should pay their share of disposal costs based on the amount of waste they discard. This practice is found extensively throughout Europe and Asia. A study of PAYT in New England communities 2 found that curbside PAYT communities generated 49% less waste than non-PAYT communities. City managers love it because it saves money and creates jobs. As with the WasteWise program, the EPA\u2019s role is that of a facilitator, not a regulator. Extended Producer Responsibility.", "Another means of bringing about waste reduction is to establish a program of extended producer responsibility (EPR), a concept that involves assigning some responsibility for reducing the environmental impact of a product at each stage of its \u201clife cycle,\u201d especially the end. EPR originated in Western Europe. Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden have well-developed regulations that require companies to take back many items, that encourage the reuse of products, and that promote the manufacture of more durable products. In the United States, EPR is better known as product stewardship, a term that implies shared responsibility by producers, consumers, and municipalities. For example, Hewlett-Packard and Xerox make it easy for customers to return spent copier cartridges, and the two companies then recycle the components of the cartridges. Call2Recycle is another good example of this concept, where rechargeable batteries and cell phones are voluntarily taken back by a nonprofit corporation, Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation. The program collects up to 7 million pounds of batteries a year. Again, the EPA is active in providing information to manufacturers and purchasing departments to help them design and buy more environmentally sound products. 2Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cPay-As-You-Throw Summer 2010 Bulletin,\u201d Get Smart with Pay-As-You-Throw, EPA 530-N-09-001, 2010. STEWARDSHIP International Regulation of Waste As the worldwide volume of waste continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly clear that the problems related to waste management extend beyond national borders. Solutions to these problems require international coordination. Some international agreements are regional. For example, while many European countries have regulations regarding their own wastes, the European Union coordinates issues related to the production and disposal of MSW among its member countries. A 1999 Landfill Directive established minimum standards for landfills within the member countries. The EU also has several regulations about the transport of hazardous wastes. Among the issues that have been addressed in international agreements are dumping at sea and the transport of hazardous materials. Because the import of waste from wealthier countries into poor countries raises ethical concerns about dumping, there is increased interest in international coordination of the export of trash to regions that lack environmental regulations. Ocean Pollution. A great deal of the world\u2019s solid waste makes its way to the oceans, much of it ending up in waters that are not under the jurisdiction of any particular nation. The first international agreement on direct dumping into the oceans\u2014the 1972 London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter\u2014 focused on substances harmful to humans or sea life. In 1987, the U.S. Congress passed the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA). About 20% of the MSW in the oceans comes from ocean shipping. The MARPOL Convention (originated in 1973) is the main international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships. Originally it was developed to deal with oil spills, but later other substances, such as sewage, garbage, and air pollution, were added. Waste Disposal in Less Affluent Countries. As we have seen, the United States and wealthy European countries are addressing many of the problems of solid waste with centralized, capital-intensive solutions such as sanitary landfills and WTE power plants. Yet most poor nations lack the resources to approach MSW disposal in the same way. In addition, solutions that work in developed nations often do not translate well into developing nations, so attempts to fund such solutions frequently fail. For example, between 1974 and 1988, the World Bank gave loans that were used for large trash-compactor trucks. However, such vehicles do not work in crowded, steeply hilly areas or with the dense, highly organic refuse produced in many poorer places. Likewise, incinerators built with western grants have sometimes been abandoned. As a result of these and similar outcomes, many experts believe that our goal should not be to build waste-disposal systems designed for high-income countries in low-income countries. Instead, we need to find solutions that are appropriate to the conditions of the poorer nations. 21.4 Public Policy and Waste Management 543 In developing countries, open dumping and burning are the norm, and the informal collection of refuse is common. Some people make their living by picking up trash or sweeping streets. Others make their homes in dumps, picking over the trash and carrying out a labor-intensive recycling process that often exposes them to unhealthy conditions. Such waste pickers usually have low status and are not well treated.", "However, this informal sector of waste pickers is estimated to employ at least 15 million people, 1% of the urban population of developing countries. 3 For these people, picking valuable components out of trash is an important source of income and a key survival strategy. By reusing materials that would otherwise be wasted, the work they do makes the use of resources more efficient. Because labor is cheap in developing nations and people need work, researchers argue that waste management in those nations should focus on practices that employ many people. Instead of centralized systems, community waste management makes more sense for these areas. By allowing waste pickers to coordinate themselves, they argue, the pickers will have more rights and better conditions. Pilot projects in Brazil and Egypt suggest that small inputs of money can dramatically improve the conditions of waste pickers. A project in Columbia showed that a 3M. Medina, \u201cWaste Picker Cooperatives in Developing Countries,\u201d Paper at WIEGO/Cornell/SEWA Conference on Membership-Based Organizations of the Poor, Ahmedabad, India, January 2005. sanitary landfill using manual labor to cover waste with earth rather than expensive heavy equipment kept costs down and provided jobs. 4 In Summary. Solving the problems related to MSW will require us to rethink our approach to the products we use. For those of us in high-income countries, producing less waste needs to be a part of the solution: Purchasing reusable rather than disposable items and recycling can help us make the transition to greater sustainability. Other solutions include using waste to generate energy and safely disposing of the remaining waste. Sweden has already been successful in these approaches, so we know that other developed countries can make this transition, too. In developing nations, we need to take appropriate community actions, to give rights to those in the waste disposal sector, and to find methods that maintain jobs for those who are already working. Regulations such as those of the EPA and international treaties are necessary to protect the most vulnerable from exploitation, and to keep trash out of the oceans, a commons we all need to protect. What are the advantages and disadvantages of pay-as-you-throw rules? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 4M.

Hazardous Chemicals: Pollution and Prevention The Baogang Steel and Rare Earth Complex in Baotou, the largest city in Inner Mongolia, is not a vacationland that you\u2019d ever see in a travel brochure. There is a good-sized lake, but not the kind you might go boating on\u2014there are no sandy beaches and no sparkling waterfalls. Formed by damming a river, the lake serves as a tailings pond for the outfall of mining wastes from multiple industries. The 10-square-kilometer lake has the dubious distinction of being considered one of the most polluted places on Earth. Rare Earth Production. Some of the refineries in Baotou produce rare earth minerals, a group of 17 metals that includes lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, and scandium. Rare earths are used in a wide array of modern products, especially electronics. Cerium, for example, is used in catalytic converters, while neodymium is used to dye the glass used in lasers and to make strong, lightweight magnets. Others are used in the making of computers, smartphones, and even components of wind turbines. To extract some rare earth minerals, large quantities of rock are crushed and then washed with chemicals such as sulfuric acid, producing enormous amounts of hazardous waste. This waste also contains radioactive elements. When this waste is dumped into tailings ponds, the pollutants may be washed downstream or picked up by wind and spread through the air. China\u2019s Choice. China produces more than 90% of the global rare earths, although these minerals are found worldwide. In part this is because China has Chapter 22", "Learning Objectives 22.1 Toxicology and Chemical Hazards: Define toxicology and explain how it applies to many of the chemicals in use in our society; identify the two most toxic chemical groups in use, and assess their involvement in food chains. 22.2 Hazardous Waste Disposal: Describe the three methods employed in land disposal of hazardous wastes; describe and give examples of what happened before land disposal came under regulation. 22.3 Cleaning Up the Mess: Explain how the Superfund program deals with abandoned toxic sites, brownfields, and leaking underground storage tanks. 22.4 Managing Current Toxic Chemicals and Wastes: Review the laws put in place to prevent illegal disposal of toxic wastes, reduce accidents and accidental exposure, and evaluate new chemicals.

Pipes spew toxic waste from smelting rare earth minerals into a tailings pond near Bautou, Inner Mongolia. been willing to bear the environmental cost of this industry in order to drive its economy forward. In places such as Baotou, the hazardous nature of producing these minerals is obvious. Visitors and residents of the city can see the stripped earth, smell the acrid tang of chemicals, and watch the black sludge pouring into the lake. Unfortunately, the hazards involved in producing rare earths are hidden from the millions of people who use cell phones and other electronic products. Yet understanding the life cycle of the goods we use and the hazardous wastes they produce is an essential part of calculating the cost of our actions. To protect ourselves and others, we need to 22.1 Toxicology and Chemical Hazards Toxicology is the study of the harmful effects of chemicals on human health and the natural environment. A toxicologist might, for example, investigate the potential for phenolphthalein (a common chemical laboratory reagent that has also been used in over-the-counter laxatives) to cause health problems. The toxicologist might study the acute toxicity effects that could occur upon ingestion of the chemical or upon its contact with the skin, as well as the effects of chronic exposure over a period of years, and, finally, the carcinogenic (cancer-causing) potential of phenolphthalein. Indeed, such studies have shown that phenolphthalein causes tumors in mice. Because of this finding, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) canceled all laxative uses of phenolphthalein, which is now listed as \u201creasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.\u201d Data on toxic chemicals are made available to health practitioners and the public via a number of sources, including the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Chemical Repository and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the latter of which provides an annual updated Report on Carcinogens, with a complete list of carcinogenic agents. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also makes available data on toxic chemicals in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). Green Media Toolshed uses these and other data sources in its Scorecard, an exhaustive profile of 11,200 chemicals, including information on their manufacture and uses (see http://scorecard.goodguide.com/). Dose Response and Threshold In our discussion of risk assessment, we introduced the con cepts of dose response and exposure (Chapter 17) . When investigating a suspect chemical, a toxicologist would conduct tests on animals, investigate human involvement with the chemical, and present information linking the dose (the level of exposure multiplied by the length of time over which exposure occurs) with the response (some acute or chronic effect or the development of tumors). For example, studies of phenolphthalein toxicity indicate that the LDL0 (lowest dose at which death occurred in animal testing) was 500 milligrams/kilogram. This is know what substances are dangerous to us and where they are located. We also need to know how to avoid producing them, how to contain them, and how to clean them up. This chapter focuses on hazardous chemicals. The material in this chapter overlaps with topics in several other chapters\u2014soil pollution (Chapter 11 ), pesticides (Chapters 12 and 13), environmental health ( Chapter 17 ), air pollution ( Chapter 19) , and water pollution ( Chapter 20) . Here we will discuss more specifically the nature of hazardous chemicals and how they are investigated. We will also consider the key U.S. laws and regulations designed to protect human and environmental health. a low toxicity, so concern about the chemical would center on chronic or carcinogenic issues.", "Human exposure to a hazard is a vital part of its risk characterization, and such exposure can come through the workplace, food, water, or the surrounding environment. For example, the NTP Chemical Repository gives the various uses of phenolphthalein, followed by the precautions to take in handling it and the symptoms of exposure (there are many!). Getting an accurate determination of human exposure is often the most difficult area of risk assessment. Threshold Level. In the dose-response relationship, there is usually a threshold. Organisms are able to deal with certain levels of many substances without suffering ill effects. The level below which no ill effects are observed is called the threshold level. Above this level, the effect of a substance depends on both its concentration and the duration of exposure to it. Higher levels may be tolerated if the exposure time is short. Thus, the threshold level is high for short exposures but gets lower as the exposure time increases ( Figure 22\u20131) . In other words, it is not the absolute amount, but rather the dose, that is important. Figure 22\u20131 The threshold level. The threshold level for harmful effects of toxic pollutants becomes lower as the exposure time increases. It is also different for different chemicals. 22.1 Toxicology and Chemical Hazards 547 Where carcinogens are concerned, the EPA generally takes a zero-dose, zero-response approach. That is, there is no evidence of a discrete threshold level for any carcinogenic chemical. However, the lower the dose, the more likely it is that the response cannot be distinguished from the background level of cancers in a population. In such cases, the risk becomes very low and drops below the level for which regulatory action is needed. These are just some basics of toxicology. The field is well established and is the most important source of sound scientific information supporting the regulatory efforts of the FDA and the EPA. The NTP was established in 1978 to provide this kind of information and has become the world\u2019s leader in assessing chemical toxicity and carcinogenicity. We turn our attention now to the chemicals themselves. The Nature of Chemical Hazards: HAZMATs A chemical that presents a certain hazard or risk is known as a hazardous material (HAZMAT). The EPA categorizes substances on the basis of the following hazardous properties: Containers in which HAZMATs are stored and vehicles that carry HAZMATs are required to display placards identifying the hazards (flammability, corrosiveness, the potential for poisonous fumes, and so on) presented by the material inside ( Figure 22\u20132) . Radioactive materials are probably the most hazardous of all and are treated as an entirely separate category. The risks associated with radioactive materials are described in another chapter (Chapter 15) . Sources of Chemicals Entering the Environment To understand how HAZMATs enter our environment, we need to look at how people in our society live and work. First, the materials making up almost everything we use, from the shampoo and toothpaste we use in the morning to the television we watch in the evening, are products of chemical technology. Our use constitutes only one step in the total product life cycle, a term that encompasses all steps, from obtaining raw materials to finally disposing of the product. Implicit in our use of hair spray, for example, is that raw materials were obtained and various chemicals were produced to make both the spray and its container. Chemical wastes and by-products are inevitable in production processes. In addition, consider the risks of accidents or spills occurring in the manufacturing process and in the transportation of raw materials, the finished product, or wastes. Finally, what are the risks of breathing hair spray? What happens to the container that still holds some of the hair spray when you throw it into the trash because the propellant is used up? Figure 22\u20132 HAZMAT placards. These are examples of some of the placards that are mandatory on trucks and railcars carrying hazard-ous materials. Numbers in place of the word on the placard or on an additional orange panel identify the specific material. Placards alert workers, police, and firefighters to the kinds of hazards they face in case an accident occurs. Multiply these steps by all the hundreds of thousands of products used by millions of people in homes, factories, and businesses, and you can appreciate the magnitude of the situation. More than 84,000 chemicals are registered for commercial use within the United States.", "At every stage\u2014from the mining of raw materials through manufacturing, use, and final disposal\u2014various chemical products and by-products enter the environment, with consequences for both human health and the environment. The use of many products\u2014pesticides, fertilizers, and road salts, for example\u2014directly introduces them into the environment. Alternatively, the intended use may leave a fraction of the material in the environment\u2014the evaporation of solvents from paints and adhesives, for instance. Then there are the product life cycles of materials that are used tangentially to the desired item. Consider lubricants, solvents, cleaning fluids, and cooling fluids, with whatever contaminants they may contain. Likewise, there are the product life cycles of gasoline, coal, and other fuels that are consumed for energy. Figure 22\u20133, on the following page, illustrates the life cycle of a typical consumer product. Toxics Release Inventory. The introduction of chemicals into the environment may occur in every sector, from major industrial plants to small shops and individual homes. The EPA tracks the industry sectors that release the Figure 22\u20133 Total product life cycle. The life cycle of a product begins when the raw materials are obtained and ends when the used-up product is discarded. At each step\u2014or in transport between steps\u2014wastes, by-products, or the product itself may enter the environment, causing pollution and creating various risks to human and environmental health. greatest quantities of toxic materials. Information about these releases is reported in the EPA\u2019s annual report, the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). 1 The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) requires industries to report releases of toxic chemicals to the environment, and the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 mandates collection of data on toxic chemicals that are released to the environment, treated on-site, recycled, or burned for energy. The TRI does not cover small businesses, such as dry-cleaning establishments and gas stations, or household hazardous waste. Nor does it cover toxic releases from oil and gas extraction, a limit environmental groups have protested. The TRI provides an annual record of releases of almost 650 designated chemicals by some 21,600 industrial facilities (Figure 22\u20134) . For 2013, the TRI reveals the following information about toxic chemicals: 1U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2013 Toxics Release Inventory: National Analysis Overview (2013), accessed April 13, 2015, http://www.epa.gov/tri. Add to the last figure the estimated 3 billion pounds of household hazardous waste released each year and an unknown quantity coming from small businesses (facilities do not have to report releases under 500 pounds), and you have some idea of the dimensions of the problem. The good news is that over the more than 30 years since the TRI has been in effect, the quantities of virtually all categories of toxic waste have been going down, and total releases have declined by more than 60%. The Threat from Toxic Chemicals All toxic chemicals are, by definition, hazards that pose a risk to humans. Fortunately, a large portion of the chemicals introduced into the environment are gradually broken down and assimilated by natural processes. After that, they pose no long-term human or environmental risk, even though they may be highly toxic in high-level, short-term exposures. Two major classes of chemicals do not readily degrade in the environment: heavy metals and their compounds and synthetic organics. If sufficiently diluted in air or water, most of these compounds do not pose a hazard, though there are some notable exceptions. 22.1 Toxicology and Chemical Hazards 549 Millions of pounds Heavy Metals. The most dangerous heavy metals are lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, tin, chromium, zinc, and copper. These metals are used widely in industry, particularly in metalworking or metal-plating shops and in such products as batteries and electronics. They are also used in certain pesticides and medicines. Because compounds of heavy metals can have brilliant colors, they once were heavily used in paint pigments, glazes, inks, and dyes. Millions of children have been treated for lead poisoning because of their exposure to lead-based paint. The paint was banned in the United States in 1978, but many older painted surfaces still hold lead and are a hazard. Heavy metals are extremely toxic because, as ions or in certain compounds, they are soluble in water and may be readily absorbed into the body, where they tend to combine with and inhibit the functioning of some vital enzymes. Even very small amounts can have severe physiological or neurological consequences.", "Mercury, in particular, has contaminated rivers, lakes, and streams in the United States because of its release into the air by coal- and oil-fired power plants (mercury is present in fossil fuels in trace quantities). In 2011, using its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA issued a new rule requiring a 90% reduction in the mercury released from power plants, bringing long-sought relief to the wildlife and people affected by this toxic pollutant. Organic Compounds. Petroleum-derived and synthetic organic compounds are the chemical basis for all plastics, How did the U.S. per capita release of toxins change during that time? Why? Food/Beverages/Tobacco All other sources synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, modern paint-like coatings, solvents, pesticides, wood preservatives, and hundreds of other products. Because of their chemical structure, many synthetic organics are resistant to biodegradation. This resistance is an important part of what makes many such compounds useful: We wouldn\u2019t want fungi and bacteria attacking and rotting the tires on our cars, and paints and wood preservatives function only insofar as they are both nonbiodegradable and toxic to decomposer organisms. These compounds are toxic because they are often readily absorbed into the body, where they interact with particular enzymes, but their nonbiodegradability prevents them from being broken down or processed further. When a person ingests a sufficiently high dose, the effect may be acute poisoning and death. With low doses over extended periods, however, the effects are insidious and can be mutagenic (mutation causing), carcinogenic, or teratogenic (birth defect causing). Synthetic organic compounds also may cause serious liver and kidney dysfunction, sterility, and numerous other physiological and neurological problems. Dirty Dozen. A particularly troublesome class of synthetic organics is the halogenated hydrocarbons, organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by atoms of chlorine, bromine, fluorine, or iodine (Figure 22\u20135) . These four elements are classed as halogens\u2014hence, the name. Of the halogenated hydrocarbons, the chlorinated hydrocarbons (also called organic chlorides) are by far the most common. Organic chlorides are widely used in plastics (polyvinyl chloride), pesticides (DDT, Kepone, and mirex), solvents (carbon tetrachlorophenol and tetrachloroethylene), electrical insulation (polychlorinated biphenyls), and many other products. Twelve persistent organic pollutants (called POPs, Table 22\u20131) have been banned or highly restricted globally as a result of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which entered into force in May 2004. Another nine compounds were added to the list in 2009. Most of these are halogenated hydrocarbons. All are toxic to varying extents, and most are known animal carcinogens. PERC. As an example, let\u2019s consider the halogenated hydrocarbon tetrachloroethylene ( Figure 22\u20135). This substance, also called perchloroethylene, or PERC, is colorless and nonflammable and is the major substance in dry-cleaning fluid. It is an effective solvent and is used in all kinds of industrial cleaning operations. It can also be found in shoe polish and other household products. PERC evaporates readily when exposed to air, but in the soil, it can enter groundwater easily because it does not bind to soil particles. Human exposure can occur in the workplace, especially in connection with dry-cleaning operations. It can also occur if people use products containing PERC, such as dry-cleaned garments. PERC enters the body most readily when breathed in with contaminated air. Breathing PERC for short periods can bring on dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and unconsciousness. Over longer periods, PERC can cause liver and kidney damage. Laboratory studies also show PERC to be carcinogenic to rats and mice, and it is listed in NTP\u2019s 2014 Report on Carcinogens 2 as \u201creasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.\u201d Studies have shown a higher risk of cancer, as well as neurological impairment, in dry-cleaning employees. Approximately 28,000 U.S. dry-cleaning establishments use PERC. The EPA has issued rules that would phase out PERC use in dry-cleaning shops in residential buildings by 2020; critics wonder why it should take so long and why in just a select few shops. The rules for PERC are currently under review. Effects on Hormones Hormones are substances that function as messengers in the endocrine system, the group of organs that regulate the growth and functions of vertebrates; insulin, testosterone, and estrogen are hormones. Changes in the concentration of a hormone can have a significant effect on an animal\u2019s endocrine system. Disturbances to the endocrine system are not trivial matters\u2014just think of diabetics who lack the hormone insulin and would die if it were not supplied to them.", "A chemical that affects the function of the endocrine system is called an endocrine disruptor. 2U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Toxicology Program, Report on Carcinogens, 12th ed. (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011). During the early 1990s, scientists became concerned that synthetic chemicals in food and the environment were acting as endocrine disruptors. 3 At that time, there had been a number of disturbing reports about the abnormal development of wildlife, such as immune disorders in mammals, alligators with reproductive defects, and fish with both ovaries and testes (Chapter 6) . Could it be that the release of low levels of synthetic chemicals into the environment was causing these abnormalities? Indeed, the effects of exposure to DDT by fish-eating birds were known to be the outcome of disruption of the birds\u2019 reproductive systems, controlled by hormones (Chapter 13) . After pouring through thousands of research articles, scientist Theo Colburn and others were able to show a common thread: Chemicals were disrupting hormone systems. This finding triggered national concern and policy responses. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 directed the EPA to develop procedures for testing chemicals for endocrine disruption activity. Accordingly, the EPA established the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. Worldwide, the issue of endocrine disruption remains a serious concern. A 2013 report published by the WHO and UNEP described the current status of the scientific research, noting three disturbing trends: (1) a high and increasing incidence of many endocrine-related disorders in humans; (2) observations of endocrine-related effects in wildlife populations; and (3) laboratory studies linking chemicals with endocrine-disrupting properties to diseases. 4 Scientific research on endocrine disruptors is ongoing. Unfortunately, we still know little about how dangerous they are (see Sound Science, Disrupting Hormones with Pollution). 3T. Colburn, D. Dumanoski, and J. Peterson Myers, Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, and Survival?\u2014A Scientific Detective Story (New York: Plume, 1996). 4\u00c5ke Bergman et al., eds., State of the Science of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals 2012 (Geneva: United Nations Environment Programme and the World Health Organization, 2013). Figure 22\u20136 An Inuit hazard. This woman is cutting the meat of a seal in Sermilik Fjord, Greenland. Seals and other animals used for food by the Inuit harbor high levels of persistent organic pollutants. 22.1 Toxicology and Chemical Hazards 551 Involvement with Food Chains Heavy metals and nonbiodegradable synthetic organics are particularly hazardous because they tend to accumulate in organisms. We have discussed bioaccumulation and biomag nification in connection with DDT (Chapter 13). Minamata. A tragic episode in the 1950s and 60s, known as Minamata disease, revealed the potential for biomagnification of mercury and other heavy metals. The disease is named for a small fishing village in Japan where the episode occurred. In the mid-1950s, cats in Minamata began to show spastic movements, followed by partial paralysis, coma, and death. At first, little attention was paid to it. But when the same symptoms began to occur in people, concern escalated quickly. Additional symptoms, such as mental impairment, insanity, and birth defects, were also observed. Scientists and health experts eventually diagnosed the cause as acute mercury poisoning. A chemical company near the village was discharging wastes containing mercury into a river that flowed into the bay where the Minamata villagers fished. The mercury was first absorbed by bacteria and then biomagnified as it passed up the food chain through fish to cats or to humans. By the time the situation was brought under control, some 50 persons had died, and 150 had suffered serious bone and nerve damage. Even now, the tragedy lives on in the crippled bodies and disabled minds of some Minamata victims. Arctic POPs. Much to research scientists\u2019 surprise, fish, birds, and mammals all over the Arctic are showing elevated body burdens of a number of persistent organic pollutants\u2014 in particular, DDT, toxaphene, chlordane, PCBs, and dioxins. Moreover, because the Inuit people of the far north depend on these animals for food, they, too, are carrying high loads of POPs\u2014some of the highest in the world (Figure 22\u20136) . The real mystery is how these chemicals\u2014all of which are toxic\u2014get to such remote and pristine environments. No one is spraying pesticides there, and there are no industries to produce PCBs and dioxins. The key to the presence of such chemicals can be found in several factors that characterize POPs: persistence, bioaccumulation, and the potential for long-range transport.", "Added to these factors is the unique climate of the Arctic, where the extreme cold promotes a process called cold condensation. POPs are volatile chemicals carried in global air patterns to the Arctic, where they condense on the snowpack and are then washed into the water with the spring thaw. Once in the lakes and coastal waters, the chemicals are picked up by plankton and passed up the food chain through bioaccumulation and biomagnification. A Canadian government study found that three-fourths of Inuit women have PCB levels up to five times above those deemed safe. The potential health effects of the chemical load carried by the Arctic residents range from immune-system disorders to disruption of their hormone systems and, over time, to cancer. The latest impact has been a serious imbalance in births, where twice as many girls as boys are born in many Arctic villages. Scientists from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program, an international body that advises the governments of the eight Arctic nations, measured levels of man-made chemicals in women\u2019s blood that were high enough to trigger changes in the sex of unborn children during their first few weeks of gestation. This transboundary pollution by chemicals is exactly why the UN Convention has banned them; hopefully, this action will eventually clear the Arctic air of the POPs. CONCEPT CHECK How did mercury become concentrated in the bodies of people in Minamata, Japan? How do POPs become concentrated in the bodies of Arctic animals? \u2610\u2713 22.2 Hazardous Waste Disposal The Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, passed in the early 1970s, put an end to the widespread disposal of hazardous wastes in the atmosphere and waterways. However, their passage left an enormous loophole. If you can\u2019t vent wastes into the atmosphere or flush them into waterways, what do you do with them? Industry turned to land disposal, which was essentially unregulated at the time. Indiscriminate air and water disposal became indiscriminate land disposal. Thus, in retrospect, we see that the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, for all their benefits in improving air and water quality, also succeeded in transferring pollutants from one part of the environment to another. Methods of Land Disposal In the early 1970s, there were three primary land disposal methods: surface impoundments, landfills, and deep-well injection. With the conscientious implementation of safeguards, each of these methods has some merit, and each is still heavily used for hazardous-waste disposal. Without adequate regulations or enforcement, however, contamination of groundwater is virtually guaranteed. Figure 22\u20137 Surface impoundment. Surface impoundments are often used for preliminary treatment of liquid wastes. Shown here is an impoundment at a paper manufacturer in Alabama. Surface Impoundments. Surface impoundments are simple excavated depressions (ponds) into which liquid wastes are drained and held ( Figure 22\u20137) . They are the least expensive\u2014and, hence, the most widely used\u2014way to dispose of large amounts of water carrying relatively small amounts of chemical wastes. The impoundments may be used to carry out wastewater treatment prior to discharging the wastes. As waste is discharged into the pond, solid wastes settle and accumulate, while water evaporates. If the bottom of the pond is well sealed and if the loss of water through evaporation equals the gain from input, impoundments may receive wastes indefinitely. However, inadequate seals may allow wastes to leach into groundwater, exceptional storms may cause overflows, and volatile materials can evaporate into the atmosphere, adding to air pollution problems. To prevent these problems, hazardous waste surface impoundments are required to be constructed with a double liner system, a leachate collection and removal system, and a leak detection system. The 2014 TRI reports 739 million pounds of toxics released to on-site surface impoundments. (On-site refers to disposal by manufacturers or institutions on their own facilities; off-site means that the wastes have been transferred to a waste-treatment or disposal facility.) Landfills. RCRA sets rigid standards for the disposal of hazardous wastes in landfills. When hazardous wastes are in a concentrated liquid or solid form, they are commonly put into drums, collected by a waste management company (for a hefty fee!), and then treated in accordance with their chemical and physical characteristics. Treatment standards for wastes are established by the EPA and characterized as best-demonstrated available technologies (BDATs). These standards apply to all solid and liquid hazardous wastes and have the effect of reducing their toxicity and mobility.", "The BDAT technologies include stabilization and neutralization of sludges, soils, liquids, powders, and slurries; chemical oxidation of organic materials; and various specific techniques applied to metal-bearing wastes that convert them to an insoluble solid material for landfill 22.2 Hazardous Waste Disposal 553 disposal. Some 384 million pounds of hazardous wastes were delivered to on-site landfills in 2013, and an additional 264 million pounds went to off-site landfills. Only 21 landfills in North America are licensed to receive off-site hazardous wastes, and these are owned by just a few waste management companies. If a landfill is properly lined, supplied with a system to remove leachate, provided with monitoring wells, and appropriately capped, it may be reasonably safe and is referred to as a secure landfill (Figure 22\u20138) . The various barriers are subject to damage and deterioration, however, requiring adequate surveillance and monitoring systems to prevent leakage. Deep-Well Injection. Deep-well injection involves drilling a borehole thousands of feet below groundwater into a porous geological formation. A well consists of concentric pipes and casings that isolate wastes as they are injected and pipes that are sealed at the bottom to prevent wastes from backing up. Over time, the wastes often undergo reactions with naturally occurring material that make them less hazardous. This method is used for various volatile organic compounds, pesticides, fuels, and explosives. Currently, 143 hazardous-waste deep wells are in operation, mostly in the Gulf Coast region. The EPA\u2019s Underground Injection Control Program regulations require that the wells be limited to geologically stable areas so that the hazardous-waste liquids pumped into the well remain isolated indefinitely. The total amount of deep-well injection (225 million pounds in 2013) has declined over the years, but the technique remains useful because it has a greater potential than other methods for keeping toxic wastes from contaminating the hydrologic cycle and the food web. Figure 22\u20138 Secure landfill. These drums of low-level nuclear waste are being buried in a secure landfill at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Washington. Mismanagement of Hazardous Wastes Because early land disposal was not regulated, in numerous instances not even the most rudimentary precautions were taken. In many cases, deep wells injected wastes directly into groundwater, abandoned quarries were used as landfills with no additional precautions being taken, and surface impoundments had no seals or liners whatsoever. Even worse, considerable amounts of waste failed to get to any disposal facility at all. Midnight Dumping and Orphan Sites. The need for alternative methods to dispose of waste chemicals created an opportunity for a new enterprise: waste disposal. Many reputable businesses entered the field, but\u2014again in the absence of regulations\u2014there were also disreputable operators. As stacks of drums filled with hazardous wastes \u201cmysteriously\u201d appeared in abandoned warehouses, vacant lots, or municipal landfills, it became clear that some operators simply were pocketing the disposal fee and then unloading the wastes in any available location, frequently under cover of darkness\u2014an activity termed midnight dumping (Figure 22\u20139) . Authorities trying to locate the individuals responsible would learn that they had gone out of business or were nowhere to be found. Some companies or individuals simply stored wastes on their own properties and then went out of business, abandoning the property and the wastes. These locations became known as orphan sites\u2014hazardous-waste sites without a responsible party to clean them up. As drums containing Figure 22\u20139 Midnight dumping. Hazardous wastes were often left on remote or unoccupied properties by unscrupulous haulers. 22.2 Hazardous Waste Disposal 555 Figure 22\u201310 \u201cValley of the Drums,\u201d an orphan waste site. Thousands of drums of waste chemicals were unloaded near Louisville, Kentucky, and left to rot, threatening the surrounding environment. Figure 22\u201311 Love Canal. A bulldozer uncovers one of the tanks holding toxic waste buried beneath the residential area of Love Canal. hazardous chemicals corroded and leaked, there was great danger of reactive chemicals combining and causing explosions and fires. One of the most infamous abandoned sites is the \u201cValley of the Drums\u201d in Kentucky (Figure 22\u201310). Love Canal, New York. The mounting problem of unregulated land disposal of hazardous wastes was brought vividly to public attention by the events at Love Canal, near Niagara Falls, New York. The area was occupied by a school and a number of houses, all of which were perched on top of a chemical waste dump that had been covered over. The surface of the dump began to collapse, exposing tanks and barrels of chemical wastes ( Figure 22\u201311) . Fumes and chemicals began seeping into cellars.", "Ominously, people began reporting serious health problems, including birth defects and miscarriages. An aroused neighborhood, led by activist Lois Gibbs, began demanding that the state do something about the problem. Following confirmation of the area\u2019s contamination by toxic chemicals, President Jimmy Carter signed an emergency declaration in 1978 to relocate hundreds of residents. The state and federal governments closed the school and demolished a number of the homes nearest the site. In all, more than 800 families moved out of the area because of the fear of damage to their health from the toxic chemicals. Who Owns the Mess? The absence of public policy for dealing with the disposal of hazardous chemicals contributed to the situation at Love Canal. Hooker Chemical and Plastics Company had purchased an abandoned canal near Niagara Falls in 1942 and filled it with an estimated 21,000 tons of hazardous wastes. Hooker covered the canal over with a clay cap and sold it to the school board for a small sum, reportedly after warning the board that there were chemicals buried on the property. Subsequent construction penetrated the clay cap, and rain seeped in and leached chemicals in all directions. Hooker Chemical\u2019s parent company, Occidental Petroleum, eventually spent more than $233 million on the cleanup and subsequent lawsuits. As both government and independent researchers began surveying the extent of the problem, bad disposal practices were found to be rampant. The World Resources Institute estimated that, in the United States in the early 1980s, there were 75,000 active industrial landfill sites, 180,000 surface impoundments, and 200 other special facilities that were or could be sources of groundwater contamination. In most cases, the contaminated area was relatively small\u2014200 acres (80 hectares) or less\u2014but in total, the problem was immense and affected every state in the country. As studies and tests proceeded, thousands of individual wells and some major municipal wells were closed because they were contaminated with toxic chemicals. Many cases of private-well contamination caused by careless disposal were discovered only after people experienced \u201cunexplainable\u201d illnesses over prolonged periods. While these incidents did not receive the media attention of Love Canal, they were nevertheless devastating to the people involved. Even more important than the damage already done was the recognition that the problem was ongoing. The problems concerning toxic chemical wastes can be divided into three areas: These problems are addressed in the following sections. CONCEPT CHECK What are the advantages and disadvantages of disposing of hazardous wastes in deep wells? How does that method of disposal compare with landfills? \u2610\u2713 22.3 Cleaning Up the Mess A major public health threat from toxic wastes disposed of on land is the contamination of groundwater used for drinking. In dealing with groundwater contamination, the first priority is to ensure that people have safe water. The second is to clean up or isolate the source of pollution so that further contamination does not occur. Ensuring Safe Drinking Water To protect the public from the risk of toxic chemicals contaminating drinking water supplies, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974. Under this act, the EPA sets national standards to protect the public health, including allowable levels of specific contaminants. States and public water agencies are required to monitor drinking water to be sure that it meets the standards (see Chapter 20 ). If any contaminants are found to exceed maximum contaminant levels (MCLs), the water supply must be closed until adequate purification procedures or other alternatives are adopted. The act was amended in 1986, and the EPA now has jurisdiction over groundwater and sets MCLs for 94 contaminants. The contaminants represent a host of chemicals that are known pollutants and are regarded as dangerous to human health (see the EPA Web site for a description of the MCLs and why they are being regulated). Groundwater Remediation. If dumps, leaking storage tanks, or spills of toxic materials have contaminated groundwater and if such groundwater is threatening water supplies, all is not yet lost. Groundwater remediation is a developing and growing technology. Techniques involve drilling wells, pumping out the contaminated groundwater, purifying it, and injecting the purified water back into the ground or discharging it into surface waters. Cleaning up the source of the contamination is mandatory. If, however, the contamination is extensive, remediation may not be possible, and the groundwater must be considered unfit for use as drinking water.", "Superfund for Toxic Sites Probably the most monumental task involved in the management of hazardous wastes is the cleanup of the tens of thousands of toxic sites resulting from the years of mismanaged disposal of toxic materials. Prompted by the public outrage over the Love Canal fiasco, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), popularly known as Superfund. Through a tax on chemical raw materials, this legislation provided a trust fund for the identification of abandoned chemical waste sites, protection of groundwater near the sites, remediation of groundwater if it has been contaminated, and cleanup of the sites. The Superfund program was greatly expanded by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). Superfund, one of the EPA\u2019s largest ongoing programs, works as described in the next several subsections. Setting Priorities. Resources are insufficient to clean up all sites at once. Therefore, a system for setting priorities has been developed: Cleanup Technology. If chemical wastes are contained in drums, the drummed wastes can be picked up, treated, and managed in proper fashion. For the \u201cValley of the Drums\u201d site, the EPA cleanup started with the removal of some 4,200 drums for off-site treatment and disposal. The bigger problem for many sites is the soil (often millions of tons) contaminated by leakage. One procedure is to excavate contaminated soil and run it through an incinerator or kiln assembled on the site to burn off chemicals; synthetic organic chemicals can be broken down by incineration, and heavy metals are converted to insoluble, stable oxides. Another method is to drill a ring of injection wells around the site and a suction well in the center. Water containing a harmless detergent is injected into the injection wells and drawn into the suction well, cleansing the soil along the way. The withdrawn water is treated to remove the pollutants and is then reused for injection. The \u201cValley of the Drums\u201d site was situated in a poorly drained shale and limestone deposit. No local use was made of the groundwater. The EPA determined that the most feasible (BDAT) treatment was simply to contain the contaminated soil and groundwater, so the agency installed a clay cap, a perimeter drainage system, monitoring wells, and a security fence. The remedial work was completed in 1989, at a total cost of $2.5 million, and the site was deleted from the NPL in 1996. The third five-year review indicated that the cap was functioning well, the site was still undeveloped, and no human uses were being made of the groundwater. Bioremediation. Another rapidly developing cleanup technology is bioremediation. In many cases, the soil is contaminated with toxic organic compounds that are biodegradable. The problem is that they do not degrade because the soil lacks the necessary organisms, oxygen, or both to aid in biodegradation. In bioremediation, oxygen and organisms are injected into contaminated zones. The organisms feed on and eliminate the pollutants (as in secondary sewage treatment) and then die when the pollutants are gone. Considerable research is being done to find and develop microbes that will break down certain kinds of wastes more readily. Bioremediation, which may be used in place of detergents to decontaminate soil, is a rapidly expanding and developing technology that is applicable to leaking storage tanks and spills as well as to waste-disposal sites. Plant Food? When the soil contaminants are heavy metals and nonbiodegradable organic compounds, phytoremediation has been employed with some success. Phytoremediation uses plants to accomplish a number of desirable cleanup steps: stabilizing the soil, preventing further movement of contaminants by erosion, and extracting the contaminants by direct uptake from the soil. After full growth, the plants are removed and treated as toxic-waste products. However, this is a slow process and can be used only at sites where the contaminants and their concentrations are not toxic to plants. Nevertheless, scientists have found sunflowers that will capture uranium, poplar trees that soak up dry-cleaning solvents and mercury, and ferns that thrive on arsenic. Phytoremediation is now used at a level above $100 million a year. 22.3 Cleaning Up the Mess 557 Evaluating Superfund. Of the literally hundreds of thousands of various waste sites, more than 47,000 have been deemed serious enough to be given Superfund status. Over time, the EPA judged that about 33,000 of these sites did not pose a significant public-health or environmental threat. Such sites were accordingly assigned to the category \u201cno further removal action planned.\u201d", "Still, more than 11,300 sites remain on the master list\u2014a figure that, it is assumed, now includes most (if not all) of the sites in the United States that pose a significant risk. Interestingly, some of the worst that have come to light are on military bases, the result of what many characterize as the totally heedless and unconscionable discarding of toxic materials from military operations (13% of the NPL sites are \u201cfederal facilities\u201d). Progress. As of 2014, 1,323 sites were still on the NPL ( Figure 22\u201312). Additions are made to the list as sites from the master list are assessed, and subtractions are made when remediation on a site is complete. Since 1980, when CERCLA went into effect, about 1,166 sites have received all the necessary cleanup-related construction, and 387 of these have been deleted from the list (Love Canal was removed in 2004). Cleanup of these sites takes an average of 12 years, at an average cost of $20 million. Total cleanup often takes that long because groundwater remediation is a slow process. Research has shown that cleanup lowers the rate of birth defects in populations living near the site; cleanup also increases home values. Who Pays? CERCLA is based on the principle that \u201cthe polluter pays.\u201d More than 70% of the costs to date have been paid by the polluters (the PRPs). Funds collected for a specific site go into special accounts until the site cleanup is finished. However, the history of a waste-disposal site may go back 50 years or more, and users may have included everything from schools, hospitals, and small businesses to large corporations, all of which mount legal defenses to Figure 22\u201312 Map of Superfund sites in the contiguous United States. Brown dots show sites currently on the National Priorities List, blue dots are sites that have been proposed for the list, and green dots are sites that have been cleaned up and deleted.

Final National Priority List Proposed Deleted/cleaned up disclaim responsibility. When liability is difficult to track down or the responsible parties are unable to pay, the Superfund trust fund kicks in. Over the years, the EPA has gained a great deal of experience in dealing with Superfund sites. The technology has become quite sophisticated, and many hazardous-waste remediation companies have become established. A great deal of progress has been made; however, the American public still rates contamination by toxic waste at the top of the list of major environmental issues. 5 Critics. The Superfund program gets its share of criticism. Industries claim that they are unfairly blamed for pollution that reaches back to activities that were legal before the enactment of CERCLA. Many feel that overly stringent standards of cleanup are costing large sums of money without providing any additional benefit to public health. (This problem of finding a suitable balance between costs and benefits is discussed in more depth in Chapter 2. ) Congress refused to renew the tax on industry at the end of 1995; the trust fund had a balance of $4 billion at the time. Since that time, the trust fund has been supported by monies in the special accounts and yearly appropriations by Congress. Congress also appropriated $600 million for EPA\u2019s Superfund program as a component of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, aimed at creating jobs and speeding up the cleanup of NPL sites, but funding cleanup continues to be a problem. Brownfields. One highly successful recent Superfund development is the brownfields program. Brownfields are abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by contamination by hazardous wastes. It has been estimated that environmental hazards not serious enough to be put on the Superfund NPL impair the value of $2 trillion worth of real estate in the United States. The Brownfield Act, which passed in 2002, provides grants for site assessment and remediation work and authorized $250 million/year for the program. Previously authorized under CERCLA, the brownfields program now stands on its own. The legislation limits liability for owners and prospective purchasers of contaminated land, thus clearing the way for more cleanup of the estimated 450,000 sites that would qualify as brownfields. Since its inception, the program has leveraged more than $21 billion in funding for cleanup and redevelopment and more than 100,000 jobs.", "Many brownfield sites lie in economically disadvantaged communities, and their rehabilitation contributes jobs and exchanges a functional facility for an unsightly blight on the neighborhood. For example, the city of Chicago recently acquired and cleaned up a former bus barn in west Chicago that was becoming an illegal indoor garbage dump. The Illinois EPA cleared the site for reuse, and it was acquired by Scott 5Lydia Saad, Water Issues Worry Americans Most, Global Warming Least, March 28, 2011, http://www.gallup.com/poll/146810/Water-Issues-Worry-Americans-Global Warming-Least.aspx. Peterson Meats, which erected a $5.2 million smokehouse that employs 100 workers. Frequently, the rehabilitation of brown-field sites provides industries and municipalities with prime land for centrally located facilities that would otherwise have been carved out of suburban or greenfield lands (land occupied by natural ecosystems). A further advantage is that the new developments go back on the tax rolls, turning a liability into a community asset that lightens the load of residential taxpayers. Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (LUSTs). One consequence of our automobile-based society is the millions of underground fuel-storage tanks at service stations and other facilities. Putting such tanks underground greatly diminishes the risk of explosions and fires, but it also hides leaks. Underground storage tanks were traditionally made of bare steel, so they had a life expectancy of about 20 years before they began leaking and contaminating groundwater. By 2011, more than 501,000 failures had been reported, with 6,000 new \u201creleases\u201d in 2011. Indeed, LUSTs are the most common source of groundwater contamination. Without monitoring, small leaks can go undetected until nearby residents begin to smell fuel-tainted water flowing from their faucets. Regulations regarding underground storage tanks, part of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), require strict monitoring of fuel supplies, tanks, and piping so that leaks are detected early. When leaks are detected, remediation must begin within 72 hours (Figure 22\u201313) . Rules now also require all such tanks to be upgraded with interior lining and cathodic protection (to retard electrolytic corrosion of the steel), and new tanks must be provided with the same protection if they are steel. Many service stations are turning to fiberglass tanks, which do not corrode. A LUST trust fund, financed by a 0.1-cent-per-gallon tax on motor fuel, pays for federal activities involved with oversight and cleanup. The states are required to have storage-tank programs, and they implement the federal regulations\u2014sometimes adding more stringent requirements. By 2014, nearly 450,000 cleanups were completed, with a backlog of 74,000. Why is the Superfund program important? Why is it difficult to fund? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 22.4 Managing Current Toxic Chemicals and Wastes The production of chemical wastes will no doubt continue as long as modern societies persist. It follows that human health and natural ecosystems can be protected only if we have management procedures to handle and dispose of wastes safely. We have already noted that the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act limit discharges into water and air, respectively. When problems regarding the disposal of wastes on land became evident in the mid-1970s, Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in order to control land disposal. Any company producing hazardous wastes in the United States today is regulated by these three major environmental acts. 22.4 Managing Current Toxic Chemicals and Wastes 559 Gasoline Storage vapors tank Pool of gasoline Contaminated water contains gasoline Mobile vacuum decontamination unit Leak repaired Contaminated water containing dissolved gasoline (b) (d) Figure 22\u201313 Leaking underground storage tank remediation. (a) Typical subsurface contamination from a leaking fuel tank at a gas station. (b) After the leak has been repaired, the vacuum-extraction process causes gasoline and residual hydrocarbons in the soil and on the water table to evaporate and then removes the vapors, preventing further contamination of the groundwater. (c) Contaminated groundwater is pumped out, treated, and returned to the ground. (d) Soil vapor extraction system removing volatile organic compounds in soil at an abandoned gasoline station. The Clean Air and Clean Water Acts The Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act of 1972, and their various amendments make up the basic legislation limiting discharges into the air or water (more is said about the Clean Air Act in Chapter 19, and the Clean Water Act in Chapter 20). Under the Clean Water Act, any firm (including facilities such as sewage-treatment plants) discharging more than a certain volume into natural waterways must have a discharge permit (specifically, a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit).", "Discharge permits are a means of monitoring who is discharging what. Establishments are required to report all discharges of substances listed in the TRI. The renewal of the permits is then made contingent on reducing pollutants to meet certain standards within certain periods. Standards are being made continually stricter as technologies for pollution control improve. Some manufacturing firms discharging wastewater into municipal sewer systems are required to pretreat such water to remove any pollutant that cannot be removed by sewage-treatment plants\u2014that is, nonbiodegradable organics and heavy metals. Nevertheless, even this restriction does not end all water pollution. Certain amounts of wastes are still legally discharged under permits, and although they may account for a low percentage of total emissions, they still add up to large numbers, as we have seen. Moreover, small firms, homes, and farms are exempt from regulation. Further still, a great deal of pollution comes from nonpoint sources such as urban and farm runoff (Chapter 20). The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) The 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and its subsequent amendments are the cornerstone legislation designed to prevent unsafe or illegal disposal of all solid wastes on land ( Chapter 21). RCRA has three main features. First, it requires that all disposal facilities, such as landfills, be sanctioned by permit. The permitting process requires that these facilities have all the safety features mentioned in Section 22.2, including monitoring wells. This requirement caused most old facilities to shut down\u2014many subsequently became Superfund sites\u2014and new high-quality landfills with safety measures to be constructed. Second, RCRA requires that toxic wastes destined for landfills be pretreated to convert them to forms that will not leach. Such treatment now commonly includes biodegradation or incineration in various kinds of facilities, including cement kilns ( Figure 22\u201314) . Biodegradation involves the use of systems similar to those used for secondary sewage treatment and perhaps new species of bacteria capable of breaking down synthetic organics ( Chapter 20). If treatment is thorough, there may be little or nothing to put in a landfill. For whatever is still going to disposal facilities, the third major feature of RCRA is the requirement of \u201ccradle-tograve\u201d tracking of all hazardous wastes. The generator (the company that originated the wastes) must fill out a form detailing the exact kinds and amounts of waste generated. Persons transporting the waste\u2014who are also required to be permitted\u2014and those operating the disposal facility must each sign the form, vouching that the amounts of waste transferred Figure 22\u201314 Cement kiln to destroy hazardous wastes. A cement kiln is a huge rotating \u201cpipe,\u201d typically 15 feet in diameter and 230 feet long, mounted on an incline. (a) Solid wastes fed in with raw materials are fully incinerated and made to react with cement compounds as they gradually tumble toward the combustion chamber. (b) Flammable liquid wastes added with the fuel and air impart fuel value as they are burned. (c) Waste dust is trapped and recycled into the kiln. are accurate. Copies of their signed forms go to the EPA. All phases are subject to unannounced EPA inspections. The generator remains responsible for any waste \u201clost\u201d along the way or any inaccuracies in reporting. This provision of RCRA thus ensures that generators will deal only with responsible parties and curtails midnight dumping. Reduction of Accidents and Accidental Exposures In August 2015, a series of massive explosions rocked the port city of Tianjin, China. The explosions were set off by a fire that spread though warehouses containing a variety of hazardous chemicals, including 700 metric tons of toxic sodium cyanide. The disaster killed more than 100 people and injured more than 700. The explosions spread pollution across a wide area, potentially harming thousands more. This tragic event illustrates the importance of regulations to ensure that hazardous materials are stored safely. A significant risk to personal and public health lies in exposures that occur as a result of leaks, accidents, and the misguided use of hazardous chemicals in the home or workplace. A considerable number of laws bear on reducing the probability of accidents and on minimizing the exposure of both workers and the public if accidents should occur. Department of Transportation Regulations. Transport is an area that is particularly prone to accidents. As modern society uses increasing amounts and kinds of hazardous materials, the stage is set for accidents to become wide-scale disasters.", "To reduce this risk, Department of Transportation regulations (DOT regs) specify the kinds of containers and methods of packing to be used in the transport of various hazardous materials. Such regulations are intended to reduce the risk of spills, fires, and poisonous fumes that could be generated from mixing certain chemicals in case an accident occurs. 22.4 Managing Current Toxic Chemicals and Wastes 561 In addition, DOT regs require that every individual container and the outside of a truck or railcar carry a standard placard identifying the hazards (flammability, corrosiveness, the potential for poisonous fumes, and so on) presented by the material inside ( Figure 22\u20132). Such placards enable police and firefighters to identify the potential hazard and respond appropriately in case of an accident. You may also see highway HAZMAT signs restricting truckers with hazardous materials to using particular routes or lanes or to using a highway only during certain hours. Worker Protection: OSHA and the Worker\u2019s Right to Know. In the past, it was not uncommon for industries to require workers to perform jobs that entailed exposure to hazardous materials without informing the workers of the hazards involved. This situation is now addressed by amendments to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA). These amendments make up the hazard communication standard, or worker\u2019s right to know. Basically, the law requires businesses, industries, and laboratories to make available both information regarding hazardous materials and suitable protective equipment. One form in which this information is presented is the material safety data sheet (MSDS), which must accompany more than 600 kinds of chemicals when they are shipped, stored, and handled. These sheets contain information about the reactivity and toxicity of the chemicals, with precautions to follow when one is using the chemical. Notably, however, the responsibility to read the information and exercise proper precautions remains with the worker. Community Protection and Emergency Preparedness: SARA, Title III. In 1984, an accident at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, caused the release of more than 40 tons of methyl isocyanate, an extremely toxic gas (Figure 22\u201315) . An estimated 600,000 people in communities surrounding the plant were exposed to the deadly fumes. Within days, more than 5,000 people died, and more than 10,000 subsequently died from gas-related diseases. At least 50,000 people suffered various degrees of visual impairment, respiratory problems, and other injuries from the exposure, and many more have experienced chronic illnesses related to the disaster. To date, the tragic events in Bhopal have been the world\u2019s worst industrial disaster. An Indian investigation of the accident found that the disaster likely happened because Union Carbide officials had scaled back safety and alarm systems at the plant in order to cut costs. Ironically, most of the deaths and injuries could have been avoided if people had known that methyl isocyanate is highly soluble in water, that a wet towel over the head would have greatly reduced one\u2019s exposure, and that showers would have alleviated aftereffects. Unfortunately, neither the people affected nor the medical authorities involved had any idea of what chemical they confronted, much less the way to protect or treat themselves. After the Bhopal disaster, Congress passed legislation to address the problem of accidents. For expediency, the measure was added as Title III to a bill reauthorizing Superfund: the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986. Figure 22\u201315 Toxic chemical disaster, Bhopal, India. Officials view some of the victims of a deadly gas release at a Union Carbide plant in 1984. At least 10,500 died, and many more suffered injuries. Title III is better known as the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which we have already encountered in connection with the TRI. EPCRA requires companies that handle in excess of five tons of any hazardous material to provide a \u201ccomplete accounting\u201d of storage sites, feed hoppers, and so on. The information goes to a local emergency planning committee, which is also required in every government jurisdiction. The committee is made up of officials representing local fire and police departments, hospitals, and any other groups that might be involved in case of an emergency, as well as the executive officers of the companies in question. The task of the local committees is to develop contingency plans for possible accidents and disasters. Evaluating New Chemicals In the past, new synthetic organic compounds were introduced for a specific purpose without any testing of their potential side effects.", "For example, in the 1960s, a new compound known as TRIS was found to be an effective flame retardant and was widely used in children\u2019s sleepwear. It was only later discovered that TRIS was a potent carcinogen. Treated sleepwear was immediately withdrawn from the market. It is not known how many children (if any) developed cancer from TRIS, but this and other such cases revealed a hole in the systems of protection. Toxic Substances Control Act. Congress responded by passing the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA), which requires that, before manufacturing a new chemical in bulk, manufacturers submit a \u201cpre-manufacturing notice\u201d to the EPA, in which the potential environmental and human health impacts of the substance are assessed (including those that may derive from the ultimate disposal of the chemical). Depending on the results of the assessment, a manufacturer may be required to test the effects of the product on living things. Following the results of testing, the EPA may restrict a product\u2019s uses or keep it off the market altogether. The law, however, also tells the EPA to use the \u201cleast burdensome\u201d approach to regulation and to compare the costs and benefits of regulation. TSCA also authorizes the EPA to develop an inventory of the chemicals already in use at the time the legislation was passed and to require testing whenever there are indications of potential risks. More than 80,000 chemical substances are currently on the inventory. There is serious concern over the effectiveness of TSCA. A huge loophole allows chemical companies to keep their chemical recipes confidential, claiming they are trade secrets. The EPA has required testing for only 200 of the chemicals in commerce and has actually developed regulations for only five of the existing chemicals. The Government Accountability Office (the investigative arm of Congress) has labeled TSCA as a failed program, largely due to the restrictions the act places on the EPA\u2019s ability to regulate. Figure 22\u201316 summarizes the U.S. laws that apply to hazardous wastes. It is noteworthy that consumer advocate groups have been a major force behind the passage of these laws, as well as the regulations requiring ingredients to be labeled on all products. Citizen action does make a difference! International Hazardous Waste Regulations There are a number of international treaties about hazardous waste, all of which are relatively recent. For the most part, these treaties emphasize the importance of informed consent and the precautionary principle, and are designed to protect those who will have the greatest exposure to chemical pollutants. Designing laws to protect those who are the most vulnerable to environmental degradation is part of environmental justice, which we will discuss in the following section. The Aarhus Convention. The Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, which went into effect in 2001, is probably the broadest of these agreements (Chapter 2). It establishes the right of the public to information, to a voice in proceedings, and to just treatment when environmental regulations are not kept. Other agreements include the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm Conventions and the REACH treaty.

Summary of the major laws pertaining to the protection of workers, the public, and the environment from hazardous materials. Three Important Conventions. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal (1989), known as the Basel Convention, preceded the Aarhus convention, entering into force in 1992. It regulates the movement of hazardous waste between nations to prevent the transfer of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries. Its regulations are designed to prevent the types of problems caused by the dumping of e-waste (Chapter 21 ).", "The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, or Stockholm Convention, came into force in 2004. Countries that signed the treaty agreed to outlaw nine particularly harmful pollutants; to limit the use of DDT to the control of malaria; and to limit the accidental production of pollutants, such as dioxin, by the breakdown of other products. The Rotterdam Convention is an international treaty that went into effect in 2004. It promotes the open exchange of information about hazardous chemicals including pesticides ( Chapter 13). One of its important features is a process of prior informed consent, in which exporting countries must inform all potential importing countries of actions they have taken to ban or restrict the use of pesticides or other toxic chemicals. Exporting countries must also label toxics clearly ( Chapter 13). European Regulations. In 2007, members of the European Union agreed to the comprehensive Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals Treaty (REACH). This agreement has resulted in a process of registering and classifying all potentially hazardous chemical substances in use in European countries. Manufacturers must provide a safety report for each chemical that includes human health and environmental hazard assessments, as well as information on how the chemical may be used once it is sold. Many chemicals not currently tested in the United States are included in this regulation, so U.S. companies that export products to Europe must follow these stricter rules. What are two key differences between OSHA and the RCRA? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 22.5 Broader Issues Before we leave the topic of hazardous wastes, we still need to address two important broader issues: the problem of environmental justice and the movement toward pollution prevention. Environmental Justice and Hazardous Wastes 22.5 Broader Issues 563 uranium mines abandoned by private companies that operated the mines under government contracts. The issue is environmental justice, introduced elsewhere (Chapter 1). The EPA defines environmental justice as: The fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that no group of people, including racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic group should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, municipal, and commercial operations or the execution of federal, state, local, and tribal programs and policies. 6 The U.S. environmental justice movement was an outgrowth of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. One of the prominent events occurred in rural Warren County, North Carolina, in 1982. County residents, poor and largely African American, protested the dumping of toxic PCBs in a government landfill. For six weeks they rallied and marched (Figure 22\u201317) . Although other protests over environmental discrimination preceded it, this was the first environmental protest by people of color to garner nationwide attention, 6Environmental Protection Agency, Final Guidance for Incorporating Environmental Justice Concerns in EPA\u2019s NEPA Compliance Analyses (April 1998), available at www.epa.gov. Figure 22\u201317 Environmental justice protest, 1982, in Warren County, North Carolina. Protesters marched against siting a dump for PCB wastes in a rural, poor, and primarily African American commu-nity in one of the early prominent events in the environmental justice movement. and it triggered further activism. In 1991, a group of prominent civil rights leaders, scientists, and others met at the first National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in Washington, DC, an event that prompted government action. Federal Response. The federal government has taken this problem seriously. In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, focusing federal agency attention on environmental justice. The EPA\u2019s response was to establish an Environmental Justice Program, which promotes a number of activities. For example, in connection with the EPA\u2019s Brownfields program, communities are putting abandoned properties back into productive use. Many efforts are directed toward addressing justice concerns before they become problems. The Obama administration recently coordinated commitments by 16 federal agencies to address environmental justice issues and implement new strategies to combat injustices to minority communities. 7 International Environmental Justice. One form of trade the developing countries can do without is the international trade in toxic wastes. Some countries or local jurisdictions in search of ready cash have found a source in the form of toxic-waste shipments, which invariably come from more developed countries and are often illegal. This issue appeared earlier in connection with the overseas shipments of electronic wastes (Chapter 21 ).", "Close to home, some 20% of spent vehicle batteries (20 million in 2011) are exported from the United States to Mexico, where environmental and safety regulations are more relaxed. As a result, Mexican workers are exposed to levels of lead that far exceed the levels allowed in the United States. The Aarhus, Basel, Stockholm, and Rotterdam conventions, already discussed, are part of the international community\u2019s effort to make hazardous waste exposure more equitable. Pollution Prevention for a Sustainable Society Pollution control and pollution prevention are not the same. Pollution control involves adding a filter or some other device at the \u201cend of the pipe\u201d to prevent pollutants from entering the environment. The captured pollutants still have to be disposed of, and this entails more regulation and control. By contrast, pollution prevention involves changing the production process or the materials used so that harmful pollutants won\u2019t be produced in the first place. For example, adding a catalytic converter to the exhaust pipe of your car is pollution control, whereas redesigning the engine or switching to a hybrid car so that less pollution is produced is pollution prevention. Pollution prevention often results in better product or materials management\u2014that is, less waste. Thus, pollution prevention frequently creates a cost savings. For example, Exxon Chemical Company added simple \u201cfloating roofs\u201d to tanks 7Environmental News Service, \u201cObama Administration Strengthens Environmental Justice Efforts,\u201d February 27, 2012, www.ens-newswire.com/ens/feb2012/2012 02-27-091.html. storing its most volatile chemicals, thereby reducing evaporative emissions by 90% and gaining a savings of $200,000 per year. That paid for the cost of the roofs in six months. As another example, United Musical Instruments in Nogales, Arizona, worked with the Pollution Prevention Unit of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality to install a closed-loop system that reduced water use by 500,000 gallons per year, saving the company $127,000 in its first year alone. The system also reduced hazardous waste by 58% in three years. Both are examples of the minimization of pollution. Green Chemistry. A second approach to pollution avoidance is substitution\u2014finding nonhazardous substitutes for hazardous materials. This is known as green chemistry. For example, the dry-cleaning industry, which uses large quantities of toxic organic chemicals, is exploring the use of water-based cleaning, or \u201cwet cleaning.\u201d Preliminary results from some entrepreneurs indicate that wet cleaning is quite comparable in cost and performance to dry cleaning. There are now more than 150 wet cleaners in North America, and the number is growing. The American Chemical Society (ACS) and the EPA have been cooperating to promote green chemistry, particularly for undergraduate and graduate chemistry courses. Case studies and laboratory modules have been developed by this cooperation, available on the ACS Web site. Reuse. A third approach is reuse\u2014cleaning up and recycling solvents and lubricants. Some military bases, for example, have been able to distill solvents and reuse them, instead of discarding these solvents in a manner that releases them into the environment. This approach has increased greatly during the past decade, as measured by the TRI data. All three approaches to preventing pollution\u2014minimization, substitution, and reuse\u2014have been employed increasingly by industries handling hazardous chemicals, and all have contributed to significant reductions in hazardous-waste releases into the environment. (See Figure 22\u20134.) The public disclosure of TRI data is judged to have played a crucial role in these reductions. The EPA has concluded that the system has been a highly effective environmental program, one of the best ever administered by the EPA. You, the Consumer. Finally, pollution avoidance can also be applied to the individual consumer. So far as you are able to reduce or avoid the use of products containing harmful chemicals, you are preventing those amounts of chemicals from being released into the environment. You are also reducing the by-products that result from producing those chemicals. The average American home contains as much as 100 pounds of hazardous household waste (HHW)\u2014substances such as paints, stains, varnishes, batteries, pesticides, motor oil, oven cleaners, and more. These materials need to be stored safely, used responsibly, and disposed of properly if they are not to pose a risk of injury or death and a threat to environmental health. (Many communities hold regular HHW collection days; if yours doesn\u2019t, you could initiate one!) Review Questions 565 A growing number of companies are beginning to produce and market green products, a term used for products that are more environmentally benign than are their traditional counterparts.", "For example, Method Products and Clorox-based Green Works are now marketing nontoxic cleaners in Target, Costco, and other large retailers. How fast and to what degree these green products replace traditional products will in large part depend on how we behave as consumers. In other words, your buying power can be an extremely potent force. In conclusion, there are four ways to address the problems of pollution by hazardous chemicals: (1) pollution prevention, (2) recycling, (3) treatment (breaking down or converting the material to harmless products), and (4) safe disposal. The first three of these methods promote a minimum of waste, in harmony with the principles of sustainability. There is every reason to believe that we can have the benefits of modern chemical technology without destroying the sustainability of our environment by polluting it.

Sustainable Communities and Lifestyles The word beltline conjures up images of a multi-lane highway that runs around a major metropolitan area, facilitating commuting and stimulating a ring of industries, all of which guarantees that not long after such a highway is built, it will become congested. Atlanta, Georgia, has such a belt, Interstate Route 285, a 10-lane highway built to allow through traffic to avoid the city, but now heavily used by commuters who travel between the expanding suburbs and the corporations that have located along the highway. This is the Atlanta Beltway. The Atlanta BeltLine is something else altogether, an ambitious makeover of an abandoned rail and industrial corridor that loops around the heart of Atlanta, well inside the Beltway (see map above). One writer has called it \u201cthe country\u2019s most ambitious smart growth project.\u201d 1 The project is a remarkable visionary effort that will provide parks, trails, public transportation, brownfields remediation, revitalization of distressed city neighborhoods, and much more. Connecting Neighborhoods. The \u201cBelt Line\u201d was originally a loop of tracks that provided rail transportation in post\u2013Civil War Atlanta. When trucks and highways came on the scene, most of the rail tracks were abandoned.

The total price tag for the BeltLine is estimated at $2.8 billion, but considering the potential benefits for the city of Atlanta, that seems like a bargain. In concept, it will create 5,600 housing units, 2,000 acres of parks, 33 miles of continuous trails, and a 22-mile light-rail transit system. A s a result of the BeltLine, some 40 city neighborhoods will be renewed. The project includes the cleanup and redevelopment of 1,100 acres of contaminated brownfield sites. In addition to thousands of temporary construction jobs, it will eventually provide 30,000 permanent jobs as well as a $20 billion increase in the city\u2019s tax base over the next 25 years.", "These are huge benefits to a city battling the effects of aging and economic struggles. 23.1 Megatrends in Communities A century ago, less than 5% of the world\u2019s people lived in cities; today more than half are city dwellers. And the world\u2019s cities are expected to continue growing well into the middle of the 21st century and beyond. By 2050, demogra-80 phers expect an extra 2.4 billion people will live in cities, which will mean that two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will be urban. The general term for this increasing dominance of cities is urbanization. Urbanization is a function of natural population growth and migration to cities from rural areas (Chapters 8 and 9). The pace of urbanization varies greatly from region to region ( Figure 23\u20131) . Africa and Asia, the continents with the largest rural populations, are urbanizing the most rapidly; within those continents, Nigeria, India, and China have the highest rates of urbanization. However, the current record for the most rapidly growing city is held by Karachi, Pakistan, which grew by 80% between 2000 and 2010. This vast urbanization is a megatrend, one of the major global changes expected as we move further into the 21st century. Urbanization coincides with a number of other trends we have been following throughout the book. These include positive trends, such as longer life spans, improved health care and education, decreased poverty, and a rising consumer class, as well as negative trends, such as growing populations, increased use of resources, increasing pollution, the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and climate change. In this chapter, we will see how these trends interact with communities\u2014from small villages in rural areas to vast metro regions. 10 0 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Year Figure 23\u20131 Urbanization by region. Between 1950 and 2014, the proportion of the world population that was urban increased from about 30% to over 50%. By 2050, that number is likely to be 67%. Most of the urban growth in the next decades will occur in Africa and A sia. Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific Islands, will have the lowest rate of urbanization.

Proportion of population (percent) 70 60 50 40 30 20 Many obstacles remain before the Atlanta BeltLine reaches completion, especially obtaining funding. There is no doubt that the BeltLine will be years in the making, but when it is finished, it will represent a monumental improvement in urban Atlanta. With its BeltLine, Atlanta joins a bevy of cities intent on transforming economically depressed neighborhoods into showplaces of urban renewal. We will begin this chapter by discussing urban and rural communities around the world. Then we will look at trends in U.S. communities, including suburban sprawl and urban reinvigoration. Next we will consider the national and global efforts being undertaken to build sustainable cities and communities in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals. Finally, we will look at some ethical concerns and personal lifestyle issues as we consider the urgent needs of people and the environment in this new millennium. PROPORTION OF POPULATION THAT IS URBAN 100 90 What Is a City? Before we continue, we need to define some terms that are used 1. Which area of the world is currently the most urbanized? Which is the least urbanized? to describe various kinds of communities. An urbanized area 2. In which year (approximately) will 50% of Africans be urban? is a densely populated region, dominated by a human-built living in larger cities will have increased Figure 23\u20132 Growth of cities of 6000 different sizes. Cities of all sizes are growing. In 2030, most urban people will live in cities with fewer than 500,000 5000 people, but the proportion of people Population (millions) 4000 more rapidly. Megacities can dominate an entire region. (Source: UN World Urbanization Prospects 3000 2014 Highlights. 2014. Geneva: UN, 13.) 10 cities 2000 21 cities Megacities of 10 million or more239 cities 294 cities Large cities of 5 to 10 million Medium-sized cities of 1 to 5 million 1000 0 environment, with more than 400 people per square kilometer. Centers with fewer people than urbanized areas may be called towns, townships, or villages, depending upon their location. Areas with populations below a certain size (in the United States the limit is 2,500 people) are classified as rural. Cities and Suburbs.", "A city, such as Philadelphia or Cleveland, is an urbanized area with a distinct government and, in most places, a mayor. Cities are often surrounded by suburbs, areas that are less densely populated than cities but interact with cities more than rural areas do. Suburbs are included in the designation \u201curban\u201d when demographers are contrasting urban and rural areas. In the United States, suburbs are often wealthy \u201cbedroom communities\u201d for a city, but this is not the case in all countries. Exurbs are even further out than suburbs. A large city may be a metropolis, a regional center for a whole area. A city with suburbs and surrounding towns or even smaller cities may be called a metropolitan area or metropolitan region. Such an area acts as a single economic zone. That is, people work, shop, and travel throughout the whole. In some places, even large cities have merged so that it is difficult to see where one ends and another begins. A chain of metropolitan regions such as occurs in the eastern United States between Boston and Washington, DC, is called a megalopolis or urban agglomeration. The merging of cities and towns around cities and the growth of suburbs are part of the reason why the identities and populations of the largest cities are not the same on all the lists you might read. Researchers have to define the areas being identified as the city: Do they mean the city proper, or the larger metro-region, or even larger combined urban aggregations? The Growth of Megacities. The very largest cities\u2014those with more than 10 million inhabitants\u2014are called megacities. In 1975, Mexico City joined New York and Tokyo as the world\u2019s only megacities. By 2014, there were 28 such cities, accounting for 7% of the world\u2019s population and 13% Cities of 500,000 to 1 million Urban areas smaller than 500,000 of its urban population. 2 The seven largest megacities are in Asia. The largest is the Pearl River Delta urban area in China, which includes what were once four distinct cities: Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Recently it has surpassed the size of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan region. 3 Most urban dwellers, however, are not in megacities. About half live in cities of under 500,000. Figure 23\u20132 shows the increase in cities of different sizes over time. Advantages of Urbanization Is urbanization a threat to the environment? It certainly is true that cities have a significant impact on the land and ecosystems around them, consuming large amounts of resources and releasing regionally concentrated levels of pollution. Yet there are a number of environmental and social benefits to urbanization. Greater Efficiency. If cities provide the basic infrastructure needs\u2014clean water, electricity, mass transit, and the sanitary disposal of solid wastes and sewage\u2014economies of scale can make the per capita resource consumption of city residents far lower than that of people living in suburbs and rural areas. In the United States, for example, the average city-dweller uses only half as much electricity as the average suburbanite. Because city residents drive less than suburbanites, instead walking and using public transportation, they consume less energy and produce less air pollution. It is also more efficient to provide heating to apartment buildings than to single-family homes. Other forms of efficiency available to cities include district heating and waste-to-energy plants, which we have discussed elsewhere ( Chapters 14 and 21). 2J. Kotkin et al., The Problem with Megacities (Orange, CA: Chapman University Press, 2014). 3World Bank, East Asia\u2019s Changing Urban Landscape (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2015). Figure 23\u20133 Benefits of urban life. People like these young resi-dents of Melbourne, Australia, enjoy the excitement, opportunities, and diverse culture of city life. Melbourne consistently ranks as a highly livable city because of its amenities, jobs, culture, and safety. Slower Population Growth. In many parts of the world, urbanization is partly an outcome of rapid population growth. But since urbanization has a natural dampening effect on fertility, the growth of cities should help to slow that trend. A number of factors\u2014economic opportunities for women, access to health services, and less need for children\u2019s labor\u2014work to reduce fertility rates in urban populations (see Chapters 8 and 9). Social and Economic Benefits. Of course, there are social and economic advantages to living in cities, including a high concentration of jobs and cultural opportunities such as museums and theaters, making cities exciting places to live ( Figure 23\u20133) .", "However, realizing these potential benefits requires effective urban planning, a topic we will consider in Section 23.3. Challenges of Urbanization and Megacities To provide essential services to their residents, cities require a vast infrastructure. What might be done by individuals in rural areas\u2014getting water from a well, building a pathway, or digging a latrine\u2014is done through an enormous network of water and sewer lines, large highways, and huge landfills. In wealthy and some middle-income countries, cities often coordinate municipal services efficiently and provide millions with employment. But in poorer regions that lack the resources to provide these services, the rapid development of cities can be disastrous. People are moving into these cities at a rate that far exceeds the capacity of the city to assimilate them. For example, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a megacity of 15 million, two-thirds of the sewage is untreated. Risks to Public Health. The crowded conditions of many cities have a serious impact on the health of their residents. When large numbers of people live close together without clean water, adequate sanitation, or electricity, diseases can 23.1 Megatrends in Communities 571 spread rapidly. Mental illness is associated with distressing conditions and lack of exposure to natural landscapes. Air pollution increases with population density, often leading to an increase in respiratory ailments (see Chapter 19). Residents of Mumbai, India, for example, have a life expectancy of 57 years, seven years below the national average. 4 Environmental Damage. As you might imagine, large cities have an enormous impact on the environment around them. The high concentration of resource use and waste production is very damaging to the surrounding environment, even though the per capita effects of city residents are less than they would be elsewhere. Habitat loss and fragmentation, overuse of groundwater, and the dumping of wastes affect terrestrial ecosystems and the services they provide. In the many large coastal cities, overfishing, heavy pollution, and eutrophication take a toll on oceans and estuaries. One of the chief concerns about large cities, however, is the vast areas of unplanned, crowded development\u2014the slums\u2014that spring up around many of them. Slums and Shantytowns Two million residents of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, live in slums consisting of flimsy shacks made of scrap wood, metal, plastic sheeting, rocks, and mud ( Figure 23\u20134) . The slum neighborhoods of Nairobi lie on the outskirts of the city. Burning trash and charcoal cooking fires cloud the air, and the lack of sewers adds to the smell. None of the residents own their homes, because the settlements are built on public land or on private land where landowners exact high rents. Similar neighborhoods can be found around most of the developing-world cities. UN\u2013HABITAT estimates that 4J. Kotkin, W. Cox, A. Modarres, and A. Renn, The Problem with Megacities (Orange, CA: Chapman University Center for Demographics and Policy [Chapman Press], 2014). Figure 23\u20134 Shantytown in Nairobi, Kenya. More than half of Nairobi\u2019s residents live in such slums, where conditions defy description. one out of every three people in the developing world cities lives in a slum. Because the buildings in slum areas are usually unauthorized, cities rarely provide them with electricity, water, sanitation, or social services such as schools and hospitals. People must obtain their water and other services from private companies. Crime is rampant, and diseases such as tuberculosis spread readily. In spite of their living conditions, slum residents are of necessity amazing entrepreneurs, engaging in a widespread informal economy. Residents usually build their own dwellings and erect their own infrastructure. They provide their own food stands, coffee shops, barbershops, and, in some cases, schools for their children. Indeed, slums are often the home of a workforce that is essential to cities\u2014the workers who are willing to take the low-paying jobs that keep the city and its wealthier inhabitants functioning. The Abandoned Countryside One outcome of urbanization is the abandonment of rural areas. Over the next 35 years, all of the world\u2019s net population growth is expected to occur in urban areas, while rural regions are expected to decline by 300 million. In the past, such changes have led to a disparity in wealth, as well as a breakdown of traditional cultures and institutions. Fewer Jobs and Aging Workers. Industrial agriculture has increased the efficiency of food production, which means that fewer laborers are needed to perform agricultural tasks. (For example, machines may be used to harvest crops that were once hand-picked.) As a result, there are fewer jobs in rural areas.", "Because farm work supports a smaller proportion of the population, many people move to cities looking for work. As workers leave rural areas, there are not enough people to support the local businesses, so those jobs dry up, too. This leads to more people leaving, until even the jobs that remain in rural areas may not have people to do them. Figure 23\u20135 Rural and urban pov-30 erty in the United States. Poverty is more common in rural areas than in urban areas; the rate of poverty among 25 rural children is greater than 25%. However, there are also significant pockets of urban poverty. This pattern 20 has held true for more than 40 years. 15 10 5 0 1976 78 80 82 84 Percent As young workers migrate to cities, the remaining rural population becomes increasingly older. In Japan, urban migration has left few rural people to work on farms, care for the elderly, or maintain communities. The majority of rice farming in Japan, for example, is done by people in their 60s and 70s. Rural Poverty. In much of the world, those who live in rural areas are poorer and have less access to health care and education than those in cities. This difference in wealth is referred to as spatial inequality. In fact, the majority of the world\u2019s poor are rural. A lack of infrastructure, access to markets, and other problems plague rural areas. Women in rural areas, who do a disproportionate amount of agricultural labor, are particularly disadvantaged. Rural poverty is worsened by urbanization. A small village or town will eventually have too few jobs and other opportunities to be attractive to the young people who grew up there, and many will feel forced to leave. As they leave, those left behind are even poorer, with fewer opportunities. The effects of rural poverty are pronounced in low-income countries, but can be seen in developed countries as well. Rural poverty is a significant problem in the United States, even though there are social safety nets (Figure 23\u20135) . Social Changes. The exodus from rural areas is also having a significant impact on rural societies. In China, a massive migration to cities has been triggered by a search for industrial work and encouraged by government authorities who promote urbanization and want to appropriate rural lands for development. Between 2000 and 2010, China\u2019s urban population increased by almost 132 million people. In 2000, there were 3.7 million villages in China; by 2010, there were only 2.6 million\u2014a loss of 300 villages a day. This almost geologic shift, the largest human migration in history, has changed the fabric of Chinese society. Because villages were centers of local culture, the loss of traditions is profound. For millennia, villagers passed traditional songs, dances, and techniques of printmaking down from generation to 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 23.2 Trends in U.S. Communities 573 Figure 23\u20136 Children who are left behind. A volunteer tutors children in China\u2019s Jiangxi Province who have been left in the care of others while their parents work in cities. Some 61 million rural Chinese children share the same plight. Figure 23\u20137 A traditional city neighborhood. Before the wide-spread use of automobiles, cities had an integrated structure. A wide variety of small stores and offices on ground floors, with residences on upper floors, placed everyday needs within walking distance. This scene is from a historic section of Philadelphia. generation. Today these arts\u2014a part of China\u2019s intangible capital\u2014are being lost. One of the most troubling changes in China is the loss of traditional family structures. When parents travel to cities, regulations about the rights of migrants often cause them to leave their children behind. As a result, today nearly one in five Chinese children is being raised by someone other than his or her parents (Figure 23\u20136) . These almost 61 million \u201cleft behind\u201d children are usually being raised by elderly relatives in rural areas. Children who move to cities with their parents also fare poorly. Without legal residence permits, children are not allowed to attend school and are often mistreated. Any sustainable future will require specific plans to support rural communities as well as urban communities. Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals relating to poverty will also mean a focus on both urban and rural areas. Why is the recent large-scale migration to cities a problem for rural areas? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 23.2 Trends in U.S. Communities", "The pace of urbanization in the United States is far slower than that in the developing world. Even so, an examination of the issues related to urban and suburban growth in this country provides insight into the pressures on modern cities around the world. In this section, we will consider the factors that have driven the movement from city centers to vast sprawling suburbs, leaving behind blighted urban areas. We\u2019ll also see how recent efforts have begun to reinvigorate many city centers. The Growth of Cities At the beginning of the 20th century, the large majority of Americans lived in rural areas. But as people abandoned less productive farms and mechanized farming reduced the need for farm labor, there was a movement out of rural areas and into cities. In the South, the unjust conditions of segregation caused many African Americans to leave rural areas, seeking greater economic opportunity in northern cities. An influx of immigrants also increased city populations. At the same time, the growth of industry provided jobs for those moving into cities. By 1940, 56% of the U.S. population was urban or suburban. The majority of people living in cities worked in factories or service jobs. The need for factory workers during World War II only increased the rate of migration to industrial centers. Until the end of World War II, a relatively small percentage of Americans owned cars. Cities and towns had developed in ways that allowed people to meet their needs by means of the transportation that was available\u2014mainly walking, but also by bicycling. Small groceries, pharmacies, and other stores, as well as professional offices, were integrated with residences. Buildings often had stores at the street level and residences above ( Figure 23\u20137) . Schools and parks were scattered throughout neighborhoods. Walking distances were generally short. Forms of public transportation such as electric trolleys, cable cars, and buses were also used. Beyond the city lines lay natural areas and farms, which provided most of the food for the city. Urban Sprawl Despite the many advantages of urban life, many people found the pollution, congestion, and noise of industrialized cities to be unpleasant. Many people had the desire\u2014the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d\u2014to live in their own house, on their own piece of land, away from the city. Cars and Suburbs. At the end of World War II, dramatic social changes occurred. Rationing during the war was replaced by a demand for consumer goods. When the mass production of cars resumed at the end of the war, people flocked to buy them. With private cars, people were no longer restricted to living within walking distance of their workplaces or transit lines. They could move out of their cramped city apartments and into homes of their own outside the city. At the same time, returning veterans and the accompanying baby boom created a housing demand that was met by developments built on farmlands and natural areas outside the cities. The government aided this trend by providing low-interest mortgages and tax deductions for homeowners, while rent was not tax deductible. These changes meant that making monthly payments on a mortgage for a home in the suburbs was cheaper than paying rent for equivalent or less living space in the city. These economic factors contributed to the development of urban sprawl, a far-flung network of low-density residential areas, shopping malls, industrial parks, and other facilities loosely laced together by multilane highways ( Figure 23\u20138) . Highways. The mushrooming development around cities did not proceed according to any plan; rather, it happened wherever developers could acquire land. Local governments in surrounding towns were quickly thrown into the catchup role of trying to provide schools, sewers, water systems, roads, and other public facilities to accommodate the uncontrolled growth. Local zoning laws kept residential and commercial uses separate. It became more difficult to walk to a grocery store or an office. The influx of commuters created a need for new and larger roads. In 1956, Congress created a tax on gasoline, producing funds to be used exclusively for building new roads. Ironically, this Highway Trust Fund has perpetuated the development of formerly rural areas. A new highway not only alleviates existing congestion, but also encourages development at farther locations, because time, not distance, is the limiting factor for commuters. (When people describe how far they live from work, it is almost always put in Figure 23\u20138 Urban sprawl. Prime land is being sacrificed for development around most U.S. cities and towns.", "The locations of developments are determined more by the availability of land than by any overall urban planning. Here we see sprawl surrounding the fastest-growing major city in the United States: Las Vegas, Nevada. terms of minutes, not distance.) New highways that were intended to reduce congestion actually led to more congestion because they fostered the ability of drivers to commute from more distant locations, leading to the development of more open land and an ever-greater number of commuters. Although the average commuting distance has doubled since 1960, the average commuting time has remained about the same. Unfortunately, government policy, as an unintended consequence, helped support and promote sprawl. Eventually, shopping malls and other businesses grew up near the residential developments. These commercial centers changed the direction of commuting: Whereas, in the early days of suburban sprawl, the major traffic flow was into and out of cities, it is now between suburban centers. Breaking the Cycle. Since 1990, there have been some changes that may help break the cycle of urban sprawl. A 1991 act allowed money from the Highway Trust Fund to be used for other modes of transportation, including cycling, walking, and mass transit. The 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the Twenty-First Century and another 2005 law increased funding for mass transit. The economic stimulus package (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) contained $64 billion for roads, bridges, rail, and transit; mass transit has been receiving much of this money. Measuring Sprawl. A team of researchers from Rutgers University, Cornell University, and Smart Growth America (a nongovernmental organization) worked to measure and evaluate sprawl and its impacts. The research team defined sprawl as \u201cthe process in which the spread of development across the landscape far outpaces population growth.\u201d 5 The team members created a sprawl index based on four measurements: residential density (sprawl lowers density), neighborhood mix (sprawl separates residences from businesses), accessibility of the street networks (sprawl concentrates traffic into large roads with few connections), and strength of activity centers and downtowns (sprawl weakens these). They used these numbers to create an index in which lower numbers represent more sprawl. The team analyzed 83 metropolitan areas, representing almost half of the U.S. population. The results ranged from 14 to 178, with the Riverside\u2013San Bernardino, California, metropolitan area the most sprawled and New York City the least ( Figure 23\u20139) . In broad perspective, then, urban sprawl is a process of exurban migration\u2014that is, a relocation of residences, shopping areas, and workplaces from their traditional spots in the city to outlying areas. The populations of many eastern and Midwestern U.S. cities, excluding the suburbs, have been declining over the past 60 years (Table 23\u20131) . At the same time, the country\u2019s suburban population has increased from 35 million in 1950 to 150 million in 2010, half of the 5Reid Ewing, Rolf Pendall, and Don Chen, Measuring Sprawl and Its Impact (Washington, DC: Smart Growth America, 2002).

(Source: Measuring Sprawl and Its Impact, 2002, Smart Growth America.) U.S. population. Sometimes people from older suburbs move to exurbs, communities that are even farther from cities than suburbs. At the same time, the population of truly rural areas has continued to decline. 23.2 Trends in U.S. Communities 575 Sprawl and Urban Blight Historically, U.S. cities included people with a wide diversity of economic and ethnic backgrounds. But during the second half of the 20th century, migration to the suburbs and the decline of industrial manufacturing worked together to increase economic and racial segregation, eventually leading to the economic collapse of portions of some cities. Economic and Racial Segregation. Moving to the suburbs required some degree of affluence\u2014at least the ability to manage a down payment and mortgage on a home and the ability to buy and drive a car. Therefore, exurban migration often excluded the poor, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. White people dominated the mass movement from cities to suburbs, giving the phenomenon the name white flight. The poorest city dwellers were mostly minorities. Some were in poverty because racial discrimination had denied them access to a good education and well-paying jobs, while others had recently immigrated to the United States and were still at the bottom of the social order. Systematic racism also played a role.", "Discriminatory lending practices by banks and dishonest sales practices by real estate agents (called redlining) kept minorities out of the suburbs, even when money was not a factor. Although civil rights laws passed in the 1960s made discriminatory practices illegal, less obvious forms of racism continue to exist, and there remain numerous barriers for residents of economically depressed inner cities to either leave or to improve the economy of the city. Figure 23\u201310 , on the following page, illustrates the outcome of this process. Decline of Industry. Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Youngstown\u2014 these and many other cities of the Midwest are representatives of what has been called the Rust Belt. Once known as the (a) (b) Figure 23\u201310 Segregation by exurban migration. Exurban migration, the driving force behind urban sprawl, has also led to segregation of the population along economic and racial lines. In (a) an area of suburbia and (b) an area of inner city Baltimore, you see the contrast. \u201cFoundry of the Nation,\u201d these cities and their outskirts had specialized in heavy manufacturing up to the mid-20th century. Then manufacturing migrated to southern states where labor was less costly, globalization of trade gave foreign manufacturers with far lower labor costs access to U.S. markets, and free trade agreements expanded. Finally, jobs were outsourced because of these developments. The result was a wholesale loss of the economic foundations of cities of the Rust Belt during the latter half of the 20th century, and the mass migration of people from these cities to other places. The term Rust Belt is a consequence of the all-too-common images of rusting and crumbling buildings and factories in the region (Figure 23\u201311) . Tax Erosion. Local governments use property taxes to pay for a wide range of public services and infrastructure, including schools, police and fire protection, water and sewer systems, waste collection and disposal, maintenance of local roads and parks, libraries, and welfare services. When large numbers of affluent people leave a city to move to the suburbs, the city government ends up with a smaller tax base with which to provide these services. Such a reduction in tax revenue is referred to as a declining tax base, or tax erosion, and it has been a serious handicap for most U.S. cities since the exurban migration started in the late 1940s. Migration to the suburbs has also caused city property values to decline. Figure 23\u201311 Rust Belt image. This abandoned factory is symbolic of many such relics of the heavy manufacturing that once took place in large Midwestern cities. The loss of affluent people also increases the proportion of inner-city dwellers who require public assistance of one sort or another, placing a disproportionate burden of welfare obligations on city governments. At the same time, there are fewer affluent people to support traditional inner-city social institutions, such as churches. Combined with the loss of government support, the social fabric of the communities is weakened. Urban Blight. An eroding tax base forces city governments to cut local services, increase the tax rate, or both. Hence, the property tax on a home in a city is often two to three times greater than the tax on a comparably priced home in the suburbs. Eventually many city properties are abandoned because the owners cannot pay the taxes. Cities \u201cinherit\u201d such abandoned properties, but they are a liability rather than a source of revenue. Without enough funding, public schools, refuse collection, street repair, libraries, parks, and other services and facilities deteriorate. Increasing taxes and deteriorating services cause yet more people to leave the city, even if they want to stay. Still, it is only the relatively affluent individuals who can afford to move to the suburbs. Thus the whole process of exurban migration, a declining tax base, deteriorating real estate, and worsening schools and other services is perpetuated in a vicious cycle. This downward spiral of conditions is referred to as urban blight or urban decay. Loss of Businesses and Jobs. The exurban migration includes more than just individuals and families: The flight of affluent people from the city removes the purchasing power necessary to support stores, professional establishments, and other enterprises. Faced with declining business, merchants and practitioners of all kinds are forced to go out of business or to move to new locations in the suburbs. Either way, vacant storefronts are the result, and people remaining in the city lose convenient access to goods, services, and, most importantly, jobs, because each business also represents employment opportunities.", "Getting to jobs, now located in the suburbs, is impossible for many people, who now have few employment options. As a result, crime rates rise. Impacts of Sprawl on Public Health and the Environment In addition to harming the city proper, urban sprawl can have major negative impacts on the quality of life in the surrounding areas. The environmental impacts of urban sprawl are many and serious. Hazards to Public Health. People living in sprawling suburbs drive more than those who live in more compact communities, who walk more and use mass transit more often. Walking and other moderate physical activities have many health benefits. One study of the health effects of sprawl found a highly significant correlation between the degree of sprawl and the incidence of overweight, obesity, and high blood pressure. People in high-sprawl areas drive greater distances and experience more traffic fatalities. In Riverside, California, the U.S. city with the greatest degree of sprawl, 18 of every 100,000 people die each year in highway accidents (Table 23\u20132) . In the eight cities that are the lowest on the index, fewer than 8 of 100,000 residents die annually on the highways. 23.2 Trends in U.S. Communities 577 Air Pollution. Shifting to a car-dependent lifestyle has increased our use of petroleum (Chapter 14). From 1950 to 2010, per capita U.S. oil consumption increased 63%. All this car use reduces air quality, making the air less breathable. Vehicles are responsible for an estimated 80% of the air pollution in metropolitan regions. Burning gasoline also releases carbon dioxide; in fact, transportation accounts for 28% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Water Resources. The roads and parking lots of sprawling urban and suburban areas increase the amount of impervious surfaces, decreasing the ability of local ecosystems to control floods and recharge groundwater (Chapter 10). Water quality is degraded by the runoff of fertilizer, pesticides, oil, pet drop pings, and other pollutants (Chapter 20 ). These nonpointsource pollutants are the leading cause of water quality problems, according to the EPA. Loss of Farmland and Natural Ecosystems. Perhaps the most serous impact of sprawl is the loss of land for agriculture, recreation, and wildlife habitat. New developments are consuming land at an increasing pace. According to the National Resources Inventory, 1.7 million acres a year were developed from 1997 to 2007, compared with 1.4 million acres a year from 1982 to 1992 (Figure 23\u201312) . In the United States, cropland is declining at a rate of 1.1 million acres per year. Most of the food for cities used to be grown on small family farms surrounding the city. With so many of these farms turned into housing developments, it is estimated that food now travels an average of 1,000 miles (1,500 km) from where it is produced\u2014mostly on huge commercial farms\u2014to where it is eaten. The fragmentation of wildlife habitat due to urban sprawl has led to marked declines in many species, ranging DEVELOPED LAND, 1982\u20132007 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Million acres Large urban and built-up areas Rural transportation Small built-up areas Figure 23\u201312 Conversion of land to developed uses. Between 1982 and 2007, 40 million acres of U.S. farmland and natural areas were converted to other uses, including urban areas and roadways. (Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture. 2007 National Resources Inventory, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Washington, DC, and Center for Survey Statistics and Methodology, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa. July 2009.) from birds to amphibians. A 2005 report 6 found that the 35 fastest-growing metropolitan areas are home to nearly one-third of the nation\u2019s rarest and most endangered species of plants and animals. Why Urban Sprawl Persists With all of these undesirable effects of sprawl, one might wonder why people put up with it. The answer is that people perceive that it is better to live in suburbs, so they move there. Quality-of-life issues tend to be decisive for most people, and these issues seem to be heavily weighted in favor of sprawl. In general, sprawl involves lower-density residential living, larger lot sizes, larger single-family homes, better-quality public schools, lower crime rates, better social services, and greater opportunity for participation in local governments. As people move farther away from an urban center, housing costs often decline. People move to the exurbs to live in neighborhoods with lower crime rates, to have access to better schools, or to live in more homogeneous communities.", "The result of thousands of people making these choices is to accentuate the concentration of poorer people in inner cities or in aging suburban communities. 7 The environmental costs of sprawl are very real, but the people moving to the sprawling suburbs seldom perceive those costs to be decisive. The costs are more a matter of the common good, and people tend to make choices based on personal good rather than the common good. The key to controlling sprawl is to provide communities with the quality-of-life benefits that attract people, but without incurring the serious environmental and social costs that are clearly associated with sprawl. The Housing Bubble and Suburban Blight The expansion of the suburbs during the second half of the 20th century was remarkable. By the early 2000s, home prices were rising rapidly and many were purchasing homes for their resale value. Banks and mortgage companies began extending loans to high-risk buyers, who were borrowing beyond their limits. But then the housing bubble burst. Property values began to decline in 2006, dropping precipitously in 2008. When housing prices fell, many people were unable to repay their loans. Fully one-fourth of all homes in the United States were worth less than their mortgaged amount (called underwater mortgages). 8 Loan defaults and foreclosures had a ripple effect through the economy, causing the loss of businesses and jobs in the United States and triggering a worldwide recession. Many of the foreclosed homes were suburban. The economic collapse also left many suburban development projects unfinished, leaving streets lined with vacant lots and half-built 6Reid Ewing et al., Endangered by Sprawl: How Runaway Development Threatens America\u2019s Wildlife (Washington, DC: National Wildlife Federation, Smart Growth America, and NatureServe, 2005). 7Robert W. Burchell et al., The Costs of Sprawl\u20142000 (Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2002). 8Michael B. Sauter and Charles B. Stockdale, \u201cAmerican Cities with the Most Underwater Mortgages,\u201d 24/7 Wall Street, December 28, 2011. houses. Suburban malls stood empty. This led to an unexpected phenomenon: suburban poverty and suburban blight. Back to the City In recent years, many college graduates and young professionals have been moving into cities. These new urbanites want the opportunities, convenience, and diversity of experience that cities can provide. Some of these new urban dwellers are looking for a more sustainable lifestyle. Public transit and new approaches to transportation such as car and bicycle sharing make it easier to live without cars. Some city dwellers are involved in a movement called urban homesteading, an effort to use skills from earlier eras to reduce their footprint in the city. Fixing up abandoned properties, using alternative sources of energy, and promoting urban agriculture are parts of this approach. The city of Detroit is one place where new approaches are making a difference. Once a dynamic city with numerous industries that provided well-paying jobs, the city was impoverished by the decades-long flight of the car manufacturers and residents to the suburbs. The 2008 housing collapse was particularly damaging to Detroit. Home values plunged, until almost a third of the city\u2019s housing sat vacant. Finally, in 2013, the over-extended city was forced to declare bankruptcy. Despite its many problems, Detroit is still an important hub for shipping and retains a strong mass transit system. Many residents who could have left have chosen to remain in the communities they love. Investors have been purchasing and rehabilitating homes and office buildings and encouraging the growth of small local businesses. Limited tax revenues make it difficult for the city to maintain its public infrastructure, but some private citizens have stepped up, providing security, repairing streetlights, and planting gardens ( Figure 23\u201313). These residents are a part of the next wave of reinvigoration for a city with a great deal of potential. CONCEPT CHECK How did the increased use of automobiles in the United States drive urban flight and, by extension, urban blight? \u2610\u2713 Figure 23\u201313 Revitalization of Detroit. These young men are plant-ing a neighborhood garden in Detroit, one of America\u2019s most economi-cally depressed cities. Such efforts are changing the fortunes of the city. 23.3 Moving Toward Sustainable Communities Sustainable Development Goal #11, Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, is focused on the development of human communities. In order to have sustainable communities and address inequalities in wealth, we must, among other things, rein in urban sprawl, revitalize our cities, and care for rural populations. Another trend that needs our attention is the overconsumption of resources, which has been increasing.", "Elsewhere, we have described the negative environmental impacts of that overconsumption. Since 1900, the world population has increased by 12-fold. But during this time, as one researcher noted, \u201cour [global] economy has increased in size by 22-fold, our use of construction minerals has increased 34-fold, ores 27-fold, and fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) have seen a 12-fold increase. We use 3.6 times as much biomass\u2014crops, residues, and wood\u2014as we did back then.\u201d 9 Our challenge today is even harder because our planet is facing or even crossing plan etary boundaries (Chapter 1) and experiencing climate change and the loss of biodiversity. Reining in Sprawl For cities with large sprawling suburbs, part of the movement toward sustainability will include reining in sprawl. Simply passing laws that bring rural development under control might seem to be the way to stop urban sprawl. Indeed, Japan and a number of European countries have such laws. However, laws cannot be passed without the support of the public. In the United States, the strong sentiment favoring the right of a landowner to develop a property as he or she sees fit has made such restrictions, with few exceptions, politically impossible to pass. Yet there are signs that a sea change is occurring in the attitudes of Americans toward uncontrolled growth. Smart-Growth Strategies. The recently emerged concept of smart growth is inviting communities and metropolitan areas to address sprawl by choosing to develop in more environmentally sustainable ways. While recognizing that communities will continue to grow, advocates of smart growth focus on economic, environmental, and community values that will lead to more livable communities. Table 23\u20133 presents the basic principles of smart growth. The goal of smart growth is integrated communities, rather than disassociated facilities. By directing growth to particular places, smart growth provides protection for sensitive lands. Early indications in the marketplace\u2014the final determining factor\u2014are that new communities that have followed the principles of smart growth are a great success. Smart-growth initiatives have been appearing on the ballot in many states and municipalities. The key strategies of these initiatives include setting boundaries on urban sprawl, saving open space, and developing existing urban space. In the 1970s, 9F. Krausmann et al., \u201cGrowth in Global Materials Use, GDP and Population During the 20th Century,\u201d Ecological Economics 68.10 (2009): 2696\u2013705. 23.3 Moving Toward Sustainable Communities 579 Oregon passed a land-use law requiring every city to set a boundary beyond which urban growth is prohibited; beyond that boundary line, expected future growth must be controlled. Some states are enacting programs to acquire crucial remaining open spaces. Maryland\u2019s Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation initiative includes measures to channel new growth to community sites where key infrastructure is already in place. Abandoned and brownfield sites in metropolitan areas are already well served with roads, electricity, water, and sewerage and can be developed into communities with new homes, workplaces, and shopping areas (Chapter 22) . Creating New Towns. One key to developing sustainable communities is to ensure that zoning laws allow the integration of stores, light industries, professional offices, and higher-density housing. Affordable and attractive housing can be built around industrial parks and shopping malls for the people who work and shop in those places. Safe bicycle and pedestrian access can be provided between residential areas and workplaces. In the 1960s, several new, self-contained communities were established along these lines, including Reston, Virginia; Columbia, Maryland; and Valencia, California. Today these communities are still highly desirable as business and residential locations. By contrast, almost 100% of Fairfax County, Virginia (next to Washington, DC), is now covered by sprawl-type development. It is estimated that if Fairfax had pursued smart-growth policies, 70% of the county would still be open space, and the county would be far less congested and polluted. Redesigning Suburbia. The recession and its accompanying impacts on suburbs have created a unique opportunity to redevelop suburbs in more desirable patterns. A recent survey found that most Americans prefer a walkable neighborhood to a large house; this is especially true of Baby Boomers (now largely empty nesters) and many Millennials (people in their 20s and 30s), who are looking for places where they can socialize. 10 Planners and developers are looking at what can be done to abandoned malls and poorly designed suburban streets and roadways to convert them to more desirable neighborhoods with village centers, greenery, and places to walk. 11", "For example, a 100-acre mall in Lakewood, Colorado, has been replaced with 22 blocks of green buildings and public streets, creating a real downtown for the suburban town. Figure 23\u201314 Livable cities. Livable cities provide heterogeneity of residences, businesses, and stores and keep layouts on a human dimension so that people can meet over coffee or stroll through an open area. In short, the space is designed for people. Shown here is Quincy Market, Boston. Figure 23\u201315 Bicycles in Tokyo. Most people in Tokyo do not own automobiles and instead ride bicycles or walk to stations from which they take fast, inexpensive subways to reach their destinations. Tokyo residents own more than 9 million bicycles. Making Cities Livable Looking to the future, the only way to sustain the global population is by having livable, resource-efficient cities (Figure 23\u201314) . Livability is a general concept based on people\u2019s response to the question \u201cDo you like living here, or would you rather live somewhere else?\u201d Crime, pollution, and recreational, cultural, and professional opportunities, as well as many other social and environmental factors, are summed up in the subjective answer to that question. No one wants to, or should be required to, live in the conditions that have come to typify urban blight and urban slums or even to live in new buildings that are densely residential but don\u2019t provide neighborhoods or allow mixed use. Looking at livable cities around the world, we find that common denominators include the following: 10Belden Russonello and Stewart LLC, \u201cThe 2011 Community Preference Survey: What Americans Are Looking for When Deciding Where to Live,\u201d March 2011, www.Brspoll.com, Washington, DC. 11Ellen Dunham-Jones and June Williamson, Suburbia: Urban Design Solutions for Redesigning Suburbs. (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2011); and Galina Tachieva, Sprawl Repair Manual (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2010). Many Japanese cities are highly livable even though they are densely populated. Japan\u2019s cities have maintained a heterogeneous urban structure that mixes small shops, professional offices, and residences in such a way that a large portion of the population is able to take trains, walk, or bike rather than drive. Japan has an estimated 72 million bicycles. In Tokyo, millions of people ride bicycles (Figure 23\u201315) , either all the way to work or to subway stations from which they catch fast, efficient trains to their destinations. Curitiba, Brazil, with a population of 1.6 million, is cited as the most livable city in all of Latin America (see Sustainability, Curitiba, Brazil\u2014City Planning Meets Growth). The city has a number of features that make it livable, especially its public transportation, parks, and green spaces. Coordinated Planning The key to sustainable urban life is planning. City planners must consider a broad range of topics, including finance and economic development, housing, energy systems, transportation, water supply, solid waste management, and adaptation for climate change. As we saw elsewhere, solving multiple problems at once (planning for co-benefits) allows resources to be used more efficiently. Green Buildings and Energy Efficiency. Think of rooftops covered in solar panels, and green structures designed to use passive solar. The development of green buildings and the use of alternative energy are central to sustainable cities. Cities use a great deal of energy to heat and cool buildings, most of which are privately owned, so cities often have to partner with the private sector to encourage green buildings. 23.3 Moving Toward Sustainable Communities 581 Figure 23\u201316 A very green building. The Bullitt Center in Seattle, Washington, was built using certified sustainable wood. Among other innovative features, a photovoltaic panel that hangs over the roof and geothermal technology provide the power used by the building. The floor-to-ceiling windows provide natural lighting for workers and can be opened to ventilate the building. When the Bullitt Center in Seattle, Washington, opened in 2013, it was called the world\u2019s greenest commercial building. Designed to last for 250 years, the six-story building captures rainwater, is powered by geothermal energy and solar panels, has its own systems for processing water and sewage, and is carbon- and energy-neutral ( Figure 23\u201316) . The efficient use of energy is another key to sustainable cities. To increase energy efficiency, cities may build power plants that use waste to generate electricity, while also producing heat for homes and businesses (see Chapter 21) . Transportation. The world\u2019s most livable and sustainable cities have taken measures to reduce outward sprawl, diminish automobile traffic, and improve access by foot and bicycle in conjunction with mass transit.", "Such changes require coordination and planning. For example, Geneva, Switzerland, prohibits automobile parking at workplaces in the city\u2019s center, forcing commuters to use its excellent public transportation system. Copenhagen bans all on-street parking in its downtown core, and Paris has removed 200,000 parking spaces from its downtown. Among the large cities in developed countries, Amsterdam holds the record for biking: the city\u2019s policies are so supportive of biking that fully 38% of the trips within the city are made on bicycles. Water Use. City planners must also address issues related to the supply and use of water. Many cities face significant problems related to aging water pipes and other parts of their water infrastructure. Leaking pipes can waste tremendous amounts of water. In Mexico City, for example, the 1,000 kilometers of main pipes and 12,000 kilometers of secondary pipes leak 11 cubic meters of water per second (347 billion liters per year); these leaking pipes waste as much water as some of the world\u2019s largest cities use. This loss of water is a significant problem for a city that is experiencing drought. To compensate, the groundwater around the city is being over-pumped; unfortunately, this over-pumping causes the ground to sink, which in turn breaks water pipes. Leaking pipes are also a health hazard: In places where both water and sewage pipes leak, sewage may seep into the water pipes and contaminate drinking water. In order to solve its water problems, Mexico City will need to pump less water, coordinate the more efficient use of water, and replace the broken pipes and infrastructure. Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has become a global hub for water planning. In 2009, the city joined the UN Global Compact Cities Program in a project that uses technology to manage limited freshwater resources. Milwaukee also houses the Global Water Center, a hub for water education, research, and innovation. Companies at the center are involved in developing products and processes such as permeable paving that allows water filtration, systems to control the runoff of water from green roofs, and the use of algae to process wastewater. Adapting to Climate Change. One of the critical jobs of city planners is to help cities prepare for future changes, including the conditions that are expected to accompany global climate change. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities are in coastal deltas, making them vulnerable to rising sea levels. In the future, these cities will need to find solutions to the problems caused by higher sea levels and increasingly severe storms. Rising temperatures will be a particular challenge for cities. Why? The people, buildings, factories, and vehicles in a city give off heat, while the dark surfaces of buildings and roadways absorb solar energy during the day and release it slowly at night, forming a pocket of hot air over the city. As a result, cities are usually 3\u20138\u00ba Celsius hotter than surrounding areas, a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect ( Figure 23\u201317) . During hot weather, this excess heat can be a serious health hazard. To reduce the heat island effect, cities can set aside parks and green spaces, plant trees, encourage people to grow plants on the roofs of buildings, increase the reflectivity of surfaces by painting them light colors, and use energy sources more efficiently. Data-Based Decisions. City planners rely on data to make decisions about how to concentrate growth and use resources efficiently. City managers can use big data and cloud computing to build smarter transportation systems, control electrical grids, coordinate waste disposal, and manage emergency responses. Data-driven technologies are also helping to make cities more sustainable. For example, BigBelly Solar produces solar-powered trash compactors that are used for waste disposal in public areas. These compactors detect their own fullness and signal a need to be emptied, so waste managers do not have to make trips to pick up half-full trashcans 23.3 Moving Toward Sustainable Communities 583 or to clean up around trashcans that were too full. The city of London, parts of Los Angeles, and Iowa State University ( Figure 23\u201318) all use BigBelly compactors. Real-time data gathering can also reduce traffic snarls and help solve other problems. However, such tech-heavy approaches may not be appropriate for poorer cities or slum areas. Those places will require solutions that use local labor and provide job opportunities. Portland, Oregon: A Leader in Sustainability The 50 most populous cities in the United States have been ranked for sustainability by the organization SustainLane.", "Criteria for the ranking include transit ridership, street congestion, air and water quality, green building, local food and agriculture, energy and climate change, and green economy. At the top of the ranking was Portland, Oregon, followed by San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, New York, and Boston. 12 Why is Portland at the top of this list? Among other things, the city has taken giant steps to curtail automobile use. The first step was to encircle the city with an urban growth boundary, a line outside of which new development 12Green-City Ranking Group SustainLane Explains Its Methodology,\u201d Grist, May 12, 2008. was prohibited. Thus, compact growth, rather than sprawl, was ensured. Second, the city built an efficient light-rail and bus system, which now carries 45% of all commuters to downtown jobs. (In most U.S. cities, only 10% to 25% of commuters ride public transit systems.) By reducing traffic, Portland was able to convert a former expressway and a huge parking lot into Tom McCall Waterfront Park, a green space that increases the livability of the city. Figure 23\u201318 Solar trash compactors. An Iowa State University student uses a BigBelly solar trash compactor, which will send real-time data to the owner, signaling the best time to pick up trash. Sustainable Communities and Poverty One look at a list of the most sustainable cities would show you that they are usually in wealthy countries. Making the rest of the world\u2019s cities both livable and sustainable will require planning and investment in infrastructure for food systems, sanitation, water, housing, transportation, and energy. According to one estimate, megacities alone will require $10 trillion in investment. It is foolish to believe that we can meet Sustainable Development Goals without investment. That investment may come from foreign aid, nonprofits, or improved trade, but it needs to be provided, particularly if these cities are to avoid the effects of climate change and sea level rise. Making Slums More Livable. Sustainability is particularly difficult in slum areas, but promoting secure housing and employment are two critical parts to the puzzle. People live in fear of bulldozers coming at any time and leveling the shantytown. In Brazil, governments are providing legal status to existing slums (favelas) by granting lawful titles to the land. Peru has undertaken a huge titling program, giving recognition to some 1 million urban land parcels in a four-year period. The people in slums also need more jobs. At little cost, city governments can employ these people to improve their own neighborhoods and other locations\u2014collecting trash, building sewers, composting organic wastes, and growing food. Perhaps the greatest need of people living in the informal neighborhoods of city slums is government representation. Their voices are seldom heard because they are among the poorest and most powerless in a society. In some regions, however, community organizations are emerging to deal with the basic issues of the city slums. People are organizing and demanding their rights as citizens. Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI), which held its first international conference in 2006, now represents these communities to institutions such as city governments and the World Bank. As cities devote resources to providing the essential services and infrastructure to the informal slums that surround them, they will only be strengthened. When a city\u2019s slums become more livable, the entire city becomes more livable. Avoiding Gentrification. In the blighted areas of cities in developed countries, it is important that city revitalization efforts do not come at the expense of low-income housing. In many cities, run-down buildings have been rehabilitated and the surrounding land used for the development of professional buildings and high rises. This process of gentrification causes real-estate prices to rise, often forcing out life-long, low-income residents and breaking up neighborhoods. Maintaining mixed-income neighborhoods is important in a livable city, and improving blighted areas without harming their residents needs to be part of the plan. Making Rural Communities Livable. Planning and investment for rural communities will also be important in the next decades. Some researchers suggest that making rural areas more livable will reduce some of the pressures on rapidly growing urban areas. Investment in a sustainable future must include support for better agricultural practices. It must also provide rural populations with access to health services, education, and opportunities for trade, if that trade helps to produce a more just society. The UN Public Private Alliance for Rural Development promotes partnerships between international agencies and other partners, such as Rotary Clubs and Chambers of Commerce, to promote rural economic improvement.", "The FAO also has a strategic objective to reduce rural poverty and works with rural communities to better the lot of women, improve crop yields, increase employment opportunities, and protect social systems. The Sustainable Communities Movement Revitalizing urban economies and rehabilitating cities requires coordinated efforts on the part of all sectors of society. What is termed a sustainable communities movement is taking root in cities around the United States and elsewhere. Some 106 countries have now developed national sustainable-development strategies that lay out public-policy priorities. In the United States, the Department of Housing and Urban Development sponsors the Sustainable Communities and Development program, providing grants to foster the development of more-livable urban neighborhoods. Groups such as Sustainable Communities Online and Smart Communities Network provide information, help, and case studies, demonstrating that the movement is gaining ground throughout the nation. The 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) created the Commission on Sus tainable Development (Chapter 1), which is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the agreements that were made at the conference. The UN also has a number of initiatives to help cities become more sustainable, including the Global Compact Cities Program and the Sustainable Cities Program. These programs provide financing and support to help cities figure out how to run vast services efficiently, sometimes with few resources. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) is a network of the world\u2019s large city governments. Founded by the former mayor of London and chaired by the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, C40 is committed to addressing climate change. Together, the 75 associated cities account for 25% of the world\u2019s GDP and 12% of the world\u2019s population. The group provides strategic planning and advice for cities to lower their carbon footprints. Supporting City Leaders National and international policies and actions can promote sustainable development. However, cities and larger cooperative regions can improve sustainability even without the support of national governments. Many large cities are larger than small nations. For example, the Tokyo-Yokohama metro-region, with more than 37 million inhabitants, is often listed as the world\u2019s largest \u201ccity.\u201d Tokyo proper has 13 million residents and a budget equivalent to that of the country of Sweden. How cities respond to pressures will depend in part on what citizens tell their leaders, and what directions their leaders take. People who lead large cities, then, can make a huge difference in how sustainable our future is. What are three resources that are available to the head of a megacity in a developing nation? CONCEPT CHECK \u2610\u2713 23.4 Sustainable Lifestyles Sound science, stewardship, and sustainability\u2014these are the guiding principles of how we must live on our planet. Sound science is the basis for our understanding of how the world works and how human systems interact with it; stewardship is the actions and programs that manage natural resources and human well-being for the common good; and sustainability is the practical goal towards which our interactions with the natural world should be working. Are we making progress in incorporating these principles into our society? Human Decisions Our intention in this book has been to avoid dwelling on the bad news and instead to raise the hope that environmental problems can be addressed successfully. Throughout the 23.4 Sustainable Lifestyles 585 text, we have pointed to policies and actions that can help move human affairs in a sustainable direction. To do so requires us to look at causes. As the late Nobel Laureate Henry Kendall said, \u201cEnvironmental problems at root are human, not scientific or technical.\u201d 13 Even though our scientific understanding is incomplete and our grasp of sustainable development is still tentative, we know enough to be able to act in many circumstances. Therefore, it is human decisions that can bring about change, and it is these decisions that define our stewardship relationship with Earth. Being a good steward of resources is not a simple task. Decision making is affected by our personal values and needs, and competing values and needs exist at every turn. Often good values compete. Making decisions means considering competing needs and values and reaching the best conclusion despite the numbing complexity of demands and circumstances. Although public policies at the national and international levels are absolutely essential elements of our success in turning things around, in the end these policies are the outcome of decisions by very human people.", "And even if those in power make thoughtful decisions, their policies will fail unless they are supported by the people who are affected by them. 13Union of Concerned Scientists. Keeping the Earth: Scientific and Religious Perspectives on the Environment, videotape transcript (Pittsburgh, PA: New Wrinkle, 1996) Positive Changes. Here are a few examples of significant changes at the level of governments, municipalities, and industries: The Common Good. At the beginning of this book, we defined the common good in the context of public policy: the improvement of human welfare and the protection of the natural world (Chapter 2). What compels people to act to promote the common good? We can identify a number of values that can be the basis of stewardship and help us in our decisions involving both public policies and personal lifestyles: To achieve sustainability, we will have to couple values like these with the knowledge that can come from our understanding of how the natural world works and what is happening to it as a result of human activities. For this to work, people must be willing to grapple with scientific evidence and basic concepts and to develop a respect for the consensus that scientists have reached in areas of environmental concern. It has been our objective to convey that consensus to you in this text. Recall also that sustainable solutions have to be economically feasible, socially desirable, and ecologically viable. This applies directly to the political decisions that are shaping our future in so many of our environmental concerns. The good news is that many people are engaging environmental problems\u2014working with governments and industries, bringing relief to people in need, and making exactly the kinds of decisions that are needed for effective stewardship. Community groups are organizing around sustainable principles, providing models of larger-scale changes that will be essential if we are to achieve a sustainable world. Traditional environmental organizations, as well as people from other sectors of society, are working together on the many issues that we have highlighted in this text, bringing about policy changes as well as changes in personal lifestyles. Colleges and Universities: Agents of Change. As institutions that train people for a wide variety of future jobs, colleges and universities have unique opportunities to change the world for the better. If they train people to work in more sustainable ways, that impact will be multiplied. Many colleges and universities belong to the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), a network for promoting sustainability initiatives. Colleges often have sustainability initiatives on campus or sustainability coordinators who oversee internships. In addition, many college groups are active in issues related to justice and sustainability. College students who want to make a difference can tap into these opportunities and even be a driving force for positive change ( Figure 23\u201319). Lifestyle Changes What are some of the lifestyle changes that are needed, and are they in fact occurring? We should be encouraged and inspired by the literally millions of people in all walks of life who are making outstanding efforts to bring about solutions. Every pathway toward solutions that we have mentioned represents the work of thousands of dedicated professionals and volunteers, ranging from scientists and engineers to businesspeople, lawyers, and public servants. Figure 23\u201319 Sustainability on campus. An environmental science student at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, helps install solar pan-els on the roof of the science building. Indeed, we are all involved, whether we recognize it or not. Simply by our existence on the planet, every choice we make and action we take\u2014the cars we drive, the products we use, the waste we throw away\u2014has a certain environmental impact and a certain consequence for the future. Therefore, it is not a matter of choosing to have an effect, but a matter of what and how great that effect will be. It is a matter of each of us asking ourselves: Will I be part of the problem or part of the solution? The outcome will depend on how each of us responds to the challenges ahead. As individuals, there are a number of ways we can participate in building a sustainable future:", "Lifestyle choices may involve such things as walking or using a bicycle for short errands; switching to a more fuel-efficient car; recycling paper, cans, and bottles; retrofitting your home with solar energy; starting a backyard garden and composting and recycling food and garden wastes into your soil; choosing low-impact recreation, such as canoeing rather than jet-skiing; and living closer to your workplace. You may even choose to reduce your environmental footprint by living in a tiny house (see Stewardship, Living in Tiny Houses). Political involvement ranges from supporting and voting for particular candidates to expressing your support for particular legislation through letters or phone calls. In effect, you are exercising your citizenship on behalf of the common good. Membership in nongovernmental environmental organizations can enhance both lifestyle changes and political involvement. As a member of an environmental organization, you will receive, and can help disseminate, information that makes you and others more aware of specific environmental problems and things you can do to help. Also, your 23.4 Sustainable Lifestyles 587 membership and contribution serve to support the lobbying efforts of the organization. A lobbyist representing a million-member organization that can follow up with thousands of phone calls and letters (and, ultimately, votes) can have a powerful impact. In cases where enforcement of the existing law has been the weak link, some organizations, such as the Public Interest Research Groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Environmental Defense Fund, have been highly influential in bringing polluters or the government to court to see that the law is upheld. Again, this can be done only with the support of members. Another form of involvement is joining a volunteer organization. Groups that depend on volunteer labor carry out many effective actions that care for people and the environment. Political organizations and virtually all NGOs depend on volunteers. Many helping organizations, such as those dedicated to alleviating hunger and to building homes for needy families ( Figure 23\u201320) , are adept at mobilizing volunteers to accomplish tasks that often fill in the gaps left behind by inadequate public policies. For example, you might be able to assist at a food bank or soup kitchen to help the homeless. Finally, you may choose to devote your career to implementing solutions to environmental problems. Environmental careers go far beyond the traditional occupations of wildlife ranger and park manager. Many lawyers, journalists, teachers, research scientists, engineers, medical personnel, agricultural extension workers, and others are focusing their talents and training on environmental issues. There are opportunites for careers in pollution control, recycling, waste management, ecological restoration, city planning, environmental monitoring and analysis, nonchemical pest control, the production and marketing of organically grown produce, and the manufacture of solar and wind energy components. Some developers concentrate on rehabilitation and the reversal of urban blight. Some engineers are working on the development of pollution-free vehicles to help solve the photochemical smog dilemma of our cities. Indeed, it is difficult to think of a vocation that cannot be directed toward promoting solutions to environmental problems. Figure 23\u201320 Habitat for Humanity volunteer. By using charitable contributions and volunteer labor, Habitat for Humanity creates quality homes\u2014more than 800,000 built or rehabilitated by 2014 that needy fam-ilies can afford to buy with no-interest mortgages, enabling the money to be recycled to build more homes. Prospective homebuyers participate in the construction and may gain valuable skills in the process. Human society is well into a new millennium, and it promises to be an era of rapid changes unprecedented in human history. Will we just survive, or will we thrive and become a sustainable global society? We are engaged in an environmental revolution\u2014a major shift in our worldview and practice from seeing the natural world as resources to be exploited to seeing it as life\u2019s supporting structure that needs our stewardship. You are living in the early stages of this revolution, and we invite you to be one of the many who will make it happen. We close with this quote: No one could make a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little. Edmund Burke, Irish orator, philosopher, and politician (1729\u20131797). How does the common good relate to the need for sustainability?
