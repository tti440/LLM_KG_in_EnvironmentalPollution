{"pubmed_id": "0", "text": ["Circular economy A circular economy is a system which maintains the value of products, materials and resources in the economy for as long as possible, and minimises the generation of waste. This means a system where products are reused, repaired, remanufactured or recycled. Actions on the circular economy also contribute to other key EU priorities, including a green recovery, climate mitigation and energy savings, biodiversity protection, and global efforts on sustainable development. In 2015, the European Commission adopted an ambitious circular economy action plan. It announced 54 measures along the entire lifecycle of products to accelerate EU\u2019s transition towards a circular economy. All these measures have been adopted. Amongst other measures, revised EU legislation on waste entered into force in 2018. It set out clear recycling targets and a long-term plan for modern waste management. This included: targets for recycling of municipal and packaging waste; binding targets to reduce landfill to a maximum limit; measures to reduce food waste and marine litter. Also in 2018 there were further initiatives such as an EU strategy on plastics, a report on critical raw materials in the circular economy, rules on single-use plastics and proposed legislation on minimum requirements for water reuse (adopted in 2020). In March 2020, as a core building block of its 2019 European Green Deal to boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean, circular economy, restore biodiversity and cut pollution, the Commission adopted a new circular economy action plan for the EU. This includes measures to: make sustainable products the norm in the EU; give more power to consumers and public buyers; focus on the sectors that use most resources and where the potential for circularity is high, such as: electronics and ICT, batteries and vehicles, packaging, plastics and textiles, construction and buildings, food, water and nutrients; ensure less waste; make the circular economy work for people, regions and cities; lead global efforts on circular economy."]}

{"pubmed_id": "9", "text": ["EU waste management law | EUR-Lex SUMMARY OF: Directive 2008/98/EC on waste and repealing certain Directives WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE? It establishes a legal framework for treating waste in the European Union (EU). The framework is designed to protect the environment and human health by emphasising the importance of proper waste management, recovery and recycling techniques to reduce pressure on resources and improve their use. KEY POINTS Directive 2008/98/EC The directive establishes a waste hierarchy: - prevention; - preparing for reuse; - recycling; - other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and - disposal. It confirms the \u2018polluter-pays principle\u2019 whereby the original waste producer must pay for the costs of waste management. It introduces the concept of \u2018extended producer responsibility\u2019. It makes a distinction between waste and by-products. Waste management must be carried out without any risk to water, air, soil, plants or animals, without causing a nuisance through noise or smells, or harming the countryside or places of special interest. Producers or holders of waste must treat it themselves or have it handled by an officially recognised operator. Both require a permit and are inspected periodically. Competent national authorities must establish waste-management plans and waste-prevention programmes. Special conditions apply to hazardous waste, waste oils and bio-waste. It introduces recycling and recovery targets to be achieved by 2020 for household waste (50%) and construction and demolition waste (70%). The legislation does not cover certain types of waste such as radioactive elements, decommissioned explosives, faecal matter, waste waters and animal carcasses. Amending Directive (EU) 2018/851 As part of a package of measures on the circular economy, Directive (EU) 2018/851 amends Directive 2008/98/EC. It sets minimum operating requirements for extended producer-responsibility schemes. These can also include organisational responsibility and a responsibility to contribute to waste prevention and to the reusability and recyclability of products. It strengthens rules on waste prevention. On waste generation, EU Member States must take measures to: - support sustainable production and consumption models; - encourage the design, manufacturing and use of products that are resource efficient, durable, reparable, reusable and capable of being upgraded; - target products containing critical raw materials to prevent those materials becoming waste; - encourage the availability of spare parts, instruction manuals, technical information, or other means enabling the repair and re-use of products without compromising their quality and safety; - reduce food-waste generation as a contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to reduce by 50% the per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and to reduce food losses along production and supply chains by 2030; - promote the reduction of the content of hazardous substances in materials and products; - stop the generation of marine litter. It also sets new municipal-waste-recycling targets: by 2025, at least 55% of municipal waste by weight will have to be recycled. This target will rise to 60% by 2030 and 65% by 2035. Member States must: - establish, by 1 January 2025, separate collection of textiles and hazardous waste generated by households; - ensure that, by 31 December 2023, bio-waste is collected separately or recycled at source (for example, by composting). The directive also highlights examples of incentives to apply the waste hierarchy, such as landfill and incineration charges and pay-as-you-throw schemes. FROM WHEN DO THE RULES APPLY? Directive 2008/98/EC had to be transposed into national law by 12 December 2010. Amending Directive (EU) 2018/851 had to be transposed into national law by 5 July 2020. BACKGROUND Waste generation used to be an unavoidable and unfortunate by-product of economic activity and growth. With modern technology and careful management, that cyclical link can be broken. KEY TERMS By-product: A substance or object resulting from a production process the primary aim of which is not the production of that substance or object. The directive sets conditions under which such a substance or object is not to be considered waste. Extended producer-responsibility schemes: A set of measures taken by Member States to ensure that producers of products bear financial responsibility or financial and organisational responsibility for the management of the waste stage of a product\u2019s life cycle.

The association is registered in Belgium and its legal seat is in Brussels, Belgium. IMPEL was set up in 1992 as an informal Network of European regulators and authorities concerned with the implementation and enforcement of environmental law. The Network\u2019s objective is to create the necessary impetus in the European Community to make progress on ensuring a more effective application of environmental legislation. The core of the IMPEL activities concerns awareness raising, capacity building and exchange of information and experiences on implementation, enforcement and international enforcement collaboration as well as promoting and supporting the practicability and enforceability of European environmental legislation. During the previous years IMPEL has developed into a considerable, widely known organisation, being mentioned in a number of EU legislative and policy documents, e.g. the 7th Environment Action Programme and the Recommendation on Minimum Criteria for Environmental Inspections. The expertise and experience of the participants within IMPEL make the network uniquely qualified to work on both technical and regulatory aspects of EU environmental legislation.

Given the clear links between the projects and the fact that both were intending to produce a Guidance Book as their principal outcome, it was agreed that the projects would remain separate but that they would work closely together and hold joint project meetings and a joint workshop.   They would also produce a Combined Guidance Book. The projects had four main components: i. An IED Project Team meeting in Milan, Italy, on 23 and 24 March 2017, at which work was continued on five topics: Inspection tools; definitions; horizontal aspects of permitting; joint inspections; and BAT in Industrial Waste Water. The meeting noted that work had been completed in five working groups, namely: levels of non-compliance; reporting to the public/public participation surveys; dealing with installations closing down/bankruptcy; BREFs/application of BAT; and Self-monitoring and operator reporting.    The Guidance Book would be amended and possibly merged with the guidance from the project on permitting: training material would be developed, which was another priority of the Commission. Comments had been received from the Commission on the Guidance Book including a request that it should be useable as training material.   It was agreed to combine the guidance with that from the project on DTRT Permitting. 4/451 ii. A DTRT Permitting Project Team meeting in Dublin, Ireland, on 9 May 2017.   The meeting agreed on further amendments and modifications for the guidance on DTRT Permitting.   The meeting also agreed that that DTRT-P would be responsible for the framework and content of the guidance. iii. DTRT Permitting Meeting on 21 and 22 June and IED Project Team Meeting on 22 and 23 June in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 22 and 23 June 2017 where it was agreed that the Guidance Book (but not the projects) would be combined.   Ongoing working groups that reported to this meeting included Joint Inspections, Industrial Waste Water, Going beyond BAT, Tools and Horizontal Aspects of Permitting.   Work would continue on the guidance book jointly with DTRT-P who would take on editorial responsibility.   Horst gave a brief presentation on the paper on risk assessment. iv. A joint DTRT Permitting/IED workshop in Lisbon, Portugal on 27 and 28 September 2017.

Purpose of the projects The IED project is intended to help achieve better implementation of the IED.   It has particular regard to permitting, participation of the public, and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental inspections and surveillance through: \u2022 application of risk criteria in a strategic way with a view to assessing, evaluating and mitigating the most serious types of non-compliance with the IED; \u2022 development of best practice examples in the application of BAT conclusions and the compilation of baseline report on soil and ground water contamination; \u2022 optimising the communication with and active dissemination to the public of the results of inspection and surveillance work; \u2022 fostering cooperation and coordination between different inspection and surveillance bodies with a view to streamlining and optimising the use of inspection and surveillance resources; \u2022 development of reaction methods after serious environmental complaints; \u2022 creation and use of electronic records of inspection and surveillance work with a view to enabling the efficiency and effectiveness of such work to be more easily measured and evaluated. The project on Doing the right things for ENV Permitting is a three year project.   In the beginning it sought to compare Environmental permitting procedures and to develop guidance that describes the best practice in Environmental permitting.   This guidance has been combined with the guidance produced for IED Implementation. Although there is much experience in Europe in environmental permitting (first with IPPC and later IED), the permitting procedure has never been described in a step-by-step guidance.   As a result, there is no level playing field for the procedures of environmental permitting, there is no guidance for new permitting officers and there is less cohesion between the IMPEL initiatives on permitting. Doing the right things for ENV permitting will look closely at the relation between permitting and inspection, identify interesting case studies and best practices in Europe and identify and describe the steps that could be used in permitting procedures. 7/451 2. Background to the projects Industrial production processes account for a considerable share of the overall pollution in Europe due to emissions of air pollutants, discharges of waste water and the generation of waste. The Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and the Council (IED) is the main EU instrument regulating pollutant emissions from industrial installations. The IED was adopted on 24 November 2010 and entered into force on 6 January 2011. The IED aims to achieve a high level of protection of human health and the environment taken as a whole by reducing harmful industrial emissions across the EU, in particular through better application of Best Available Techniques (BAT). Around 50,000 installations undertaking the industrial activities listed in Annex I of the IED are required to operate in accordance with a permit (granted by the authorities in the Member States). This permit should contain conditions set in accordance with the principles and provisions of the IED. 2.", "The IED allows competent authorities some flexibility to set less strict emission limit values. This is possible only in specific cases where an assessment shows that achieving the emission levels associated with BAT described in the BAT conclusions would lead to disproportionately higher costs compared to the environmental benefits due to the geographical location or the local environmental conditions or the technical characteristics of the installation. The competent authority is required to document its justification for granting such derogations. Furthermore, Chapter III of the IED on large combustion plants includes certain flexibility instruments (Transitional National Plan, limited lifetime derogation, etc.). 4. The IED contains mandatory requirements on environmental inspections. Member States shall set up a system of environmental inspections and draw up inspection plans accordingly. The IED requires a site visit to take place at least every 1 to 3 years, using risk-based criteria. 5. The IED ensures that the public has a right to participate in the decision-making process, and to be informed of its consequences, by having access to permit applications, permits and the results of the monitoring of releases. . 8/451 An initial IED project was carried out in 2015 and a subsequent project was carried out in 2016.   This subsequent project sought to build on and develop the outcome of the previous project by identifying further areas of the IED where there were challenges for those seeking to implement the directive and by seeking to establish good practice in those areas.   This work has been incorporated into a draft guidance book and has been continued into the project in 2017. The project on Doing the Right Things (Permitting) arose from the fact that although there is a lot of experience in Europe in environmental permitting (first IPPC and later IED), the permitting procedure has never been described in a step-by-step guidance. As a result, there is no level playing field for the procedures of environmental permitting, there is no guidance for new permitting officers and there is less cohesion between the IMPEL initiatives on permitting. Combined Guidance (see Annex 3) Work on developing combined guidance for IED implementation has been carried over the last few months following an agreement at earlier meetings in Ljubljana, Slovenia on 21 and 22 June 2017 that the projects on DTRT Permitting and IED Implementation should bring together relevant aspects of their work. The combined guidance builds on the IED Implementation Guidance Book that had been built up through contributions from IMPEL\u2019s IED Implementation Project and the work carried out by the \u2018Doing the Right Things\u2019 for Permitting Project. The guidance is structured around the regulatory cycle: 9/451 The main structure of this guidance consists of four main parts: 1. Legislation: the general obligations from the Industrial Emissions Directive, written mainly for policy makers; 2. The permitting process: strategic, general and operational steps, written for the permit officer and management; 3. The inspection process: strategic, general and operational steps, written for the inspector and management; 4. Evaluation and feedback: on the legislative process and its implementation, written for all target groups. The main structure of the Combined Guidance is supported by technical \u2018Factsheets\u2019 that address specific areas of IED implementation. The Combined Guidance is already a substantial body of work. The intention is that it will continue to be developed and updated with further outputs from both projects and also other relevant IMPEL projects, for example, IED Baseline Reports. It will be fully cross-referenced to specific articles in the IED legislation. An interactive web-based version is also planned. 10/451 Annexes 11/451 Annex I Terms of Reference IED Implementation TOR Reference No.: 2017-01 Author(s): Horst B\u00fcther / Florin Homorean Version: 1.5 Date: December 2016 TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR WORK UNDER THE AUSPICES OF IMPEL 1.

Outline business case (why this piece of work?) 2.1 Name the legislative driver(s) where they exist (name the Directive, Regulation, etc.)", "Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) BAT Reference Documents and BAT Conclusions Air Quality Directive Seveso III Directive 2.2 Link to IMPEL MASP priority work areas 1. Assist members to implement new legislation 2. Build capacity in member organisations through the IMPEL Review Initiatives 3. Work on \u2018problem areas\u2019 of implementation identified by IMPEL and the European Commission 2.3 Why is this work needed? (Background, motivations, aims, etc.) Industrial production processes account for a considerable share of the overall pollution in Europe due to their emissions of air pollutants, discharges of waste water and the generation of waste. The Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and the Council (IED) is the main EU instrument regulating emissions from industrial installations. The IED aims to achieve a high level of protection of human health and the environment taken as a whole by reducing harmful industrial emissions across the EU, in particular through better application of Best Available Techniques (BAT). Around 50,000 installations undertaking the industrial activities listed in Annex I of the IED are required to operate in accordance with a permit (granted by the authorities in the Member States). This permit should contain conditions set in accordance with the principles and provisions of the IED. The 2014/2015 Implementation Challenge project of IMPEL and consultations with the European Commission identified a lot of unresolved problems in the implementation of industrial regulation. 2017 is the third year in a row of the IMPEL IED Implementation project. It has become a very successful IMPEL activity attracting a lot of environmental officers from numerous European countries. In the last two years, IMPEL has had to raise the budget of the project in order to accommodate this increased interest. This is a clear indicator that there is need for exchange on IED topics between the European competent authorities with responsibility for IED implementation. The IED Implementation project has established itself meanwhile as one of the main long running activities of the IMPEL network. In the last two years, the project team has developed a lot of good practice examples that were put into a specially designed guidance book. This book not only contains guidance from the running project but also from previous and related IMPEL projects dealing with issues of industrial 14/451 regulation. The IED project itself developed in sub-groups good practice examples for the following topics: \u2022 Translation of BAT Associated Emission Levels (AELs) into Emission Limit Values \u2022 Levels of non-compliance; publication of inspection reports \u2022 Bankruptcy and temporary or definitive cessation of activity in IED installations \u2022 Self-monitoring and reporting obligations of the operators \u2022 Tools for regulating IED installations \u2022 Joint inspections \u2022 Definitions [in legislation] \u2022 Horizontal aspects of permitting \u2022 Minimum content of IED inspections \u2022 Feedback from the inspector in the BREF-cycle \u2022 How to check industrial waste water BAT \u2022 Going beyond BAT (application of Article 18). The project team started with these topics because they were regarded as the highest priority issues by the project members. Some of these topics will not be finished in 2016 and shall be developed further in this 2017 project. There are also a lot of other issues that shall be developed to good practice during the 2017 project and in the future (see 2.4). The advantage of a large project group is that the ideas coming from a working group are immediately discussed by environmental officers of different implementation cultures and backgrounds. According to the demands of the member countries and the European Commission, joint inspections have been carried out and will continue to going forward. The results of these inspections will also be included in the guidance book. 2.4 Desired outcome of the work (what do you want to achieve? What will be better / done differently as a result of this project?) A lot of good practice has already been developed by the projects in 2015 and 2016 and put into the guidance book on IED implementation. There are still a lot of issues identified by the Implementation Challenge project, IMPEL member countries, the European Commission, and the project and workshop participants. The identified topics for further developing good practice are: \u2022 Emission limit values (ELVs) \u2013 ambient air quality 15/451 \u2022 Implementation of new BREFs \u2022 Application of BAT within 4 years after publication of BAT conclusions (timetable) \u2022 Making changes to permits \u2013 what is significant change \u2022", "Integrated permits (one stop shop); how to deal with other than normal operating conditions \u2022 Concentration vs. mass emission limits \u2022 Non-routine inspections \u2022 Charging regimes \u2022 Public participation. At every project meeting and during the workshop the IED implementation of the host country/authority is presented and discussed by the project members. This gives a fast and good overview on the approaches in different European countries and is a good addition to the IMPEL IRIs. A general goal of the project is to establish the project team as a core group of the Industry and Air Expert Team and a sustainable cooperation of European enforcement authorities. This includes: improvement of the IED implementation in Europe; raising the percentage of BAT application through common understanding and expert exchange, fast exchange of solutions concerning implementation problems; facilitating implementation; joint inspections; web applications and tools; invited speakers of related projects and activities outside IMPEL; feedback to the COM on implementation of the IED; new ways of identifying implementation gaps. 2.5 Does this project link to any previous or current IMPEL projects? (state which projects and how they are related) Projects dealing with the IED in a broader sense but also the IRIs and the DTRT and easyTools projects are linked to this activity. The results and good practices of former projects dealing with industrial issues are already included in the IED Implementation Guidance Book. The project managers of related projects were invited to the IED workshop in 2015 to give a presentation and discuss how their results could be included into the guidance book. These projects are: \u2022 Derogations from BAT in IED permits \u2022 IED baseline report on soil and ground water contamination 16/451 \u2022 IED and Habitat Directive \u2022 Doing the right things in (IED) permitting \u2022 IPPC and Water Framework Directive \u2022 Air quality and industrial emissions In addition a representative of the Technical Working Group on Inspections of the Seveso Expert Group was also invited to exchange the experiences of these related approaches. 17/451 3. Structure of the proposed activity 3.1 Describe the activities of the proposal (what are you going to do and how?) Guidance and best practice examples that have already been developed in the first 2 years of the project and from other projects will be put into a form that is useful for the guidance book (if that not has already been done). Priority topics from the issues described in 2.4 will be chosen by the project group for the development of solutions and guidance by sub-groups of the project. These topics will also be discussed and developed further during a workshop of the project. Coming from that guidance and best practice examples will be prepared for the IED implementation guidance book. During the project meetings and the workshop the host countries will give a presentation of the IED implementation in their countries. Back to back with the workshop and the project meetings a joint inspection of a small sub-group of the project team will be performed at an industrial installation of the host country. The results of these activities will also be used for the guidance book. Project managers of related projects will also be invited to the workshop to present and discuss the results of their projects. In addition members of the Commission will also be invited to discuss the results of the projects and priority topics of further investigations. 3.2 Describe the products of the proposal (what are you going to produce in terms of output / outcome?) Outputs: \u2022 Guidance book for better implementation of the IED \u2022 Combination of the results with other related projects \u2022 Results from joint inspections \u2022 IMPEL member examples for IED implementation \u2022 Inspection tools \u2022 Minimum extent and resources for IED inspections \u2022 Results from a technical workshop on implementation of EU industrial law. Outcome: Reduction of the IED implementation gap and a level playing field within IMPEL member countries (see also 2.4) 3.3 Describe the milestones of this proposal (how will you know if you are on track to complete the work on time?) 18/451 \u2022 Development of the work program 2017: January/February 2017 \u2022 Work of the sub-groups on not jet finished topics of the 2016 project: Jan/Feb 2017 \u2022 Finalising work program at the first project group meeting:", "March 2017 \u2022 Work of the sub-groups on new topics of the 2017 project: April/May 2017 \u2022 New project groups on further topics at the second project group meeting: June 2017 \u2022 Preparation of the workshop at the second project group meeting: June 2017 \u2022 Joint inspection: back to back with the project group meetings and the workshop \u2022 Workshop: country approach / good practices / related projects: September 2017 \u2022 Development of guidance and good practice examples: until October 2017 19/451 3.4 Risks (what are the potential risks for this project and what actions will be put in place to mitigate these?) The first risk is that only a few countries collaborate within this activity. The new IMPEL strategic approach for actively encourage and support passive members was used to mitigate this risk. The big interest in the project in 2015 and 2016 shows that this is no real risk. The second risk is that only inspectors will be members of the project team and that there will not be enough attention on topics related to permitting. In the 2015 and 2016 IED Implementation project first working groups on BREF application were launched to work on permitting related aspects. The results will invite more permitters to participate in the project The third risk is that outputs of the project are only recognized by a small group of active project members. The new strategic IMPEL approach on communication of IMPEL results shall be used to mitigate this risk (see item 8). 4.

Work type and title: Doing the right things for permitting (second year) 1.1 Identify which Expert Team this needs to go to for initial consideration Industry Waste and TFS Water and land Nature protection Cross-cutting \u2013 tools and approaches - 1.2 Type of work you need funding for Exchange visits Peer reviews (e.g. IRI) Conference Development of tools/guidance Comparison studies Assessing legislation (checklist) 29/451 Other (please describe): training 1.3 Full name of work (enough to fully describe what the work area is) A project to compare Environmental permitting procedures (1st year), to develop guidance that describes the best  practise in Environmental permitting (2nd year), and to train member countries how to use the guidance (3rd year). Focus is on a more general framework using IED permitting as example. 1.4 Abbreviated name of work or project DTRT for ENV permitting 30/451 11. Outline business case (why this piece of work?) 2.1 Name the legislative driver(s) where they exist (name the Directive, Regulation, etc.) Industrial Emission Directive (IED) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 2.2 Link to IMPEL MASP priority work areas 4.", "Assist members to implement new legislation 5. Build capacity in member organisations through the IMPEL Review Initiatives 6. Work on \u2018problem areas\u2019 of implementation identified by IMPEL and the European Commission 2.3 Why is this work needed? (background, motivations, aims, etc.) The Environmental Inspection Cycle is well known within IMPEL. It describes step by step how Environmental inspections should be planned and what to consider when executing the inspections. The Environmental Inspection Cycle is also used by IMPEL as a framework where other IMPEL inspection initiatives can hook up on to create a better cohesion between the tools that are developed. Although there is a lot of experience in Europe in environmental permitting (first IPPC and later IED), the permitting procedure has never been described in a step by step guidance. As a result there is no level playing field for the procedures of environmental permitting, there is no guidance for new permitting officers and there is less cohesion between the IMPEL initiatives on permitting. The proposal of this 3 year project is to: 1) collect and compare the procedures that are used within Europe at this moment and clarify the needs, 2)  based on this information, a project team will develop a guidance that is flexible enough to accommodate the authorities in Europe while issuing permits for the IED,  3) organize training sessions on IED permitting and identify  the gaps in tools and methodologies for issuing permits so new IMPEL projects can be initiated. Doing the right things for ENV permitting will look closely at the relation between permitting and inspection, identify interesting case studies and best practices in Europe and identify and 31/451 describe the steps that could be used in permitting procedures. This document is the Terms of Reference for the second year. 2.4 Desired outcome of the work (what do you want to achieve? What will be better / done differently as a result of this project?) The final outcome of the work is a step by step guidance for permitting, well trained permitting officers and an identification of new IMPEL initiatives for projects on permitting. 2.5 Does this project link to any previous or current IMPEL projects? (state which projects and how they are related) This project links to the Doing the right things project for Environmental Inspections. 12.

The association is registered in Belgium and its legal seat is in Bruxelles, Belgium. IMPEL was set up in 1992 as an informal Network of European regulators and authorities concerned with the implementation and enforcement of environmental law. The Network\u2019s objective is to create the necessary impetus in the European Community to make progress on ensuring a more effective application of environmental legislation. The core of the IMPEL activities concerns awareness raising, capacity building and exchange of information and experiences on implementation, enforcement and international enforcement collaboration as well as promoting and supporting the practicability and enforceability of European environmental legislation. During the previous years, IMPEL has developed into a considerable, widely known organisation, being mentioned in a number of EU legislative and policy documents, e.g. the 6th Environment Action Programme and the Recommendation on Minimum Criteria for Environmental Inspections. The expertise and experience of the participants within IMPEL make the network uniquely qualified to work on both technical and regulatory aspects of EU environmental legislation. Information on the IMPEL Network is also available through its website at www.impel.eu. 41/451 Table of contents Table of contents ............................................................................................................................................ 41 Introduction ................................................................................................................................................... 45 Scope and purpose of the guidance ................................................................................................................ 45 Main structure ................................................................................................................................................ 46 PART 1.

It describes step by step how Environmental inspections should be planned and what to consider when undertaking  inspections. The Environmental Inspection Cycle is also used by IMPEL as a framework for integrating other IMPEL inspection initiatives, creating  better cohesion between the tools that are developed. Although there is a lot of experience in Europe in environmental permitting (first IPPC and later IED), the permitting procedure has never been described in a step-by-step guidance. As a result there is no level playing field for the procedures of environmental permitting, there is no guidance for new permitting officers and there is less cohesion between the IMPEL initiatives on permitting. The document that is now in front of you is a combined guidance for permitting and inspection. Scope and purpose of the guidance Although we strongly believe that this guidance can be used broadly we do focus on permitting and inspection in relation to the implementation of the Industrial Emission Directive (IED). To explain this we use the regulatory cycle as shown in fig 1. The Regulatory Cycle is used to assist government agencies in charge of regulating the impact to the environment and to develop strategies. It helps them, to work systematically towards a permitting,  compliance and enforcement programme that will include structured feedback. Figure 1 shows the sequential steps. Activities within these steps are interrelated, and a missing or underdeveloped step immediately affects the step that follow. For example, inadequate permitting affects inspection and enforcement actions. Inspections are only effective if permitting can be used as a proper starting mechanism. Compliance checking and monitoring are only effective if an inspection system is in place and the consequences of non-compliance can be adequately addressed in the follow-up activities. When there are non- enforceable regulations or permit conditions in place, feedback may lead to adjustments in the legal framework or in the permit conditions to make them more enforceable. Policy planning Legislation Implementation Goals & Objectives Evaluation and 46/451 In this guidance we will only cover the steps: Legislation; Implementation; and Evaluation and feedback. The implementation step represents Permitting and Inspection. The guidance should be used in combination with the technical guidance from the European Commission that are already in place (and the formal/ informal Expert Groups), and the guidance already in place/ under development in your country. The guidance is written for inspectors, permit writers, their management but also for policy makers. Main structure The main structure of this guidance consists of the following 4 parts. 1. The first part is about legislation, it contains the general obligations from the Industrial Emissions Directive and is written for the policy makers; 2. The second part is about the permitting process, it contains a strategic, general and operational steps and is written for the permit officer and his or her management; 3. The third part is about the inspection process, this also contains a strategic, general and operational steps and is written for the inspector and his or her management; 4. The fourth part is about evaluation and feedback on the legislative process and its implementation and is written for the all target groups mentioned above. The 4 parts present the main body of this guidance. They can be seen as stepping stones to direct you to more detailed information that can be found in the linked factsheets, best practices and related IMPEL reports. Within part 2 and 3 you will also find operational and strategic cycles and corresponding steps. To keep the guidance readable we did our best to keep the mail body of this guidance as short as possible. Enjoy reading ! Part 4 Part 3 Part 2 Part 1 Permitting Inspection Compl. ass.

Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU The Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and the Council (IED) is the main EU instrument regulating pollutant emissions from industrial installations. The IED was adopted on 24 November 2010 and entered into force on 6 January 2011. 1.1.", "Introduction The IED aims to achieve a high level of protection of human health and the environment taken as a whole by reducing harmful industrial emissions across the EU, in particular through better application of Best Available Techniques (BAT).   Around 50,000 installations undertaking the industrial activities listed in Annex I of the IED are required to operate in accordance with a permit (granted by the authorities in the Member States). This permit should contain conditions set in accordance with the principles and provisions of the IED. The IED is the successor of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive. 1.2. IED principles The IED is based on the following principles: \u2022 An integrated approach: in which the regulation of installations takes into account environmental impacts as a whole including emissions to air, water and land, generation of waste, use of raw materials, energy efficiency, noise, prevention of accidents, and restoration of the site upon closure. \u2022 Best available techniques (BAT): where the permitting of installations and emission limit values are based on agreed BAT Conclusions and BAT Reference Documents (known as BREFs) published by the European Commission. \u2022 Flexibility: by allowing the licensing authorities to set less strict emission limit values in specific cases where an assessment shows that the achievement of emission levels associated with BAT as described in the BAT conclusions would lead to disproportionately higher costs compared to the environmental benefits due to     geographical location or the local environmental conditions or the technical characteristics of the installation. \u2022 A system for environmental inspections: where Member States must set up a system of environmental inspections and draw up inspection plans. Site visits have to take place at least every 1 to 3 years, using risk-based criteria. \u2022 Public participation: in decision-making and being informed of its consequences by having access to permit applications, the issued permits, the results of the monitoring of releases and the inspection actions that have been executed 1.3. IED implementation arrangements 50/451 The IED makes provisions for the establishment of two groups involving representatives from Member States to support the implementation of the IED. These are: \u2022 The IED Article 13 Forum: a formal expert group set up to exchange of information between Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and the Commission. The focus of this group is to review and form an opinion on the proposed content of the BAT reference documents. \u2022 The IED Article 75 Committee: a formal Committee set up to assist the Commission by  delivering  opinions on implementing acts, including guidance on the collection of data and on the drawing up of BAT reference documents and on their quality assurance, BAT conclusions, implementing rules for large combustion plants  and the type, format and frequency of reporting by Member States. \u2022 The Industrial Emissions Expert Group (IEEG): An informal group established to facilitate the exchange of experiences and good practices concerning interpretation, transposition and implementation of the IED, and to advise the Commission during the preparation of delegated acts. 1.4.

Enforcement Policy planning Permitting Legislation Evaluation and Feedback 53/451 2. Permitting cycle The structure can best be explained by first focussing on the Strategic cycle. The strategic cycle is for the managers. The first step here is the Context. In the Context we identify and describe the information that is needed to set the policy and the right priorities (step 2) and define our strategies (step 3). Based on these 3 steps we can prepare a well-balanced workload plan for the permit writer. The operational cycle is based on Plan Do Check Act Cycle (PDCA). First step is preparing a plan for the workload of the permit writer (see strategic cycle above). Based on this plan we make sure all conditions are met to execute this work (Permitting Framework). Next step is the execution of this work (Permitting procedure, see next paragraph). Last step is the monitoring. Here we check if targets in the plan are met and if we need to make changes in the Planning step. In the Permitting procedure the actual permitting takes place.", "Although the steps in this part are presented linear (with a clear beginning and an end) in most cases (especially with the IED) when the permit is granted there will be a moment in time the permit needs to be reviewed and possibly revised. The target groups we address are: \u2022 Strategic cycle: managers \u2022 Operational cycle: permit writers \u2022 Permitting procedure: Permit writers and inspectors It\u2019s good practise that a permit writer and the inspector understands what is happening in the strategic part. Operational cycle Permitting procedure Planning Monitoring Permitting Framework Strategic cycle Priorities Strategy Context Planning Access to justice Decision making Application 54/451 3. Strategic (permitting) cycle Describing the context is a first step of the systematic approach for developing a work plan for permitting and a necessary input for setting policies, priorities and strategies. An inventory of the context within which the authority has to operate is vital to define its activities and sets the scope of the work plan. See chapter 3.1. The second step is \u201cPriorities\u201d. Setting priorities is necessary when first in, first out is not an option and to make best use of resources available. See chapter 3.2. The third step is \u201cStrategies\u201d. Strategy should be seen a method or plan chosen to achieve the desired goals and objectives that have been set by either national level or your own organisation. It will contain all kinds of actions that will contribute to these achievements. See chapter 3.3. The fourth step is \u201cPlanning\u201d. In this step the work plan for permitting is developed and will include the priorities, the strategies and the activities that will be carried out within the defined time period. In contrast to inspection plans, the work plan for permitting is not mandatory by the IED. It\u2019s therefor also not mandatory to actively publish the plan. However we do encourage authorities to develop such a plan and make this publically available. See chapter 3.4. Strategic cycle Priorities Strategy Context Planning 55/451 3.1. Context Describing the context is a first step of the systematic approach for developing a work plan for permitting and a necessary input for setting policies, priorities and strategies. An inventory of the context within which the authority has to operate is vital to define its activities and sets the scope of the work plan. This scope is normally identified by elements such as the general mission and objectives of the authority and in particular its statutory tasks and competences. It is important to keep in mind that the authority is also bound to national, regional or local policies, which are established by others. Furthermore the authority may want to take into consideration particular opinions expressed by the general public, NGO\u2019s, industry or other stakeholders. On a more detailed level, information about companies and installations that fall under the competence of the authority concerned can be gathered, including data on their environmental impact; permit situation, compliance behaviour etc. Part of this information is collected through the execution of inspection activities. This data is also assessed in the process of monitoring. The data that is gathered in this step is used for setting policies and priorities as outlined in the next step. For inspectors this first step is almost identical. It\u2019s therefor strongly advised to exchange information and look for cooperation between permit writers and inspectors. 3.1.1. Identifying the scope This element is about identifying the areas and activities that should be looked at in the further stages of the planning process and sets the scope of the working plan. Together with the element \u201cinformation gathering\u201d (section 3.1.2) it provides the input for setting priorities. Issues that are relevant here are for example: the geographic area; goals and objectives of the authority; and the statutory tasks and competences. For a full list of all relevant issues see fact sheet 2.01. 3.1.2. Information gathering This element is about collecting more detailed information on the areas that are identified in section 3.1.1 and are needed to prioritise the work load and develop a work plan for permitting. Issues that are relevant here are for example: data on the (local) environment; technical data on the IED installations in the controlled area; the permit situation of these installations; and upcoming changes in legislations and BAT conclusions. For a full list of all the relevant issues see fact sheet 2.01. See Factsheet 2.01 See Factsheet 2.01 56/451 3.2. Priorities In this step we look at priorities.", "Setting priorities is necessary in case we do not have enough resources and first in, first out is not an option for different kind of reasons. Permitting Departments are responsible for a range of tasks which directly or indirectly relate to permitting. Available staff do not always provide for the operation of a first in first out application completion method. Where a first in first out method is not feasible a prioritisation model is required. The aim of a prioritisation model is to identify the factors which influence the prioritisation of permit applications. These factors can then be used to rank permit applications received and those due to be received within the upcoming year. The figure below is an example of a working set of prioritisation factors for permit applications. This model can be used as a starting point, however, due to variations across IMPEL Member countries these factors should be tailored to ensure relevance. Permit writer resources Green or significant investment Client and third party demands Enforcement priority site Policy drivers Revenue Age of the application Statutory deadline/ infringement risk Environmental outcome A B C D E F G H 57/451 In random order: a) Environmental Outcome: In some cases installations may be negatively impacting the environment due to e.g. historic contamination or current emissions. Inspection authorities bodies may wish to regulate activities at an installation that may be causing issues locally or perhaps the installation needs to be closed in a regulated manner. b) Green or significant Investments: There may be a requirement nationally for a particular economic sector or emerging industry type to be given a priority where investments have been made in order to get these industries operational. c) Statutory deadline/infringement risk: Applications may need to be prioritised where they have links to statutory deadlines (e.g. implementation of Commission Implementing Decisions relating to BAT conclusions), known infringements, any complaints being made to the Commission, petitions from the European Parliament, queries from MEPS or reports being submitted to the Commission which point to infringements of Community environmental law. Applications should be prioritised to ensure the risk of infringement is reduced. d) Client and third party demand: Regulatory bodies may have a history of on-going communication with various clients and third parties. As a means of optimising stakeholder focus specific applications may need to be prioritised. e) Revenue: It may be the case that applications which have higher fees are a priority depending on the financial climate of the regulatory body. f) Policy drivers: Overall organisation policies require consideration in addition to local enforcement and permitting policies. National policies should also be considered e.g. circular economy, climate, greenhouse gases and national emission ceilings. g) Age of the Application: If for any reason a permit application has not been progressed for an extended period of time it may need to be prioritised in order to ensure the information within the application remains relevant. Abandonment procedures may need to be progressed in some instances. h) Enforcement Priority Sites: the Permitting Department should formalise a means of communication with the Permit Enforcement Department. This should ensure that enforcement staff relay their priorities with regard to specific installations and the justification for their prioritisation requirement. Once the prioritisation model has been decided and agreed by management it can used to assess the current staffing level versus the permit applications which have been submitted and applications due to be submitted in the following year. This will enable permitting managers to allocate permit applications to permit writers with a justified priority ranking as part of the annual working plan for permitting. It is important to note that this approach requires a certain degree of flexibility as factors which influence prioritisation of permit applications may change over the course of the year. 58/451 3.3. Strategy In this step we look at strategy. Strategy should be seen a method or plan chosen to achieve the desired goals and objectives that have been set by either national level or your own organisation. It will contain all kinds of actions that will contribute to these achievements. The issues addressed in this section are not limited and more issues could be added Applying BAT The way permit conditions are set is by referencing the BAT conclusions, national guidelines, or by following national legislation.", "However the competent authority has the power to deviate from BAT conclusions as long as the performance levels i.e. the BAT AELs are met Derogations (setting less stricter ELV\u2019s than BAT AEL) are open to appeal in court and competent authorities should be able to defend this. The submitted EIA can also play an important role when defining the permit conditions. See fact sheet 2.02. Reviewing existing permits: According to article 21 of the IED the competent authority has to reconsider or review all permit conditions, and where necessary to update these permit conditions. When reconsidering permit conditions, the competent authority shall use any information resulting from monitoring or inspections. The IED also sets a timeframe of 4 years after the publication of BAT conclusions. See fact sheet 03 reviewing existing permits for answers to questions about reviewing of permits. Objectives or targets for certain companies or industrial sectors These objectives and targets that need to be reached are laid down in national legislation or in regional plans (e.g. air quality plan, action plans for noise reduction). Typical objectives or targets are set for air quality, risk reduction, odour, storm water runoff, waste management, reduction of greenhouse gases and energy efficiency. These objectives or targets should be translated in strategies within the permitting procedure. Some examples are: \u2022 The special requirements from legislation; \u2022 The use of the EIA; \u2022 According to the annual licensing plan; \u2022 Control plan Air Quality; See Factsheet 2.02 See Factsheet 2.03 59/451 \u2022 Industrial plans; \u2022 Special guidelines that have to be followed. Deviation is possible in some circumstances; \u2022 Regional programs for improving Air quality. There is an annual permitting plan which set priorities. Encouraging and facilitating eco-innovations Eco-innovations in terms of development and implementation of completely new processes and techniques leading to significantly improved monitoring, control or reduction of waste or emissions are key to achieving environmental goals and ambitions of Member States. Authorities can within the framework of IED permitting develop strategies and take various (organisational) measures aimed at proactively encouraging and facilitating operators who want to carry through eco-innovations. Relationship permitting and inspection Establishing and encouraging a good level of communication, information exchange and relationship between permit writers and inspectors/enforcers is very important. Not only the quality of the permits will benefit from this, also work can be done more effective and more efficient. There are a number of opportunities the inspector can have a positive involvement in the permitting procedure. Transparency and visibility Public visibility of the application, draft report and permit, submissions, objections and final report and permit. The permit procedure must be fully transparent and allow for public participation. This requirement is stated explicitly in the Industrial Emissions Directive and comes from the Aarhus Convention. Internal and external communication \u2022 Some good practices for internal and external communication are: \u2022 Communication plan that ensures the involvement of various stakeholders in the process; \u2022 Protocols that describes how letters are formally stored and how communication through internet can take place; \u2022 A customer charter, which is published on the website of the competent authority and includes all applicable documents, correspondence and decisions by the competent authority; \u2022 An annual internal communication plan, that includes: media relations, website and intranet, publications, internal communications, internal newsletters, exhibitions, environmental surveys, education etc); \u2022 A national web based communication system for all communication between competent authority and applicants. See Factsheet 2.05 See Factsheet 2.06 See Factsheet 2.04 60/451 61/451 3.4. Planning In this last step of the strategic cycle we look at \u201cPlanning\u201d. In this step the work plan for permitting is developed and will include the priorities, the strategies and the activities that will be carried out within the defined time period. In contrast to inspection plans, the work plan for permitting is not mandatory by the IED. It\u2019s therefor also not mandatory to actively publish the plan. However we do encourage authorities to develop such a plan and make this publically available. Annual work plan for permitting Benefits and opportunities of an annual work plan are: \u2022 It is a management tool for the organisation.", "It gives guidance for the desk officers (it is important for them to know the amount of work that is planned, time pressure); \u2022 It presents de the priorities (dividing time between important and less important issues); \u2022 Annual plan can be internal (practical) and external (communication tool); \u2022 Annual plan can help implement the national environmental action plan; \u2022 Input from inspection colleagues can present opportunities to identify priorities and outcomes; \u2022 Factors that will influence the annual plan are: priorities from inspection colleagues; \u2022 Age of application; economics. Issues of importance: A working plan needs some form of flexibility. \u2022 Changing of plan because of changing priorities \u2022 Influence of political priorities \u2022 Changing legislation; \u2022 The way objectives on environmental outcomes play a role in setting priorities is difficult; \u2022 Focussing on environmental outcomes might be too high level for day to day work of permit writer; \u2022 Environmental outcomes already have their place in specific policy and legislation, The way objectives on environmental outcomes play a role in setting priorities is difficult; \u2022 Focussing on environmental outcomes might be too high level for day to day work of permit writer; \u2022 Environmental outcomes already have their place in specific policy and legislation. Data needed for planning could be collected through: \u2022 pre-consultation (or pre-application discussion); \u2022 number of permits with expired period; \u2022 revision needed because of adoption BAT conclusions; \u2022 based on permitting statistics in the past and inspection data. Working plans could contain the following information: 62/451 \u2022 Multi-annual IED evaluations, taking into account  the publication of the BAT conclusions; \u2022 Permits on hand and permits that can be expected which will be progressed and finalised during the year. Reviews of existing permits; \u2022 The plan also contains other work commitments assigned to permitting staff; \u2022 The human, financial and other resources that are necessary and need to allocated; \u2022 Priorities that have been set; \u2022 Key data on time spend on the different types of applications. Estimations on how much time is needed could be based on the average number of applications in the last 5 years, the knowledge of new applications that can be expected and, the knowledge of changes in legislation that can occur. Further we need to address that an annual working plan for new installations is sometimes difficult or not  possible. The annual work plan is to ensure that we reach our targets. There is not always a relation between budget and targets to be reached. Allocation of staff can be a solution. Input from lawyers and specialist should be part of the work plan. In case lawyers and specialist are not part of the same organisation a Service Level agreement could be helpful. A work plan for permitting is not (yet) mandatory and are often set up based on the planning of the revision of the BREFs. Publication of the work plan is also an issue we need to address) Time allocation Time required for the procedures and the maintenance of permits. Time spend depends on the quality of the application, the complexity of the activity, the need for further information from the applicant and the possible effect of public participation. In most cases the time frames are set by law and need to be respected. Flexibility in a plan is necessary. You have to be sure the organisation can adapt to changes 63/451 4. Operational (permitting) cycle In this step the work plan for permitting is developed and will include the priorities, the strategies and the activities that will be carried out within the defined time period. In contrast to inspection plans, the work plan for permitting is not mandatory by the IED. It\u2019s therefor also not mandatory to actively publish the plan. However we do encourage authorities to develop such a plan and make this publically available. The second step is \u201cPermitting Framework\u201d. In this step we make sure all necessary conditions are met so the permitting officers can do  their work in an efficient and effective way. Conditions that are of importance are: education, training, competences, IT solutions, procedures and protocols, manuals and agreements for advise etc. See chapter 4.2. The third step is \u201cPermitting procedure\u201d. In this step the actual permitting work is done. This step includes the submission of the application, decision making and access to justice. See chapter 4.3. The fourth step is \u201cMonitoring\u201d.", "To make sure we meet the objectives we set in our work plan we have to monitor the output (did we carry out the planned activities?) and the outcome (what were the effects of our activities?). This information will be used for reviewing the plans and for reporting to different stakeholders, for instance the minister responsible, parliament, the general public, the European Commission etc. From the \u201cMonitoring\u201d step we return to the \u201cPlanning\u201d step. Based upon the monitoring results but also because of other influences (e.g. changes in the context) the working plan be reviewed and possibly be revised. See chapter 4.4. Operational cycle Permitting procedure Planning Monitoring Permitting framework 64/451 65/451 4.1. Planning In this first step the work plan for permitting is developed and will include the priorities, the strategies and the activities that will be carried out within the defined time period. In contrast to inspection plans, the work plan for permitting is not mandatory by the IED. It\u2019s therefor also not mandatory to actively publish the plan. However we do encourage authorities to develop such a plan and make this publically available. This step is already described in chapter 3.4. 66/451 4.2. Permitting framework The second step is \u201cPermitting Framework\u201d. In this step we make sure all necessary conditions are met so the permitting officers can do  their work in an efficient and effective way. The following conditions should be in place: \u2022 Adequate education and training \u2022 Good guidance \u2022 Agreements on coordination and internal and external advice \u2022 Clear procedures \u2022 Protocols for communication, information management and information exchange \u2022 Clear instructions \u2022 Checklists \u2022 Technical literature \u2022 IT systems for: o Planning o Monitoring procedures o Preparation of permits o Registration of applications, decisions (permits) and appeals \u2022 Means of transport and communication \u2022 Personal safety equipment Ensuring good quality of the work can be done by: \u2022 Making sure national legislation is not hindering the developments in Best Available Techniques; \u2022 The development of national studies on BAT; \u2022 Organising seminars for the permitting division; \u2022 Enhancing the expertise of staff by participation in experts working groups; \u2022 By combining the opinion of other advisory bodies into a joint opinion; \u2022 Working with an authorised person; \u2022 Cooperation with other governmental authorities; \u2022 Improving the skills of the officers by specialisation in a specific part of industry; \u2022 Peer reviewing of the permits, e.g. by a senior member; \u2022 By training permitting officers and inspectors; \u2022 Cooperation between colleagues, e.g. setting up a team with lawyers and different specialists and inspector that have input during the permitting procedure; Following clear procedures while issuing or refusing permits; \u2022 Use of templates and standard text blocks for permit conditions that are maintained and up to date for use; \u2022 Good communication and information exchange between departments and staff; By certification of the permitting procedure; \u2022 Pre-consultation between the competent authority and the operator. 67/451 68/451 4.3. Permitting procedure In this step we look at the \u201cPermitting procedure\u201d. Here the actual permitting work is done. This step includes the submission of the application, decision making and access to justice. 4.3.1. Application Main  steps in this phase are: Access to justice Decision making Application One of the annexes to the application form is the Base-line report on soil and ground water contamination. The report provides the basis for a comparison with the state of contamination upon definitive cessation of activities. See factsheet 2.07 for base-line report The operator takes the initiative because of a new installation or a change of installation. The competent authority can take the initiative in case the permit needs to be changed because BAT conclusions, expired period of permit or changing a legislation. This meeting can be organised or held before the official submission of the application takes place. The legal status of this step differs from country to country. See fact sheet 2.06 on pre-application discussions. It\u2019s advised to make use of standard application forms. These forms can either be mandatory or voluntary for the applicant to be used. In the forms all compulsory information and annexes should be  marked. The forms could be made available on website of the competent authorities and could include a  guidance how to fill in the form. There are good practices with electronic portals to apply for a permit (provided by the authority). Good practice for application forms is also to ensure that they are asking the right questions.", "We have to make sure that  the information asked for is in fact required to make an application determination. Boundaries of installation !! Submission of the application can be done by either registered mail (with a number of hard-copies or CD-ROM) or electronically by email or by a dedicated website or online tool. Optional, the application can first be checked by the competent authority before it is formally submitted). This can be divided in 2 checks, an administrative check (completeness) and a technical check (assessment on quality of the application). Sometimes these are 2 separate steps, sometimes this is part of the same overall assessment. This will help to speed up the assessment of the application, if permit writers are alert to potential weaknesses in applications. See factsheet 2.07 for checking application. Factsheet 2.07 Annexes Initiative Pre- application discussion Application form Submission and intake Checking of application Factsheet 2.08 Factsheet 2.09 69/451 in case the application is declared complete and admissible the applicant is notified by registered letter, by email or by a notification from a dedicated online tool, within a dedicated timeframe. After this the application (either all documents including the annexes or only an abstract) could be published on the website of the CA. The notification could contain the following information: o the statement that application was complete and admissible; o type of permit and procedure; date procedure starts; o information about public participation. o All forms of communication, formal or informal need to be recorded as they influence the evolution of the permit; Public and other stakeholders can be informed about the application through official panels, newspapers, (dedicated) website of the competent authority and/or official electronic gazette. In some cases it\u2019s good practice to send letters to citizens that live within a certain radius of the installation. Other ways of public participation are public hearing or information meeting can also be organised by the competent authority (or the applicant) after the application is considered complete and admissible. Often the application and the annexes will be available for insight by public and interested parties for a dedicated time. The type of procedure is always given by legislation. The following types can be distinguished: o Procedure for a minor change; o Procedure for change of installation; o Procedure for a new installation; o Regular procedure; o Extended procedure. This can be a fixed amount, an amount depending on the scale of the activity or the amount of hours spend on the permit. Fees can be paid in advance (before submitting the application or after it has been declared complete and admissible), or paid afterwards Notification Public partici- pation Type of procedure Fees 4.3.2. Decision making There are legal timeframes between the date the application was submitted and declared complete and admissible and the moment the decision is made. In some cases the permit is considered to be refused in case the timeframe is not met. The main steps in this phase are: 70/451 Environmen tal Impact Assessment Appropriate assessment Advise and consultancy Boundaries of installation In case the installation is classified as an IEA installation an IEA report has to be submitted. In some countries the report has to be written by an authorised person. Screening can be done by the competent authority  or by a special authorities. The same is for the scoping and the evaluation of the report. In some countries the EIA is an integrated part of the application, for some it\u2019s a mandatory step that has to be finished before submitting an application, for others the conditions in the EIA will be part of the permit. In some countries EIA and AA can be joint together in one procedure, in other countries this is not possible. It\u2019s advised to make use of standard application forms. These forms can either be mandatory or voluntary for the applicant to be used. In the forms all compulsory information and annexes should be  marked. The forms could be made available on website of the competent authorities and could include a  guidance how to fill in the form. There are good practices with electronic portals to apply for a permit (provided by the authority). Good practice for application forms is also to ensure that they are asking the right questions.", "We have to make sure that  the information asked for is in fact required to Advise and consultation: Advise could be explained as information that is needed to continue the process, while consultation is more an exchange of information and opinions. In some cases advise can be given by certain staff that is assigned with specialist responsibilities (e.g. EIA, AA, Baseline reports, BREF\u2019s, water, waste, safety, air) and can assist colleagues. For external knowledge and expertise special meetings could be attended that are organised by national or federal level. Consultation starts after the application is sent to the (legal) advisers or to experts (some internal some external, some compulsory) opinions are submitted within a certain timeframe to a commission, case manager, coordinator or permit officer. The following information can be used: Record of complains; incidents and accidents; Inspection reports; Emission data; Previous activities; and for waste installations criminal records could also be acquired. \u2022 There are two strands in defining the boundary of an Installation.   This is defining the technical unit (TU) and identifying any directly associated activities (DAA).   Together these two aspects will allow the boundary of an installation to be determined. See factsheet 2.09 Cost- benefit A key component of Article 15(4) of the IED is the need to undertake an assessment that shows that the achievement of BAT-AELs would lead to disproportionately higher costs compared to the environmental benefits as a result of the criteria laid down in Article 15(4)(a) and (b). Factsheet 2.10 Factsheet 2.11 Access to justice Decision making Application 71/451 Derogations The IED allows competent authorities some flexibility to set less strict emission limit values. This is possible only in specific cases where an assessment shows that achieving the emission levels associated with BAT described in the BAT conclusions would lead to disproportionately higher costs compared to the environmental benefits due to the geographical location or the local environmental conditions or the technical characteristics of the installation. The competent authority is required to document its justification for granting such derogations. The provisions for derogation in the IED can be found in factsheet 2.11. BAT assessment & Setting conditions Setting conditions: Key list of conditions are: See factsheet 2.12 \u2022 Permissible values of emissions into water, air or soil; \u2022 Environmental protection measures and other conditions for the operation of installation; \u2022 Operator's obligations concerning the implementation of monitoring and reporting to the ministry; \u2022 Measures to ensure the maximum level of protection of the environment as a whole. Use of General Binding Rules Use of General Binding Rules: Use of General Binding Rules : GBR apply to all installations and should be resulting from BAT conclusions. GBR should be regularly updated and needs to be BAT proof.   In addition to GBR installation local and specific conditions need to be set. Draft decision An authority should use a standard format for a decision. It should at least include: \u2022 A reference to the opinions and the motivation why they are followed or not followed; \u2022 The conditions for operation; \u2022 The considerations of the competent authority about the conditions; \u2022 The expiration data in case the permit is limited in time. Reasons to refuse or end the permit are: \u2022 When the building permit is refused (only when there is a direct link the environmental permit); \u2022 In case the operation of the establishment (or part of the establishment) has not been taken into use within a certain timeframe (e.g. 3 years); \u2022 In case the installation has been destroyed by fire or explosion Enforceabilit y check An enforceability check is done on the draft permit by the inspector. In case standard conditions are used, the enforceability has already been checked on front. In case of non- standard conditions the enforceability check is done afterwards. Notification The (draft) decision is send to the operator by mail, email or can be downloaded from a dedicated online tool. All involved persons will be informed. The notification can be send by letter, email or notification. Factsheet 2.13 Factsheet 2.12 Public partici- pation The IED ensures that the public has a right to participate in the decision-making process, and to be informed of its consequences, by having access to permit applications, permits and the results of the monitoring of releases. A (draft) decision will be published for a certain timeframe at the regular locations (official boards, newspapers, websites). For more sensitive activities the CA can organise public meetings.", "There are a lot differences between the countries in the procedures for public participation; Some countries publish the application on the website but do not organise meetings. Some publish applications and will organise meetings on request; Some countries also publish the draft decision. Also here some countries do not organise meetings and some only do this on request. Fees See application phase 72/451 4.3.1. Access to justice Main steps in this phase are: Access to justice Decision making Application This is only relevant when the competent authority prepares a draft decision. Reasons to prepare a draft decision are: \u2022 it will help in the negotiation; \u2022 it gives the operator the chance to express his comments and remarks on the draft permit. In some cases only the operator and other governmental organisations are involved in this step. When this step is taken the permitting authority can use the views while writing the final decision. . In principle it should be possible to object against decisions.   A special commission could be  assigned to give advises if the decision should be reconsidered. In principle everybody can object  (also public, NGO\u2019s and neighbours). The form an objection needs to be given could be different per country. There are also differences how to act on an objection. E.g. when the objections comes from an authority the competent authority must come with a solution. When objection is turned down, appeal in court is possible for those that have a direct concern with the activities to which the permit is issued. Appeal is possible for the (Administrative) court and the higher (administrative) court or State court. In most countries all involved parties can appeal (operator, other authorities, directly involved persons, NGO\u2019s). In some cases the appeal suspends the disputed decision, in other cases it doesn\u2019t. Against a decision in appeal in court can be appealed again for the higher court. Judging is done by either the (administrative) court or the higher (administrative) court. Outcome of judging is: \u2022 Rejection of the decision and ask for a new decision by the component authority; Confirm the decision made by the competent authority; \u2022 Court comes with his own decision. Views Objection Appeal Judging 73/451 4.4. Monitoring In this step we look at \u201cMonitoring\u201d. To make sure we meet the objectives we set in our work plan we have to monitor the output (did we issue, review and revise the permits that was planned and we reach good quality) and the outcome (what were the effects of our activities?). Output Execution of (personal) work plan can be checked in house on regular basis and on annual basis by the ministry: \u2022 Elements that can be monitored are: \u2022 Timeframe of the permitting process \u2022 Number of permits issued Outcome Here we should make a relation to monitoring and reporting of environmental quality. 74/451 PART 3.

Inspection cycle The structure can best be explained by first focussing on the Strategic cycle. The strategic cycle are for the managers. The first step here is Describing the context. Here we identify and describe the information that is needed to set the right priorities (step 2) and define our objectives and strategies (step 3). Based on these 3 steps we can prepare the inspection plan. In the operational cycle we see a Plan Do Check Act Cycle (PDCA). First step is preparing an inspection plan (see strategic cycle above). Based on this plan we make sure all conditions are met to execute this work (Execution Framework). Next step is the execution of the inspection, compliance assessment or enforcement. Last step is performance monitoring. Here we check if the inspection targets that are formulated in the plan are met and if we need to make changes in the Planning step. In the step Inspection, compliance assessment and Enforcement the actual work is executed ()actual inspection work (preparation, executions and reporting). Although the steps in this part could be linear (with a clear beginning and an end) in many cases inspection work for a certain object will never stop. This can be because a non-compliance is identified but also because the IED prescribes a certain frequency (based on risk) after which the object needs to be inspected again.", "The target groups we address in part 3 are: \u2022 Strategic inspection cycle: Managers \u2022 Operational inspection cycle: Inspector and managers \u2022 Inspection, Compliance Assessment and Enforcement: Inspectors It\u2019s of course expected from an inspector to understand what is happening in the strategic part. Reporting inspection Preparation General steps Performance Monitoring Inspection Framework Planning Review Inspection, Compl. ass. & Enforcement Strategic steps Setting Priorities Objectives Strategies Describing the context Planning Review 77/451 6. Strategic (inspection) cycle The first step in this cyclic process is \u201cDescribing the context\u201d. Here the inspecting authority looks amongst others at its statutory tasks. This part sets the scope of the inspection plan. In addition to the identification of the scope it is necessary to gather information for performing the risk assessment. The second step is \u201cSetting priorities\u201d. This step starts with an assessment of selected environmental or other risks. The risk assessment will result in a list of installations or activities that are ranked and classified. In this step the priorities are also set. In other words, what installations or activities will get the necessary attention (and how much) and what will not. The output of this step, the listed priorities (for the specified period), is then the input for the next step. The third step is \u201cDefining objectives and strategies\u201d. Within this step the inspecting authority identifies inspection objectives and targets. These objectives and targets can be presented quantitatively and/or qualitatively. When it is clear what we want to achieve we can define or modify the inspection strategies in order to meet these objectives and targets. The output of this step, the objectives, measurable targets and the inspection strategies, will be part of the input of the next step. The fourth step is \u201cPlanning and review\u201d. In this step the inspection plan is developed. The inspection plan covers a defined time period and describes and explains the steps taken in box 1a, 1b and 1c. Part of the inspection plan is the inspection programme. The inspection programme may stand as a working annex to the inspection plan, or as a separate document referenced within the inspection plan. Strategic cycle Setting Priorities Objectives Strategies Describing the context Planning Review 78/451 79/451 6.1. Describing the context Describing the context is a first step of the systematic approach for planning of inspections and a necessary input for identifying and analysing the risks. A full inventory of the context within which the authority has to operate is vital to define its activities and sets the scope of the inspection plan. This scope is normally identified by elements such as the general mission and objectives of the authority and in particular its statutory tasks and competences. It is important to keep in mind that the inspecting authority is also bound to national, regional or local policies, which are established by others. Furthermore an inspectorate may want to take into consideration particular opinions expressed by the general public, NGO\u2019s, industry or other stakeholders. On a more detailed level, information about companies and installations that fall under the competence of the authority concerned can be gathered, including data on their environmental impact; permit situation, compliance behaviour etc. Part of this information is collected through the execution of inspection activities. This data is also assessed in the process of performance monitoring. The data that is gathered in this step is used for carrying out the risk assessment process as outlined in the step priorities. 6.1.1. Identifying the scope This element is about identifying the areas and activities that should be looked at in the further stages of the planning process and sets the scope of the inspection plan. Together with the element \u201cinformation gathering\u201d (section 6.1.2) it provides the input for the risk assessment. The table in Factsheet 3.01 gives a list of all the relevant factors that the inspecting authority may have to consider when making the inventory. 6.1.2. Information gathering This element is about collecting more detailed information that is needed to carry out the risk assessment on the areas and controlled activities/installations that were identified in Section 6.1.1. It provides the input for the risk assessment. In other words information which enables the authority to estimate and weigh the different risks connected to these areas and activities in order to assign priorities to certain areas and activities. See factsheet 3.01 to find the issues that may be relevant to gather information of. Input (information) Risk Assessment (priorities) Output (objectives) See Factsheet 3.01 See Factsheet 3.01 80/451 Input: Output:", "Relevant legislation and regulations, legal obligations to inspect, environmental and other governmental policies, environmental and other assessments, management reports, inspection reports, complaints, data from performance monitoring (box 4), operational complexity and location . Data for the risk assessment. 81/451 6.2. Setting Priorities Setting priorities starts with a risk assessment. The method used for risk assessment should be objective in nature, simple to apply and can differ between inspecting authorities. The information gathered in the previous step will be used as input. The output of the risk assessment are assigned priorities that can be defined as objectives. The main goal of a risk assessment is to prioritize the workload of an inspecting authority. The result of an assessment within the framework of the IED will result in an inspection frequency of site visits of inspection objects. The reason for prioritizing our workload is that inspecting authorities have limited resources (inspectors and finance), which should be distributed among the inspection objects in an accountable way. In a risk-based approach, most inspection effort should be expended on the objects with the highest risks (highest risk first). Limited resources on the one hand and a multitude and variety of statutory tasks, for which they are responsible, on the other, make it necessary to set clear priorities. Priorities are set using the outcome of the risk assessment, which could be a list or an overview of all the identified/selected installations and activities and their respective risks. These installations and activities can on the basis of their assessed risks be classified, for example, in \u2018high risk\u2019, \u2018medium risk\u2019 and \u2018low risk\u2019. In addition the inspection approach for each level can differ: the higher the risk level, the more attention it will get from the inspecting authority. The inspection approach will as a consequence also determine the claim on the available resources, and is therefore equally relevant for the inspection plan and in the inspection schedule. 6.2.1. Risk assessment There are many definitions for the concept \u201cRisk\u201d. For assessing risks of industrial activities we use the following definition: The Risk of an activity in inspection planning is defined as the (potential) impact of the activity on the environment or the human health during periods of non-compliance with the regulations by law or permit conditions. To begin, it is necessary to make some basic assumptions and to define concepts: Risk is a function of the severity of the consequence (the effect) and the probability this consequence will happen: Risk = f (effect, probability) Input (information) Risk Assessment (priorities) Output (objectives) 82/451 * = Risk Effect Probability In this guidebook, Risk is defined as: Effect depends on the source (how powerful is it?) and on the receptor (how vulnerable is it?); What is the impact of the source on the receptor? In this guidebook, effect is represented by Impact Criteria1. Probability is considered to be a function of the level of management, the level of compliance with laws, regulations, permits, attitude, the age of the installation, etc. In this guidebook, probability is represented by Operator Performance Criteria. In this section Impact criteria, Operator Performance Criteria and the methods to determine the risk will be further explained. Because not all the criteria will have an equal importance we also address the topic weighting here. Impact Criteria (IC) To assess the effect, the object is rated against impact criteria. The impact criteria can differ between inspecting authorities and tasks. When assessing the risk for IPPC (IED) installations examples of appropriate impact criteria include for example: Quantity/quality of air pollution; Quantity/quality of water pollution; (Potential) pollution of soil and ground water; Waste production or waste management; Amount of dangerous substances released or present; Local nuisance (noise, odour). See factsheet 3.02 for a full list of Impact criteria. Please note that in order to account for both the magnitude of the emission and the sensitivity of 1  We realize that in this concept, Impact criteria can also include some probability. * = Risk Effect Probability See Factsheet 3.02 83/451 * = Risk Effect Probability the receptor, you must use 2 impact criteria for that item, e.g. Air: IC1 = amount of the substance that is emitted IC2 = the distance and vulnerability of the surroundings or receptor. Operator Performance Criteria (OPC) Probability is considered to be influenced by the quality of management, the level of compliance with laws, regulations, permits etc., the attitude of the operator, the age of the installation, etc.", "To take this into account, the object can be scored against operator performance criteria, for example: Attitude; Compliance record; The implementation of an environmental management system e.g. EMAS; Age of the installation. Operator performance criteria can influence the risk in a positive way (good compliance) or in a negative way (age of the installation). See factsheet x for a full list of Operator performance criteria. Determination of the risk category Different methods for risk based approach are being used across Europe. These methods can be classified in four groups: Linear Mean Value; Mean Value of Risk and; Maximum Value and the Rule based method. Types first 3 groups work as follow: \u2022 Linear Mean Value: Risk = (C1W1 + C2W2 + \u2026 + CnWn)/n \u2022 Mean Value of Risk: Risk = (C1W1 + C2W2 + \u2026 + CnWn)/n * P \u2022 Maximum value : Inspection frequency = Max(IT1,IT2, \u2026,ITn) Where: C = impact criterion W = weighting factor P = probability of occurrence Max = maximum of IT = inspection task with fixed frequency See Factsheet 3.03 84/451 All systems work either with a database or a spreadsheet within a network or in a stand-alone system. Although most methods and tools are a copy from systems used in other organizations or Member states they all have been tailor made to fit the exact needs of the inspecting authority. There are no good or bad systems. They come with their own advantages and disadvantages. Rule based method (IRAM) The fourth group is the Rule based method, IRAM (Integrated Risk Assessment Method). This method was developed by the IMPEL easyTools project team by combining the advantages of the three methods, while limiting the disadvantages. IRAM also differentiates between impact criteria, probability criteria and risk categories. The scores of the impact criteria are directly linked to the risk categories and therefore to the inspection frequencies, similar to the maximum value method. In the maximum value method a specific inspection task - such as Seveso inspections - induce the highest inspection frequency, but in IRAM the inspection coordinator decides before the start of the assessment how many highest scores of an inspection task are needed to induce the highest inspection frequency. Within IRAM this is called \u201cThe Rule\u201d. The more impact criteria are used for the assessment the higher the number of highest scores that is \u201cnecessary\u201d to induce the highest inspection frequency. This is a clear difference to the mean value methods; the highest scores cannot be levelled out by low scores of other criteria. IRAM Principles \u2022 The inspection frequency is determined by value of the highest score; \u2022 The inspection frequency is reduced by one step, if the set minimum number of highest scores (called \u201cthe Rule\u201d) is not met; \u2022 The inspection frequency can be changed by only one step up or down based on operator performance; \u2022 The higher the sum of scores, the longer the inspection time. See factsheet 3.04 for more details on IRAM. Input: Output: Data for the risk assessment. Assigned priorities. See Factsheet 3.04 85/451 6.3. Defining objectives and strategies Based upon the (assigned) priorities, the inspecting authority sets targets and objectives. In order to establish whether these objectives and targets can be and will be met, the output and the outcome must be monitored. This is generally done by using performance indicators. Examples of performance indicators on outcome that may be useful are: \u2022 The amount of incidents or complaints occurring; \u2022 The level of compliance; \u2022 The actual achievement of reduction targets for certain pollutants or certain risks at the sites that are directly regulated or enforced by the inspection authority; \u2022 Improvement of air, land and water quality through the actions of the inspectorate to improve compliance. The inspecting authority may want to link its objectives with certain inspection strategies to ensure that these objectives can be met in both an effective and efficient manner, causing minimal burdens for the company and the authority. It may furthermore want to adopt and use certain communication strategies for exchanging information internally and with other competent authorities. Subjects that can be addressed are: \u2022 co-operation and information exchange between inspecting organisations and other authorities; \u2022 the character and form of inspection; \u2022 the effect of the operator\u2019s behaviour on the inspection frequency; \u2022 the path of administrative and/or criminal follow-up upon non-compliance, which must be firm, fair and unambiguous in case of non-compliance.", "The term strategy in this document refers to the way objectives are to be reached. 6.3.1. Objectives and measurable targets The priorities that we have set in the previous chapter tell us what activities/installations need our attention. Having set these priorities it is now time to define the objectives and targets. The objectives that we define here should not be confused with the overall goals that inspecting authorities have to take into account as part of the context and that are input for the risk assessment. Input (information) Risk Assessment (priorities) Output (objectives) 86/451 6.3.2. Setting targets on inputs and outputs Over recent years inspectorates have become increasingly interested in steering and assessing their performance. At its most straightforward, an inspectorate can assess its performance against targets on inputs and outputs. Targets on inputs could for example relate to a certain amount of staff time to be allocated to specific supervision activities. Targets on outputs could, for example, relate to the number of site inspections to be carried out, or the number of emission reports to be validated within a certain time period. These indicators help to steer the timely delivery of the planned activities without exceeding the allocated resources. These targets can be periodically adjusted to increase the amount of activity for a set level of resource or to maintain the level of activity against a reduction in available resource. Managing performance against input and output targets in this way encourages an inspectorate to carry out its work in a planned and efficient way. However, that\u2019s not to say that the activities that the inspectorate has chosen to undertake and measure will necessarily be the most effective in terms of achieving Policy or environmental outcomes. Using appropriate input and output targets can be useful but inspection authorities need to recognise the risks and limitations of over- reliance on them. If used without any reference to outcomes they can simply lead to an inspectorate doing ineffective activity more efficiently. See factsheet 3.05 on how targets on outcome should be set. 6.3.3. Strategies Inspection strategies to ensure compliance In order to actually achieve a certain target we need to determine what inspection activities in that particular case have the greatest positive effect on compliance. By doing so we can further determine the resources needed and use our resources in the most effective and efficient way. In many cases a mix of activities is the most appropriate strategy. In some cases however an inspecting authority may be limited in its choices because it is obliged to perform specific inspection activities, based on national legislation. An inspection strategy to help ensure compliance may include: \u2022 specific ways of compliance checking (e.g. certain routine and non-routine inspections, in-depth investigations, verification of self monitoring data), \u2022 specific compliance promotion activities, \u2022 specific approaches and ways to remedy and sanction (repeated) non-compliances. See factsheet 3.06 on how to determine the best inspection strategy. See Factsheet 3.05 See Factsheet 3.06 87/451 Input: Output: Assigned priorities. Objectives and measurable targets and inspection and communication strategies. 88/451 6.4. Planning and review Based upon the previous steps (describing the context, setting priorities and defining objectives and strategies), the inspecting authority should then develop its inspection plan and inspection programme. The inspection plan can be seen as a strategic plan and does not contain operational information (e.g. does not include the planned and type/dates of inspections). The review and revision of the inspection plan is also part of this step. When we continue the process, after step \u201cPerformance monitoring\u201d, we return to this step. Based upon the monitoring and evaluation of the inspection plan (including the inspection programme), it will be reviewed and possibly be revised. 6.4.1. Inspection plan An inspection plan describes: \u2022 The objectives that the Inspecting authority, given its mission and tasks, wants to achieve; \u2022 The policy, environmental, legal, organizational, financial and other relevant conditions under which the inspecting authority has to perform its inspection activities; \u2022 The strategies which the inspecting authority has adopted for performing its inspection activities; \u2022 How priorities with regard to inspection activities are set, taking into account these objectives, conditions and strategies; \u2022 The priorities themselves; \u2022 And the additional items described in Article 23 of the IED. The general public has the right to know what the inspecting authority has planned for the defined period (it should be transparent) and the plan should therefore be available to the public.", "However the inspecting authority may choose to withhold part of the plan (e.g. the Inspection Schedule). This could be typically due to the inclusion of unannounced Inspections or other unannounced enforcement actions which must be without warning in order to be effective. The inspection plan will be used to compile the inspection programme. This programme should include information such as names of installations, dates, type of inspections, inspectors assigned, etc. When developing the inspection plan and inspection programme it is necessary to consider the organisational, human and financial circumstances. Most importantly the inspection plan and the inspection programme should be in balance with the available resources and budgets and should be in line with the organizational structure. See factsheet 3.07 to find the required element for an inspection plan. See Factsheet 3.07 89/451 6.4.2. Review and revision The inspection plan should be reviewed and if necessary revised periodically. In evaluating the success of the inspection plan the inspecting authority should determine the extent to which it achieved the objectives and targets set out in the plan. Where they have not been met the inspecting authority should determine the factors that have impacted on the completion of the tasks. As the inspection plan is a more strategic document it is envisaged that revision may only be required in response to significant changes to policies, significant changing activity in given industrial/work sectors, or other changing situations. However, changes to the plan may also be made as a result of performance monitoring. Where performance targets set are met (or not met), or where efforts expended through the inspection plan have not resulted in the expected improvements to the state of the environment, the authority may also wish to change the inspection plan (e.g. to change the strategy to be employed, the resources to be assigned, or the objectives/targets set). For the revision of the inspection plan the authority should go through the steps in the strategic cycle. When only the inspection programme has to be revised, revision of the entire plan may not be necessary (e.g. where the only change is to the number of planned inspections to be carried out \u2013 i.e. changes in desired output). The inspection programme however will normally change on an annual basis. The requirement to revise and evaluate the implementation of previous plans in order to develop the plan for the coming period is the application of a management systems approach. In defining the priorities and targets within the inspection plan, the inspecting authority should put in place the means to track and evaluate their performance with respect to the plan. The inspection plan should contain the targets to be achieved during the year to allow for ongoing evaluation of activities during the execution of the plan. In addition to the numerical targets inspecting authorities should also consider how they are going to evaluate performance in relation to the priorities that they set in their plans so that the environmental outcome of their activities is checked in addition to the activities themselves. Input: Output: The context, risk assessment, priorities, objectives and measurable targets, inspection and communication strategies and the results of performance monitoring. Inspection plan and inspection programme 90/451 7. Operational (inspection) cycle The first step is \u201cPlanning and review\u201d. In this step the inspection plan is developed. The inspection plan covers a defined time period and describes how and when the inspection tasks  will be executed. Part of the inspection plan is the inspection programme. The inspection programme may stand as a working annex to the inspection plan, or as a separate document referenced within the inspection plan. The second step is \u201cInspection framework\u201d. Before inspections can be executed we have to make sure that all necessary conditions are met. The appropriate working procedures and instructions, powers and competences and equipment should be in place. The third step is \u201cInspection and enforcement\u201d. In this step the inspection work is done. Here the routine and non-routine inspections are executed and reports of findings are written. Data on the inspections that are carried out and their outcomes and follow-up have to be stored in a good accessible database. See operational steps (chapter 8 for more information). The fourth step of the process is \u201cPerformance monitoring\u201d. To make sure we meet our objectives and targets we have to monitor the output (did we carry out the planned activities?) and the outcome (what were the effects of our activities?).", "This information will be used for reviewing the plans and for reporting to different stakeholders, for instance the minister responsible, parliament, the general public, the European Commission etc. From the \u201cPerformance monitoring\u201d step we return to the \u201cPlanning and review\u201d step (box 1d). Based upon the monitoring results but also possible changes in box 1a (describing the context) the inspection plan (including the inspection schedule) will be reviewed and possibly be revised. Operational cycle Performance Monitoring Inspection Framework Planning Review Inspection, Compl. assess &Enforcement 91/451 7.1. Planning and review In this step the inspection plan is developed. The inspection plan covers a defined time period and describes how and when the inspection tasks  will be executed. Part of the inspection plan is the inspection programme. The inspection programme may stand as a working annex to the inspection plan, or as a separate document referenced within the inspection plan. See section 6.4 92/451 7.2. Inspection  Framework The execution framework serves to facilitate the different inspection activities, e.g. compliance checking through site visits, enforcement actions like imposing sanctions, compliance assistance through organising information campaigns etc. Within this step, training, protocols and working instructions are developed and conditions for realisation. This step is necessary to make sure that inspection activities can be executed effectively, efficiently, professionally and consistently. The execution framework should at least cover (in no order of preference): \u2022 Training programme(s) for the inspectors (staff), based on a training needs assessment ; \u2022 Protocols and working instructions for routine inspections; \u2022 Protocols and working instructions for non-routine inspections (how to react to incidents and accidents); \u2022 Procedures for imposing sanctions; \u2022 Development of inspection and enforcement handbooks; \u2022 Protocols for communication with the public (access to information) and with Industry; \u2022 Information management (e.g. information systems) and information exchange (within the organization and with partner organizations); \u2022 Provisions and memorandum of understandings for cooperation with relevant partners (other inspecting authorities); \u2022 Conditions for realisation; \u2022 Clear authorisations and competencies (e.g. legal right of access to site and information); \u2022 All necessary assistance from the operators to carry out any site visits, to take samples and to gather information necessary for the performance of their duties (legalised in legislation); \u2022 System for planning, programming and monitoring; \u2022 Facilities and materials needed (e.g. computers, transport, means of communication); \u2022 Maintenance and calibration of equipment. See factsheet 3.08  on training programme Input: Output: Inspection plan (containing information of step 1a, 1b and 1c) including the inspection programme. Conditions to execute inspections. See Factsheet 3.08 93/451 7.3. Inspection, compliance assessment and enforcement In these steps the inspections, compliance assessment and or enforcement are actually carried out: the various inspection activities (aimed at compliance checking and compliance assistance) are prepared, executed and reported. 7.3.1. Preparation Type of inspection, staff and (safety) equipment The decision on the type of inspection and staff and equipment needed can either be decided on forehand, during the planning stage, or during the preparation of the  inspections. Although the first option is recommended (the time needed for an inspection is very much connected to the type of inspection) the latter could also be necessary because of changing circumstances. In both cases the type of inspection will often be decided by the head of inspectors. He or she should also have an overview of the available and needed resources (human and equipment). See factsheet 3.09 on preparation inspection for the considerations that could be taken into account when deciding on the type of inspection, the staff and equipment needed. Gathering information and data The inspection team should be fully prepared for the inspection. It should therefore gather all the relevant information and data that is available. The preliminary analysis of the collected documentation must enable a better understanding of the production cycle of the plant and its past and current critical points. Furthermore, the analysis of the technical data acquired during the desk study allows to better prepare the checklist and Inspection Agenda that will be used during the site visit. See factsheet 3.09 on preparation inspection for the type of information sources that can help you to prepare your inspection. Reporting Inspection Preparation See Factsheet 3.09 See Factsheet 3.09 94/451 Inspection tools Now a days we see more and more electronic tools that can help the inspector to perform a good inspection. It will reduce the time necessary for preparation and make sure we will not forget important aspects to inspect.", "Although we strongly believe this is the way forward we still need to understand how a good checklist and/or questionnaire is composed. In factsheet 3.09 on preparation of inspection you can find some issues you can take into account. Announce an inspection? In some cases, from a practical point of view, it is worth announcing inspections shortly beforehand it is conducted. These cases are: \u2022 when an inspector has to interview a specific person. This way they are sure the proper person will be available at their convenience; \u2022 when an inspector wants to inspect the (technical) installation. Changes to technical installation will probably not be made that short in advance (because of the investment); \u2022 while inspecting a single-person company; \u2022 when there is a need to have some documentation be prepared for the inspector and this will result in a more efficient inspection. In all other cases it could be argued that (if national legislation allows) unannounced inspections could be preferred. 7.3.2. Inspection Issues to inspect Traditional inspection activities are the (physical) routine (site) inspections, non-routine (site) inspections and investigations of incidents. Many of these activities can and should be executed according to standard protocols and working instructions (that have been developed in the previous step). The cooperation and information exchange with partner organisations is also part of this step. See factsheet 3.10 on inspections that lists the issues that have to be taken into account while executing the inspection. See Factsheet 3.09 See Factsheet 3.10 95/451 Checking Operator self-monitoring report The IED sets requirements and provisions concerning operator self-monitoring and how this is reported to competent authorities as part of the inspection process. The analyse of the report by the inspector is essential for assessing environmental performance and compliance with the conditions set out in environmental permits. See factsheet 3.11 on operator self-monitoring. Level of non-compliance It goes without saying that non-compliances identified during inspections need to be followed up. However in the case of a serious non-compliance an additional inspection has to be executed within 6 months. See factsheet 3.12 on levels of non-compliances. Cessation of operations, bankruptcy and site closure Inspection work isn\u2019t limited to installations that are in operation. In the case of cessation of operation, bankruptcy and site closure the inspector needs to check if actions have been taken to avoid any risk and pollution and to make sure the site of operation is returned to satisfactory state. In factsheet 3.13 guidance is given on the requirements and provisions mentioned in the IED. Information on the inspection activities carried out, their results and their follow up (imposed sanctions) should be stored in an accessible database. 7.3.1. Reporting Reporting should at least cover (in no order of preference) \u2022 Reporting o After a site visit; o Process/ store inspection data; o Evaluation for further actions; o Finalised a.s.a.p. o Keep record of reports; See Factsheet 3.12 See Factsheet 3.11 See Factsheet 3.13 96/451 o Accessible database; o Notified to the operator (within 2 months after an inspection is completed); o Publicly available (within 4 months after an inspection is completed). \u2022 Exchange information with partner organisations The audience of the inspection reports can be broad. Besides the inspectorate and the operator, also other competent authorities, ministries, public and the European Commission could be interested in the results of the inspection. A report should therefore be written in plain language and not too technical. Commercial confidentiality and National security are also issues to take into account before publishing the report. Because of this, it may be considered appropriate to make specific reports excluding these issues available for external use (public). These summary reports could then be used without prejudice if non-compliance leads to a possible court case. Otherwise, the requirement to make a report publicly available within 4 months could easily be passed before while the outcome is being investigated by the inspectorate. See factsheet 3.14 for a further explanation on reporting on inspection findings. Input: Output: Inspection schedule and execution frame work. Inspection activities and the results. See Factsheet 3.14 97/451 7.4. Performance monitoring The inspecting authority should act on the basis of systematic monitoring of the inspection and enforcement process and its result and effects. Performance monitoring is necessary so the inspecting authority can report internally or at national or EU-level and check if objectives and targets have been met. It is important to use meaningful performance indicators to assess the effectiveness of the inspection plan.", "Insight into their effectiveness can help to determine which tools and strategies are working best to ensure compliance and to allow the public and stakeholders to examine whether the inspecting authority is meeting its responsibilities. This monitoring can take place on different levels. On the inspection schedule level, regular monitoring of progress should be carried out in relation to performance indicators (e.g. planned number of inspections vs. actual inspections carried out). This should inform execution of the schedule and may be carried out for example on a six-monthly or quarterly basis. This should also include monitoring of actions taken as result of inspections or complaints e.g. legal notices issued. Performance monitoring should also take place at a higher level in relation to the success of the plan. This could include measurement against plan outcomes, against the objectives and measurable targets (e.g. general environmental improvements, increase in compliance rate), and external reporting of plan outputs/outcomes to national or EU level etc. Performance monitoring should at least cover (in no order of preferences): \u2022 Monitoring o Performance of staff (output) o Monitoring of the results (outcome) \u2022 Accounting for effort, performance results o Annual reports o Report on agreements with other inspecting organisations o Input in the regulatory cycle o Feedback on the results and recommendations \u2022 Comparing and auditing \u2022 External reporting o Available to public o Region and local level to public and National level o National authority to Commission, o Data about staffing and resources o Role and performance in relation to inspection targets o Summary of the inspections carried out o Degree of compliance o Actions taken as result of complaints, accidents and incidents o Actions taken as result of occurrence of non-compliance 98/451 Input: Output: Information on inspection activities and their results. Information for the review of the inspection plan (the outcome) and the inspection schedule (output) and reports for external use. 99/451 PART 4. Evaluation and feedback PART 4 Evaluation and Feedback 100/451 101/451 8. Evaluation and feedback Part 4 of this guidance is about the evaluation and feedback given from practitioners of the (national) authorities competent for the implementation and enforcement to actors and stakeholders in the legislative process. It also concerns the evaluation and exchange of feedback between colleagues. In this last case it can be the inspector giving feedback to the permit writer and the other way around. 8.1. Purpose and aim Feedback mechanism Evaluation and feedback is given on the practicability and enforceability of new and existing legislation. The overall aim is improving the implementation of environmental law. Feedback  can also be used to contribute in achieving EU and national ambitions, e.g. on establishing a resource efficient economy (circular economy) and reaching climate goals. For effective evaluation and feedback, planning and organisation of the legislative process at European and national level must provide adequate opportunities to gather and assess this evaluation and feedback properly from practitioners. Also the involvement of practitioners needs to be organised. This can be achieved by using the feedback and evaluation mechanism. 8.1.1. Practicability and enforceability Problems of practicability arise when competent authorities for the implementation and enforcement encounter difficulties in the practical application of legislation, inspection and enforcement and permitting. These issues can arise because insufficient attention has been paid to the need for proper transposition into national law and application through individual administrative decisions, or to the need for adequate infrastructure and resources. Also problems of practicability may be faced by the regulated target group when their obligations, as defined by the legislator, are unclear or unrealistic. 8.1.2. Feedback mechanism As shown in the presentation of the Regulatory Cycle, a systematic compliance and enforcement programme triggers a feedback mechanism. The information derived from enforcement response, compliance-promotion efforts and compliance checking need to be assessed so that the appropriate elements in the cycle can consider and improve the process. This could mean, in practice, reconsidering a law or its parts (returned to policy-makers and parliament), and changing the formulation of conditions in permits so that they become clearer and more enforceable (regulations applied by permitting bodies and agencies). This will ensure that the continuous process shown in the Regulatory Cycle will work to improve laws and regulations for the environment and will be able to achieve the goals set in these same laws. Actors are national policy makers and legislators, national authorities competent for the implementation and enforcement, IMPEL and other Implementation and Enforcement networks and regulated target groups (businesses). 102/451 8.1.3.", "Checklist on evaluation of regulatory activities To assess short comings in the enforceability and practicability of regulatory activities and to give effective feedback to policy makers or between inspectors and permit writers, a set of questions relating to the enforceability and practicability can be used. The questions e.g. relate to the quality of the legislation (e.g. the used definitions and terms) and on the practicability of compliance by the targeted group (e.g. are the obligations easily achievable/realistic). 8.1.4. Checklist on evaluation of regulatory activities on eco-innovation Since ambitions at both EU and at Member State level on developing a circular economy are far-reaching. Also the implementation of the Paris Climate agreement  requires increasing efforts of the EU member states to reach the agreed targets. Therefore, more business are carrying out eco-innovations. Eco-innovations are vital for helping to solve persistent environmental problems in the EU, for combatting climate change and in particular to act as a catalyst and scale-up in the transition to a circular economy.   Also the implementation of the Paris Climate agreement  requires increasing efforts of the EU member states to reach the agreed targets. Eco-innovation refers to any innovation that aims to reduce the use of natural resources and/or to decrease the release of harmful substances across the whole life-cycle. When carry through eco-innovations, barriers can be encountered in the current European environmental legislation, which may be not fit for purpose to enable eco-innovations. To assess these short comings or bottlenecks in the legislation and give feedback to adapt legislation (e.g. relating to different waste processing and recovering) a checklist can be used. The questions e.g. relate to short comings in used definitions (e.g. waste definition) or those relating to emerging techniques. 8.1.5. Organisation of feedback on short comings in regulatory activities This can be done by: \u2022 Direct feedback to the ministry because of close engagement but also by formal letters; \u2022 Through conferences organised by national level; \u2022 Periodic evaluation groups (4 to 5 times a year) that are established for this issue; \u2022 Special activities upon request of national level. This was considered as one of the weakest links within the cycle 103/451 8.1.6. Support from MS in the IED Implementation The IED makes provisions for the establishment of two groups involving representatives from Member States to support the implementation of the IED. These are: \u2022 The IED Article 13 Forum: a formal expert group set up to exchange of information between Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and the Commission. The focus of this group is to review and form an opinion on the proposed content of the BAT reference documents. \u2022 The IED Article 75 Committee: a formal Committee set up to assist the Commission by delivering opinions on implementing acts, including guidance on the collection of data and on the drawing up of BAT reference documents and on their quality assurance, BAT conclusions, implementing rules for large combustion plants and the type, format and frequency of reporting by Member States. \u2022 The Industrial Emissions Expert Group (IEEG: An informal group established to facilitate the exchange of experiences and good practices concerning interpretation, transposition and implementation of the IED) 104/451 FACT SHEETS Part 2 \u2022 Factsheet 2.01 \u2013 Describing the context for permitting \u2022 Factsheet 2.02 \u2013 Applying BAT \u2022 Factsheet 2.03 \u2013 Review of existing permits \u2022 Factsheet 2.04 - Eco-innovations \u2022 Factsheet 2.05 \u2013 Relationship permitting and inspector \u2022 Factsheet 2.06 \u2013 Transparency and visibility \u2022 Factsheet 2.07 \u2013 pre-application discussion \u2022 Factsheet 2.08 -  Baseline reports \u2022 Factsheet 2.09 \u2013 Checking of application \u2022 Factsheet 2.10 \u2013 Boundaries of installation \u2022 Factsheet 2.11 \u2013 Cost benefit \u2022 Factsheet 2.12 \u2013 Derogations \u2022 Factsheet 2.13 \u2013 Translating AEL\u2019s to ELV\u2019s Part 3 \u2022 Factsheet 3.01 \u2013 Describing the context for inspections \u2022 Factsheet 3.02 \u2013 Impact criteria \u2022 Factsheet 3.03 \u2013 Operator performance criteria \u2022 Factsheet 3.04 \u2013 Risk assessment - IRAM \u2022 Factsheet 3.05 \u2013 Defining objectives \u2022 Factsheet 3.06 \u2013 Defining inspection strategies \u2022 Factsheet 3.07 \u2013 Inspection plan \u2022 Factsheet 3.08 \u2013 Training programme \u2022 Factsheet 3.09 \u2013 Preparation of inspections \u2022 Factsheet 3.10 \u2013 Execution of inspections \u2022 Factsheet 3.11 \u2013 Operator Self-monitoring \u2022 Factsheet 3.12 \u2013 Level of non-compliance \u2022 Factsheet 3.13 \u2013 Cessation of operations \u2022 Factsheet 3.14 \u2013 Reporting of inspections 105/451 Factsheet 2.01 - Describing the context for permitting Describing the context is the first step of the systematic approach for developing a work plan for permitting.", "In this fact sheet we list the issues that could be of interest while identifying the scope and on information that should be gathered. Identifying the scope are (in random order): \u2022 Geographical area for which the authority is competent \u2022 Mission and (national) goals of the authority, It\u2019s important to define goals as environmental outcome. Goals can be  set on either national level (e.g. ministry, national environmental institutes) or regional level (e.g. competent authorities themselves). Goals on environmental outcome are: o Laid down in special legislation through environmental quality standards; o Laid down in policy documents (e.g. programs to improve air quality, waste management); o Laid down in (strategic) plan (e.g. CO2 reduction plan); o Specific environmental goals for single parameters relevant to a pollution problem within a certain area (e.g. NOx, PM10).We should define the term Environmental outcome in the guidance and give more examples \u2022 The environmental outcome the authority is trying to achieve \u2022 Statutory tasks and competences \u2022 Applicable legislation, either originated from a EU-, national- or regional level, against which the authority has to issue permits \u2022 Established environmental (national) policy and priorities. Some of the policy may come from EU or national level but the authority should also set her own policy. Issues that could be addressed are: o To set priorities on permitting tasks; o To make sure that all permits will comply to BAT and will be timely updated; o To establish and encourage a good level of cooperation between permitting and inspection and enforcement (e.g. exchange of information, joint inspections, collaboration within the permitting procedures) o To ensure all staff will have the appropriate skills and knowledge o Transparency and visibility towards public about the permitting procedure o To stimulate industry to go further then BAT requires o There where possible to have flexibility in the permit so industry can innovate (either in emerging techniques or products) o Applications will be of good quality \u2022 Interests of stakeholders (e.g. NGO\u2019s, branches of industries) \u2022 Public opinions \u2022 Register of activities and installations for which the authority is the competent \u2022 Sectors of industries \u2022 Types and sizes \u2022 Numbers and geographical distribution of installations 106/451 \u2022 Relevant environmental issues (water, air, safety, etc) Gathering information are (in random order): Environment \u2022 Environmental issues (environment, safety, public health, nature) particularly relevant for the area concerned \u2022 Information on the state of and trends in the (ambient) environment (e.g. data from national or regional networks of pollution control sampling stations or monitoring devices) Installations \u2022 Sector-specific issues/needs, e.g. expertise, attitude, culture, compliance behaviour and economics of (industrial) target groups \u2022 Information on the numbers, location and the branches of small and medium sized enterprises in the area that are regulated and falling under the competences of the authority \u2022 Information on individual controlled activities/installations, such as information on: o Legal requirements and permit situation o Emissions/discharges (results from emission monitoring), environmental impact, risk, accidents/incidents o Complexity of installation o Location of installation o Compliance record / behaviour  (inspection history) o Performance record (e.g. Environmental management systems, self monitoring and reporting, safety management systems, audits, experiences of inspection authorities) o Relevant complaints \u2022 New applications for permits that can be expected in a certain time period. Although the number of new installations could be low, the authority can get insight in the new applications for permits that can be expected in a certain time period by or through: o The EIA reports that have been submitted; o Holding regular meetings with permit holders or representatives of Association of enterprises; o Inspections, changes of installation that are detected during an inspection; o Executing periodic surveys of the industrial sector; o Getting in contacts with trade associations; o Having extensive communication through authority\u2019s website; o Encouraging prospective applicants or existing permit holders to seek pre-application meetings. This can be done by the inspectors, through the website or consultants; o Agreements made with local authorities. In some cases permits for spatial planning issues are required with the local authority. They will either suggest the applicant to announce the plans to the competent authority or communicate  this directly. 107/451 \u2022 (Significant) changes in installations that can be expected in a certain time period; \u2022 Revisions of permits (this often happen because of changes in BAT conclusions). \u2022 Expiring dates of permits. Depending on the legislation (and policy) some permits are issued for an unlimited time and some are issued for a limited time.", "For the latter permits could be limited for 5 years and others for 10 years. The difference in time could depend on the fact if a company is ISO-14001 (12 years) or EMAS (14 years) certificated. Sometimes permits are granted for a limited time due to special reasons (to test an operation). Unlimited time is as long as the installation is not changed or  there\u2019s new BAT Conclusions for the main activity of the installation. General \u2022 Possible changes in BREF\u2019s or BAT conclusions. The authority can get insight in possible changes in BREF\u2019s or BAT conclusions by through: o Following new developments through newsletters and seminars; o The communications about new developments through national knowledge Centres, ministries or national technical working groups; o The website of the European IPPC Bureau and following BATIS news; o Participating in BREF review process; o Participating in national technical working groups; o Communication with trade associations or relevant sectors; o Appointing a staff member in the role of national BREF coordinator. \u2022 New or changes in EU or national legislation that need to be implemented. The authority can get insight in possible changes in EU or national legislation by or through: o Special divisions within the organisation that monitor changes and are  involved in relevant networks; o News feeds from EU, e.g. EU journals; o Following internal and external communication through email and websites; o Nationally collected and disseminated information within regular meetings; o News feeds from external companies; o News feeds from the ministry or knowledge centre; o Being engaged in drafting of new legislation by giving technical and practical input; o Follow up on Public debates or seminars; o Internal procedures that make sure all staff are informed. \u2022 Quality and enforceability of the requirements in legislation or permits \u2022 Research on types of industry, objects and spatial planning done by third parties (e.g. Universities, Statistical boards or other Inspectorates) \u2022 Coordination and cooperation with other (inspection) authorities 108/451 Factsheet 2.02 \u2013 Applying BAT BAT assessment and BAT reconsideration (the installation is BAT) This can be done for new permits by: \u2022 BAT  appraisal is performed and the relevant BAT conclusions  are referenced for the installation; \u2022 Applicants are required to submit an assessment against relevant BAT conclusions as part of their permit application (operator provides evidence that the installation operates in a way that can meet any environmental objectives or performance levels (i.e. BAT-AELs) contained within  the relevant BAT conclusions). Competent authorities carry out a BAT assessment on site before the permit is granted \u2022 Local and installation specific conditions will be taken into account with adding special conditions; Internal quality procedures, e.g. before issuing, permits will be peer reviewed; This can be done for existing permits by: \u2022 In case general binding rules are used, they will be regularly updated on national level so they will stay BAT; \u2022 When new BAT conclusions are published, existing permits must be reviewed within the required timeline (i.e . within 4 years from the date of publication of the BAT conclusion from the main activity of the installation) and if necessary updated \u2022 Permits are regularly reviewed and if necessary updated based on a special program; \u2022 Use of a special IED tool of app) Further we need to address the definition of \u201cBAT\u201d. E.g. if you deviate from BAT-conclusion (with good motivation) is the permit considered to be BAT? 109/451 Factsheet 2.03 - Review of existing  permits Review should be done: \u2022 Within 4 years from the publication date of the BAT Conclusions for the main activity of the installation.   In order to allow the operator to make changes to the installation in order to adapt to the BAT Conclusions it is good practice to commence any review as soon as possible and at least within 1-2 years from the publication date. \u2022 When there is a legislative change; \u2022 When there is a request from the operator because of a change of installations (good practice to develop a detailed guidance for the permit holder so they can check if  a technical amendment of their permit is possible or if a complete review of the permit is necessary); \u2022 When local environmental situation requires an update of the permit; \u2022 Based on annual environmental reports from the operator; based on inspections  ", "Sometimes it\u2019s an environmental NGO that initiates the process; \u2022 The pollution caused by the installation is of such significance that the existing emission limit values need to be revised or new emission limit values need to be included in the permit; \u2022 Operational safety requires other techniques to be used; or \u2022 It\u2019s necessary to comply with a new or revised environmental quality standard. Important questions that needs to be answered here are: what is the main activity of the company and which BAT-conclusions are leading with regard to 4-years term for amendment? The BAT conclusions (BATc) for the main activity alone trigger the 4 year permit review period.   The main activity at an installation should almost always be judged in the context of vertical BATc documents only, as horizontal BATc by definition cannot ordinarily cover the main activity at an installation. While the trigger for the review period will be the publication of the BAT conclusions document for the main activity of the installation, this does not mean that this review is limited to just those BAT conclusions \u2013 it is possible that other BATc will also be applicable. It is likely that the BATc covering the main activity of the installation will be within the scope of a vertical BATc where at least one vertical BATc document applies to the activities at the installation.   Vertical BATc are those apply only to a discrete activity, group of activities, or an industrial sector. Horizontal BATc (such as those addressing energy efficiency, industrial cooling systems etc.) cannot cover the main activity at an installation and consequently any review may also need to consider one or more horizontal BATc document, but publication of horizontal BATc will not be the trigger for a permit review at the installation. Many installations will involve activities that are covered by just a single vertical BATc document, in which case there is no need to determine which activity is the main activity at the installation; the activity that is covered by the single relevant BATc document is considered to be the main activity. 110/451 However, at a relatively small number of installations, two or more vertical BATc apply, and the \u2018main activity\u2019 must be determined.   Consideration should be made of the \u201cprimary activity\u201d of the installation \u2013 for example, at an installation for the manufacture of chemicals with steam raising boilers and a waste water treatment plant, the main activity is the manufacture of chemicals rather, than the combustion of fuels or waste water treatment.   This approach is fully consistent with one of the European Commission\u2019s suggestions in its FAQs. 111/451 Factsheet 2.04 \u2013 Eco-innovation Introduction Eco-Innovation can be defined as the introduction of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), process, organisational change or marketing solution that reduces the use of natural resources (including materials, energy, water and land) and/or decreases the release of harmful substances across the whole life- cycle. Eco-innovations are vital for helping to solve persistent environmental problems in the EU, for combatting climate change and in particular to act as a catalyst and scale-up in the transition to a circular economy.   Product eco-innovation in particular concerns the introduction of less polluting, less resource- intensive products, including the substitution of dangerous substances by \u2018greener\u2019 ones, or the substitution of materials by less resource-intensive materials. Process eco-innovation is about introducing new technology for improved monitoring and reduction/ minimisation/control of waste and emissions, both from industry and other sources. Finally, particularly important for circular economy, are eco-innovations regarding the production of new secondary materials from waste. Perceived challenges in permitting, inspection and enforcement Between the environmental ambitions and the day to day practice where businesses and authorities try to carry through eco-innovations there is a significant gap. Competent authorities in the Member States face challenges when applying and enforcing current EU environmental legislation. This may cause uncertainty and delays in decision-making. Possible barriers include: \u2022 Rules which are unnecessarily inflexible, detailed, complex or which change very frequently. \u2022 The absence of rules or standards. \u2022 Rules which in practice are misinterpreted easily or rules stetting very general criteria the application of which requires from authorities considerable technical and legal expertise and experience. \u2022 The interface between different directives and regulations, for instance those regarding products, chemicals and waste. In practice these directives and regulations may not be well attuned or there may be gaps. \u2022", "Obstacles in case of cross border activities (f.i. marketing products and secondary materials across MS borders), because authorities from different MS interpret and or implement the EU legislation differently. \u2022 Lack of responsiveness (insufficient alertness to eco-innovations, lack of cooperative attitude, lack of understanding of the needs of innovators) \u2022 Lacking capability to properly handle risks related to innovations including weighing different environmental interests and getting timely political backing \u2022 Lack of cooperation between different competent authorities. Unclear allocation of responsibilities to different layers of government and lack of feedback and evaluation from practice to policy makers and vice versa 112/451 Possible adjustments in the permitting, inspection and enforcement process to facilitate eco- innovations Possible adjustments in the permitting, inspection and enforcement  processes may include: \u2022 Learn, train and secure in the organisation to recognize eco-innovation and, when necessary scale up towards policy makers timely; \u2022 At an early stage, a standard preliminary consultation involving all relevant competent authorities and stakeholders; \u2022 A coordinator at the competent authority to facilitate and support those who have to deal with an eco-innovation; \u2022 Address eco-innovation explicitly in how permitting, inspections and enforcement are organized and carried out (in work processes and procedures). - For permitting: appoint for each major eco-innovation a case manager/single point of contact; engage all relevant competent authorities from the start; share all information between these authorities; escalate timely; seek timely guidance or decision at higher level. - For inspections and enforcement: attune inspections and enforcement to the sort of risks foreseen or experiments or pilots authorized; in particular clarify upfront what compliance is expected (possibly what non-compliances under what conditions may be condoned) and how authorities will respond to non-compliances; \u2022 Active feedback and evaluation between practitioners and policy makers on practicability and enforceability of legislation; \u2022 Use of existing room for controlled experimentation; \u2022 Embed in the authority\u2019s organization and make accessible for others knowledge on eco- innovations \u2022 Establishing partnerships between authorities and businesses in order to facilitate innovation process. \u2022 Other arrangements on organizational level to facilitate innovations. E.g. to establish a Rapid Response Team: It can be valuable to create a team of experts on a green innovative cases. Such a 'rapid response team' can be used in cases where a) is to be decided quickly; b) vital knowledge is missing from the relevant parties and c) mediation is required. 113/451 Factsheet 2.05 - Relationship permitting and inspection The following issues could be helpful while establishing and encouraging a good level of cooperation between permit writers and inspectors: \u2022 Inspection reports, documents and risk priorities can be used in the application phase; \u2022 Complains received by the inspector about existing installation can be reported to the permit writer and be taken into account while defining the conditions; \u2022 In case of a new installation the involvement of the inspector  could be common site visit by the inspector and the permitting officer; \u2022 A shared databases for permitting and inspections where information and inspection history can be found would be helpful; \u2022 The enforceability check of the permit conditions by the inspectors should be mandatory action. This could also be done by other authorities.   A library of standard set of conditions (standard requirements) would be very helpful in this; \u2022 Inspectors can be the eyes and ears of the permit officers; \u2022 Inspectors can use the information from the permitting officers to shift their priorities or focus of their inspection work. Although we believe that all actions above will have a positive influence in the relationship and the work, for some of them it will mean additional work. The lack of resources could form a risk in this cooperation. Sharing the same objectives, targets and priorities will not always be easy or possible. However knowing these objectives, targets and priorities from each other could be very useful especially for the work of the inspector. Involvement and good communication between inspection and permitting is very important and this can have different forms and structures. In general it\u2019s not good practice to have the same person for permitting and inspection. Although this might be seen as a very effective way of working, it can also be seen as a potential cause of loss of sight, since details non addressed in the permitting procedure could also be undervalued in the inspection. A rotation system in where the roles (permitting officer or inspector) change at a certain moment could also help in the understanding of each others work.", "Of course this can only be done if both persons work for the same organisations and there are no legal constrains. 114/451 115/451 Factsheet 2.06 \u2013 Transparency and Visibility Public visibility of the application, draft report and permit, submissions, objections and final report and permit. The permit procedure must be fully transparent and allow for public participation. This requirement is stated explicitly in the Industrial Emissions Directive and comes from the Aarhus Convention. Relevant documentation should be made available online throughout the entire permitting process. This includes the following elements: \u2022 Permit application \u2022 Environmental Impact Statement, where relevant \u2022 Natura Impact Statement, where relevant \u2022 All correspondence between the regulator and other relevant statutory bodies. \u2022 All correspondence with, and submissions and objections received from, third parties, including interested members of the public \u2022 All further information received from the applicant \u2022 Draft Permit \u2022 Report of the permit writer \u2022 Technical report considering any objections \u2022 Final Permit Applicants should be made aware that all information is made publicly available; therefore confidential information should not be generally submitted. In the event that an applicant requires information to be kept confidential, it must be strongly justified. If is it not necessary for the consideration of the permit application, it is returned to the applicant. It is also possible to interact with the permitting process online, using a facility to make online submissions and objections at the appropriate parts of the process. Internal and external communication Some good practices for internal and external communication are: \u2022 Communication plan that ensures the involvement of various stakeholders in the process; \u2022 Protocols that describes how letters are formally stored and how communication through internet can take place; \u2022 A customer charter, which is published on the website of the competent authority and includes all applicable documents, correspondence and decisions by the competent authority; 116/451 \u2022 An annual internal communication plan, that includes: media relations, website and intranet, publications, internal communications, internal newsletters, exhibitions, environmental surveys, education etc); \u2022 A national web based communication system for all communication between competent authority and applicants. 117/451 Factsheet 2.07 - Pre-application discussion Pre-application discussions or pre-consultations: \u2022 should be an informal step (advised but not mandatory) in case of new installations. The advantages: better applications and to explain the specific procedure to the operator. \u2022 should be a formal step in case of changes in existing installation. Here it\u2019s necessary to decide by the authority if it\u2019s major or minor change and if an application is necessary or not. Especially in the first case (informal step) the permit writer should stay in his or her role as regulator and not step in the role as a private consultant (companies will use this as free advice on their application). Issues to discuss during the pre-consultation discussions are: \u2022 to explain how to fill in the application form; \u2022 to discuss the information that is required; \u2022 to explain the (type) permitting process; \u2022 to discuss the main environmental issues; \u2022 to discuss the future plans and the requirements with respect to the IED, EIA (scoping) and AA; \u2022 to discuss if any data is confidential; to ensure the application is of high quality; \u2022 to visit of the site. 118/451 Factsheet 2.08 \u2013 Base-line report on soil and groundwater contamination This Factsheet provides guidance on the requirements for Baseline Reports on soil and groundwater contamination under the Industrial Emissions Directive. The main requirements are set out in Article 22 of the IED where activities that involve the production or release of hazardous substances that may lead to the possibility soil or groundwater contamination should be subject to the submission of a report by the operator before starting operation of an installation or before a permit for an installation is updated for the first time. The report provides the basis for a comparison with the state of contamination upon definitive cessation of activities. Article 22 contains provisions for the definitive cessation of activities involving the use, production or release of relevant hazardous substances. A key tool in this respect is the establishment of the Baseline Report. Where the installation has caused significant pollution of soil or groundwater by relevant hazardous substances compared to the state established in the Baseline Report, the operator must take the necessary measures to address this pollution so as to return the site to that state.", "Article 22 (2) states that:  where the activity involves the use, production or release of relevant hazardous substances and having regard to the possibility of soil and groundwater contamination at the site of the installation, the operator shall prepare and submit to the competent authority a baseline report before starting operation of an installation or before a permit for an installation is updated for the first time after 7 January 2013. The baseline report shall contain the information necessary to determine the state of soil and groundwater contamination so as to make a quantified comparison with the state upon definitive cessation of activities provided for under paragraph 3. The baseline report shall contain at least the following information: (a) information on the present use and, where available, on past uses of the site; (b) where available, existing information on soil and groundwater measurements that reflect the state at the time the report is drawn up or, alternatively, new soil and groundwater measurements having regard to the possibility of soil and groundwater contamination by those hazardous substances to be used, produced or released by the installation concerned. 119/451 European Commission guidance on baseline reports According to the last subparagraph of Article 22(2) of the IED, \u2018the Commission shall establish guidance on the content of the baseline report.\u2019 Accordingly, the Commission has published a Communication on European Commission Guidance concerning baseline reports2. This guidance provides information on the legal provisions concerning a baseline report and covers the following elements of Article 22 of the IED that should be addressed in the baseline report: \u2022 Determining whether a baseline report is required to be produced; \u2022 Designing baseline investigations; \u2022 Designing a sampling strategy; \u2022 Developing the baseline report. The guidance sets out 8 key stages in the development of the report: 2 European Commission Guidance concerning baseline reports under Article 22(2) of Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions. 2014/C 136/03. Article 22 (3) states that: Upon definitive cessation of the activities, the operator shall assess the state of soil and groundwater contamination by relevant hazardous substances used, produced or released by the installation. Where the installation has caused significant pollution of soil or groundwater by relevant hazardous substances compared to the state established in the baseline report referred to in paragraph 2, the operator shall take the necessary measures to address that pollution so as to return the site to that state. For that purpose, the technical feasibility of such measures may be taken into account. Without prejudice to the first subparagraph, upon definitive cessation of the activities, and where the contamination of soil and groundwater at the site poses a significant risk to human health or the environment as a result of the permitted activities carried out by the operator before the permit for the installation is updated for the first time after 7 January 2013 and taking into account the conditions of the site of the installation established in accordance with Article 12(1)(d), the operator shall take the necessary actions aimed at the removal, control, containment or reduction of relevant hazardous substances, so that the site, taking into account its current or approved future use, ceases to pose such a risk. 120/451 Stage 1: Identifying the hazardous substances that are currently used, produced or released at the installation \u2013 to determine whether or not hazardous substances are used, produced or released in view of deciding on the need to prepare and submit a baseline report. Stage 2: Identifying the relevant hazardous substances - to restrict further consideration to only the relevant hazardous substances in view of deciding on the need to prepare and submit a baseline report. Stage 3: Assessment of the site-specific pollution possibility - to identify which of the relevant hazardous substances represent a potential pollution risk at the site based on the likelihood of releases of such substances occurring. For these substances, information must be included in the baseline report. Stage 4: Site history \u2013 to identify potential sources which may have resulted in the hazardous substances identified in Stage 3 being already present on the site of the installation. Stage 5: Environmental setting \u2013 to determine where hazardous substances may go if released and where to look for them. Also, to identify the environmental media and receptors that are potentially at risk and where there are other activities in the area which release the same hazardous substances and may cause them to migrate onto the site.", "Stage 6: Site characterisation- to identify the location, nature and extent of existing pollution on the site and to determine which strata and groundwater might be affected by such pollution. Compare with potential future emissions to see if areas are coincident. Stage 7: Site investigation \u2013 to collect additional information as necessary to allow a quantified assessment of soil and groundwater pollution by relevant hazardous substances. Stage 8: Production of the baseline report 121/451 IMPEL project on baseline reports An IMPEL project3 is in progress to assess the procedures that are already being implemented in countries in relation to the production of baseline reports and to identify good practice. <add summary of IMPEL project> 3 IMPEL Project: IED Baseline Report. Number 2015/24 - 2016/10 - 2017/11. 122/451 Factsheet 2.09 \u2013 Checking of application <Not finished> Completeness  and admissible: After submission the first check is to see if the application form is complete (all mandatory fields are filled in). Based on this the application will be further assessed or the applicant will be notified about information missing. After the check for completeness the application will be further assessed if it\u2019s admissible. In case it\u2019s not admissible the operator is requested for additional information. In most cases there is a dedicated (legal) time to check if the application is complete and admissible. When the application is declared complete and admissible the permit procedure starts. This step can also be used by the competent authority to carry out a screening for appropriate assessment under the habitat directive and a screening under the IEA. \u2022 What is the minimum required information? \u2022 What is the quality standard (when is application good enough? \u2022 Should we advise that a site visit should take place in the this step? \u2022 What are the weaknesses in an application and what are the pitfalls 123/451 Factsheet 2.10 - Boundaries of an installation The technical unit consists of the plant or machinery where one or more activities listed in Annex 1 of the IED is undertaken. Machinery includes equipment for monitoring for releases, control rooms, and equipment needed to run the plant and move materials around the Installation. Plant may include static items such as tanks concrete pads and lagoons.    The technical unit must include enough plant and machinery to allow the Activity to take place in a controlled manner for a sufficient period of time for the operation to reach its designed or intended output. Therefore the \u201ctechnical unit\u201d can be taken to mean something which is functionally self-contained in the sense that the unit \u2013 which may consist of one component or a number of components functioning together \u2013 can carry out the Annex 1 activity or activities on its own.\u2019 If there are two or more technical units on the same site they will be treated as a single TU if they are technically connected and one of the following criteria is met: (a) They carry out successive steps in an integrated activity; (b) One of the listed activities is a Directly Associated Activity (DAA) of the other; or (c) Both units are served by the same DAA. Directly associated activities Directly associated activities are activities are those being carried out in conjunction with the Annex 1 IED activity.    DAAs should also be included within the installation. The following 3 criteria must all be met before an activity will be regarded as a DAA of the TU: a) The activity must be directly associated with the stationary technical unit; b) The activity must have a technical connection with the listed activities carried out in or by the stationary technical unit; and c) The activity must be capable of having an effect on emissions. In addition to meeting criteria (a), (b) and (c) the activity must also take place on the same site as the TU.    Two parcels of land do not need to touch physically to form the same site, provided that the parcels are technically connected, so a site would not become two sites merely because two parcels of land were separated by a barrier such as a stream or a road. 124/451 Factsheet 2.11 \u2013 Cost-benefit methodologies The quantitative analysis of costs and benefits will usually require that a range of possible information sources are considered to draw relevant data. In assigning values to environmental harm, useful references may exist in national publications.", "Article 15(4) places an obligation on the competent authority to make a judgement about what constitutes disproportionately higher costs compared to the environmental benefits. This has close links to the issue of cost-benefit analysis. However, the results of any cost-benefit analysis will not necessarily provide an answer as to what is disproportionate for a particular installation. Factors that could be considered in deciding on disproportionality: \u2022 Payback periods for investments to be made to comply with BAT-AELs; \u2022 The impact of compliance with the BAT-AELs on product prices; \u2022 Cross-media impacts of compliance with the BAT-AELs including energy costs and resource consumption; \u2022 Cost-effectiveness of the measures proposed to be implemented; \u2022 Disproportionality may vary by installation and by sector given the wide variety of activities covered by the IED. 125/451 Factsheet 2.12 \u2013 Derogation from BAT-AELs Article 15(3) of the IED provides for a specific role for BAT conclusions and BAT-AELs when setting emission limit values in permits. The expectation is that, in general, emission limit values will be set in permits so that emissions from the installation do not exceed the BAT-AELs. However, Article 15(4) of the IED provides the possibility to derogate from the requirements of Article 15(3) and, thereby, to allow emissions to be higher than the BAT-AELs where an assessment shows that the achievement of BAT-AELs would lead to disproportionately higher costs compared to the environmental benefits due to: a) the geographical location or the local environmental conditions of the installation concerned; or b) the technical characteristics of the installation concerned. Under Article 21(3) of the IED, within 4 years of publication of decisions on BAT conclusions competent authorities must reconsider and, if necessary, update the permit to ensure compliance with the Directive and in particular Article 15(3) and 15(4) and that the installation complies with its permit. The first two sets of BAT conclusions for the manufacture of glass and iron and steel production were published on 08 March 2012 and competent authorities are now under pressure to reconsider and update permits for these sectors by the 2016 deadline. Finally, Article 15(5) of the IED provides for temporary derogations for the testing and use of emerging techniques for a total period of time not exceeding 9 months, after which either the technique is stopped or the activity achieves at least the BAT-AEL. The IED does not stipulate any technical criteria for the using this derogation provision. Technical characteristics, local environment and geographic factors Article 15(4) of the IED makes clear that derogations can only be justified where one or more of the following factors would mean that the achievement of the emissions levels associated with the best available techniques would lead to disproportionately higher costs compared to the environmental benefits: I. The geographical location of the installation concerned; II. The local environment of the installation concerned; III. The technical characteristics of the installation concerned. Participants in the IMPEL project provided examples where derogations might be applied with respect to these factors. With regard to technical characteristics, examples given were: \u2022 production of specialist products that are not adequately covered by the BAT conclusions, \u2022 configuration of a plant on a given site and lack of space to fit equipment, \u2022 practicability of installing equipment within four years, \u2022 intended operational lifetime of parts of an installation, \u2022 application of BAT to short-run / batch activities, \u2022 specificity of process gases, 126/451 \u2022 failure of the application of the BAT concerned to achieve the BAT-AELs and \u2022 plants designed to use specific local raw materials. With regard to geographic characteristics, examples given were: \u2022 remote locations (such as islands) involving high transport costs for waste treatment, \u2022 availability of process water, and \u2022 size, type and flow of surface water were given as examples. With regard to local environment examples given were: \u2022 The availability of water and quality of the surrounding environment including location of sensitive receptors. 127/451 Factsheet 2.13 \u2013 BAT assessment and setting conditions BAT Conclusions (BATc) have a key role in the permitting process as they must be the reference for setting permit conditions. In basic terms the BATc will describe the issues to be considered and the expected performance levels of an installation. It is then for the operator to demonstrate and ensure that the installation can meet these performance levels.", "Despite this, it is important to note that the BATc include a statement declaring that they are not prescriptive regarding the particular techniques that should be used, and that other techniques can also be used.   This means that they are not exhaustive in describing techniques but rather provide the focus on the areas to pay attention to and performance expectations to reference when determining a permit application or reviewing a permit \u2013 and not the means of achieving those outcomes. BAT is the Best Available Techniques and is defined as the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation that indicates the practical suitability of particular techniques for providing the basis for emission limit values and other permit conditions designed to prevent, and where that is not practicable, reduce emissions and the impact on the environment as a whole. There is a misconception that BAT is all about having the right types of technologies, kit and abatement plant at an installation.   This is not the case.   BAT is all about the optimisation of site-specific performance.   It may be the case that an installation has all the most modern technologies and abatement equipment, but if it is not operated or maintained correctly, the performance of this equipment is not optimised, and it may not be BAT. Similarly an installation could use older technologies, but is operated in such a way that their performance is optimised and is BAT for that installation. The BATc do not define which techniques or technologies should be used by an installation.   The practical suitability of particular techniques will vary on a case by case basis and will be site specific \u2013 dependent upon the technical characteristics of the installation, operational limitations, local conditions and any environmental outcomes that are merited necessary to minimise impact and protect the environment as a whole. The BATc will contain BAT - associated emission levels (BAT-AELs).   Typically BAT-AELs will be presented as a range.   It should be noted that due to the principle of optimisation where the BATc present a range of emission limits it is not appropriate to simply set the ELV at the top of the BAT-AEL range.   The appropriate ELV from the BAT-AEL range is what protects the environment and can be achieved by the normal optimised performance of the installation. This means that as part of our BAT assessment we must assess and ensure that site specific performance is optimised and can achieve the performance levels within the range of the BAT- AELs.   If we conclude as part of our assessment that site-specific performance is optimised, then BAT for that installation will be reflected by the emission levels associated with this optimised performance. BAT Assessment 128/451 While the BATc  do not specify that a particular technology or technique is utilised by an installation, it lists various technologies and techniques that may be applicable.   This is not an exhaustive list and just because a technique has not been identified by the BATc this does not mean that it is not BAT. Where a technology or technique has been listed in the BATc, BAT associated emission levels or BAT associated performance levels may also be included. These will present what is considered to be the normal operating range for BAT techniques or technologies and should be the reference for setting the permit conditions.   These are also a useful reference for determining whether the performance of a particular installation is optimised and should form the basis of any discussions with the operator.   It should be noted that the BATc may prohibit the use of certain technologies or techniques, however  this will be unusual. Just because a technique or technology is not mentioned in the BATc it does not mean that it is not BAT. Permit conditions can be set on the basis of techniques that are not described in any of the relevant BATc \u2013 however we must be satisfied that the proposed approach represents BAT. Where an alternative technique is proposed, you should utilise Annex III of the IED which contains criteria for determining Best Available Techniques.   You should consider these criteria and assess whether the proposed alternative technique satisfies these criteria, based on sufficient justification from the operator and can be considered to be BAT. These criteria include: 1.", "the use of low-waste technology; 2. the use of less hazardous substances; 3. the furthering of recovery and recycling of substances and used in the process and of waste, where appropriate; 4. comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been tried with success on an industrial scale; 5. technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding; 6. the nature, effects and volume of the emissions concerned; 7. the commissioning dates for new or existing installations; 8. the length of time needed to introduce the best available technique; 9. the consumption and nature of raw materials (including water) used in the process and energy efficiency; 10. the need to prevent or reduce to minimum the overall impact of the emissions on the environment and the risks to it; 11. the need to prevent accidents and to minimise the consequences for the environment; and 12. information published by public international organisations. If we consider that an alternative technique satisfies these criteria, and is BAT, you must also set emission limit values that ensure that under normal operating conditions the emissions do not exceed the BAT-AELs which are described in the BATc. 129/451 Where it is assessed that an installation is not currently BAT, the operator must undertake an assessment of the options to minimise the emissions and specify the steps that will be taken to employ BAT at  the installation by the end of the BATC review period.   This process is called optioneering. Considering a Range of Options It is likely that in most cases that the options for achieving BAT can be addressed in a number of ways \u2013 BAT will vary on a site by site basis.   A basic principle of BAT assessment is to consider a range of options to address BAT and to carry out an options appraisal \u2013 optioneering.   Without considering a range of options it is not possible to determine if the chosen approach represents the most suitable option, and therefore represents BAT. Optioneering should always include at least one option for reducing the emissions to within the BAT-AEL range within the BATc review deadline (where this is technically feasible).   Where appropriate the operator may also need to consider options that would allow the installation to achieve the BAT-AELs after the BATc review deadline \u2013 these options should be assessed on the basis of other options resulting in disproportionate costs of dis-benefits to the environment.   Under these circumstances the \u201cdo nothing \u2013 status quo\u201d option may also be considered as an appropriate alternative approach. Crucially any options that are being considered must be considered to represent the Best Available Techniques (BAT). Optioneering, Costs and Benefits The consideration of costs and benefits of credible options is an important aspect of optioneering.   The operator should ensure that an analysis of costs and benefits is made available for the range of credible options considered.   It is acknowledged that there may be challenges in producing accurate costs and, more particularly monetising net benefits.   As a consequence it may not always be possible to conduct an assessment that relies fully on a quantitative analysis. Where a cost benefit analysis is required to justify derogation, the operator should provide a CBA for both the selected upgrade option and for the option that would allow the installation to achieve emissions within the BAT-AEL ranges within the BATc review deadline.   This is required in order to demonstrate disproportionate costs. See further factsheet 9. Justification for Preferred Option The operator will have a preferred option and should indicate the reason(s) the proposed option has been selected. As part of this justification the operator should state the reason that an option is being selected and where necessary give details of any benefits and risks associated with the option, and why they are preferred over 130/451 other options, including why other possible options are not selected and are therefore not the best options for the site specific circumstances. The operator should as part of its justification provide evidence to support understanding of underlying cause as to why a particular option has been selected.   This could take the form of technical assessments, monitoring data, photographs, historic maps or survey data. The operator should demonstrate that the proposed upgrades will provide the intended benefits e.g. these benefits may include the protection of important infrastructure and buildings, valuable land resource, or renewable energy production \u2013 but most importantly why the preferred option is BAT and will achieve emissions within the BAT-AEL range.", "Derogation (and deviation from the BAT-AELs) can only be considered after the site specific BAT assessment has been concluded, and if the BAT assessment and optioneering does not demonstrate any BAT option that will achieve emissions within the BAT-AEL range. The need to consider derogation will arise only if it is concluded that an operator\u2019s BAT Assessment adequately demonstrates that BAT in those operators specific circumstances might be defined by an ELV that exceeds the upper end of the applicable BAT-AEL range.   This can be either on an ongoing basis, or on a time limited basis in order to allow the investment necessary to eventually reduce emissions to an appropriate point within the BAT-AEL range. It is a common misconception that derogation is from both BAT, the BAT Conclusions and the full requirements of the IED \u2013 this is not the case. Types of Derogation The IED specifies only 2 types of derogation. \u2022 Article 15(4) derogation - allows the setting of less strict ELVs that exceed the BAT-AEL range.   This derogation can be granted only if on-site operations are considered to be BAT (an article 15(4) derogation is not derogation from BAT).   Furthermore this should ordinarily not be considered to be an indefinite derogation from the BAT-AELs, but rather a temporary relaxation of the ELVs. The operator must justify any derogation with firm plans to bring operations to within the BAT-AEL range (within an appropriate timescale) and cease the requirement for derogation.   This type of derogation would need to be reappraised again at any future BATc review, and the status of BAT at these future reviews is uncertain.   As a consequence the operator may ultimately be faced with greater upgrade requirements in the future. \u2022 Article 15(5) derogation \u2013 allows for the testing and use of emerging techniques.   This derogation can be granted if site operations are not BAT \u2013 however this derogation can only be granted for a period of 9 months.   It is considered unlikely that this type of derogation will be appropriate for BATc reviews. Circumstances in which Derogation may be Justified 131/451 If BAT may be represented by an ELV that exceeds a BAT-AEL range in the case of a specific installation, competent authorities it can set an ELV that exceeds the upper end of the BAT-AEL range.   Competent authorities can only set such an ELV if it can be demonstrated that reducing the comparable emissions to within the BAT-AEL range would lead to disproportionately higher cost compared to the environmental benefits for the installation concerned due to: \u2022 the geographical location or the local environmental conditions of the installation, and/or \u2022 the technical characteristics of the installation. The reasons that could justify derogation to be considered on the grounds of the geographical location or the local environmental conditions might include: \u2022 higher construction and/or energy costs due to remote location; \u2022 the installation uses a locally available raw material that affects the emissions, and importing the raw material upon which compliance with BAT-AEL depends would require substantial infrastructure investment and increased transport costs; \u2022 the uses of alternative techniques at the installation would require additional infrastructure locally (e.g. remote locations without interconnector for power supply); \u2022 the built up nature of the local area may result in higher costs (e.g. because of higher land prices); \u2022 local planning restrictions limit the nature of developments or their costs; or \u2022 the installation is located where there are fewer people or environmental receptors, resulting in lower impacts (and damage costs) than would apply to a typical installation. The reasons that might justify derogation to be considered on the grounds of the technical characteristics of the installation might include: \u2022 atypical cross media impacts would arise whereby reducing the emissions of one pollutant increase the emissions of another; \u2022 the configuration of the plant within the site results in practical difficulties and increased costs, including lack of space for the construction of additional plant; \u2022 the history of recent investment in techniques designed to reduce emissions; \u2022 the remaining operational life of the plant; \u2022 the product must be produced to meet a specific and atypical specification that necessitates e.g. additional purification steps, different reaction chemistry etc.; or \u2022 the characteristics of the gaseous or liquid effluents are atypical. In order for competent authorities to entertain the possibility of derogation the optioneering BAT assessment should include at least one option for reducing the emissions to within the BAT-AEL range and meet BAT within the BATc review deadline.  ", "This assessment will need to demonstrate that the reason such an option was rejected as BAT, or whose introduction is delayed, can be linked to at least one of the relevant qualification criteria mentioned above.   If this is not the case then competent authorities cannot consider the possibility of derogation and would therefore have no option but to set the ELV within the BAT-AEL range. 132/451 Translating BAT Associated Emission Levels (AELs) into Emission Limit Values (ELVs) This part provides guidance on how to translate the BAT Associated Emission Levels (AELs) published at EU-level into Emission Limit Values (ELVs) that are specific to the permitting of individual installations. The IED requires that Emission Limit Values (ELVs) are set for polluting substances likely to be emitted in significant quantities (Article 14, para 1). The ELVs must reflect the principle that that Best Available Techniques (BAT) is applied in the operation of the installation (Article 11). The BAT conclusions agreed at EU-level provide the reference for setting ELVs, including the requirements for the monitoring of  emissions (Article 14, para 3). In particular, the BAT-AELs provide the basis for setting the ELVs for individual installations (Article 15, para 3). Article 3 Definitions (5) \u2018emission limit value\u2019 means the mass, expressed in terms of certain specific parameters, concentration and/or level of an emission, which may not be exceeded during one or more periods of time; (10) \u2018best available techniques\u2019 means the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation which indicates the practical suitability of particular techniques for providing the basis for emission limit values and other permit conditions designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions and the impact on the environment as a whole [\u2026] Article 11 General principles governing the basic obligations of the operator Member States shall take the necessary measures to provide that installations are operated in accordance with the following principles: [\u2026] (b) the best available techniques are applied; Article 15 Emission limit values, equivalent parameters and technical measures 133/451 [\u2026] 3. The competent authority shall set emission limit values that ensure that, under normal operating conditions, emissions do not exceed the emission levels associated with the best available techniques as laid down in the decisions on BAT conclusions referred to in Article 13(5) through either of the following: (a) setting emission limit values that do not exceed the emission levels associated with the best available techniques. Those emission limit values shall be expressed for the same or shorter periods of time and under the same reference conditions as those emission levels associated with the best available techniques; or (b) setting different emission limit values than those referred to under point (a) in terms of values, periods of time and reference conditions. Where point (b) is applied, the competent authority shall, at least annually, assess the results of emission monitoring in order to ensure that emissions under normal operating conditions have not exceeded the emission levels associated with the best available techniques. To put the IED requirements into practice it is necessary to derive a mass or concentration limit (single value) from the BAT-AEL range (level A to level X). This single value should not exceed the range under normal operating conditions. In order to comply with the basic obligation to apply BAT, this mass or concentration limit needs to reflect the best technically and economically viable option to protect the environment. If the ELV is expressed for another time period or under reference conditions other than those stated in the BAT-AELs, an additional calculation by the operator is required to prove that the level of protection is equivalent. The implementation of BAT-AELs can be split into three steps: \uf02d Translating BAT-AELs into a single ELV (from a range to a number) or several ELVs for different operational conditions. \uf02d Setting monitoring requirements, and in case of other reference conditions, setting additional monitoring/reporting requirements. \uf02d Setting compliance rules, like reference periods and conditions and allowed exceedances during other than normal operating conditions. 134/451 Under certain limited conditions, Article 15, para 4, allows an ELV to exceed the upper value of a BAT-AEL range. See factsheet2.11 for further information on derogations Conditions in permits, general binding rules, national/regional Brefs The IED provides the options to implement BAT-AELs in individual permit conditions or in general binding rules. In the permitting option, BAT-AELs are translated into ELVs for an individual installation.", "In the general binding rules option, BAT-AELs are translated into ELVs for a sector. Examples from Member States show that general binding rules are prepared by working groups with experts from competent authorities and the member state. Operators and trade associations are consulted. Article 6 General binding rules Without prejudice to the obligation to hold a permit, Member States may include requirements for certain categories of installations, combustion plants, waste incineration plants or waste co- incineration plants in general binding rules. Where general binding rules are adopted, the permit may simply include a reference to such rules. Article 17 General binding rules for activities listed in Annex I 1.When adopting general binding rules, Member States shall ensure an integrated approach and a high level of environmental protection equivalent to that achievable with individual permit conditions. 2. General binding rules shall be based on the best available techniques, without prescribing the use of any technique or specific technology in order to ensure compliance with Articles 14and 15. 3. Member States shall ensure that general binding rules are updated to take into account developments in best available techniques and in order to ensure compliance with Article 21. 135/451 4.General binding rules adopted in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 3 shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Examples in Member States show two approaches, combining permits and general binding rules: The general binding rules set ELVs that are considered to reflect best available techniques for the majority of the installations. In the permits of individual installation these ELVs are checked and if deemed necessary amended in permit conditions. The ELVs in the general binding rules are sometimes at the upper level of the BAT-AEL and sometimes at a more stringent level depending on the performance of the installations and environmental circumstances in the area covered by the general binding rules. An option in between (not mentioned in the IED) are national/regional Brefs which provide guidance to set ELVs for a specific sector or region. Like general binding rules national/regional Brefs are developed by working groups consisting of experts from competent authorities and the member state and in co-operation / consultation with industry. Step 1: Translating BAT-AELs into an ELV BAT Conclusions are published Regional Working Group (WG) starts OUTPUT of the WG Reference document for the Region Inspection Authority Authority (permit) Trade Association Operators 136/451 To set ELVs based on BAT-AELs the emission performance of a whole sector needs to be compared with the performance level of an individual installation or, in the case of general binding rules, of the group of installations covered under the scope of the general binding rules. For this analysis, detailed and good quality information is needed. The IED provides the legal basis to require the operator to submit the necessary information: \uf02d Permit application (Article 12) \uf02d Monitoring plan and data (Article 14) \uf02d Possibility to require operator information for reconsidering permit conditions (Article 21) \uf02d Inspection reports (Article 23). To carry out the analysis, the information needs to include in particular: \uf02d Technical details on the installation (existing/new, continuous / non-continuous operations). \uf02d Substances emitted, including information on quantities of individual and categories of substances and monitoring methods and reference conditions. \uf02d Nature of the emissions, like fluctuations, point / diffuse source, normal / other than normal operating conditions. \uf02d Emission reduction techniques (to be) implemented. Practical examples in Member States show that requiring the operator to draw up a plan, including on implementing BAT and monitoring and in some cases following formats or criteria, contributes to good quality and quantity information collection. If a first check, also in comparison with the BREF, shows that the quality and/or quantity of information is not sufficient, the competent authority may, before granting or revising the permit, request additional information. A better understanding of the specific situation may also require additional information. For example, the reference conditions and monitoring methods that underlie the emission data must be clear to be able to use them for setting an ELV Article 12 Applications for permits 1.", "Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that an application for a permit includes a description of the following: the installation and its activities; the raw and auxiliary materials, other substances and the energy used in or generated by the installation; 137/451 the sources of emissions from the installation; the conditions of the site of the installation; where applicable, a baseline report in accordance with Article 22(2); the nature and quantities of foreseeable emissions from the installation into each medium as well as identification of significant effects of the emissions on the environment; the proposed technology and other techniques for preventing or, where this is not possible, reducing emissions from the installation; measures for the prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling and recovery of waste generated by the installation; further measures planned to comply with the general principles of the basic obligations of the operator as provided for in Article 11; measures planned to monitor emissions into the environment; the main alternatives to the proposed technology, techniques and measures studied by the applicant in outline. An application for a permit shall also include a non-technical summary of the details referred to in the first subparagraph. Article 21 Reconsideration and updating of permit conditions by the competent authority 2.   At the request of the competent authority, the operator shall submit all the information necessary for the purpose of reconsidering the permit conditions, including, in particular, results of emission monitoring and other data, that enables a comparison of the operation of the installation with the best available techniques described in the applicable BAT conclusions and with the emission levels associated with the best available techniques. When comparing the information with a BREF/BAT-AEL five outcomes can be distinguished: The installation uses the same techniques as described in the BAT conclusion. In this case the next step is to check if the emission level of the installation is within the BAT-AEL. If so, that emission level can be set as an ELV. The installation uses the techniques described in the BAT conclusions, but emission levels exceed the BAT-AEL. The emission level in the operator information cannot be automatically set as the ELV (article 15). The 138/451 competent authority could consider to deviate from the application and set the ELV at the upper level of the BAT-AEL or a lower level considered appropriate looking at the technical characteristics of the installation or comparable installations in the BREFs or elsewhere. This requires consultation with the operator to prevent objections and to guarantee enforceability. The installation uses techniques other than those described in the BAT-conclusion. In this case the emission level must be compared to the BAT-AEL and additionally the technique must be tested against the Annex III criteria to determine BAT (article 14, para 5). This second test can identify cross-media effects possibly leading to interference with other BAT conclusions. If this is not the case and the emission level is within the BAT-AEL, that emission level can be set as an ELV. The installation uses techniques other than those described in the BAT-conclusion and emission levels exceed the BAT-AEL. The emission level in the operator information cannot be automatically set as the ELV (article 15). The competent authority could consider deviating from the application and set the ELV at the upper level of the BAT-AEL or a lower level considered appropriate looking at the technical characteristics of the installation or comparable installations in the BREFs or elsewhere. Alternatively, the competent authority may refuse to grant the permit or require the operator to send in a justified application for an article 15(4) derogation. This must be distinguished from processes and environmental effects not covered by BAT conclusions. In that situation, competent authorities and operators must derive an ELV using the criteria of Annex III IED (article 14, para 6, IED). The operator applies for an article 15, para 4, derogation to use a less stringent ELV than the BAT-AEL. See factsheet 2.11. See factsheet 2.11. In all situations, the quality of the permit application needs to be checked thoroughly: Does the emission level reflect the best available techniques looking at the installation and its activities, the materials and energy and the conditions of the site? Are the proposed emissions reduction techniques acceptable in terms of appropriate design, operation and maintenance and optimal capacity and availability? The BREF chapters on techniques to consider in the determination of BAT and on emerging techniques provide useful information for this check.", "Other sources may also be used, for example: Comparable installations elsewhere in or outside Europe The operator, competent authority or both can investigate the feasibility of applying other or additional techniques that potentially can reduce the emissions. In particular, in the case of general binding rules, information from technology institutes, universities and industry representatives (both the IED sectors and material suppliers/suppliers of emission reduction technology). 139/451 In summary, the ELV is normally set with respect to the actual emissions from the installation under normal operating conditions. This level is a single value, not a range for each operating window/scenario/product. It is within the range of the BAT-AEL and not necessarily at the upper level of the range. The collection and analyses of information by the operator, competent authority and/or legislator (in the case of general binding rules) is aimed at setting the ELV at a realistic, practicable and enforceable level. All activities of the competent authority to define the ELV must be clearly reported, by means of a technical report or included in the permit itself. This justification is part of the requirement to make information available to the public and to enable public participation (article 24, para 2). Article 24 Access to information and public participation in the permit procedure 2. When a decision on granting, reconsideration or updating of a permit has been taken, the competent authority shall make available to the public, including via the Internet in relation to points (a), (b) and (f), the following information: the content of the decision, including a copy of the permit and any subsequent updates; the reasons on which the decision is based; the results of the consultations held before the decision was taken and an explanation of how they were taken into account in that decision; the title of the BAT reference documents relevant to the installation or activity concerned; how the permit conditions referred to in Article 14, including the emission limit values, have been determined in relation to the best available techniques and emission levels associated with the best available techniques; where a derogation is granted in accordance with Article 15(4), the specific reasons for that derogation based on the criteria laid down in that paragraph and the conditions imposed. Step 2 Setting monitoring requirements The IED requires operators to make and submit a monitoring plan as part of the permit application (article 12, para 1j). The competent authorities are required to set conditions on monitoring that enable verification of compliance with the permit. The conditions should cover methodology, frequency, evaluation, data processing, recording and presentation. BAT conclusions on monitoring provide the reference for setting the monitoring conditions. 140/451 Article 14 Permit conditions 1. Member States shall ensure that the permit includes all measures necessary for compliance with the requirements of Articles 11 and 18. Those measures shall include at least the following: [\u2026] (c) suitable emission monitoring requirements specifying: (i) measurement methodology, frequency and evaluation procedure; and (ii) where Article 15(3)(b) is applied, that results of emission monitoring are available for the same periods of time and reference conditions as for the emission levels associated with the best available techniques; Article 16 Monitoring requirements 1. The monitoring requirements referred to in Article 14(1)(c) shall, where applicable, be based on the conclusions on monitoring as described in the BAT conclusions. [\u2026] The monitoring plan should be checked and, where necessary, modified by the competent authority before granting the permit in order to improve the reliability of the plan. Frequently used criteria to check monitoring plans are: \u2022 Conformity with BAT conclusions on monitoring. \u2022 Conformity with the goals of the monitoring, which should meet the goal of the BAT conclusion and verify compliance. \u2022 Consistency of the complete monitoring system, not only the monitoring of separate parameters. \u2022 Inclusion of obligations regarding Monitoring Data Quality Assurance (e.g. UNI EN 14181 for CEMS, laboratory/operators qualification, sampling methods and procedures \u2026). \u2022 Application of CEN standards or, if CEN standards are not available, ISO, national or other international standards which ensure the provision of data of an equivalent quality level. \u2022 Check if acknowledged (legal) persons do the monitoring or at least the testing of the monitoring system. 141/451 Check if the monitoring plan is sufficiently risk-based: The frequency increases with the impact of a failure of abatement techniques. Another approach is to take into consideration the sensitivity of the receptor in question to determine which method to choose based on its limit of quantification and error.", "Monitoring plans can also be compared with existing monitoring programs in similar installations to check the quality. General binding rules often include monitoring requirements. In addition to these general binding rules, details (such as parameters, reference conditions, intervals, reporting requirements and monitoring methods) might be specified in the permit. After the publication of BAT conclusions for a sector, a comparison is made between the monitoring requirements in general binding rules and the monitoring requirements in the BAT conclusions. Based on this comparison, a proposition is made for implementing additional monitoring requirements in the general binding rules. Sometimes BAT conclusions allow alternative methodologies and sometimes operators would prefer to use other monitoring methods or frequencies: Often the least stringent monitoring method and frequency is taken where the BAT conclusions allow alternatives. When existing permits and general binding rules are already more stringent, the existing conditions are reaffirmed. In case of BAT conclusions which provide alternative methods of monitoring, all methods are usually allowed. If the operator proposes an alternative method to the one specified in the permit (and/or in the monitoring plan) he must prove, with the application of international procedures, the equivalence of the alternative method (in terms of LOQ, LOD, \u2026). For the specific situation of another period and/or other reference conditions than in the BAT conclusions (article 15, para 3) in advance it is checked if the method allows recalculation to the same circumstances (reference conditions) of the BAT conclusion. The competent/control authority can also change monitoring methods and/or frequency after the permit issue, depending on the specific situations, the monitoring results, the results of inspections, the number and type of non-compliances, and any incidents/ accidents that have occurred. Individual Competent Authorities/Member States have developed guidance for specific sectors on the interpretation of the BAT conclusions on monitoring. 142/451 In summary, a good quality monitoring plan and a thorough check of the monitoring plan in advance of granting the permit can, to a great extent, ensure that compliance with the permit conditions can be verified reliably. Step 3 Setting compliance rules The IED requires, on the one hand, that ELVs should be set for normal operating conditions (Article 15, para 3) and, on the other, that measures should be included for other than normal operating conditions (Article 14, para 1f). For this, again, good quality and detailed information is needed, for example: Installation specific Permit application (Article 12) Monitoring plan and data (Article 14) Notifications on incidents, accidents and non-compliance (Articles 7, 8). Sector information Background information on the BAT-AELs in the BREFs CEN standards or other technical standards for maintenance, good operation, etc. Comparable installations elsewhere in or outside Europe Article 14 Permit conditions 1.Member States shall ensure that the permit includes all measures necessary for compliance with the requirements of Articles 11 and 18. Those measures shall include at least the following: [\u2026] (f) measures relating to conditions other than normal operating conditions such as start-up and shut-down operations, leaks, malfunctions, momentary stoppages and definitive cessation of operations; Article 7 Incidents and accidents [\u2026] 143/451 (a) the operator informs the competent authority immediately; (b) the operator immediately takes the measures to limit the environmental consequences and to prevent further possible incidents or accidents; (c) the competent authority requires the operator to take any appropriate complementary measures that the competent authority considers necessary to limit the environmental consequences and to prevent further possible incidents or accidents. Article 8 Non-compliance [\u2026] 2. In the event of a breach of the permit conditions, Member States shall ensure that: (a) the operator immediately informs the competent authority; (b) the operator immediately takes the measures necessary to ensure that compliance is restored within the shortest possible time; (c) the competent authority requires the operator to take any appropriate complementary measures that the competent authority considers necessary to restore compliance. [\u2026] In particular, the following information is needed: Reference period: the time period to which the ELV refers, e.g. half hour or daily average, average over half hour sampling period, (non-)continuous process. Reference conditions: the ELV must include reference conditions to be used for the compliance check (e.g. pressure, temperature, oxygen concentration, humidity ...). In principle, emission limit values are expressed for the same or shorter period of time and under the same reference conditions as the BAT-AEL. If not, additional monitoring is required to prove yearly that the level of protection is equivalent. Monitoring methods: for each ELV/emission point, including QA procedure (e.g. UNI EN 14181 for CEMS);", "Other than normal operating conditions such as start-up and shut-down of operations, leaks, malfunctions, temporary stoppages and definitive cessation of operations in order to determine: if emissions from non-routine operations are relevant and different from routine operations, and 144/451 if so (examples from Member States show that this is not always the case), to set higher ELVs for defined parameters and non-routine operations including limits on frequency and duration for other than normal operating conditions in order to make clear when the ELV based on the BAT-AEL applies and when it doesn\u2019t apply. Not all other than normal operating conditions can be anticipated. That is why the IED includes the obligation to inform the competent authority in case of incidents and (possible) non-compliance (article 8 and 9). Based on these notifications the permit conditions may be reviewed to ensure more effective regulation. During one \u201cemergency situation\u201d, usually during a short period after one exceptional event, the operator may exceed the ELV and the compliance rules but should take immediate measures to rectify the situation and identify its causes so that future incidents can be prevented. The operator also has to communicate what happened and the actions that are being implemented to the permitting and inspections authorities e.g. on a 24h limit. Examples from Member States show that general binding rules often do not include rules on other than normal operating conditions. The permits for individual installations cover these conditions. In summary, the challenge in setting compliance rules is to check if other than normal operating conditions leading to higher emission levels are expected and, if so, to distinguish these clearly from normal operating conditions to which the BAT-AELs apply. 145/451 Factsheet 3.01 - Describing the context for inspections Identifying the scope Relevant factors are (in random order): \u2022 Geographical area for which the inspecting authority is competent \u2022 Mission and goals (in general) of the inspecting authority \u2022 The environmental outcome the inspecting authority is trying to achieve \u2022 Statutory tasks, competences and measures to enforce of the inspecting authority \u2022 Applicable legislation, either originated from a EU-, national- or regional level, against which the inspecting authority is competent to inspect \u2022 Obligations to inspect, laid down in specific (EU-)legislation \u2022 Established environmental (national) policy and priorities \u2022 Interests of stakeholders (e.g. NGO\u2019s, branches of industries) \u2022 Public opinions \u2022 Register of activities and installations for which the inspecting authority is competent to inspect (the level of detail needs to be tailored for the Member State): o Sectors of industries o Types and sizes o Numbers and geographical distribution of installations \u2022 Relevant environmental issues (water, air, safety, etc) for which the inspecting authority is competent to inspect \u2022 The inspection resources (financial and human) that are available for the inspecting authority \u2022 Types of inspection activities (control, compliance promotion, information transfer etc) to be covered Gathering Information Information on the following issues may be relevant in this respect: Environment \u2022 Environmental issues (environment, safety, public health, nature) particularly relevant for the area concerned \u2022 Information on the state of and trends in the (ambient) environment (e.g. data from national or regional networks of pollution control sampling stations or monitoring devices) Installations \u2022 Sector-specific issues/needs, e.g. expertise, attitude, culture, compliance behaviour and economics of (industrial) target groups \u2022 Information on the numbers, location and the branches of small and medium sized enterprises in the area that are regulated and falling under the scope of the inspection plan 146/451 \u2022 (Minimum) frequency of inspections based upon (national) legislation or national or local goals. \u2022 Information on individual controlled activities/installations, such as information on: o Legal requirements and permit situation o Emissions/discharges (results from emission monitoring), environmental impact, risk, accidents/incidents o Complexity of installation o Location of installation o Compliance record / behaviour  (inspection history) o Performance record (e.g. Environmental management systems, self monitoring and reporting, safety management systems, audits, experiences of inspection authorities) o Relevant complaints General \u2022 Changes in legislation that need to be implemented \u2022 Quality and enforceability of the requirements in legislation or permits \u2022 Research on types of industry, objects and spatial planning done by third parties (e.g. Universities, Statistical boards or other Inspectorates) \u2022 Coordination and cooperation with other (inspection) authorities o Feedback and evaluation of past inspections o Likelihood of offences (e.g. is there a big financial profit for not complying to legislation) To gather, store and use all this information the inspecting authority should have an effective data management system.", "Software applications are a useful tool in this regard.

Application of BAT Score Definition -1 The installation is exceeding BAT requirements 0 The installation does reflect the BAT requirements 153/451 1 The installation does not reflect the BAT requirements 154/451 Factsheet 3.04 - IRAM The scores of the impact criteria are directly linked to the risk categories and therefore to the inspection frequencies. In IRAM the inspection coordinator decides before the start of the assessment how many highest scores of an inspection task are needed to induce the highest inspection frequency. This is called \u201cThe Rule\u201d. The more impact criteria are used for the assessment the higher the number of highest scores that is \u201cnecessary\u201d to induce the highest inspection frequency. See example below. 155/451 Example Impact criteria and setting the Rule: In the risk assessment for inspection object 1 and 2 the highest score for all impact criteria is \u201c5\u201d which equals to the highest risk category and the highest inspection frequency of (for instance) once a year. If the minimum number of highest score is 2, the inspection frequency of once a year is induced when at least two impact criteria have a maximum score of \u201c5\u201d. In that case the risk category is also \u201c5\u201d. If only one impact criteria has the maximum score of \u201c5\u201d the risk category will be lowered by one step to \u201c4\u201d and the inspection frequency is less than once a year. If the rule =\u201c1\u201d, \u201conly one highest score is enough\u201d, then the Risk category = 5 If the rule =\u201c2\u201d, \u201ctwo highest scores are needed\u201d, then the Risk category is lowered by one step (Risk category = 4). If the rule = \u201c1\u201d, \u201conly one highest score is enough\u201d, then the Risk category = 5; If the rule = \u201c2\u201d, \u201ctwo highest scores are needed\u201d, then the Risk category stays 5; If the rule = \u201c3\u201d, \u201cthree highest scores are needed\u201d, then the Risk category is lowered by one step (Risk category = 4).", "In IRAM, the operator performance criteria (OPC) are used as probability criteria. Their role is to shift the Risk category and therefore the inspection frequency. In case of good operator performance the shift will be to a lower inspection frequency and in case of bad operator performance the shift will be to a higher inspection frequency. For this reason the operator performance criteria can be scored with \u201c-1\u201d (good), \u201c0\u201d (moderate) and \u201c+1\u201d (bad). In case of good operator performance one point is subtracted from each impact score and in 5 4 3 Inspection object 1 IC 1       IC 2       IC 3       IC 4      IC 5       IC 6 5 4 3 Inspection object 2 IC 1      IC 2       IC 3       IC 4       IC 5      IC 6 156/451 case of bad operator performance one point is added to each impact score. By introducing these probability criteria, the impact scores are transformed into risk scores. As a result the inspection frequency will be one step lower or respectively one step higher. In case of more than one operator performance criterion the result of the scoring will be the average of all OPC scores, rounded to the integer. This avoids that the shift of the inspection frequency will be bigger than one step. 157/451 Example Probability Criteria In the next 2 examples the role of the Probability Criteria becomes clear. The influence of a good or bad operator performance is explained for inspection object 1 and 2. The operator performance of inspection object 1 is good: OPC = \u201c-1\u201d This means: 1 point is subtracted from each impact score and the he impact scores are turned into risk scores. Assume the rule = \u201c1\u201d, then one highest score is enough\u201d, so the Risk category = 4 The operator performance of inspection object 2 is bad: OPC = +1; This means: 1 point is added to each impact score. Assume the rule =\u201c1\u201d again, then one highest score is enough, so the Risk category = 6. Note that if the maximum risk category was defined to be 5, then the final risk category for this RC 1    RC 2      RC 3      RC 4     RC 5     RC 6 5 4 3 Inspection object 2 (OPC = +1) 5 4 3 RC 1     RC 2      RC 3     RC 4      RC 5      RC 6 Inspection object 1 (OPC = -1) 5 4 3 IC 1       IC 2       IC 3       IC 4       IC 5       IC 6 Inspection object 1 5 4 3 IC 1       IC 2       IC 3       IC 4       IC 5      IC 6 Inspection object 2 158/451 inspection object will be the maximum = 5. If so desired, the inspection authority can decide on a higher inspection frequency for this specific inspection object. The result is a Risk profile that could be used by the inspector to choose the most important subjects for inspection. Frequencies of site visits in IED After assessing the risk of an inspection object and calculating the risk category, an inspection frequency can be assigned to the inspection objects. Legal obligations with respect to the minimum inspection frequency per inspection object need to be taken into account. The IED sets the minimum site visit frequency for lowest risk installations at 1 inspection in 3 years and for highest risk installations at 1 inspection a year. To make sure we comply with these legal obligations IRAM introduces a so called \u201csafety net\u201d. This safety net will ensure that the inspection frequency for this inspection object will never be lower than the legal minimum inspection frequency. Inspecting authorities should be aware that in order to do a risk assessment, up-to-date information is needed, including data on low risk installations/activities, gathered through inspections (e.g. minimum inspection frequency). Allocating resources As described above the outcome of the risk assessment sets the frequency of inspections. The frequency however doesn't tell us how much time we need for an inspection. A very complex inspection object may take more time to inspect than a simple object. Besides technical complexity we also have to take into account the scope of the inspection: will it be a fully integrated inspection or an inspection only on the most important environmental issues? This last part of complexity, the inspection profile, can be included in a risk assessment model and will give information on the question \u201chow much time will this take me\u201d. 159/451 Example inspection profile Inspection object 1 scores high on several impact criteria:", "Inspection object 2 scores high on just one impact criterion: The (theoretical) maximum of all the scores = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 30 The sum of the scores of inspection object 1 = 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 24 (= 80% of 30) The sum of the scores of inspection object 2 = 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 =  10 (= 30% of 30) \u201cHow much time will this take me\u201d is reported in IRAM as an inspection %. The way to implement the inspection % is to define ranges or inspection effort categories. Example inspection effort category Here the inspection % output is reported as a range of 4 categories in 25% increments. The highest range (100%-75%) is termed \u2018D\u2019 and the lowest (0%-25%) is \u2018A\u2019. If the required inspection time for a full integrated inspection would be 40 hours then: Calculation Resulting inspection effort category Inspection object 1 requires 24/30 = 0,8 = 80 % of 40 hours Category D Inspection object 2 requires 10/30 = 0,36 = 30 % of 40 hours Category B 5 4 3 Inspection object 1 IC 1       IC 2         IC 3         IC 4        IC 5        IC 6 5 4 3 Inspection object 2 IC 1        IC 2         IC 3        IC 4        IC 5         IC 6 160/451 Integrated inspections might be directed where the inspection profile is larger than 50% (i.e. Categories C&D) Inspection on themes (e.g. inspection focussing only on Impact Criteria 3 above) might be directed where the inspection profile is lower than 50% (i.e. Categories A&B) In addition to the required inspection time that is allocated to the different inspection objects, the inspection authority can also use the \u201cinspection profile\u201d to determine the focus of the inspection. Example inspection focus For object 1 this would be the environmental aspects under impact criteria 2, 3, 4 and 5, while the inspection for object 2 focuses on the aspect under impact criterion 3. Another way to deal with complex inspection objects such as object 1 is to work with a multi annual inspection plan: IC3 and IC4 are inspected every year; IC2 and IC5 are inspected every second year additionally; IC1 and IC6 are inspected every third year additionally Normally the total amount of staff available is limited and does not necessarily match with the staff time needed for carrying out all prioritised inspection activities. It is important that we bridge this gap along the planning process and that we give account for this in the inspection plan. We can choose to adjust our priorities. But we may also want to adjust our targets or inspection strategies for certain prioritised inspection activities, or to reconsider the inspection schedule. In any case we need to know the total staff time needed to perform all the prioritised inspections. And we must assess the average amount of time required for carrying out different types of inspection activities. For instance we need to know for each type of controlled installation the average time needed for performing a certain type of routine inspection, including preparation, travelling, the actual site visit, reporting, (possible) enforcement actions and court cases. The enforcement actions (e.g. sanctions or repressive actions) cannot be planned in advance and average time based on experience has to be used. 161/451 This will be dependent on the size and complexity of a certain type of installation and the average compliance record of the sector, etc4. In addition to the inspections outlined above, we must include information on staff time which is needed for administrative and legal support and for follow up actions (e.g. enforcement actions). Often a simple percentage of the total inspection time is taken for this. Resources will also have to be allocated for non-routine inspections (e.g. responding to complaints and accidents). It is important to reserve an amount of time for non-routine inspections. On average the amount of time needed for non-routine inspections could be between 20% and 40% of the total time of an inspectorate. The exact percentage is to be determined by experience, achieving a good balance between routine and non- routine inspections. 4 Inspection units can be useful here. Inspection units can be defined as logical units that are dimensioned in such a way that 1 inspector is able to carry out an inspection within a given time. 162/451 IRAM: The integrated risk assessment method", "The next figure shows the basic steps of the Risk Assessment model. Risk assessments start by first defining your criteria and settings. The criteria and Weighting Factors and Terms are defined in step 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b. Next, define \u201cthe Rule\u201d (the minimum number of highest scores), the classification of the risk category (in combination with the inspection frequency) the legal obligations and the weighting factor for inspections. This is done in steps 3 to 6. These settings are normally made by a coordinator and will apply to all the inspection objects that are being assessed under a specific inspection task. In the final steps (7 and 8) the actual data relating to each of the inspection objects are entered.

Each inspection object is scored against a set of impact criteria, and every impact criterion itself is defined with a set of sub criteria (often with thresholds). In section 2.1 a list of possible Impact criteria is given. If we take the Impact criterion \u201cemission to air\u201d as an example, the set of sub-criteria and the scoring range could look like this: Example emission to Air Score Definition 0 Activity is not mentioned in Annex 1 of the EPRTR Regulation and there are no releases to air 1 Activity is mentioned in Annex 1 of the EPRTR Regulation but no threshold of Annex 2, column 1a, is exceeded and there are no other releases to air 2 Activity is or is not mentioned in Annex 1 of the EPRTR Regulation, no threshold of Annex 2, column 1a, is exceeded but there are other releases to air 3 Activity is mentioned in Annex 1 of the EPRTR Regulation and the sum of the releases to air - normalised to the thresholds* of Annex 2, column 1a - is >1 4 Activity is mentioned in Annex 1 of the EPRTR Regulation and the sum of the releases to air - normalised to the thresholds* of Annex 2, column 1a - is >5 5 Activity is mentioned in Annex 1 of the EPRTR Regulation and the sum of the releases to air - normalised to the thresholds* of Annex 2, column 1a - is >10 * Ratio of release to threshold value In this example the range is set from 0 to 5 164/451 The number of Impact criteria that will be used in the assessment is up to the inspecting authority. This can be different per organisation and per task. Note that \u201cthe Rule\u201d (see section 3.5) is closely linked to the number of criteria that are used and that the scores are directly related to the Risk categories and therefore to the inspection frequencies. Other examples of Impact criteria for IED can be found in annex III. Step 2a \u2013 Define the Operator Performance criteria Along with the impact criteria, the inspection object is also assessed against operator performance criteria, see section 2.2 for examples. Here the criteria are also defined with a set of sub-criteria and a scoring range. The scoring range of the operator performance is different from the one used for impact. The impact is the main driver and can only be adjusted by the operator performance. This effect can be positive, negative or neutral and can be regulated by the scoring range of the operator performance criteria. Within IRAM a range of -1 to + 1 is used. If we take the operator performance criterion \u201ccompliance\u201d as an example the set of the sub-criteria and scoring range could look like this: Example compliance Score Definition -1", "No relevant non compliances of the installation with the permit conditions or violation of the operator duties 0 One relevant non compliance of the installation with the permit conditions or violation of the operator duties 1 More than one relevant non compliance or one important non compliance with the permit conditions or violation of the operator duties An inspection object with a high impact and a bad operator performance will receive more attention than an inspection object with a similar impact but with a good operator performance. Other examples of Operator performance criteria for IPPC/IED and Seveso can be found in annex 2 and 3. Step 1b and 2b \u2013 Define the Weighting Term and Factor 165/451 Impact criteria and operator performance criteria don\u2019t always have the same importance. For that reason, weighting is introduced, so one criterion can get a higher weight in the calculation than another. Weighting terms and factors are part of the steering mechanisms. The importance of weighting is explained in section 2.3. By introducing a weighting term, for example 2, for the impact criterion \u201cemission to air\u201d, a score of 2 is added to the defined impact criterion. That way, we define air as two categories more important than the other impact criteria. In the operator performance criteria, weighting is done with a weighting factor; the criterion is multiplied by the factor. For example, if the weighting factor for the operator performance criterion \u201ccompliance\u201d is 2, the score of this criterion would be multiplied by 2. The importance of \u201ccompliance\u201d is doubled compared to other OPC. Another way to steer is to use a (temporary) ceiling on one or more impact criteria, the risk ceiling. For these impact criteria it will not be possible to give a higher score than the defined ceiling. For example, if we set the ceiling for the impact criterion \u2018noise\u2019 on 3, it will not be possible to give \u2018noise\u2019 a higher score than 3, although the remaining criteria could have a maximum of 5. In this example noise will normally not be responsible for a high risk classification and the resulting inspection frequency (see section 3.5 for risk classification). This step is also part of the steering mechanism. Step 3 \u2013 Define \u201cthe Rule\u201d In step 3 we define \u201cthe Rule\u201d. In section 2.5 and 3.1 we already mentioned that the Rule is closely linked to the number of Impact criteria and that the more impact criteria we use the higher the Rule will be. \u201cThe Rule\u201d is a number (1 or higher) and works like this: \u2022 Rule 1 means: there is only one highest score (of an impact criterion) required to equate the score of this impact criterion to same risk category. \u2022 Rule 2 means: there are at least two highest scores (of impact criteria) required to equate the score of these impact criteria to the same risk category. \u2022 Rule 3 means: there are at least three highest scores (of impact criteria) required to equate the score of these impact criteria to the same risk category. \u2022 If the number of highest scores does not meet the Rule, the Risk category will be lowered by a maximum of 1 step. This step is part of the steering mechanism. Step 4 \u2013 Classify the Risk Category In this step we link the risk category to the inspection frequency. Within IRAM there is a direct relation between the Risk Category and the inspection frequency. This relationship is a policy decision of the inspecting authority, for example: \u2022 RC0 = no routine inspections \u2022 RC1 = min 1 inspection in 5 years 166/451 \u2022 RC2 = min 1 inspection in 4 years \u2022 RC3 = min 1 inspection in 3 years \u2022 RC4 = min 1 inspection in 2 years \u2022 RC5 = min 1 inspection every year The risk category can also be used in allocating (human) resources for different inspection tasks. This step is part of the steering mechanism. Note that this step is not part of the internet IRAM tool \u2013 rather a policy decision for the inspecting authority as to how to use the outputs of IRAM. Step 5 \u2013 Set the Legal Obligations and Policy (safety net) In step 5 we set the legal obligations and or policy (per inspection object) with respect to the minimum and the maximum inspection frequency.", "In section 2.6 we mentioned that this \u201csafety net\u201d is necessary to make sure we will stay within the boundaries of national and European legislation and the policies of an organization. The safety net will limit the drop in the risk category to a defined lowest risk category. This would be the case where the actual result of the risk assessment is lower than a given limit (e.g. if one cannot inspect a given facility less that once every three years). On the other hand an inspection authority may choose a highest inspection frequency that should not be exceeded. In this case a highest risk category can be set. This setting will change the risk category to the highest risk category if the result of the risk assessment is higher than that. These steps are part of the steering mechanism. Step 6 \u2013 Define the Weighting Factors for Inspections With weighting factors for inspections we can influence the inspection profile, see section 2.3). Some environmental aspects (that are linked to a certain impact criteria) will take more time to inspect than others (because of size or complexity). For example if we would set the weighting factor for inspections for the impact criterion for waste management on 2, the scoring of waste will have a bigger influence on the inspection profile.   This step is also part of the steering mechanisms. Step 7 \u2013 Fill in the Impact Criteria scores In step 7 we fill in the impact scores for the inspection objects. The impact scores are combined with the weighting terms. The table below gives a simplified impact score of 2 inspection objects. We use 6 Impact criteria, set the weighting term of Air on 1 and the Rule on 1. 167/451 Impact criterion Air Water Waste Safety Health Quality Weighting Term 1 0 0 0 0 0 Range <0, 5> <0, 5> <0, 5> <0, 5> <0, 5> <0, 5> Inspection object 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 Inspection object 2 5 1 4 1 5 1 For inspection object 1 the score would look like this: The Risk category for this object (without the influence of other mechanisms) would be 4. If the Rule would be set on 2, the risk category would be 3. And for inspection object 2 the score would look like this: The Risk category for this object (without the influence of other mechanisms) would be 6. If the Rule would be set on 2, the risk category would be 5 Note: If the highest risk category is set to \u201c5\u201d also the first result will be 5. 5 4 3 2 Inspection object 1 IC 1   IC 2    IC 3    IC 4    IC 5   IC 6 5 4 3 2 IC 1   IC 2    IC 3    IC 4    IC 5   IC 6 Inspection object 2 168/451 Step 8 \u2013 Fill in the Operator Performance scores In step 8 we fill in the scores for the operator performance for the inspection objects. The operator performance scores are combined with the weighting factors. The table on the next page gives a simplified operator performance score of the same 2 inspection objects. We use 3 criteria and set the weighting factor on compliance on 2. Note that the Rule is only applicable to the impact criteria and not here. From the scores, an average operator performance score is calculated, the operator performance term (OPT). In the table above, inspection object 1 scores an operator performance term of 1, and inspection object 2 scores an operator performance term of -1. The calculation with the weighting factor (in case of object 2) worked as follow: compliance with factor 2 scored two times -1, the other criteria both scored 0. Operator performance term is -2 divided by 4 = -0.5, which is rounded to the integer: -1. In case the weighting factor would be 1 the operator performance term would be 0 because -1/3 = -0.33, which is rounded to the integer: 0. The way the operator performance (term) influences the risk assessment is that it induces a shift on the impact score. The impact scores, combined with the OPT-score (that results from the operator performance scores), give Risk scores! A good operator performance term (-1) lowers the risk, so it leads to a risk score that\u2019s lower than the impact score. A bad operator performance term (+1) raises the risk and will lead to a higher risk score.", "An average operator performance term (0) will not change the risk. If we look at the same inspection objects the graphs (after adjusting the impact criteria with the operator performance term) would now look like the following: For inspection object 1 the score would look like this because the OPT is added to every criterion: +1. The Risk category for this object would be 5. If the Rule would be set on 2, the risk category would be 4. 5 4 3 2 Inspection object 1 RC 1   RC 2   RC 3   RC 4   RC 5  RC 6 169/451 And for inspection object 2 the score would look like this because the OPT is added to every criterion: -1. The Risk category for this object would be 5. If the Rule would be set on 2, the risk category would be lowered to 4. 5 4 3 2 Inspection object 2 RC 1   RC 2   RC 3   RC 4   RC 5   RC 6 170/451 Factsheet 3.05 - Defining Objectives Inspection authorities need to show that they are effective, that their activities solve problems, prevent harm or lead to environmental improvement. Authorities that are unable to show how they make a positive difference may face budget cuts or even run the risk of discontinuation. For that reason authorities may want to introduce targets describing certain desired outcomes and assess their efforts against these targets. The challenge here is to identify outcomes that are relevant, that can be influenced by the inspection authority\u2019s activities, and that are capable of being measured. To illustrate the use of the terms \u201cobjectives \u201cand \u201ctargets on outcome\u201d we can consider a simple situation where an inspection authority wants to see an improvement in the quality of water in local rivers; that\u2019s the outcome and can be set-out as an objective. The objective could be expressed qualitatively \u2013 that the rivers are to be capable of supporting certain species of fish, or quantitatively \u2013 that the concentration of key pollutants does not exceed a particular level. This would be an appropriate objective if the inspection authority can influence the outcome. In this example, the outcome is realistic if we assume that the water quality is mainly influenced by discharges from regulated facilities and that if all of these facilities complied with their permit conditions the objective would be met. This suggests that an appropriate target on outcome would be for the inspection authority to ensure compliance with discharge limits from facilities it regulates. 5 In the real World, some authorities are nervous about setting targets that they are not completely and exclusively in control of. They are worried that they will be criticised if targets are not met because of an unpredictable incident for example. However, it is extremely unlikely that an inspectorate will ever define outcomes that are completely in its control. What matters is that their work is targeted at achieving the desired outcome and that deviations caused by external factors are understood and can be explained. Equally important is that an authority both internally and externally communicates clearly on outcomes achieved and how and to what extent its works has contributed to these. An authority can and should claim successes when it can show that its efforts have led to concrete results. Inspection authorities can decide to use targets on outcomes in combination with targets on inputs and outputs. Targeting and monitoring inputs can help an authority to show \u201cthe price\u201d for achieving certain outcomes or how efficient certain inputs are in relation to the achieved outcomes. Targeting and monitoring 5 Note that in the IMPEL project report, mentioned in section 2.1 and footnote 2, the distinction is made between \u201cfinal outcome\u201d and \u201cintermediate outcome\u201d. One could argue that in the terminology of this guidance an objective describes a desired final outcome, like a certain improvement of the environment. A target (on outcome) describes a desired intermediate outcome, in terms of a certain improvement in compliance leading to the final outcome of improvement of the environment. We have chosen not to use the terms final outcome and intermediate outcome in this guidance, but to stick to the terms objectives and targets as defined in the \u201cDoing the right things\u201d Guidance Book. 171/451 outputs can help an authority to demonstrate the effectiveness of certain actions carried out in relation to the outcomes achieved. The main focus of this guidance is however on setting targets on outcomes.", "It should be noted that in practice not all inspection time will be spent on planned activities and not all planned inspections activities will be linked to targets as defined in the guidance. It should be noted that inspection authorities have to set their targets taking into account the obligations under the IED. It is also important to stress here that inspection authorities primarily exist to ensure compliance with environmental legislation and their interventions are geared to that aim. Compliance behaviour can be directly influenced by supervision interventions, although there are other factors that influence compliance too. Better compliance can in turn lead to an environmental improvement.   It therefore makes sense to set targets which are directly or indirectly related to safeguarding or improving compliance. Improving compliance becomes particularly meaningful when it leads to solving actual environmental problems or reducing actual environmental risks. When an authority decides to start steering (part of) its activities on the basis of outcome targets, it is important that it makes the right choices. It needs to make sure that it has a clear understanding of the legislation for which it is competent, its mission and tasks, and the goals towards which it wants to strive. It should also have reliable, evidence-based knowledge of the current state of the environment so that it can identify areas where environmental problems are occurring. There may be political or community pressure for the authority to take action in all of these areas without regard to their relative importance, their cause, the competence of the authority or the cost of intervening. It is therefore crucial that the authority gathers information to identify the causes of these environmental problems. In particular, it should examine the current state of compliance with relevant environmental legislation. In cases where the problem is significant and mainly the result of a lack of compliance the authority would want to intervene but will also need to consider the resources available to it and the relative importance of competing demands. Equally, when new legislation comes into force, an inspecting authority may want to focus its interventions on those provisions in the new law where a lack of compliance poses the highest environmental risks. It can then set outcome targets stating a certain level of compliance with these provisions to be achieved within a certain period of time. Or when a law has been in force for some time but a certain target group systematically does not comply with certain provisions, thereby causing a high environmental risk, an authority can set a target stating a certain improvement in compliance within a certain period of time. Compliance outcomes This guidance focuses on targets related to the following types of compliance outcomes: improving compliance leading to an improvement of the environment 172/451 This is about raising compliance with certain environmental legislation across a particular target group within a defined period of time, resulting in a measurable improvement of the environment or solving a specific environmental problem. improving compliance leading to control or reduction of risks of environmental deterioration This is about helping establish or improving compliance with certain environmental legislation in order to control or reduce the risks of environmental deterioration. Such a target may be helpful where new legislation is introduced or substantially amended and supervision efforts need to address the most urgent, high risk issues. Under legislation which has been in place for some time, there may be an urgent need to target supervision activities towards a high risk sector of industry with a documented record of sustained poor compliance. In that case a target could be to achieve gradually a higher percentage of all regulated facilities within that sector that comply with certain specific regulatory requirements. Another target could be to reduce the recidivism rate within that sector i.e. the percentage of offenders in that sector that  are found to have violated the law again during a specified observation period. It is usually easier for an inspection authority to show how its interventions to tackle non-compliance have led to environmental improvements rather than how its work to maintain compliance have prevented harm. The community will usually recognise the cleaner air that results from a heavily polluting installation being brought into compliance with emission limits. In contrast, the authority\u2019s work in reducing the likelihood or consequences of another installation failing is unlikely to be noticed.", "One of the major challenges that all regulators face \u2013 and this applies beyond environmental inspectorates - is to effectively communicate about their work aimed at preventing harm and demonstrate that this work is effective. The following figure shows examples of targets on inputs and outputs and the main outcome targets this guidance document is focussing on. 173/451 Since there may be a number of competing areas that the authority could improve through specifically targeted actions, it will have to set priorities, based on an assessment of the severity/scale of the environmental problem/risks in the areas concerned. Targeted interventions will often require substantial resources. The authority at this stage needs to make at least a rough estimate of what the special attention given to the selected high priority areas will cost. It also will have to take into account that some resources will be not available because they need to be allocated to non routine inspections. It may come to the conclusion on output on outcome Equipment Staff Number of site visits Number of measurements Improvement in compliance leading to improvement of environment Improvement in compliance leading to control or reduction of risks of environmental deterioration on input Number of validated emission reports Inspection targets 174/451 that it would be more efficient to use the available resources for high priority areas other than the ones selected initially. For the selected high priority areas where the authority can predict with a sufficient degree of certainty that compliance will move to a more satisfactory level within a certain period of time due to the authority\u2019s interventions, it can set targets. These will state a certain improvement of compliance or achieving certain compliance levels. The authority will also define related performance indicators to monitor on a regular basis the progress in achieving the targets. Before it can set meaningful and realistic targets the baseline situation has to be established; where is the authority starting from? Performance monitoring is only possible when both the baseline situation and target are sufficiently clear. In order to achieve the target, the authority will have to determine the right intervention strategy, i.e. what mix of supervision interventions (activities) it will deploy. For determining the right strategy the authority needs to analyse what factors determine the (poor) compliance. At the stage of establishing the baseline situation it is often useful to gather in parallel more detailed information on the compliance behaviour of the target group which can be used as further input for determining the intervention strategy. It should be noted that when determining an intervention strategy, obligations by law to perform certain inspection activities, may limit the room to use different types of interventions. 175/451 To summarise The two following schemes present the terms used and steps described above in a systematic order. Defining objectives  and strategies Performance monitoring Setting priorities Describing the context Baseline situation Targets Performance Indicators Strategies Goals Objectives Priorities Monitoring with Performance Indicators A goal states in general terms a situation or state of play the authority wishes to achieve. A goal is derived from the mission of the authority and is set on a strategic level. Priority areas are identified on the bases of a risk assessment, looking at compliance and environmental impacts/risks. An objective specifies a goal for a certain priority area. \u2022 A target is linked to an objective and defines a concrete outcome in terms of an improvement of compliance or of the environment. \u2022 Performance indicator on outcome: a quantitative or qualitative criterion stating a certain outcome at a certain moment, used for monitoring and demonstrating progress in achieving a target. The mix of interventions that aim at influencing the compliance behaviour and engaging stakeholders to help achieving the target. Performance is monitored on the basis of data gathered during execution and with the use of performance indicators previously defined. The results of the monitoring may trigger a review/revision of the targets, strategies, actions and inspection plan for the next year. Establishing the baseline situation refers to the process of defining the current situation /starting point from which the target can be defined. The final selection of priority areas will need to take account of the resources (money, staff, skills, equipment, etc) available. Planning- execution Planned/ implemented actions The inspection plan describes the objectives, targets, indicators and strategy; the inspection schedule describes the planned actions. Planned actions are implemented during execution.", "Resources 176/451 1C. Defining objectives and strategies Baseline situation Objectives Targets & Performance Indicators Strategies 1A.

Execution and Reporting Monitoring with Performance Indicators Actions 177/451 Case Studies Setting targets on outcomes In this annex we explain in more detail how an authority can organise its supervision activities by setting targets and monitoring its performance against these targets. We will use a case to illustrate the different steps the authority takes in the Environmental Inspection Cycle as outlined in chapter 2. Introduction of case 1 The case \u2013 described in the blue boxes - is about bringing illegal waste management sites into compliance. This case illustrates that the general methodology set-out in this guidance can be used by inspection authorities across the full range of its competencies, not just the inspection of permitted sites. Targeting supervision activities will often start with the acknowledgement that a certain urgent and often persistent environmental problem occurs which is caused by a lack of compliance. Often such a situation can only be remediated through targeted action by the inspecting authority. In our case, the authority has already made considerable efforts to remedy the issue of illegal waste sites, but these efforts have not had the desired impact on the degree of compliance or the reduction of harm.   A sustainable solution can only be reached by a more focused, targeted approach. Describing the context The inspectorate has worked for a number of years to bring illegal waste sites into compliance or close them down in order to reduce the risks they pose to the environment, communities and legitimate businesses. Last year, over 1,000 illegal sites were closed down which demonstrates the inspectorate\u2019s commitment to tackling this problem. However, the net reduction in illegal sites has been modest because each year new illegal sites emerge. The inspectorate decides that a more targeted approach is required to achieve a significant and lasting reduction in the scale of illegal waste activities. 178/451 In our case the environmental problem is pollution and nuisance caused by waste sites that are deliberately being operated in breach of the relevant legislation. The inspectorate is competent to enforce the relevant Waste legislation. One of the goals of the Inspectorate is to help create a situation in which the operators of these sites either bring their sites into compliance with the legislation or stop operating (either at the original sites or elsewhere).   This goal is based on the overall mission of the Inspectorate to protect the environment by ensuring compliance with environmental legislation. Setting priorities Step 1A: Assessing applicable legislation; Defining mission, tasks and goals of the authority; Gathering data on the environment and compliance In the region concerned there are many legitimate waste management companies who operate several thousand waste storage, transfer, treatment and disposal sites. These operators hold the necessary permits, comply with the relevant waste management legislation and incur the necessary compliance costs. However, they face unfair competition from operators of illegal waste management sites. These sites are often relatively small and particularly associated with the dismantling of end-of-life vehicles, processing of scrap metal and burning and disposing of waste from skip hire businesses These activities cause local air pollution and soil and water contamination. Illegal waste sites close to residential areas also cause noise and odour nuisance. The Inspectorate is competent for enforcing the legislation concerning waste management and disposal. The mission of the Inspectorate in this situation is to protect the environment by enforcing compliance with the provisions of the Waste legislation. 179/451 At this stage illegal waste sites are assessed by the Inspectorate to be a high risk issue and consequently identified as high priority. When it comes to assessing risks of different types of installations, the Integrated Risk Assessment Method (IRAM), developed by IMPEL under the \u2018easyTools\u2019 project, can be useful. The tool works with a set of rules and a number of steering mechanisms. Inspecting authorities can use this tool for free; it is available online through the IMPEL website. The inspectorate in our case makes an estimation of the resources needed for targeting illegal waste sites. The available resources of an inspecting authority may already at this stage constitute a compelling reason for the Inspectorate to adjust its priorities. Note that in our case the Inspectorate has both the will and the possibility to allocate sufficient resources for targeting the problem area.", "Defining Objectives Step 1B:  performing a risk assessment to decide on priority areas, taking account of available resources The Inspectorate is faced with a number of competing demands for its attention and must decide how to allocate its limited resources in order to reduce risk to the environment or tackle actual environmental harm. The Inspectorate decides therefore to perform a risk assessment to determine the issues to prioritise. In the risk assessment, illegal waste management sites score high in terms of environmental damage and the economic harm done to legitimate operators and investment in high quality waste management infrastructure. The inspectorate\u2019s assessment is that resource spent on tackling the illegal waste sites will deliver a greater environmental impact than spending more resource on, for example, additional inspections at permitted facilities. Prior to establishing the project, the Inspectorate performs an initial scoping exercise to determine the size of the task, resources required, the governance arrangements, phasing and duration of the project. The Inspectorate considers that it can make sufficient resources available for tackling the problem of illegal waste sites \u2013 this will involve recruiting additional staff with specialist intelligence gathering and analysis skills, initially on a temporary basis. This is made possible because of efficiency savings elsewhere in the organisation, and the Inspectorate\u2019s policy of maximising the share of its resources directed to \u2018frontline\u2019 activities that deliver environmental outcomes. The inspectorate therefore has labelled illegal waste management sites as a high priority area. Step 1C Given the high priority assigned to illegal waste sites, the Inspectorate sets an objective to bring illegal waste management sites into compliance or close them down in order to reduce the risks they pose to the environment, communities and legitimate businesses. 180/451 The Inspectorate has set as objective to significantly reduce the number and impact of illegal waste management sites.   This is consistent with the more general goal of the organisation to ensure compliance with the waste legislation. Establishing the baseline situations Before targets can be set, it is important to establish the baseline situation. It is about determining the baseline from which the target can be defined \u2013 in our case the number of existing illegal waste sites at the start of the project. It may also include, as in our case, further clarifying the characteristics of the prioritized area: detailed classification of the illegal waste sites, corresponding risk profiles, etc. Step 1C Following discussion with central Government and legitimate operators, the inspectorate decides to establish a task force focusing solely on illegal waste sites. A project structure is put in place involving a project manager, the inspectorate\u2019s national enforcement service, local enforcement teams and oversight from senior managers. The first activity of the task force is to develop the intelligence picture, including confirming the number, type, and risk profile of the illegal waste sites. 181/451 Setting targets on outcomes and defining performance indicators The target in our case is based on the objective to reduce illegal waste sites. The longer term target is to be achieved in 2013 and is, a reduction of illegal waste sites by fifty percent, compared to the baseline of 2011. A number of quantitative and qualitative performance indicators have been selected to help assess progress in achieving the target. Note that the Inspectorate could also have set targets and performance indicators on inputs and outputs. Step 1C The Inspectorate sets a target that the number of known illegal waste sites is reduced by 50% between 2011 and 2013, based on the number of known illegal waste sites in 2011. The  target is very challenging and not only takes account of illegal waste sites known about at the beginning of the project but also any new sites that emerge during the life of the project.   So for example, if there were 600 known illegal waste sites, the aspirational target would be to close 300 sites during the project.   However, if between 2011 and 2013, another 500 illegal sites open or identified, the aspirational target would be to close 850 sites. To monitor what progress is made in achieving the target the following performance indicators are chosen: \u2022 Reduction in the number of known illegal sites (linked to 2011 baseline); \u2022 Number of sites which have been closed or brought into compliance; \u2022 Positive feedback from legal operators and communities (i.e. that they think the situation has significantly improved; fewer reports of illegal sites); \u2022 Feedback from field officers; \u2022 Increase in the permitted capacity or throughput at permitted sites.", "182/451 Defining Strategies The strategy outlines the combination and/or succession of interventions applied. In our case a range of interventions is used: prevention, providing information, transfer of knowledge, disruption, enforcement, communicate progress, spread best practice, engage stakeholders, etc. The selected interventions will often have a different timing and duration, and will require different resources. Together they form a mix, a combination that is expected to help achieve the target. Step 1C The inspectorate after a thorough analysis of the problem, the sector and its compliance behavior decides to apply systematically and consistently the following interventions: \u2022 To develop the national and local intelligence picture on illegal waste sites  to understand both the symptoms and the causes of the problem.   This intelligence will be used to inform both end of pipe enforcement activity and up-stream disruption activities; \u2022 To speed up the closure of sites.   As part of doing this, the inspectorate will ensure that the criminal activity is stopped and not displaced to a new site; \u2022 To engage with the inspectorate\u2019s partners and stakeholders.   This will include working with partner organisations to improve effectiveness in dealing with the problem.   The inspectorate will also work with industry so that they understand their role in helping to tackle the problem; \u2022 To use innovative interventions and approaches to tackling illegal waste sites.   Through this work the inspectorate will understand which are the most effective, leaving a legacy of a more informed toolbox for dealing with the problem; \u2022 To use the project resource to help intelligence-led enforcement gain greater momentum across the organisation.   Where appropriate, facilitate the transfer of knowledge and skills from the project to the wider inspectorate helping to ensure long-lasting benefits.   This will include careful planning and management of the project closure; \u2022 To ensure environmental outcomes are sought, clearing the sites of waste where possible. 183/451 Planning Often the necessary interventions and actions are interrelated and reinforce each other. Almost always they have to be implemented over a period of more than one year to be really effective. Therefore, a target will usually be set for a longer time horizon than one year, as in our case. To manage the project properly it is important to break down the process into several phases and incorporate these in the yearly inspection plans and schedules. Based on the chosen strategy, interventions are outlined and concrete actions are described (indicating numbers, timing and duration of actions, allocated staff, equipment and other resources, etc.) in the successive inspection plans and inspection schedules. The inspection plan will also describe the targets and indicators which have been set. Step 1D The Inspectorate decides that the project will run in three distinct phases: Phase I (November 2011 to March 12) - developing the intelligence picture, including confirming the number, type, and risk profile of the illegal waste sites. Phase II (April 12 to March 13) - acting on the intelligence \u2013 prevention, disruption and enforcement activities guided by the inspectorate\u2019s intelligence picture as well as further intelligence development. Phase III (April 13 to September 13) \u2013 embedding new approaches developed during phase II and closing the project in an orderly transition. A workshop will take place in March 2012 to review the intelligence held by the inspectorate and select the prevention, intelligence and enforcement activities that will be undertaken in Phase II. This planning will be incorporated in the yearly inspection plans and schedules for 2011, 2012 and 2013. These documents contain special sections dedicated to this particular project. 184/451 Execution and reporting, Performance Monitoring and Review In our case a project and taskforce are established to manage the process of organising and carrying out targeted supervision activities. The project is given special, separate attention in the overall yearly inspection plans and schedules of the Inspectorate. The senior management of the Inspectorate and relevant stakeholders are involved and play their role in keeping the project on the right track. The commitment and expertise of the inspectors are sought from the start of the project. A successful outcome is also dependent on the robust implementation of planned project activities, carefully monitoring by the taskforce, well organised collection of data on actions carried out, regular monitoring against the performance indicators and procedure for review/ revision of the project target, strategy and actions. Step 3, 4 and 1D The Special Task force on illegal Waste Sites of the Inspectorate is in charge of implementing the section in the inspection plan and schedule dealing with this particular project.", "The Taskforce is well connected with the inspectors on the ground. The Taskforce checks regularly whether all planned actions are carried out according to the plan and the necessary data coming out of these actions are properly recorded. It takes care of a periodic review of the intelligence gathered, the latest assessment on the number and type of illegal waste sites and resource requirement. Progress is periodically monitored using the performance indicators defined earlier and reported to senior management and stakeholders. Unexpected problems quickly are escalated by the Taskforce for resolution. Thorough project review is foreseen at the end of each year. This may lead to adjustment of the target, the strategies and the actions for the next year. 185/451 The next three cases will further illustrate how in practise inspection targets are used. Case 2: IED In Region A, there are 800 IED installations. To implement article 23 of the Industrial Emission Directive (IED), the Environmental Inspectorate has chosen to work with the Integrated Risk Assessment Method (IRAM) developed by IMPEL under the \u201cEasytools\u201d project. To establish a baseline situation, the inspectorate undertook integrated inspections of the 800 installations following the criteria set in article 23 of the IED.   The information collected allowed the inspectorate to place each installation into one of three risk categories (High risk, Medium risk and Low risk). The Inspectorate wants to focus on compliance as a mean to reduce the overall environmental risks of the installations.   Therefore the criteria \u201ccompliance\u201d, (as part of the operator performance in IRAM) was given a higher weighting factor.   The results of the risk assessment were 20% high risk (HR), 30% medium risk (MR) and 50% low risk (LR). The compliance classification scheme allows the classification of sites into 3 categories: high compliance (HC), medium compliance (MC) and low compliance (LC).

The Inspecting authority performed a general risk assessment (on the level of legislation/tasks) in which the odour problem was scored as \u201chigh risk\u201d. The source(s) of the odour problem was not known. A project was set up as part of the inspection plan to solve this problem over a period of 3 years. 188/451 Describing the context Goals Defining objectives  and strategies Base line situation Strategies Objectives The goal of the Regional Authority is to contribute to a healthy and clean environment by improving ambient air, water and soil, preventing the production of waste and promoting the recycling of waste and securing compliance with environmental law by the operators. By running a general risk assessment the different tasks and responsibilities of the authority have been reviewed. Odour nuisance in the region was identified as one of the highest priority areas. To reduce odour nuisance in region A by mid 2014 \u2022 Target 1: All installations and activities that are identified as the main source of the odour nuisance comply with legislation or permit conditions by 1-7-2014; \u2022 Target 2: The number of odour units does not exceed two on any day in the first half of 2014; \u2022 Target 3: The average monthly number of verified odour nuisance complaints in the period 1-1-2014 till 1-7-2014 is reduced by 50% compared to the average monthly number of verified odour nuisance complaints in the period  1-1-2012 till 1-7-2012. \u2022 Performance indicators: number of verified odour complaints, number of odour units per day, number of non compliances to legislation or permit conditions by installations identified as the main source of the odour nuisance. \u2022 Gathering information \u2022 Building relations and communicating with authorities, companies and local community, \u2022 Inspection and enforcement Yearly monitoring on \u2022 Number of verified odour complaints \u2022 Number of odour units per day \u2022 Number of non compliances to legislation or permit conditions by installations identified as the main source of the odour nuisance.

In the general risk assessment (on the level of legislation/tasks) the high concentration of PM10 got a high score and was therefore considered to be a high priority issue. Focussing on industrial sources, the inspecting authority performed a specific risk assessment on the level of industrial installations, applying an increased weighting factor for fine dust. Ten installations that had substantial fine dust emissions were labelled high risk installations. Estimations showed that full compliance by this specific group of installations with the requirements concerned would result in a significant overall reduction of fine dust emissions and reduce the exceedance of the air quality norm to about 10%.   A special campaign was set up to bring these installations into full compliance. This action is taken as part of a larger programme to improve the air quality in Region C according to EU legislation. 190/451 Performance monitoring Monitoring with performance indicators Planning and execution Monito Perfo Indi Describing the context Goals Defining objectives  and strategies Baseline situation Targets Strategies Objectives The goal is ambient air quality that meets the PM10 concentration that meets the EU Legislation By increasing the weight factor of PM 10 the risk assessment identified 10 installations in the high risk category that potentially emit PM 10.", "To ensure that the PM 10 concentration established in the European norm (max 50 \u00b5mg/m3 day average) is complied with. Target: Four years after the start of the campaign the 10 prioritised industrial installations fully comply with PM 10 provisions in their permit, leading to a situation in which the exceedance of the PM 10 concentration norm is no more than 10 percent in the region. Performance Indicators: \u2022 Actual average level of PM 10 concentration in region B and actual exceedance of PM 10 norm and \u2022 Actual number of prioritised installations in full compliance with the PM concentration ELV on 1-1-2012, 1-1-2013, 1-1-2014 and 1-1-2015 \u2022 Communicating with industry about the project upfront \u2022 Inspections and advise \u2022 Enforcement \u2022 Initiate permit revisions where necessary Yearly monitoring on \u2022 Compliance behaviour of the 10 installations in what respects PM ELV. \u2022 Concentration on PM 10 as a day average.

Organising the process Targets raise expectations both externally and internally, expectations that need to be satisfied. Targets as a steering instrument will require from the authority long-term commitment, discipline and in many cases a change of working processes and culture. In short: introducing targets can have a profound impact on the organisation and how it is perceived. Setting targets is therefore a serious matter and cannot be a stand-alone exercise, separate from the other steps in the process of planning and executing supervision activities. If a target is set in isolation there is a serious risk that it will be ill founded and will prove to be not relevant and/or not achievable. The authority will also need to consider what organisational format is going to be the most appropriate for managing its work. Can these actions best be managed through a specific project, programme or (thematic) campaign or as an integrated part of routine inspection activities? Using a specific organisational format like a project helps in keeping sufficient focus but at the same time bears the risk of being perceived as not part of the core business of the authority and therefore management may be more easily tempted to terminate it prematurely. All important decisions in the process should have the explicit backing of senior management; their continuing support is required to retain commitment from across the inspectorate and to safeguard the necessary resources. Early involvement of staff and key stakeholders is also essential for getting the necessary support for the target-based project and ensuring that it is realistic and understood. For an authority it is key to properly manage its own and others\u2019 ambitions and expectations: it is better to start small, to learn by doing, to engage only in matters you can influence and to be conscious of possible constraints or risks of failure.", "When setting up a project for targeted action in a certain area it is advisable to consider the following issues: Identify the areas the targeted actions can contribute to solve environmental problems or reduce risks Identify and describe the relevant legislation and in particular key requirements and any draft legislation which is likely to come into force shortly; Assess what information is available on the target group, their compliance record and behaviour and the connected environmental impact/risks; Assess what information is still missing and how that information should be collected; consider performing additional fact finding inspections, taking additional samples, making further measurements or carrying out more detailed surveys to collect the necessary information; consider asking inspectors for their expert judgments as an additional source of information; 192/451 Assess any necessary involvement of other authorities; Assess the possible supporting or obstructing role stakeholders (trade unions, consumer and industry associations) can/might play Assess if there will be sufficient expertise and skills available for carrying out the project; Assess how management and staff can be properly informed and trained; Assess how inspectors can be actively involved in the process, including asking feedback from the inspectors at the different stages of the project (on the workload, issues related to data collection etc); Consider establishing a communication plan and appointing a spokesman for the project; Assess the information needs of the different internal and external audiences who have an interest in the project at the different stages of the project. Communication During each of the different stages (i.e. when identifying the area concerned as high priority, defining the objectives and targets, establishing the baseline situation, choosing the right strategy, carrying out the actions, monitoring performance and assessing achievements) good internal and external communication is important. Effective communication is about developing a dialogue that encourages the sharing of information. It involves seeking opinions and feed back, providing information (facts and figures) and explaining decisions and actions. Proper internal communication will encourage everyone within the authority to adopt the same line and create support and commitment throughout the organisation. Clear and timely external communication, for instance by using social media, will make the authority transparent and enables it to explain what it is doing. It can also be used to get the cooperation from relevant stakeholders, other competent authorities and the target groups concerned. Priorities The priorities can be set by using a risk assessment. Different methods for assessing risks related to industrial installations exist in Europe. This information, including the new developed methodology IRAM, can be found in the final report of the IMPEL project easyTools. The authority should also decide which criteria (for impact and probability) are going to be used to assess the priority areas. Although the criteria are likely to remain more or less the same throughout the years within an authority, the weighting factors of the different criteria might change as the environmental problems change. Targets Targets should be set in such a way that progress in achieving the targets can be monitored. The following aspects should be considered: 193/451 Define the targets as SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timely) as possible, taking into account the baseline situation; Select the key regulatory requirements that should be complied with; Select the targeted population \u2013 in many cases a certain segment of the regulated community; Select the proper timeframe \u2013 in many cases it\u2019s more suitable to use multi annual target; Make sure the targets are realistic in the sense that they can be achieved when applying the chosen intervention strategy (compliance promotion, compliance checking, enforcement); When targets are related to risk categories of inspection objects (e.g. lowering the risk category of a facility from high to a lower level) one should previously identify if a high classification is related to a situation an inspection authority has a certain degree of influence on (like compliance behaviour); Make sure the targets are realistic in the sense that they can be achieved given the available resources. Consider setting different targets for different moments in time. Consider distinguishing different phases/steps Performance monitoring An inspection authority will want to know how it is performing in view of the objectives and targets it has set. Especially in the situation of multiple annual objectives an inspection authority might find it necessary to monitor its performance against certain performance indicators. Performance indicators need to be meaningful (i.e. linked to the targets), clear and easy to measure.", "Ideally the monitoring system will make maximum use of systems and data that are already in use in order to avoid disproportionate administrative burdens.   The authority will need to consider whether data needs to be externally verified, how it will be collected, and how often it will be reviewed.   It is important to recognise that monitoring performance won\u2019t just rely of numerical information. Qualitative feedback from the public, operators and field staff can be a valuable tool in assessing performance (and how the performance is being perceived). In assessing the progress made towards the desired outcome, the authority needs to understand the contribution its activities have made.   If outcome targets are missed, does this suggest the authority has not been effective or have targets been missed because of one or more external factors beyond the authority\u2019s control or competence? What are these factors, can their impact be quantified and is it possible to revise the authority\u2019s work plan to counteract their impact? In cases where multiple annual objectives have been defined an inspecting authority might find it necessary to also review on a regular basis if the targets that have been set, are still valid, taking into account changes to resources, risk or population size. Performance monitoring is a process to measure whether you are achieving your targets and objectives. Here are the main steps in the process: Decide which areas you need to measure; 194/451 Collect relevant and reliable data; Analyse the data and turn it into useful information; Understand your performance and assess the need for corrective action. The following aspects should be considered when establishing performance indicators: Comparison \u2013 a single number is not a performance indicator.   It needs to be set in context by comparing with past performance or a future target; Objective \u2013 the data used must be unbiased and complete; Evidence \u2013 the data you are going to assess to identify performance; Degree \u2013 indicators will be more powerful when they can identify smaller changes in performance.   For example, measuring customer satisfaction on a scale of 1-10; provides more information than measuring customer satisfaction as a simple yes / no; Performance result \u2013 measure what you should, can and will do something about; Over time \u2013 measuring performance over time and plotting it on a graph, allow you to identify trends and predict future events. 195/451 Factsheet 3.06 - Inspection strategy To determine the best inspection strategy it can be useful to assess the following elements: Element 1 Clearly define the target group and the rules they have to comply with. Element 2 Gather information about the compliance behaviour of the target group. The aim is to get an insight into the target group compliance behaviour and the motives for that behaviour. The following factors may influence the compliance behaviour of the target group: The familiarity with and clarity of legislation among the target group. The tangible/intangible advantages and disadvantages arising from compliance or non-compliance with the rule(s), expressed in time, money and effort. The extent to which the policy and legislation is considered acceptable by the target group. The extent to which the target group respects the government\u2019s authority. The risk, as estimated by the target group, of positive or negative reactions on their behaviour from others than the authorities. The risk, as estimated by the target group, of a violation detected by persons or bodies other than the authorities, being reported to a government body. The risk, perceived by the target group, of an inspection by the authorities. The risk, as estimated by the target group, of a violation being detected in an inspection carried out by the authorities. The perceived risk of inspection and detection of a violation resulting from being selected for inspection out of a larger population. The risk, as estimated by the target group, of a sanction being imposed if an inspection reveals that a rule has been broken. The severity and nature of the sanction associated with the violation and additional disadvantages of being sanctioned. Table 8, factors that influence compliance behaviour Element 3 196/451 Determining the inspection strategy Based on insights on the compliance behaviour the proper inspection strategy can be determined. Generally speaking the strategy will depend on the specific tendency of the target group to comply or not to comply and the factors that lead to this tendency. The figure here below shows a general distinction in tendencies, motives and strategies.", "Not knowing Not able to Not willing Inclination to comply Advise Facilitate Reward or tempt Inclination to violate Advise in combination with inspection and enforcement Facilitate in combination with inspection and enforcement (Repeated)  Inspection and enforcement Table with the relation compliance behaviour - strategy Communication strategy The inspecting authority can only perform in an effective, transparent and accountable way when it has a communication strategy: a set of adequate provisions and arrangements for internal information exchange and for communication with other authorities, stakeholders and the general public. The general public should have access to information on the inspecting authorities\u2019 activities and environmental performance of the regulated community. Beyond passively responding to requests for information, the inspecting authority should pro-actively issue news releases and otherwise disseminate information. The general public should have the right to provide information to the inspectorate (for example complaints) and to have its concerns addressed. Good communication will allow the inspecting authority to inform, understand, engage with and influence all the people who can contribute to improving the environment. Effective communication cannot be taken for granted, nor does it \u201cjust happen\u201d. It requires a systematic approach. 197/451 Factsheet 3.07 - Inspection plan This factsheet presents the elements for an inspection plan that either are obligation from the RMCEI or are to be considered as good practice. Defined time period and area The inspecting authority needs to develop an inspection plan that covers a defined time period and a defined geographic area. A common time period is 1 year but multi-annual inspection plans are used. As the competence of an inspecting authority is also bound to a geographic area (municipality, region or MS) it is common to use this geographic area also in the inspection plan. Depending on the size and tasks of the inspecting authority sub-inspection plans can be developed covering all a different part of the area. Scope Besides time period and area the inspecting authority should give a clear picture of the scope of the inspection plan. It should describe: \u2022 the tasks, competences and obligations it has \u2022 its mission and goals \u2022 the (national) policies and priorities \u2022 the applicable legislation (EU or national) \u2022 the controlled activities and installations \u2022 the range of different inspection activities that can take place Priorities The inspection plan should describe the method used for the risk assessment, the classification and ranking of activities and installations and the priorities arising from these. This means that besides the outcome also the process needs to be described. In other words the inspection plan should not only give the priorities itself but also the justification how the inspecting authority came to these priorities. Here the gap between available and needed resources also finds its pace. Objectives and targets Based on the priorities the inspection plan should describe the objectives and the measurable targets for the activities. It is important the targets are formulated in a way so they can be monitored and evaluated. Inspection activities 198/451 The inspection plan should provide information on the numbers and types of routine environmental inspections to be carried out, including: frequency of site visits for different types of specified controlled installations key figures/indicators on necessary inspection capacity Strategies and procedures The inspection plan should describe or refer to the strategies and the procedures that will be taken into account. The inspection plan should at least include reference to: \u2022 procedures for routine inspections, which can include site visits as well as other kind of inspection activities \u2022 procedures on reporting \u2022 procedures for non-routine inspections in case of \u2022 Complaints \u2022 Accidents and incidents \u2022 Occurrences of non-compliance \u2022 Inspections or activities as part of the permit procedure \u2022 procedures for coordination between the different inspecting authorities; \u2022 provisions for review of the inspection plan \u2022 agreements with operators on the notification of non-compliances Inspection programme The inspection programme can be part of the inspection plan. The inspection plan however is public available. Therefore the inspecting authority might want to decide to include the programme as an annex or separate document. This way the programme can stay confidential. The inspection programme at least covers: \u2022 a defined time period \u2022 a list of all installations to be inspected, including: \u2022 Inspectors or inspection unit \u2022 Type of routine inspections \u2022 Date (days/weeks/months), time and frequency \u2022", "Amount of time and staff needed \u2022 Co-operation with other authorities 199/451 Sample Inspection Plan; Table of contents Note that some issues are not an obligation according to the IED.

This assessment will show the gap(s) between the required and existing skills and qualifications for job. Based on this assessment a training programme could include the following issues: Knowledge: \u2022 of work and production process within governmental organisations \u2022 of procedures, methods and systems in the field of environmental inspections \u2022 of Industrial sectors \u2022 of the applicable legislation \u2022 of the procedures in court \u2022 of environmental management systems Specific skills: \u2022 basic inspection skills \u2022 sampling of emissions, soil and waste \u2022 assessment of administrations and data management (e.g. maintenance, monitoring, waste management) \u2022 basic information technology \u2022 social skills, especially for dealing with difficult stakeholders \u2022 communication skills to communicate with industry, present enforcement action to the public and provide evidence in a court of law \u2022 management skills to ensure a high quality and effective inspectorate, including planning skills The inspecting authority should look into the possibility for joint or mutual training with staff from other relevant authorities. 202/451 Factsheet 3.09 - Preparation inspection In this factsheet you will find information on the following topics: \u2022 Type of inspection \u2022 Inspection team \u2022 Equipment \u2022 Gathering information \u2022 Inspection tools \u2022 Checklist \u2022 Inspection agenda Type of inspection \u2022 Some considerations that could be taken into account when deciding on the type of inspection, the staff and equipment needed: \u2022 The focus of the inspection \u2013 not all issues might be relevant to inspect; \u2022 The inspection targets that need to be achieved; \u2022 The inspection strategy that has to be followed; \u2022 The complexity of an installation \u2013 complex installation might require additional experts in the team; \u2022 Situations with high risk \u2013 some extraordinary inspections, especially conducted upon complaints, incidents or accidents could lead to higher (personal) risk. Allocating more resources could be necessary (e.g. more inspectors); \u2022 The resources needed (man-power/equipment, safety precautions); \u2022 In relation to the previous point, it is recommended to have a check-list of the equipment needed (including safety gear, sampling equipment in case sample taking is required, laptop if available and convenient\u2026); \u2022 Weather condition as well as the time of a year - some additional equipment might be needed (e.g. torches, protective clothes, etc.). Inspection team Once the complexity of the inspection has been assessed, the inspection team is defined. For the more complex inspections it can be decided to compose a small inspection team.", "It could include core and specialist competencies necessary for the effective performance of the inspection. A leader of the team should be identified, who does not necessarily have a hierarchical role with respect to the rest of the team but is the responsible for coordinating the inspection and drafting of the final inspection report. Equipment The inspection team identifies the equipment needed to perform the in situ inspection and it is regarded as necessary to prepare a set of documents containing at least: 203/451 \u2022 IED permits; \u2022 Drawings of the plant; \u2022 Technical reports; \u2022 Recent self-monitoring report. Gathering information and data Information sources that will help a good preparation of an inspection are: \u2022 Environmental Impact Assessment; \u2022 Application for the permit; \u2022 Environmental permits; \u2022 Applicable legislation \u2022 Reports of previous inspections; \u2022 Environmental reports submitted by operators; \u2022 Complaints received from the society; \u2022 Communications sent by the operator (incidents, modifications, requests, etc.); \u2022 BAT Reference documents - Technical aspects on the production cycle from the point of view of the process, on its articulation in phases and for each stage of the process related flows of material (input and output); main environmental impacts, also in terms of consumption; \u2022 PRTR and other register; \u2022 Information on installations received from other competent authorities; \u2022 Internet (website of company); \u2022 Environmental Management System (EMAS or ISO14001): relevant procedures useful for the inspection and validity of the certificate; \u2022 Maps. Inspection tools On the basis of the evaluation of the collected information the following has to be prepared: \u2022 A comprehensive questionnaire which will be used for the operator\u2019s interview \u2022 A checklist to facilitate the inspection \u2022 An outline of the \u201ccritical\u201d ELV (i.e. those parameters which significantly contribute to the pollution load coming out of the installation) \u2022 The list of BATs (according to the issued permit) which the operator should have installed and operated \u2022 The list of documentation to be provided by the operator (e.g. self-monitoring records, annual reports submitted to the authorities) \u2022 The inspection minutes and report templates (tailor-made for the installation) to be filled in at the end of the inspection \u2022 Agenda of the inspection 204/451 Principles of preparing a checklist A good checklist can facilitate inspections considerably. A checklist is the result of all the information that is assessed during the desktop study (see also section 3.3.1.2, Desktop study \u2013 gathering information and data) combined with points of interest of the inspection. Advantages of using checklists are: \u2022 to ensure all necessary aspects will be inspected; \u2022 a better organisation of the interview and site visit; \u2022 time rationalisation; \u2022 fast assessment of the non-compliance situations. A simple \u201cyes\u201d / \u201cno\u201d if the installation is compliant with a certain provision is often used. This means that the checklist should be prepared in a way that it is possible to answer yes or no. However, it often happens the answer is not so simple - therefore additional space should be reserved on the checklist to make comments. For example to be able to specify location, good practices, problems observed, cause of non-conformity, etc. Also be aware that checklists made for a specific installation and/or specific legislation could  run out-of-date. So always check if the checklist is still up-to-date. Checklists may include: \u2022 the unique number of the inspection; \u2022 the type of inspection; \u2022 the name(s) of the inspector(s) and who is leader of the inspection team; \u2022 the name of the company or inspection object; \u2022 the name and function of the interviewed person(s); \u2022 the date and time (start and finish) of the inspection; \u2022 the inspected installation  and/or area; \u2022 the list with documents that need to be checked; \u2022 the provisions/obligations the operator has to comply with; \u2022 the samples that have been taken during the inspection; \u2022 The pictures that have been taken; \u2022 Space for  notes. A useful tip is to start an interview with general issues and end with the detailed ones. It must be kept in mind that checklists are an important tool but cannot replace the critical mind of an experienced inspector. They can serve as a useful road map or reminder but should not restrict the inspector from changing direction based on unexpected observations. Preparation of a short inspection agenda A short agenda can be a very useful tool that will help to execute an inspection.", "Providing an operator with an agenda in advance may result in more smooth coordination of the inspection from his/her side  because the 205/451 operator will be aware of how many resources and people  have  to be available for the inspector. Preparing such a document before an inspection is not time-consuming. The inspection agenda could consist of: \u2022 Time schedule of each single step of the inspection. \u2022 The type issues that will be inspected (e.g. waste management, air pollution). \u2022 Eventual samples to be taken. \u2022 Distribution of competencies of the members of the inspection team. \u2022 The documents that need to be presented by the operator. \u2022 The installations that will be inspected. \u2022 The staff of the company that will be interviewed. \u2022 Closure meeting of the inspection. 206/451 Factsheet 3.10 - Execution of inspections In this factsheet inspection types are listed with the elements that could be covered during the execution of the inspection. Routine site visits \u2022 Examining environmental impact by following: \u2022 Inspection programme \u2022 EC legal requirements \u2022 Organisational arrangements of inspectorate \u2022 Promoting and reinforcing knowledge and understanding of operator \u2022 Evaluating permits and authorisations \u2022 Monitoring of emissions \u2022 Checks of internal reports \u2022 Follow-up documents \u2022 Verification of self-monitoring \u2022 Checking of the techniques used \u2022 Adequacy of the environment management of the installation \u2022 Additional inspection (follow-up inspection) in case of an important non-compliance has been identified (within 6 months after the initial inspection) Non-routine site visits \u2022 Complaints \u2022 Accidents and incidents \u2022 Occurrences of non-compliance \u2022 (The need for) issuing a new permit \u2022 (The need for) revising the permit Investigation of accident/incident / occurrence of non-compliance \u2022 To clarify the cause and its impact \u2022 Responsibilities, liabilities and consequences \u2022 Forward conclusions to the inspecting authority \u2022 Follow up that has to be taken \u2022 Actions to mitigate / remedy the impact \u2022 Actions for prevention \u2022 Actions taken by the operator \u2022 Actions and enforcement actions 207/451 Other compliance checking and compliance assistance activities like: \u2022 Remote monitoring (on-line inspections) \u2022 Data from Operator self-monitoring (see also factsheet 3.11) \u2022 Theme inspections \u2022 Surveillance \u2022 Remote sensing assessing operator monitoring data \u2022 Organising information campaigns. It goes without saying that non-compliances identified during inspections need to be followed up. However in the case of a serious non-compliance (see annex VIII on graduation of non-compliances) an additional inspection has to be executed within 6 months. 208/451 Factsheet 3.11 - Operator self-monitoring This Factsheet provides practical guidance on the requirements for the recording and reporting of the results of the monitoring of emissions from industrial installations by the operator. Proper monitoring planning, execution and reporting is a fundamental aspect of good operational and environmental management. It is essential for assessing environmental performance and compliance with the conditions set out in environmental permits. This Factsheet covers the requirements and provisions of the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) concerning operator self-monitoring and how this is reported to competent authorities as part of the inspection process. In particular, it addresses the minimum content of the operator self-monitoring report and the analysis and follow-up of the report by inspectors. Self-monitoring (including monitoring undertaken on behalf of operators by contractors) involves repeated measurements or observations, at an appropriate frequency in accordance with documented and agreed procedures, to obtain the required information on emissions. This information may range from simple visual observations (for example, visible emissions to air from doors, flanges or valves, or the alteration of the colour of a discharge) to precise numerical data (such as the concentration or load of a pollutant). Recital 26 of IED states that: \u201cIn order to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of this Directive, operators should regularly report to the competent authority on compliance with permit conditions\u201d. Article 3 (22) of the IED Directive states that environment inspection covers all actions, including verification of self- monitoring.", "Article 14 (1c) of the IED requires that conditions in environmental permits should include suitable emission monitoring requirements specifying: (i) measurement methodology, frequency and evaluation procedure; and (ii) where Article 15(3)(b) is applied, that results of emission monitoring are available for the same periods of time and reference conditions as for the emission levels associated with the best available techniques; Article 14(1d) includes an obligation to supply the competent authority regularly, and at least annually, with: (i) information on the basis of results of emission monitoring referred to in point (c) and other required data that enables the competent authority to verify compliance with the permit conditions; and (ii) where Article 15(3)(b) is applied, a summary of the results of emission monitoring which allows a comparison with the emission levels associated with the best available techniques. 209/451 IMPEL has carried out a body of work to define minimum criteria for environmental inspections. This included guidance on operator self-monitoring6 which stated that: \u201cThe monitoring of industrial processes, their releases and their impact on the environment are key elements of regulatory control. Such monitoring may be undertaken by the competent authorities responsible for inspection duties. Industrial process operators may also be required to carry out monitoring themselves and report their results to the competent authorities. This is known as operator self-monitoring\u201d. The IMPEL project on supporting IED implementation included a working group that looked at operator self- monitoring reporting in 20167. This guidance is based on the report from that group. Minimum content of the operator self-monitoring report Usually, the frequency for the operator to report self-monitoring data to the competent authority is set in the permit to be on a yearly basis. The self-monitoring report is usually based on the content of the self-monitoring plan and/or the permit conditions. The required content of the report is often included in the permit, and, in some cases, there is also a template that sets out the required structure and content for the submission of the report. The monitoring report should include information about compliance with all permit conditions. Emissions monitoring results and waste management data are also necessary to comply with the Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) register. Effective reporting of self-monitoring involves the production of an Executive Summary, supported by the detailed monitoring results (raw data), relevant information concerning the operation of the specific process, and assessment of compliance with the required permit conditions. The raw data should be accompanied by a more detailed description and interpretation of the underlying process trends and conditions. Other relevant information to be presented may include, for example, maintenance measures, data on materials and energy consumption, and the production of waste. The production of the following tools/templates is recommended to ensure consistent reporting of operator monitoring: Description of minimum content and frequency of the self-monitoring report Self-monitoring report templates Identification of the necessary data to comply with PRTR register requirements. 6 IMPEL report on Operator Self-Monitoring. February 1999. 7 IMPEL report on Supporting Implementation of the Industrial Emissions Directive. Project 2016/1, October 2016. 210/451 Analysis of self-monitoring report to be performed by inspectors A common approach has been identified and it is recommended that this should be applied to ensure that key components of the self-monitoring reports are included in the analysis. The assessment of the self-monitoring report submitted by the operator should usually cover the following aspects: whether the report was submitted by the agreed date and according to the required frequency of reporting as set out in the permit conditions the use of appropriate templates for reporting, if required the completeness of data and parameters required, including frequency and extent of measurements the adequacy of the operator to self-monitor its emissions: whether measurements were carried out on-site or not, by the required person or institution (internal or external laboratories, with appropriate quality control, with certification or accreditation, if necessary), by appropriate sampling at specified locations, using appropriate analytical methods and instrumentation, at a clearly defined operation status of the installation a review of calculations and statistical analysis of the monitoring data (especially in more complex reports). The nature and scope of the analysis should include, as a minimum, an assessment of compliance with the emission limit values set out in the permit.  ", "It may also include: a check of overall compliance of the installation with environmental permit conditions an analysis of the trends in environmental parameters (e.g. material and energy consumption, emissions, amount of waste produced) in order to check the operational performance of the installation so that timely action can be taken to ensure that it continues to operate within the definition of BAT an assessment of critical conditions to be focused on in the next inspection a comparison of the performance of the installation with other installations in the specific sector a comparison of the performance of the installation with BAT. Useful tools for the analysis are: appropriate templates for the assessment and reporting on self-monitoring reports to simplify and standardize the analysis use of a (national) database for the storage and exchange of the operator reports and of the assessment process (which may involve several experts) 211/451 independent monitoring to cross-check the operator self-monitoring, e.g. by analysing samples taken during on-site visits, including split samples. As far as the output of the self-monitoring report analysis is concerned, the IED has no specific requirements for the preparation of the report of the evaluation. Consequently, EU Member States use different approaches in the reporting of the results of the analysis of the operator\u2019s self-monitoring: some produce the report according to a standard template and others take a free-form approach, some produce the report as a separate document outside the site-inspection, and others incorporate the self- monitoring analysis with the reports from on-the-spot inspections, in some countries, the reporting of the evaluation is a formal requirement, but in others it is not. In some countries, a report on the analysis of the self-monitoring report is produced only in cases where non- compliances have occurred. In others, a report is produced even if no non-compliances are reported or detected. In these cases, the document provides evidence that supports confirmation of compliance with the conditions of the permit and the requirements of the regulations (such as: compliance with ELVs and other required parameters set in the permit, operator monitoring equipment and regime, accreditation of laboratory, time limit for reporting, frequency of reporting, use of required template for reporting). There are also differences in practice over the notification and release of the inspector\u2019s report to the operator and other competent authorities. In some countries, the inspector may only provide notification that the report has been produced (and that it may have been placed on an inspection database). In others, the inspector\u2019s report is submitted directly to the operator or to the competent authority. Templates for report of the self-monitoring analysis have been developed in some countries. Follow-up of the self-monitoring report analysis The analysis of the self-monitoring report is useful to competent authorities: to check compliance with permit conditions, before going to a site for performing an environmental inspection; to plan a non-routine site visit; to review the environmental risk assessment of a plant; to verify data sent by operators to the PRTR register; to take decisions on interventions that might be needed to prevent environmental harm, such as suspension of the permit or suspension of operation; 212/451 to provide the evidence to support the initiation of penal or administrative procedures against operators that have failed to comply with the law. There are two different kinds of non-compliance reporting in the self-monitoring report: first, the non- compliance is reported by the operator and second, the non-compliance is detected and reported by the inspector. For non-compliances identified by the operator, in most EU member countries, operators have to inform competent authorities immediately when an incident or accident occurs or when emission limit values are exceeded. The competent authority will stipulate what remedial actions need to be taken by the operator to return to a state of compliance and to resolve the problems that have occurred. In these cases, the self- monitoring report should include a compilation of the incidents or breaches that occurred and the remedial action that was taken over a fixed period (usually one year). This compilation can be used to support a new environmental risk evaluation. For non-compliances detected by the inspector during the analysis of the self-monitoring report, there are differences in approach between countries in taking follow-up action. Italy, for example, considers that the detection of exceedances of emission limit values in the analysis of self- monitoring reports is not, in itself, enough to open infringement procedures against the operator.", "The breach has to be confirmed by the operator or proved by means of evidence from the actual sampling and analysis of the emissions. Other countries do take action and may prosecute operators on the basis of self-monitoring data. In the follow-up of cases where non-compliances are detected through self-monitoring inspectors should take into account at least the following criteria: Whether the non-compliance is reported by the operator or detected by the inspector through the analysis of the self-monitoring report. The level of the non-compliance. The assessment of the reason for the breach (through a site visit or by requesting further documentation). 213/451 Factsheet 3.12 - Levels of non-compliance This Factsheet provides practical guidance to assess the degree of non-compliance where this is detected during both routine and non-routine inspections. This will help inspectors to determine the appropriate actions to be taken. There are specific requirements in the Industrial Emissions Directive that address situations where non-compliances are found in inspections of industrial installations. These requirements cover both non- compliances with permit conditions and also complaints, incidents and accidents. This chapter provides guidance on how to interpret these requirements based on work carried out in 2015 as part of IMPEL\u2019s project, \u2018Supporting IED Implementation\u20198. This report also provides some examples of practice in different countries. The project also drew upon a previous IMPEL project that looked at the question of inspections and levels of non-compliance: \u2018Environmental inspections of industrial installations in accordance with the Industrial Emissions Directive\u20199. Tiered approach to assessing levels of non-compliance Three levels of compliance are described: 8 Supporting Implementation of the Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU). IMPEL Report 2015/1. 9 Environmental inspections of industrial installations in accordance with the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED). IMPEL Project 2012/06. Article 23(2) of the IED requires that all installations should be covered by an environmental inspection plan at national, regional or local level. Article 23(4) requires competent authorities to regularly draw up programmes for routine environmental inspections. If an inspection has identified an important case of non-compliance with the permit conditions, an additional site visit shall be carried out within 6 months of that inspection. Article 23(5) requires that: non-routine environmental inspections shall be carried out to investigate serious environmental complaints, serious environmental accidents, incidents and occurrences of non- compliance as soon as possible and, where appropriate, before the granting, reconsideration or update of a permit 214/451 \u2022 A minor \u2022 B significant or relevant \u2022 C important or serious. These three levels are summarised in next overview: Levels of non- compliance Permit conditions complied with? emission limit values complied with? environmental quality standards complied with? Aim of the permit achieved? A Minor cases of non- compliance No Yes Yes B Relevant or significant cases of non- compliance No No Yes C Important or serious cases of non- compliance No No No No (or negligible) offences To be assessed from case to case; measures necessary Enforcement required There is no simple definition for the three different levels of non-compliance and this will ultimately be a matter of judgement, taking into account, for example, the attitude of the operator, the frequency of recurrence of non-compliance, and the extent of participation in the European Union Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) by the operator. Instead, sets of examples for the different circumstances of non- 215/451 compliance are provided for each of the three categories to help guide decision-making by environmental- inspectors on how the level of non-compliance should be reported and what action should be taken. It should be noted that no distinction is made here between important and serious cases. Level 3 refers only to important cases of non-compliance. Occurrence of the most serious non-compliances leading to the closing down of installations under Article 8 of the IED is assumed to be very seldom, and accordingly no definition has been provided for those cases. Each assessment of, and decision on, the level non-compliance should be done on a case-by-case basis. The assessment should take account of and respect other relevant regulations, for example, if it is a criminal offence to operate an installation without a permit this should not be rated as a minor non-compliance.", "Level A \u2013 Minor level of Non-compliance In general, these are cases where: non-compliance presents a low risk of damage to the environment, so within a reasonable period of time appropriate measures must be taken to eliminate the non-compliances; there are only minor violations of permit conditions /legal obligations/operator duties with no consequences for pollution prevention and control; emission limit values, environmental quality standards and other limitations are still met; the aim of the permit (to protect the human health and the environment against pollution and to take precautionary measures against pollution) is still achieved. In these cases, it would usually be sufficient for the competent authority to write a letter to the operator pointing out the minor problems that require attention. Examples: The operations diary is not kept in orderly and up to date. There are missing work instructions. Pipelines are not labelled properly. Documentation of stipulated maintenance work is not directly available, or is missing, or there are inadequate records of the work undertaken, such as data on raw material consumption. 216/451 There are missing data on waste types and waste quantities, solvent management plans, etc. Waste management plans are missing or inadequate. There are inadequate safety precautions at storage units or for the handling of environmentally hazardous substances (e.g. catch basins). The operator monitoring arrangements for emissions are inadequate and fall short of accepted good practice. Emission monitoring reports from the operator are incomplete or do not conform with accepted good practice. The operator monitoring reports show incidences of minor non-compliance. The agreed deadline for periodic reports is exceeded. Other obligations under environmental law for reporting or verification are not met. Level B \u2013 Significant or relevant non-compliance In general, these are cases where: non-compliance may present a risk of harm to the environment or damage has already occurred, so within a reasonable period of time appropriate measures must be taken to eliminate the non-compliances; there are significant violations of permit conditions/violations of legal obligations/operator duties which can have consequences for the prevention and control of pollution; it is unclear whether the emission limit values are complied with; the aim of the permit (to protect the human health and the environment against pollution and to take precautionary measures against pollution) is in question; the requirement, according to Articles 8 (2a) and 20 (1) (IED), that the operator has to inform the competent authority about non-compliances and changes of the operation is not met; there are several or repeated similar minor non-compliances which could be rated as a relevant non- compliance. Examples: Required actions arising from inspection reports are not completed. The required frequency of maintenance work, for example, maintenance work on an exhaust gas cleaning facility, is not complied with. Required reports are missing (from audits, emission- or monitoring reports). 217/451 The annual emission monitoring report required by Art.14 para. 1 (d) IED is not made available, if requested, or the deadline for the periodic report is significantly exceeded. Continuous monitoring of emissions is severely deficient, there is a failure of monitoring systems, the monitoring equipment is not operational or does not exist at all. Safety precautions at storage units or for the handling of environmentally hazardous substances (eg, catch basins) are missing. The operator does not hold a permit for a mode of operation where this would normally be required; this may have consequences for the control of emissions. There has been a series of ongoing minor non-compliances that have not been addressed and resolved. Level C - Important cases of non-compliance In general, these are cases where: non-compliance results in substantial harm to the environment or presents a serious risk of doing so; immediately appropriate measures must normally be taken to resolve the cases of non-compliance; there are serious violations of permit conditions, legal obligations, or operator duties which can have consequences for the prevention and control of pollution; emission limit values, environmental quality standards or other limitations are not met; the aim of the permit (to protect the human health and the environment against pollution and to take precautionary measures against pollution) is not met; there are several or repeated similar relevant non-compliances that could be rated as a serious non- compliance; there is violation of an environmental quality standard or non-compliance that could result in harm to the environment and human health. non-compliance is very important in terms of complaints and public perception.", "Examples Operation of an installation without a permit or a substantial change of an installation is made without necessary changes to the existing permit. Maintenance or monitoring of environmentally relevant parts of the installation is not carried out by the operator. 218/451 The maximum permitted waste storage capacity of the installation is exceeded. There is a malfunctioning of filter installations or protection systems leading to significant exceedance of emission limit values. Hazardous (liquid) waste is stored on unprotected soil. Old, single-walled sub-soil pipelines for hazardous substances may be in use without proper protection against corrosion. The operation of the plant presents \u2018imminent danger\u2019 to the environment. Emission control systems or wastewater treatment systems are not functioning. There are exceedances of emission limit values (based on BAT-AELs) that could lead to significant impacts on public health and environment. Important cases of non-compliance leading to an additional site visit The decision on whether a non-compliance should lead to an additional site visit should be supported by an assessment of the risk presented by the process or activity. Section 6.2 of the combined guidance gives further information on this. If a non-compliance detected during a routine inspection presents a higher degree of risk to the environment and human health than that identified in the existing risk assessment, then this non-compliance is considered to be important and an additional inspection within six months would be required as set out in article 23(4) of the IED. It should be noted that leaving the EMAS scheme or enlarging the production capacity may lead to a higher inspection frequency, but is not, in itself, a case of non-compliance. So, this will not lead to an additional site visit according to Art. 23(4) IED). The risk assessment should be updated (directly) after each inspection. A higher inspection frequency could be the outcome. However, the update of the full inspection program can be done later, according to the practice of the competent authority (for example each year). It is recommended that where an additional site visit is carried out this does not lead to the inspection cycle being changed. The next regular site visit should be performed at the planned date according to the last 219/451 determined inspection frequency. If the next routine site visit is planned within the next six months, it may be combined with the necessary additional on-site inspection. Possible action to be taken in the case of non-compliance Decisions on the appropriate action to be taken in the case of non-compliance will depend on the impact on human health and the environment as well as the operator performance. Possible measures that can be taken by the authority include: writing a letter to the company demanding a rehabilitation plan/technical measures putting seals on devices partially or full closing down a plant or activity administrative fines info potential environmental impact letter warning c lose down a dministrative fines punish bad operator performance Reaction of the administration to non compliances 220/451 notification to prosecutors imprisonment. If a non-compliance is observed several times in the same year, the competent authority can adopt a partial and/or temporary closure of installation, depending on the environmental impact of the non-compliance. In some countries, individual cases of non-compliance are recorded on a database, collected over one year and then assessed. Less-compliant sites will pay a surcharge on their annual charge, while operators with perfect compliance records may receive a discount. Another result could be a changed inspection frequency. It should be kept in mind that the judgement and the experience of the inspectors is a very important factor when assessing and classifying cases of non-compliance. While they are useful to support decision-making, technical definitions of non-compliance levels are not sufficient on their own for a realistic assessment. 221/451 Factsheet 3.13 - Cessation of operations, bankruptcy and site closure This Factsheet provides practical guidance on the requirements and provisions in the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) concerning the cessation of operations of installations and site closure. There may be several different reasons why operations are terminated and these are often difficult to foresee. The guidance is aimed at helping regulators recognise the signals and then to take appropriate action. It also covers the role of financial guarantees and cessation/ decommissioning plans. Where there is a risk of soil and groundwater contamination, there is also a requirement in the IED for the operator to produce a Baseline Report and to take remedial action to restore the site to its former condition.", "This is covered in factsheet 2.07 Article 11(h) requires that the operator takes the necessary measures upon definitive cessation of activities to avoid any risk of pollution and return the site of operation to the satisfactory state defined in accordance with Article 22. Article 14(f) relates to permit conditions and requires that measures are taken relating to conditions other than normal operating conditions such as start-up and shut-down operations, leaks, malfunctions, momentary stoppages and definitive cessation of operations. Article 22 covers the provisions for site closure, including the requirement for the production of a Baseline Report in cases where there is a possibility of soil and groundwater contamination. It requires the operator to assess the state of soil and groundwater contamination by hazardous substances and to take remedial action where significant pollution has been caused. Article 24(3) refers to access to information and public participation in the permit procedure. It requires the competent authority to make available to the public relevant information on the measures taken by the operator upon definitive cessation of activities in accordance with Article 22 The guidance in this Factsheet was developed as part of the IMPEL project on IED implementation. Further details and examples of practices in individual countries can be found in the 2015 report of this project10. How to find out whether a company is heading towards bankruptcy Bankruptcy is difficult to foresee. Usually the competent authority doesn\u2019t receive information about difficulties in operations from companies. 10 IMPEL Project on Supporting IED Implementation. Project No. 2016/01. 6 December 2015. 222/451 The following \u2018weakness signals\u2019 can be taken in account in assessing whether a company is at risk of imminent bankruptcy: No annual reports being produced. Temporary closure of the company or simplification of operations, significant changes in amount of staff and reduction in salaries. Many non-compliances and no effort from the company to tackle them (because they don\u2019t have the money). Problems in day-to-day operation. Weakness signals be reflected in the risk assessment of the company. No payment of required fees, for example, the annual inspection fee. Financial guarantees Experience shows that in the case of bankruptcy and/or site closure there are not enough resources to finance all measures needed to safeguard the environment.   In such cases, early preservation of financial resources through insurance, financial guarantees, bank guarantees or other means (such as environmental funds) could help both operators and competent authorities in rehabilitation of the environment, closure of installations and after-care measures. The financial guarantee is not obligatory but should be seen as be a good tool to take care of problems arising when companies have to close down, especially in bankruptcy cases; examples of good practices can be found in many countries, for example: Environmental fund \u2013 funded by fines (50%) issued to companies because of infringements of environmental law (Portugal). Financial guarantee is mandatory in Italy upon IED implementation for all IED plants\u2013 national decision (awaiting decree); up to now financial guarantee is required for waste treatment plants but it will be mandatory for IED sites which manage and discharge hazardous substances (Baseline report). In Xunta de Galicia (Spain) a financial guarantee is needed for: Companies producing waste and waste management companies All IED installations will need to have a guarantee in 2 years\u2019 time. In Finland, a financial guarantee is mandatory only for waste management sites: The amount of money is calculated based on the size of the site and the cost of the cessation operations (monitoring of the site for 30 years). 223/451 In The Netherlands, a financial guarantee is mandatory for underground storage tanks containing petrol or gasoline type of liquids and landfills. In the Czech Republic, a financial guarantee is mandatory only for landfills (both IED installations and smaller sites). In Austria, financial guarantees can be mandatory or optional measures or they may not be possible, depending on the type of installation and the relevant material law; under the mining law financial guarantees are foreseen for mining activities schedule, mining installations and waste facilities of category A. In Croatia, a financial guarantee is needed before granting a permit for waste management installations and before granting notifications for trans-frontier shipments of waste. In Iceland, the guarantee is requested before a permit for waste management installations is issued. Also, an insurance of up to 1 million Special Drawing Rights (1 US$ is approximately 0,72 SDR) is needed for installations that can possibly cause pollution in the ocean or on the coastline.", "In Germany (Bremen), financial guarantees are required for Windmills on public ground and for waste treatment installations dealing with waste that cannot be sold on the market, especially waste incineration plants. In Romania, financial guarantees are required for landfills (both IED and smaller sites) and for mining activities. In Cyprus, financial guarantees are required before granting the permit; the guarantees are used to cover possible environmental damage or to handle untreated waste (for example after bankruptcy) and are mandatory for IED Installations and for waste management. In Slovenia, financial guaranties are used for very limited types of installations and are mandatory only for landfills of waste. More detailed information on these examples can be found in Part 2 of the IMPEL 2015 IED Implementation Project report. The report also documents a survey of methodologies, guidance and tools for determination of financial guarantees used in different countries. To encourage the competent authorities to use such tools the Member States can make use of art. 14 of Environmental Liability Directive (this provides an encouragement to Member States to put up a financial security system). IED installations are included in the Annex III of the Environmental Liability Directive. In the transposition of the Environmental Liability Directive, seven member states (Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Portugal and Spain) decided to establish in their national legislation on Environmental Liability a system of mandatory financial security provided in article 14 of the Directive. In some countries, actual implementation of the system is still to be developed in regulation which shall specify the form and the extent of the security, conditions for using the security, rules of accounting and keeping the records of it, and rules of the environmental protection insurance. 224/451 Definitive cessation of operations The 2015 IED Implementation Project report provides arrange of examples of how to implement the requirements of the IED on definitive cessation. These include Finland, Romania and Xunta de Galicia (Spain). The Finnish examples illustrated the cessation and demolition of a Large Combustion Plant while the Romanian examples referred to a cessation plan included in an IED permit.   The case of Xunta de Galicia (Spain) referred to a chemical plant (squalane production). Cessation conditions included in an IED permit granted to a refinery in Romania are: \u2022 Operational permits are very detailed \u2022 In each permit, there is an obligation for cessation plan \u2013 the plan must be agreed by the EPA and is a part of the permit \u2022 Contains both general and particular conditions \u2022 The particular conditions for a refinery: \u2022 Preliminary activities \u2022 Cessation of the installation \u2022 Leakage flow from pipes, hazardous substances \u2022 Maintenance/conservation \u2022 Dismantling of installation/equipment \u2022 Demolition \u2022 Remediation actions Minimum content of a cessation/decommissioning plan To avoid the contamination of the environment in the case of definitive cessation of operation, the permit granted by the competent authority shall contain conditions and measures that the operator must comply with. As good practice, the permit shall contain a cessation/decontamination plan and not only conditions (in most cases a few lines in the permit). In this way, the permit will be more enforceable. The IMPEL 2015 IED Implementation Project report provides examples of decommissioning plans in different countries. An example of a decommissioning plan for an IED chemical plant was given by Sardinia Region (Italy). This plan consists of: \u2022 Risk analysis and risk management \u2022 Activity description, including storage of raw materials and wastes, treatment of waste water, etc. \u2022 Health, security and environment monitoring \u2022 Waste management plan and plan for recoverable materials. No guidelines have been identified at EU level on the minimum content of a cessation/ decommissioning plans. Therefore, as good practice, it is recommended that the following items should be considered in drafting such plans: \u2022 The cessation/decommissioning plan is usually prepared in the permit phase (permit recast) 225/451 \u2022 It must be approved by the relevant authorities \u2022 Minimum aspects that the cessation of the plant must contain: o History of the activity of the company \u25aa Operational time \u25aa Evolution of plant engineering, structural expansions, new equipment etc. \u25aa Information about remediation or similar activities \u25aa Information about accidents \u25aa The context in which the plant is running \u25aa Identification of possible sources of environmental pollution (reservoirs / tanks / pipes / underground facilities) \u25aa Procedures provided for the disposal of pollution sources identified \u25aa Pollution prevention and reduction for the protection of the environmental compartments (Air, Water, Soil) \u2022", "Additional criteria could be: o Waste management and management of hazardous materials during closure \u25aa Focus on hazardous waste \u25aa Recovery or disposal \u25aa Foreseen production of waste \u25aa Demolition waste and storage o Monitoring of emissions to the environment during and after the closing of installations \u25aa Frequency of sampling and what parameters should be monitored o Remediation actions on contaminated compartments \u25aa Quantified comparison with baseline report \u25aa Assessment of the state of the environment - soil and groundwater o Information about the maintenance/demolition of the site (buildings, etc.) o Measures for landscaping (does not always apply). 226/451 IED Article 23 (6) obliges Member States to take the following actions: Following each site visit, the competent authority shall prepare a report describing the relevant findings regarding compliance of the installation with the permit conditions and conclusions on whether any further action is necessary. The report shall be notified to the operator concerned within 2 months of the site visit taking place. The report shall be made publicly available by the competent authority in accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information within 4 months of the site visit taking place. Article 23 (6) also requires that the competent authority should ensure that the operator takes all the necessary actions identified in the report within a reasonable period (this is relevant to the provisions on action to be taken in the case of non-compliance covered in Article 8(2) of the IED). 227/451 Factsheet 3.14 - Reporting of inspection findings This Factsheet provides guidance on the requirement in Article 23(6) of the Industrial Emissions Directive that competent authorities should make their reports on inspections publicly available. It covers the structure of the report and provides information on good practice for the reporting of inspections. This guidance draws on work carried out as part of the IMPEL project on IED implementation, reported in 201511. The report from the 2015 project also contains examples of inspection reports produced in different countries. This is a useful reference to support this guidance. Interpretation of requirements of the IED for reporting of inspections This guidance interprets the specific requirements of IED Art.23 (6) as follows: The report is the key document in setting out the findings of an inspection. The report should be notified to the operator. It should be noted that an inspection can involve more than one site visit. It is also possible that relevant inspection results (e.g. monitoring results) are not immediately available after the site visits. In these cases, the report has to be sent to the operator 2 months after the first site visit with a follow-up when the further results are available. 11 Report on IMPEL Project on supporting IED implementation, 2015. Project number: 2015/01. IED Article 23 (6) obliges Member States to take the following actions: Following each site visit, the competent authority shall prepare a report describing the relevant findings regarding compliance of the installation with the permit conditions and conclusions on whether any further action is necessary. The report shall be notified to the operator concerned within 2 months of the site visit taking place. The report shall be made publicly available by the competent authority in accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information within 4 months of the site visit taking place. Article 23 (6) also requires that the competent authority should ensure that the operator takes all the necessary actions identified in the report within a reasonable period (this is relevant to the provisions on action to be taken in the case of non-compliance covered in Article 8(2) of the IED). 228/451 The report should be made publicly available. Reports of routine and non-routine inspections have to be made proactively available (for instance on the internet) 4 months after the site visit. If the 4 months pass and the results are not yet available then only the relevant findings should be mentioned and followed-up later when the results become available. Recommended structure of the inspection report The following recommended structure of inspection reports is considered to be good practice for fulfilling the reporting requirements of the IED. It is suitable for active publishing on the internet.", "Inspectorates may also wish to include other (optional) aspects, for example: a full form report; a description of the scope of the inspection (what was and was not inspected); and other assessments, for example, data audits and the results of non-routine inspections. (i) Description of the inspection carried out, to include: \u2022 Inspection basis (permit, legal regulations) \u2022 Competent inspection authority and cooperating inspection authorities \u2022 Type of installation (e. g. power plant or chemical plant) \u2022 Operator (Name of the company) \u2022 Address \u2022 Date of inspection \u2022 Length of inspection time \u2022 Scope of the site inspection (e. g. integrated inspection, media that were inspected, parts of the installation that were inspected) \u2022 Expected or unexpected site inspection (ii) Results of the inspection and compliance assessment This should be reported according to the guidance provided on assessing the levels of non-compliance, covered in Fact Sheet 3.11: \u2022 No or only minor non-compliances \u2022 Significant or relevant non-compliances \u2022 Serious or important non-compliances (iii) Action taken This may include a range of measures that are initiated dependent upon the degree of non-compliance, including: warning letter, (supplementary) decree, fine, closing down of (parts of) the installation, cancellation of the permit. 229/451 It should be noted that inspection reports for publication should not contain information that violates the rights of third parties, such as protected data, and confidential information on information on industrial and business activities. Good practice for reporting of inspections The following guidance on good practice for reporting was developed as part of IMPEL\u2019s 2015 project on IED implementation. Procedure \u2022 Information should be made available for the public in a proactive way (on internet). \u2022 Although not the main reason, publication of inspection reports can be used to increase compliance promotion. \u2022 More and more Member States publish via the internet and in the spirit of more transparency. This approach to publication is considered to be the way forward. \u2022 It is an important principle that there should be transparency in reporting and that therefore the inspection reports should be made public for a minimum period of time (taking into account local legal obligations). \u2022 Three years is considered as a minimum publication period as it fits with the inspection cycle (all installations have to be inspected within three years). Content \u2022 The level of understanding of the published report should be targeted to the general public. \u2022 There should be only one inspection report. A summary of the report can be extracted for publication. \u2022 The summary should contain the basic information, without too many technical details, and not more than 1 to 3 pages in length. A fixed template should be used. \u2022 Information on the type of inspection (scope and depth) should be included in the report (full, partial (some areas), random sample check, in depth\u2026) \u2022 As a minimum, only cases of non-compliance need to be included in the published report. \u2022 There should be opportunity given to the company to react in the publication: Before: it is a good practice to use the legal obligation to notify the inspection report to the operator (within 2 months) for seeking comments on it (for example, possible mistakes, sensitive commercial information, privacy legislation). The operator should have a minimum time to do so.   Two months is considered to be reasonable. \u2022 After: once the report is published on the internet, it is final and no further opportunity should be given to the operator to give comments. \u2022 The action taken to resolve the non-compliance should be included in the next inspection report as this finding is the result of a new inspection. This will help to motivate the operator to act quickly. 230/451 \u2022 When reporting the follow-up action required by the IED, both the actions of the operator and enforcement actions of the inspector\u2019s organisation should be mentioned. As a good practice and to avoid potential problems in subsequent judicial action, it is recommended that details on future enforcement actions should be reported but kept to a minimum. \u2022 The name of the inspector should not be included in the inspection report, only the name of the inspection organisation. \u2022 In the case that the site visit lasts more than one day, the last day of the site visit should be taken as the starting point for the periods for notification to the operator (within 2 months) and for making available to the public (within 4 months).", "Annex IV Doing the Right Things Permitting Project Meeting, Prague, 7 March 2017 Subject: 4th project team meeting Doing the right things for Permitting Date: 7 March 2017 Time: 09:30 \u2013 18:00 Location: Czech Environmental  Inspectorate \u2013 Na B\u0159ehu 267, Praha 9 Participants: Tony Liebregts, The Netherlands (chair and project leader) Rob Kramers, The Netherlands Birna Guttormsd\u00f3ttir, Iceland Katja Buda, Slovenia Helena Kamenickova, Czech Republic 231/451 Thomas Augustin, Czech Republic Judith Adamov\u00e1, Czech Republic Caroline Murphy, Ireland Horst B\u00fcther, Germany Elisabete Dias Ramos, Portugal Minutes Subject Annotation 1 Welcome and opening of the meeting Tony opened the meeting. Program of the meeting was adopted 2 Tour the table/ experience / expectations Birna: Experience is good, done a lot since the start. Manage to go a bit further, this meeting we will be looking at the structure and try to steam line this with the project of Horst. Katja: Important to be in contact with other organisations, we have done a lot of work last year, this year we have to go further with the guidance, very interested in the IED project of Horst and have to make sure we connect well with our project to avoid overlap. Helena: to continue with the work we started and develop the guidance Thomas: is very interested to take part, is also involved in the project of Horst. Judith: it necessary to learn more about the targets of the permit writer and start working together. Caroline: A lot of work has been done and eager to get started with the guidance Elisabete: The guidance structure seems already very consistent and hopes that today we can make it even better. Further to exchange ideas with the IED project and see how we can connect both projects. Horst (project leader for IED project and chair of the expert group air and industry): Both projects (IED Implementation and DTRT-P) met in in Cologne in Dec 2016 and decided to work together. We need to see how we can develop 1 guidance. The Baseline report and derogations are also projects that needs to be included in such a guidance. Rob: hopes we can decide on the project plan and the structure of the guidance in close cooperation with the IED implementation project. Tony: expects active contribution from the project team members, that experience and good practices can be taken on board so our colleagues of IMPEL have a great guidance. Where are in close connections with the project of Horst, to see how we integrate the projects. 3 Project plan Project plan was adopted with the following changes: \u2022 Add 2 more project team members: Alfredo and Elisabete \u2022 Project team meetings will be held in: \u2022 2nd meeting in Dublin on 9 May \u2022 3rd meeting in Ljubljana or Helsinki on 29 June \u2022 4th meeting in Reykjavik or Rome on 19 Oct \u2022 Workshop will be held in Portugal (Lisbon) on 26 \u2013 29 Sept 232/451 \u2022 On communication, the abstract will be added and the workshop date will be placed on the IMPEL website. 4 IED Implementation project Horst presents the IED implementation project: IED Implementation is mutual joint visit of industry inspectors and regulators to achieve a level playing field in the implementation of the IED. IMPEL now consists out of the following Expert teams - Industry and Air (IED implementation project) - TFS and waste - Water and land - Nature protection / Green IRI - Cross cutting (DTRT-P project) Why IED implementation project: \u2022 IED implementation was an important issue for the member states \u2022 Technical working group wanted country visits to look at the implementation of the IED. \u2022 There was a call for joint inspections \u2022 We needed a guidance book of good practices Question the project is asking itself: how should a guidance book look like so it can also be used for training. The UE commission is asking IMPEL to come with proposals how start with trainings for the implementation of legislation Outcome of the project: create  a Level playing field by: \u2022 Identify implementation gaps \u2022 Learning from other countries \u2022 Mitigation of non-compliance with the IED \u2022", "Application of BAT conclusions \u2022 Development of good practice examples \u2022 Common understanding of inspections \u2022 Development of inspection tools \u2022 Appropriate public participations Themes of the working groups: Finished \u2022 Compliance assessment with levels of non-compliance \u2022 Reporting to the public / public participation surveys \u2022 Dealing with installations closing don / bankruptcy \u2022 BRAF\u2019s application of BAT \u2022 Self-monitoring and operator reporting On-going \u2022 Inspection tools \u2022 Definitions \u2022 Horizontal aspects of permitting \u2022 Joint inspections \u2022 BAT in industrial waste water Still to start 233/451 \u2022 Application of art 18 (ELV\u2019s and air quality limits) \u2022 Involvement of the inspector in the BREF cycle \u2022 Minimum Risk Criteria and inspection \u2022 Application of emission range / narrative BAT More information can be found in annex 1 5 Structure DTRT-P guidance Rob presented the structure of the guidance. The structure and chapter of the guidance is following stepping stones of the Doing the right things cycle for permitting (outcome of the workshop). The stepping stones are discussed in the meeting and still found as a good basis of the guidance. The meeting was happy with how the structure looks at the moment. Some of the more important comments were: - Be clear for whom the information is. Present this for every step - The priority step misses sections on the priorities for types of permits and priorities to changes in BREF\u2019s and revisions of permits - Give more attention to possible changes in the working plan. Its\u2019 important to put some flexibility in the work plan. 6 Content of DTRT-P guidance Discussion started how to combine both projects and develop a common guidance. DTRT-P is focussing on permitting. DTRT for inspection is focussing on inspections. They overlap where the inspector is involved in the permitting procedure. The IED implementation is focussing on permitting, inspection and obligations of industry. This part overlaps DTRT-P and DTRT-I (with respect to IED). The industry part is not covered by either DTRT-P or DTRT-I. See picture The meeting agreed that we will develop 1 guidance containing 3 parts Part 1. Permitting Part 2. Inspection Part 3. Every other business / Industry DTRT-P DTRT-I IED implementation impleme 234/451 It will be written in a way that it can be used as training material and easy to put online. For every step, 1 page will be dedicated. All other information will be linked to the steps in the annex. 7 Actions to be taken \u2022 2nd project team meeting (9 May): Caroline will cheack availability. This ia already done and its possible. \u2022 3rd project team meeting (29 of June): Horst and Katja will check availability \u2022 May meeting: Caroline has checked availability \u2022 4th project team meeting (9 October): Birna will check the costs having the meeting in Iceland \u2022 Workshop (26 \u2013 29 Sept): Elisabete will check if its possible to host this in Lisbon \u2022 Project team (all) will give information and good practices on the topics that are still open before the 9 of April 235/451 Annex 1 236/451 237/451 238/451 Annex V.

Welcome by Teresa Cazzaniga Ms Cazzaniga warmly welcomed the IMPEL Project to Milan and said that ARPA Lombardia was very pleased to be able to host the meeting.   She expressed the wish that everyone would have a comfortable stay in Milan and above all that the meeting would have very successful discussions and outcomes. Ms Cazzaniga described the context of Lombardia.   Lombardia is the first Italian region for population and for the number of local institutions, the second for population density (only after Campania) and the fourth for area (after Sicily, Piemonte and Sardinia).   The population is more than 10 million citizens and the area almost 23,800 km\u00b2.   ", "The population density is 419.65 inhabitants/km\u00b2.   There are eleven Provinces and one 239/451 Metropolitan City and more than 1,500 municipalities.   There are more than thirteen Local Prosecutors\u2019 Offices and two General Prosecutors\u2019 Offices. In terms of environmental pressures, there are almost 100,000 factories and approximately 50,000 Farms. There are approximately 1,800 IED installations (35% of the national amount) and 300 Seveso Plants (more than 25% of national plants).   There are 50 lakes and 6,000 km of rivers and a long network of canals (nearly 200,000 km).    There are 400 monitoring points for surface water (lakes and rivers) and 500 for underground water.    There were more than 100 controls on urban waste water treatment plants. ARPA Lombardia was established in 1999 and became fully operational in 2000.   The Agency is part of the Lombardy Region governance system which means that it is one of the public institutions that takes part in the decision-making process.   ARPA is a Public Institution with administrative, organisational, technical and economic autonomy.   It has 940 employees including the President, Executive Director and Central Directors (Administrative, Central and Operations).   There are four Technical Sectors, six Chemical Laboratories and six Departments for twelve Provinces.   There are regional centres for radioprotection, air quality, air emissions, weather, landslides and avalanches. It is organised in four sectors covering guidance and coordination, support to the Executive Director to plan activities and managing regional centres and regional monitoring (water).   The six Departments cover implementation of \u2018on site\u2019 activities, support to local Public Administrations and definition of priorities and local activities and planning. The main activities are environmental monitoring (air quality, surface water (rivers and lakes), groundwater and biodiversity), controls (Seveso plants, IED, Air emissions, Waste, EMAS, Noise and Electromagnetic pollution), and natural risks protection (weather climatology, hydrographic service, avalanches centre, geological centre).    The laboratory activities include radioactivity, radon, PA, As, Ni, Cd, Pb samples, annual and daily bulletins, monitoring campaigns, environmental impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments. ARPA Lombardia interacts with public, private and civil society and is a member of the National System for Environmental Protection (SNPA) established in 2016.   SNPA is a federative System which is aimed at joining detailed knowledge of the territory and local environmental problems to national prevention and protection policies.    It is a real network system that can be considered as a \u00abnew identity\u00bb, which unifies the skills of each single Environmental Agency of Italy and of the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA). 2. Welcome by Horst B\u00fcther Horst thanked Ms Cazzaniga for her kind words of introduction and said how pleased the group was to be meeting in Milan.   He pointed that there was a very high attendance which in itself was evidence of the importance of the project.    He thanked those present for their attendance. The minutes of the meeting held in Ghent on 5 and 6 October 2016 were adopted as a correct record, subject to Mr Heino Falcke\u2019s name being spelt in that way (and not Falke). There was a Tour de Table for those present to introduce themselves. 240/451 3. Background and progress of the IED implementation project Horst gave a presentation on the background and progress of the IED implementation project.   Compliance with environmental law is a priority for the Commission.   Horst began by listing other IMPEL projects (past and present) which were relevant to it.   These were: Doing the right things / easyTools; Air Quality Standards and Industrial Emissions; Linking Water Framework Directive and IPPC; IPPC and REACH; IED Inspections; Transition to IED permits; IED/IRAM Inspection Programme; Derogations from BAT-AEL\u2019s under IED; IED and Nature Protection; IED Baseline Report; and Doing the right things method for permitting.   The last three in italics were current projects. Results so far included information on implementation approaches in Bremen, Wallonia, Romania, The Netherlands and Flanders together with the identification of implementation challenges.   Thematic working groups had been established with final results already received from five groups.   Some groups were still ongoing and some new groups had been set up.   Site visits had been organised in Bremen, Rotterdam and Ghent.   Results from related IMPEL projects had been included in the Guidance Book.   There were project abstracts in different languages and a very useful exchange of experience had been achieved. Work had already been completed in five working groups, namely: Compliance assessment with levels of non- compliance; reporting to the public/public participation surveys; dealing with installations closing down/bankruptcy; BREFs/application of BAT; and Self-monitoring and operator reporting.  ", "Work was ongoing on five topics: Inspection tools; definitions; horizontal aspects of permitting; joint inspections; and BAT in Industrial Waste Water.   Topics which would be considered in the future included:   Application of Article 18 of the IED (Emission Limit Values and Air Quality limits; Involvement of the inspector in the BREF cycle; minimum risk criteria and inspection; and, possibly, application of emission ranges/narrative BAT. The budget for the first year of the project in 2015 was 63,500\u20ac (with 30 days\u2019 consultant time).   This had reduced to 54,500\u20ac in 2016 (with 22 days\u2019 consultant time) and to 52,000\u20ac in the proposed budget for 2017 (again with 22 days\u2019 consultant time).   If participants were able to travel to workshops and project meetings at the expense of their own authorities, that would be very helpful in that it would mean that other people would also be able to take part.   The project work programme for 2017 would include presentation of country approaches, joint inspections, thematic working groups and the development of Tools.   The Guidance Book would be amended and possibly merged with the guidance from the project on permitting: training material would be developed, which was another priority of the Commission.   There would be a proposal on Risk Assessment Criteria for the Commission and future Mutual Joint Visits would be developed. 4. Italian system of IED implementation Lombardia is a highly industrialised region with about 1,800 IPPC installations of which 1,100 are industrial installations.   In Italy as a whole there are about 5,000 IPPC installations.    The main challenges associated with IED include the extended scope of application (Annex 1), in particular waste treatment activities (in Lombardia about 100 new permits were granted in 2015).    There is an issue over emission levels associated with BAT (Art.14) and the criteria for enforcement and any exceptions (derogation).   There is also the question of the frequency of environmental inspections (Art.23) set with reference to an evaluation of the environmental risk from the activity which are every three years for lower risk installations and every year for higher risk installations.   The requirement for the Baseline report (Art.22) for activities that use, produce or discharge 241/451 hazardous substances is challenging as is the question of the publication of the inspection report and self- monitoring data (Art.24: Access to information and public participation in the permit procedure). Permits are issued by the Provinces except for those covering large industrial installations such as refineries which are issued by the Ministry of the Environment.    A further exception is waste incineration plants for which permits are issued by the Regions.    Inspections are carried out by ARPA (EPA of Lombardy) though in the case of large industrial installations they are done by ISPRA (national EPA) with the cooperation of the local ARPA.    There were two levels of coordination, namely the National working group between the Ministry and Regional authority and the Local working group between regional and provincial authorities. After the BAT Conclusions are published they are considered by the Regional Working Group which includes the Permitting Authority, the Inspecting Authority, Trade Associations and Operators.   The output of this group is a reference document for the Region.   There are so far five regional reference documents on Manufacture of Glass, Steel production, Lime production, Cement production and Pulp and Paper.   Work is in progress on Wood panel. The Support System for Planning Controls is a new tool for risk criteria.   It is an algorithm and the factors it looks at are the actual impact (real emissions and the environmental context \u2013 where the plant is located) and the potential impact in terms of the management of environmental issues and the kind of installation.    Using this algorithm, every installation gets a risk index on a scale of 1-10 with those at high risk having an inspection every year as required by Art.23. The European Commission Guidance concerning baseline reports was implemented in Italy by Ministerial Decree n. 272 of October 13, 2014.   The Ministerial Decree concerning baseline reports was implemented in Lombardia (regional Decree) in 2015 for the screening phase (relevant hazardous substances with thresholds). AIDA is the ARPA web-based tool for self-monitoring data.   Every year Self- monitoring data are input into AIDA directly by the operators and are validated by the operators.   Self-monitoring data are forwarded to ARPA where they are elaborated for publication on a yearly basis.    Electrolytic treatment of metals is the largest IPPC category in Lombardia (24.1%) followed by non-ferrous metals (9%) and waste treatment (7.2%).  ", "Surface treatment of substances is next at 5.88 % followed by pharmaceuticals at 5.64%: all other categories are below 5%. 5. Continuous Emission Monitoring System \u2013 Project in ARPA Lombardia (ARPA) The Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) is very important not only for the compliance with Emission Limit Values but also to obtain important environmental data such as the yearly mass flow of a pollutant (NOx, SOx, etc).   In Italy, CEMS are requested in big plants (LCP > 50MW- Municipal Solid Waste Incineration Plants, Cement Kilns and Glass Furnaces under the IPPC Directive).   For these plants, CEMS data are acquired every day and processed by a specific database developed by ARPA: \u00abThe CEMS Network. \u00bb  CEMS are managed by the owners and an accredited laboratory is used to assess them.   The context for this is that the Lombardy Region is highly industrialised with more than 100,000 industrial plants of all sizes and approximately 280 plants falling under the Seveso Directive.   It is a critical area with a Regional Plan for the Improvement of Air Quality with bad weather conditions (lack of wind), much traffic and a high population density.   It\u2019s important to know the sources and to identify and quantify the pollutants. 242/451 It works through a sampling group of the gaseous effluent, remote sensors (signals system, characteristic parameters of the plume), and the Distributed Control System.    This information is recorded and processed by specific software called AEDOS (Data Acquisition and Processing Open Source) installed on an industrial PC.   In ARPA, emission data are analysed for checking the pollutant emissions of big plants and identifying critical cases. The table below shows the position in Lombardy Region: Type of plant Plants number CEMS number Waste incineration plants 11 23 Glass furnaces 7 7 Cement Kilns 5 6 Large combustion plants (LCP) 16 32 Summary 39 68 6. Report on the Joint inspection The joint inspection took place at the Electrical Power Plant Cassano d\u2019Adda.   Those taking part were Robert Gross (Austria), Jaako Vesivalo (Finland), Dubravka Pajkin Tu\u010dkar (Croatia), Ruth Ciarlo (Malta) and Malgorzata Budzynska (Poland).    Roberto Borghesi was present from ISPRA and representatives from ARPA Lombardia were Fabio Colonna, Vittoria Villa, Mauro Prada and Andrea Pagani.    Documents were shared beforehand and a draft inspection plan was drawn up.    A video conference took place via WEBEX and the inspection plan was shared.    The joint inspection consisted of gathering information, requesting documents, preliminary assessment, on site visit and a report.   There was a final meeting in ARPA. The permit was in two parts.   The first part contains a description of the plant and its context, the application of BAT and the provisions for air emissions, water discharge, noise and waste.   The second part is the Monitoring Plan which is up to the owner and allows for the monitoring of the quantity and quality of pollutants during a year. The strengths of the joint inspection were the good atmosphere in which it was carried out and the focus on limited items: the weaknesses were the limited time available, the time needed for translation and the lack of discussion time after the inspection. No examples of non-compliance were found.   Minutes of the inspection were prepared in English and Italian and signed by the participants.   There was a suggestion that there should be a minimum content for joint inspections which the Inspection Group would look at. 243/451 7. Status of the working groups and activities 7.1 Joint inspections The section for the guidance book had been further redrafted.   There was also a list of good practice to which the latest Joint Inspection would be added.   The latest one had included a video conference which was good though there had been technical problems.   The group would continue working.   Horst said that the Commission provided funding for Joint Inspections on REACH and Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances (CLP).   He would put the details on Basecamp.   Members of this group included Marinus, Manuel, I\u00f1aki, Maria Milagros, Florin, Silva, Antonio and Romano. 7.2 Definitions Pieter said that some 212 terms and 30 definitions had been collected on an Excel spreadsheet and people had added some more.   It was accessible via Basecamp.   Thought would need to be given as to how to make it available.   The problem was that there were more questions than answers.   Pieter and Fabio were in this group. 7.3 Tools The questionnaire had been sent out in January and so far there had been 15 replies containing much information.   The work of the group was ongoing.  ", "People in this group included Wulf, I\u00f1aki, Rikke, Maria Milagros, Tom\u00e1\u0161, Vlado and \u015eenay.. 7.4 Horizontal aspects of permitting There was a problem of people moving in and out of the group.   The questionnaire had been prepared and it would be a good idea to review it in the group.   The intention was to see how countries are dealing with the horizontal aspects of permitting (for example, energy efficiency and dealing with accidents etc.).    People in this group included Elizabete, Nathalie, Hartmut and Chrystalla. 7.5 Narrative BAT Richard Chase had offered to send guidance from the Environment Agency for England on how they dealt with this.   Pieter would ask Richard to send the guidance. 7.6 BAT in Industrial Waste Water Horst said that this was a topic that the Commission had asked the group to work on.   Charlotte Sholl had offered to put something on Basecamp to start the discussion.   One of the outputs could be a checklist of measures for BAT.     Those interested in it included Antonio, Romano and Malgorzata. 7.7 Minimum criteria and method for risk assessment Horst gave a brief presentation on this.   The risk criteria for routine inspections and site visits were the kind of installation; emissions to air; emissions to water; waste processing; soil and groundwater protection; sensitivity of the environment; risk of accidents; compliance with permit conditions; and participation in EMAS.   As an example for the kind of installation, the risk related inspection interval was three years if there was simply an IED permit, two years for an IED permit and Seveso or EIA and yearly where there was an IED permit and Seveso and EIA.   For emissions to air and water, no frequency was set if they were below the PRTR threshold.   If they were above the PRTR threshold it 244/451 was a 3 (every 3 years), 2 if abatement technology were necessary and 1 if there was a permit with BAT derogations.    For waste processing, below the PRTR threshold there was no set frequency below the PRTR threshold: above that threshold it was a 3.   If there was off-site transfer of hazardous waste it was a 2 and a 1 TFS of hazardous waste.   On soil /groundwater protection, there was no set frequency if no baseline report was necessary and where such a report was necessary it was a 3.   It was a 2 where protection technology was necessary and a 1 where contingency measures were necessary.   For sensitivity of the environment, there was no set frequency if there was low level pollution.   If EQSs were kept it was a 3 and a 2 if EQSs were violated.   It was a 1 if Article 18 of the IED was applied.   On risk of accidents where the amount of dangerous substances (DS) was below the Seveso threshold there was no set frequency.   With DS were above the first Seveso threshold there was a 3 and a 2 if it was above the second Seveso threshold.   Where there had been a major accident in the last x years, it was a 1. In accordance with IRAM principles, the inspection interval is determined by the risk criteria with the shortest interval and not by the average.   The inspection interval can be changed by one step up or down based on operator performance.    Only risk criteria with shortest interval have to be inspected at every on-site visit.   Operator performance depends on the record of compliance.   Where the operator is in compliance there is a longer interval and no change where there is a minor non-compliance. Where there is a relevant non-compliance there is a shorter interval.   Participation in EMAS results in a longer interval.   IRAM is considered to be used by the Inspection Authorities of Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Kosovo, Luxembourg, Macedonia, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey. Horst suggested to go on with the work on criteria and to produce guidance for the IED.   After approval by the IED project the guidance would be sent to the Commission. Florin, Vlado, Dubravka and Robert will take part in this sub-group. 7.8 Going beyond BAT/Air Pollution Examples were needed and there was a need to discuss how to collect information.   The Commission were keen to know about NO2, in particular the impact that a high background level of NO2 would have on emission limit values.   ", "Horst suggested that this might be combined with consideration of the National Emissions Ceiling Directive.    Those interested in this included Jamie, Pieter, Elizabete and possibly a person from Cyprus. 7.9 Recommendations from the Derogations Project John would consider how to incorporate the results of this project into the guidance. 7.10 Report from the Baseline Report Workshop The workshop was held in Como, Italy, on 10-11 October 2016 with participants from eleven countries. The topics discussed at the workshop were: the results of the questionnaire; site definition; definition of closure of activities; monitoring; determination of relevant hazardous substances; quality check for Baseline Reporting; and Baseline Reporting for closing down a site.   Responses to the questionnaire had been received from thirty institutions in sixteen countries. From the responses it was apparent 245/451 that six countries have a specific guidance document for IED Baseline Reporting different from the EC guidance. Another country is in the process of preparing one.   The Baseline Reports (the soil investigations and the redaction of the report) are made by private companies in all countries.   A formal approval of the baseline report by the competent authority is mandatory in three countries and the validity of the baseline report is not limited in time. For the risk assessment, most countries use fixed minimum thresholds. Only three countries follow the guidance (stages 1-3) concerning the risk of soil contamination based on hazardous substances HS quantities to decide whether a baseline report is not required.   In almost all countries site inspections of the installation are carried out before the decision is made. The main concern in the stage of the site study is the wide interpretations and the variety of definitions of \u201csite extension/limits\u201d and \u201csite\u201d.   It has been decided to carry out a workshop to address the lack of harmonisation regarding this definition.   In most member states, data relevance is assessed on a case by case basis. Guidance on site investigation strategy exists in almost every member state.   The choice of the substances that have to be analysed varies from country to country. The way this decision is made and on what basis as well as the analytical protocols and standards applied will be discussed in greater depth at the next workshop.   Most countries do not have a mandatory template for the baseline report and its approval by the authority is a part of the permit. There is a need for a better definition of \u201cdefinitive closure\u201d as its interpretation is wide within the EU. Most countries requested a survey or an investigation upon site closure when a baseline report was not required to ensure that the site does not pose any significant risk to human health or the environment.   \u201cSignificant level of pollution\u201d is not well defined either, and needs to be better characterised. There are different possible approaches to do so: risk based, quantitative (threshold values) or other approaches.   All member states agree on the implementation of monitoring to control the groundwater quality during the activity of an IED site. Nevertheless, the guidance on the IED baseline report does not cover \u201cmonitoring\u201d in detail.   It will be interesting to clarify the guidance on the monitoring work, given the possible consequences if an elevation in concentration is detected. 7.11 Update on self-monitoring Romano said that Annelies Baert had sent out a short list of questions seeking information on the reporting of emissions monitoring results.   Replies had been received from thirty organisations in twenty two member states.   In only two cases was the information submitted on demand: in the others it was done automatically.   Mostly the information was submitted annually though sometimes more frequently depending on the permit conditions and type of installation.   In a few cases it is requested every 3 years.   There was continuous monitoring for some parameters, with monitoring reports sent monthly or quarterly.   Roughly half made it an obligation to use a fixed template.   A similar proportion received the information in paper format as opposed to electronically.   Roughly half had a summary and raw data and ten had just a summary: one had just the raw data.    About half made the information available to the public passively on demand and nine made it actively available.   In three cases it was not available to the public. 246/451 8. Status of the Guidance Book 8.1 Feedback from the Commission The Commission had given some comments on the Guidance Book which Horst requested Terry and John to look at and to incorporate into the manual as appropriate.  ", "If the Groups had any comments they should get in touch with Terry and John. The Commission wanted the guidance book to be used also as training material.   This could involve a great deal of work and Horst suggested that it would be useful if the Commission\u2019s consultants could also work with us.   The Commission was seeking to upgrade IMPEL\u2019s role in compliance promotion and their consultants were often used to produce guidance documents.    Countries had different issues with compliance and it might be useful to look at where countries have particular problems.   Horst suggested that this should be considered in the Expert Group. 8.2 Cooperation with DTRT (Permitting) Rob Kramers explained that the project was based on IMPEL\u2019s concept of the Environmental Inspection Cycle.   It consisted of step-by-step guidance to help design an optimised environmental permitting process.   The ultimate goal of this project was to have permits of the required quality and a level playing field with regard to permit writing.   It is a three year project.   In 2016 they collected details of the procedures used within Europe and compared the procedures that are used within Europe and clarified the needs.   In 2017 they will use this information to develop guidance flexible enough to accommodate the authorities while issuing permits and in 2018 they will organise training sessions and identify gaps in tools and methodologies so that new IMPEL projects can be initiated. There were overlaps with the project on IED implementation and consequently it could be useful to combine the guidance from the two projects.   Their proposal was to have a maximum of two pages for each step in the process (permitting, inspection and operator obligations) with links to factsheets to give more information.   This could be available on the internet and also be used for training. 8.3 Structure of the Guidance Book Jaako was concerned that the Guidance Book is only in English and that this created a language barrier. Horst said that translation was expensive and that the Commission were unlikely to provide much assistance on that.   Jaako suggested that it should be structured in such a way that at least part of it could be readily translated, as proposed in the project on DTRT Permitting.   Reporting and Derogations should be included in the Guidance Book.    Antonio suggested that it might be helpful to carry out inspections under the Emissions Trading Scheme as part of the IED inspection and it would be helpful to know what should be checked. 9. Results from the breakout groups 9.1 Horizontal aspects of permitting Chrystalla said that the group had reviewed the questionnaire and would need a further month to make it clearer.   Chrystalla would contact Nancy to discuss making it into a Survey Monkey.   Some 247/451 answers were expected by June and it should be possible to evaluate them over the summer ready for the September meeting.   The group will try to identify best practice in dealing with the horizontal issues in permitting, whether included in the permit or elsewhere.   They will also look at whether Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) should be part of the permitting process. 9.2 Joint inspections Marinus said that the group was planning to make them more effective. An innovation was the use of video conferencing but since the technology could be unreliable it would be helpful to have telephone conferencing as a backup.   The video conference needed a good agenda.   There had been a discussion over whether the inspection was about tools or content: it was agreed that it was about tools since content is more complicated and needed specialists.   They would draw up a list of what the hosts should prepare and the visiting inspectors would be asked to bring their procedures.   They had made a first draft of Joint Inspections on basecamp which would be available to everyone together with a list of good practice.   It was important to make a note of good practice seen on site (such as the CEMS, a good tool to see whether a company is behaving in accordance with the rules).    It was likely that the group could produce guidance material for training as they developed more experience. 9.3 Tools Wulf said that there was a considerable amount of interest in the topic and the results of the discussions would be written down and finalised by the end of April.   Rikke had presented the Danish database which had been constructed by an external enterprise and which met the needs of inspectors.   ", "The Group consisted of Wulf, I\u00f1aki, Rikke, Maria Milagros, Tom\u00e1\u0161, Vlado and \u015eenay. 9.4 Waste Water Treatment The Commission saw this as an important issue and Romano suggested that it was important to collect further information about it and to check what was happening in countries.   It would be useful to look at the BREF on waste water treatment plants to see what that said.   They wanted to understand the criteria on waste water to prioritise risk assessment.    At the next meeting they will have an overview of checklists used and on inspections in waste water treatment plants.   It would also be interesting to know what different countries are doing with permitting, and to see how violations are assessed.   In Italy, for example, it was not possible to use self-monitoring to assess violations.   It would also be useful to establish what operators have to pay for what they introduce into water.   In Germany this had had a big effect on the quality of waste water since the money had been used to build new purification plants.   In Romania, operators payed for discharges to water and air.   Antonio, Romano and Malgorzata were in this group. 9.5 Going beyond BAT It would be important to define what is meant by going beyond BAT and what the IED says about that. For instance, Article 18 states that \u2018where an environmental quality standard requires stricter conditions than those achievable by the use of the best available techniques, additional measures shall be included in the permit.\u2019   Article 44 allows conditions beyond BAT (the use of national BREFs in The Netherlands is an example).   Pieter and Jamie would develop a questionnaire to find examples of going beyond BAT and in what sectors and put it on Basecamp. 248/451 10. IED Project Organisation 10.1 Budget The budget for the project was very restricted.   Last year there was an overspend in IMPEL of 20,000\u20ac and this year a conference was being organised in Oxford.   There would be no additional money from the Commission though cooperation with the DTRT Permitting project should help.   Horst reiterated that it would be good if people were able to travel to meetings at the cost of their own authority. 10.2 Project Organisation For the next meeting in Ljubljana it would be necessary to identify who would like to take part in the Joint Inspection.   Vlado suggested that there should be between three and five inspectors and Marinus said that it would be helpful to have an inspector from the previous Joint Inspection.    Hartmut said he would be able to take pat and Marinus and Fabio would be able to help organise it. 10.3 Cooperation with DTRT Permitting The following people would take part in the group to look at preparing joint guidance with the project DTRT Permitting: Horst, Terry, Antonio, Jaako and John. 11. Any Other business There was none. 12. Location and date of next meeting The next meeting would be on 21-23 June in Ljubljana (combined with DRTR Permitting) and the workshop would be in Lisbon in the week beginning 25 September (combined with DRTR permitting).   The suggestion for the Ljubljana meeting was that the first day would be the Joint Inspection and the first day of the meeting of the DRTR Permitting project.   The second day would be a joint meeting and the third day would be the second day of the meeting of the IED project. 249/451 13.", "Participants Participation at the meeting in Milan Country Robert Gross AT Olivier Dekyvere BE Dubravka Pajkin Tuckar HR Chrystalla Stylianou CY Tom\u00e1\u0161 Augustin CZ Rikke Cochran DK Mette Lumbye S\u00f8rensen DK Silva Prihodko EE Jaakko Vesivalo FI Horst B\u00fcther DE Hartmut Teutsch DE Wulf B\u00f6ckenhaupt DE Roberto Borghesi IT Romano Ruggeri IT Fabio Colonna IT Nathalie Ellul Mt Ruth Ciarlo Mt Pieter Roos NL Marinus Jordaan NL Rob Kramers NL Malgorzata Budzynska PL Ant\u00f3nio Quintas PT Elizabete Ramos PT Florin Homorean RO 250/451 Vladimir Kaiser SI I\u00f1aki  Bergareche Urdampileta ES Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Mallada ES \u015eenay Aslan TR Jamie McGeachy UK (SCO) Terry Shears IMPEL 251/451 Annex VI Note of DTRT (Permitting) Project Team Meeting, Dublin, 9 May 2017 Subject: 5th project team meeting Doing the right things for Permitting Date: 9th May 2017 Time: 09:30 \u2013 18:00 Location: Irish Environmental Protection Agency, Dublin, Ireland Participants: Tony Liebregts, The Netherlands (chair and project leader) Rob Kramers, The Netherlands Birna Guttormsd\u00f3ttir, Iceland Katja Buda, Slovenia Helena Kamenickova, Czech Republic Caroline Murphy, Ireland Caitriona Collins, Ireland Elisabete Dias Ramos, Portugal Alfredo Pini, Italy Minutes Subject Annotation 1 Welcome and opening of Welcome by Caitriona and Tony. 252/451 the meeting The following issues are added to the agenda: organisation workshop; the next project team meeting and the future of this project. 2 Tour the table/ experience / expectations Birna: is changing position within her organisation. She will be the project manager for the implementation of WFD in Iceland. This will be her last project team meeting. Expectations: would like to go for a holistic approach while continuing with this project. Alfredo: New in the project team. Long history within IMPEL. Has been responsible for IED permitting first and following for IED inspections within the national government in Italy. Now has moved to a new position. Expectations: To have interesting discussion on this very important topic. Jamie; New in the project team. Works for the SEPA on IED Implementation issues. Expectations: is looking for new ways of working within his organisation and expects that this project will give input for this. Elisabete: Expectations: to be able to give a good contribution and to make this guidance even better. Caitriona: is also changing position, from permitting officer to mother :-). Expectations: is very interested to see where the guidance and this project is heading. Caroline; Will take over from Caitriona. Expectations: to make sure there will be a good connection between permitting and inspection. Helena: Expectations: finding good examples for this guidance. Katja: Expectations: would like to know more what happened in Milan and would like to see how can we finish the guidance. Rob: Expectations: to discuss the structure and content on this first draft but also discuss the responsibility about the whole guidance, where does this project stands for and how should we continue. Tony: Has a new job within the Inspectorate but will stay on as project leader of this project. Expectations: to develop a guidance that is integrated and combined with the IED project. To discuss how we will continue and manage this integration. Further he expects an active discussion and participation of the project team. 3 Minutes of 4th project team meeting 4 Minutes of the last project team meeting are adopted. Tony goes through the actions: the next project team meeting and workshop. 4 IED Implementation project Rob reports back on the IED Implementation meeting that was held in Milan. The presentation of the combined guidance book was well received by this project team. Conclusions: \u2022 Project team approved to combine DTRT-P and the IED implementation guidance; \u2022 This combined guidance would consist out of 3 parts (Permitting; Inspection and; Operators obligations. \u2022 Inspection cycle should be the same as permitting cycle; \u2022 Overall structure could also be leading for new initiatives; \u2022 It should be used as a guidance and training materials; \u2022 Agreed on combined project team meeting and workshop. Rob also reported back on a meeting (Conference call) with Horst, Terry and 253/451 John (2 consultants of IED implementation) to discuss the structure of the combined guidance. The outcome of this discussion is the structure that is now in draft version 1.2 Part 1: Legislation Part 2: Permitting Part 3: Inspection Part 4: Evaluation and feedback Note: IED implementation is not time limited. Focus is important. What are the subjects that are good for our guidance See annex 1 for the presentation of the report back.", "5 Guidance DTRT The project team agreed that we use the Regulatory cycle as the basis structure (Legislation \u2013implementation \u2013 Evaluation and feedback). To keep it simple we combine permitting and inspection in the box execution. This picture will be used in the introduction of the guidance. The picture of the regulatory cycle will be followed by a picture in which the 4 parts of the guidance are presented: Part 1: Legislation \u2013 Part 2: Permitting \u2013 Part 3: Inspection \u2013 Part4: Evaluation and Feedback. To keep it as clean as possible the arrows that show there is also a connection between Evaluation and Feedback and Permitting and Inspection will be left out. This connection will only be shown in part 4. Further it was agreed that only the box that is described in a certain part will be coloured, the rest will be grey.

Enforcement Evaluation and Feedback Policy planning Permitting Legislation Goals & Objectives Implementation: Permitting & Inspection Evaluation and Feedback Policy planning Legislation 254/451 Comments on the Regulatory Cycle are: \u2022 When possible describe the subject of evaluation and feedback also in the parts about permitting and inspection. \u2022 The cross-references to legislation made in IED inspection report could also be helpful for permitting. Comments on the Permitting cycle: \u2022 Execution framework should be permitting framework. Execution should be Permitting procedure. Delete permitting procedure as text in lowest box. Policy should be is Policy and priorities. See picture below: Comments on Inspection cycle are: \u2022 Execution and reporting should be inspection and enforcement. Execution framework should be inspection framework. Delete text in lowest box. See picture below. Strategic cycle Setting Priorities Objectives Strategies Describing the context Planning Strategic cycle Operational cycle Policy & Priorities Strategies Context Monitoring Permitting Framework Planning Access to justice Decision making Application Permitting procedure 255/451 Further comments on guidance book: \u2022 In the permitting and inspection cycle the strategic cycle should be explained first then the operation cycle; \u2022 Screening should be done for the EIA and the appropriate assessment (page 31); \u2022 BAT and setting conditions (page 30): Jamie and Alfredo will give text proposals for this part. \u2022 BAT and setting conditions (page 29): Jamie will give a text proposal on deviations; \u2022 Where the guidance mentions \u201csome countries\u201d replace this with the name of the country; \u2022 Relationship permitting and inspection (page 23): Conflict of interest should be replaced with blindness; \u2022 Expiring dates of permits: unlimited time is as long as the installation is not changed or until there is a new BREF + new BAT conclusions for the main activity of the installation. 6 Future Discussion on the future of the project DTRT-Permitting. There are 3 options: Option 1: This project develops the framework for the guidance with the parts: Legislation; Permitting; Inspection; and Evaluation and feedback. The content should come from the IED Implementation project. They should deliver their content to the framework. DTRT-P will only be responsible for the 2 page frame work. Option 2: Establishing a whole new project team that will be responsible for all of the content of the guidance (framework and factsheets and other reports). Option 3: A mix of option 1 and 2: existing project team will be extended with expertise that we miss at the moment. DTRT-P will be responsible for framework 256/451 and content. The project team agrees that the (integrated) framework should be the basis for the work and output of the industry and air cluster. Cross cutting is responsible for the whole framework and structure. There should be a project team (new or existing) that will steer this work. The coordination between the authors is the responsibility for the project leaders. Birna will prepare a discussion document Project team agreed to go for option 3. We should notify Michael about the structure and the work can find a place in the IMPEL website. 7 Next project team meeting Meeting in Ljubljana: 21st of June: DTRT-P project team meeting \u2013 participants: project team DTRT-P, Horst, Terry, John and 3 additional members (in total 14 persons). 22nd of June: mixed meeting of IED implementation and DTRT-P: purpose of the meeting - to report back on the discussions on 21st and get feedback from the IED project team members. To prepare the workshop in Lisbon.", "Katja will check hotel for the project DTRT-P Flight booking form has to be send in asap Workshop in Lisbon: 27th and 28th of September. Tony will discuss with Horst who to invite for the workshop. DTRT-P would like to invite the people that participated in Halfweg Last project team meeting: Iceland or Italy, 24th October. 7 Actions to be taken \u2022 Comments on the guidance send to Rob before 23 of May \u2022 Discussion paper before next Thursday (already finished and sent to Simon) \u2022 Jamie and Alfredo will give a text proposal on the subject: Boundaries of installation \u2022 Jamie will give a text proposal on the subject: deviations \u2022 Tony will notify Michael on the progress of the project \u2022 Katja will check hotel in Ljubljana \u2022 All will fill in the flight booking forms for next meeting 8 Closure of the meeting 257/451 Annex 1 258/451 259/451 260/451 Annex VII Note of DTRT Permitting Meeting, Ljubljana, 21-22 June 2017 Subject: 6th project team meeting Doing the right things for Permitting Date: 21st and 22nd of June May 2017 Time: 09:30 \u2013 18:00 and 09:00 - 12:30 Location: Slovenian Environmental Agency, Vojkova 1b 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia Participants: Rob Kramers, The Netherlands (chair) Katja Buda, Slovenia Helena Kamenickova, Czech Republic Caroline Murphy, Ireland Gabri\u00eblle K\u00fchn, The Netherlands Horst B\u00fcther, Germany John Seager Terry Shears Simon Farrugia, Malta 261/451 Minutes 21st of June 2017 Subject Annotation 1 Start at 09:30 Welcome and opening of the meeting Welcome to the project team by Rob and Katja. Absentees: Tony, Elisabethe and Alfredo couldn\u2019t not join the meeting due to other planned activities. Rob is chair of this meeting on behalf of Tony. 2 Tour the table/ experience / expectations Simon: permit writer in Malta, but before this working as inspector. Last meeting in Milan was very fruitful to share experiences on inspections. Notices that progress has been made on the draft guidance. Expectations: sharing experiences. Gabri\u00eblle: working at InfoMil, environmental knowledge centre in the Netherlands and project secretary of project Make it Work. Expectations: hopes to find good links between the work of Make it Work on eco- innovation and the DTRT guidance on permitting. Terry: working as a consultant in the IED implementation project. Expectations: there is a clear way forward on combining both projects. John: used to work at England Environment Agency, now working as a consultant on the IED implementation project. Expectations: good to emerge about the clarity we want in the guidance. The work on IED implementation group has brought together subgroups, e.g on monitoring. Interesting to merge the outcomes of these subgroup and also technical information. The current structure of guidance is very good. Also good to sort out what we can use and who is the main target group of the guidance. Caroline: is working on waste and permitting. Believes there is a good flow in guidance, it is easy to understand and readable. Expectations: looking on what help she can give on the development of the guidance. Helena: is the Czech representative of the environmental inspectorate. Expectations: to find some practical tools and is interested in the development of the strategy part. Katja: is working in the environmental agency of Slovenia. Expectations: looking forward on discussing what should be in the guidance and on preparing the programme of the workshop in September. Horst: working on the environmental agency in K\u00f6ln and is chair of the expert team for Industry and Air. Explains that the European Commission is working on environmental compliance assurance and on the Environmental Implementation Review (EIR). In February a number of meetings took place on these subjects. Discussion is ongoing on how IMPEL can best contribute to better a implementation. IMPEL could establish a knowledge centre and a knowledge database. IMPEL could organise trainings and IRIs, wherein every Member state will have an IRI every 5 year. 2018 will be a transitional year for IMPEL. In 2019 these changes should be implemented. IMPEL has prepared a position paper on this (send to the Commission end of April). Expectations: look if the guidance will be suitable for training purposes and if it is useful for the knowledge database. Rob: is assisting Tony on the project DTRT permitting. John and Terry will be co- authors of the guidance. Expectations: to discuss the different subjects and how we can make the guidance 262/451 suitable for training sessions. The training methodology is equally important as the content of the guidance.", "It\u2019s important to discuss how the guidance could be the basis for these trainings. The future of IMPEL looks good but also challenging with the new role as knowledge centre, trainings and the IRI\u2019s. 3 Approval of meeting agenda The agenda of the 1,5 day meeting is introduced by Rob. The programme of the workshop in September in Lisbon is added to the agenda. 3 Minutes of project team meeting 5 Minutes of 5th project team meeting are approved 4 Discussion paper Rob: During the last project meeting in Dublin we discussed how to continue with DTRT-P. The parts on inspection and legislation were added, but we are missing some of the expertise in the current project team on these subjects. The project team for 2018 will probably undergo some changes. A discussion paper was drafted and disseminated. The third year of DTRT-P (2018) will not be focussing on trainings but on further development of the guidance as we are now combining the complete guidance together with project on IED implementation. 5 Combined guidance DTRT Introduction of new version: due to combining the complete guidance with the project team IED implementation, the guidance has a new structure. Comments on the new version and level of detail of the guidance: \u2022 Main driver should be compliance assurance, which requires a regulatory approach (permitting, inspection, enforcement). The work which has been done on IED inspections has the same structure as the DTRT guidance permitting and therefore can be easily combined. Main challenges persist in the permitting area. The main concerns/gaps of the Commission on this subject are: guidance on derogations, requirements on derogations (e.g costs/benefits), creating pan European standards. \u2022 Guidance will also serve as a tool to help to implement the IED \u2022 The outline (structure) is now prepare. When filling in the different subjects it will clear where the gaps are. \u2022 IED group: guidance is only one part, also exchanges good practices should be added. \u2022 It\u2019s a good idea to exchange experiences between DTRT-P and IED implementation group (permitting and inspectors) \u2022 For 2017 the project team will remain as it is, with some exchange of experience between the two projects and focus on IED legislation. For 2018 the focus will be on finishing the guidance with input of the IED implementation project. Tony and Horst will decide on how to go forward. Comments on targets groups of the guidance: \u2022 In general: It should be taken into account that EPA\u2019s in Europe are organised differently (with respect to permitting and inspections). Therefore the aim should be to define a minimum level or define good acceptable level: e.g. what would be good practice across Europe to inspire these organisations.   Then it is for policy and strategic departments to decide what is the cycle and give a backbone to their strategy. The factsheet should include the statement: expression of good practices across Europe and it\u2019s up to the EPA\u2019s across 263/451 Europe to translate these in their country. Target audience: - management - strategic departments - policy makers (focus on IED) - permit writer (focus on IED) - inspectors - IRI groups (as DTRT is used as basis for IRI and Commission is planning to increase the frequency of IRI in MS and guidance could be part of the IRI process). - other interested groups: since the guidance will be set up as a webpage, it can be used as a stepping stone for searching and getting information Amendments on the structure of the guidance: Main structure: Addition of a connection between Evaluation and Feedback and Policy planning because it also feeds into policy planning: Add glossary/explanation of terms used in the guidance. I. Legislation: Amendments: connection arrow is added between Evaluation and Feedback and Policy planning. 264/451 The (most important) articles of the IED will be included this part. References will be made per article to the implementation sections in part II, III and IV. II. Permitting: Amendments: \u2022 In the box policy and priorities, the term policy is deleted because it is not clear which elements of policy should be included here. \u2022 Priorities: adding good practices on calculation of priorities (Action: Caroline) \u2022 Permitting process: connection arrows between application \u2013 decision making \u2013 access to justice are deleted because the last box does not automatically follows after decision making. \u2022 Permitting process: a \u201cstandard\u201d checklist for review of permit applications and the preparing the permit itself should be added.", "This checklist should contain only basic legal requirements and information of best practices. \u2022 Permitting procedure / Application: the text on confidentiality needs to be checked (Action: Caroline) \u2022 Permitting procedure / Permitting: Adding a time frame on the permitting procedure as good practice under principles. III. Inspection, Compliance assessment and Enforcement Also here the arrows between the boxes Preparation, Execution and Reporting have been deleted so it\u2019s more in line with permitting. 265/451 The work that has been done on IED inspections will be added where possible. IV. Evaluation and feedback: Division of work: The project team DTRT is responsible for the main body of the guidance.

Minutes joint project team meeting 22nd June 2017 Subject Annotation 1 Welcome and opening of the meeting Welcome by Horst to both project teams. Agenda was approved, a short tour the table followed. 267/451 2 Introduction host country on Implementation IED Presentation on inspectorate of Slovenia by Vladimir Kaiser 3 Reporting back day 1 See presentation in annex Combined guidance Rob presented the results of the project meeting on 21 June. The guidance has progressed considerably, but the broadening of the scope is also a challenge for the project team. \u2022 The factsheets which have been produced or will be produced by the working groups of the IED implementation project team. \u2022 The guidance will be a web based tool, including references to sources. \u2022 Existing products/work on Compliance assessment will be migrated in the new structure, including self-monitoring and reporting to the public. \u2022 There are still some gaps on derogations, costs benefits. Future of DTRT project The composition of the project team will remain unchanged in 2017, but there will be some exchange between the teams on expertise: permit writers, inspectors, management and policy makers. In 2018 we will continue with the development of the guidance. The workshop in Lisbon will give input for this development. Division of tasks: DTRT project team is overall responsible for the guidance. There should be no overlapping, therefore it will be one document in which we will work as two project teams together. The projects will be closely interconnected and joined project meetings will be organised. 4 Preparation Combined workshop The combined project teams adopted the programme idea of the 2 day workshop in which we will have 16 working groups working on 8 subjects. 4 subjects will be submitted by DTRT and 4 by the IED implementation project. The project team on IED implementation submitted the following working group subject: 1. Definitions; Making changes to permits \u2013 what is significant change 2. Joint inspections (good practices take out for guidance) 3. How to deal with other than normal operating conditions 4. Compliance assurance : other enforcement actions along fines The project team on DTRT will submit the following project ideas: 1. Setting priorities in permitting 2. Defining your strategies in permitting 3. Permitting procedure (the common steps in the process) 4. Evaluation and Feedback in combination with Eco-Innovation 5 Closure of the meeting Rob and Horst closes the joint part of the project team meeting DTRT-P and IED implementation.", "268/451 269/451 270/451 271/451 272/451 273/451 Annex VIII Note of IED Project Team Meeting, Ljubljana, 22-23 June 2017 Note of IED Project Team Meeting, Ljubljana, 22-23 June 2017 IMPEL Project on supporting Implementation of the Industrial Emissions Directive Project meeting held at the Slovenian Environmental Agency, Vojkova 1b, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia on 22 and 23 June 2017 Summary of action points from the meeting 1. Final draft of the report on Industrial Waste Water to be ready for the meeting in Lisbon (Romano) 2. Marinus to use basecamp to test reactions on the preferred level of expertise of inspectors to take part in joint inspections 3. Questionnaire on horizontal aspects of permitting will be loaded to basecamp by Chrystalla with replies requested by the end of July.   Responses would be evaluated and a short report prepared for the meeting in Lisbon 4. Simon would act as the link person between the group on horizontal aspects of permitting and the project on DTRT Permitting 5. Horst would prepare a ToR on IED for 2018.   He would discuss it with Rob from the DTRT Permitting project 6. Topic leaders would produce short introductory papers for their topics to be discussed in Lisbon Make it work \u2013 innovation vs permit restrictions (presentation by Gabri\u00eblle K\u00fchn) Gabri\u00eblle said that the motto of the \u2018Make it Work\u2019 initiative (MiW) is \u2018better rules for a better environment\u2019 and that the aim is to help improve EU environmental legislation and its implementation.   It is a Member State initiative with a cross-sectoral approach bringing together policy makers and practitioners with cooperation from the Commission and IMPEL.   The lead countries are Sweden, the Netherlands and UK (Scotland).   It has 274/451 produced recommendations for smart environmental inspections and environmental reporting and is now looking at how to better facilitate eco-innovations.   Eco-Innovation is any new product, process, organisational change or marketing solution that aims to reduce the use of natural resources and to decrease the release of harmful substances across the whole life-cycle and it is crucial for establishing a low carbon, circular economy. They may not fit within current environmental legislation and could be difficult to establish in terms of permitting and enforcement which may result in legal and governance challenges. One example involved a company which was active in several EU countries.   The process involved the extraction and recycling of fine fractions of non-ferrous metals (mainly Al, Zn, Cu) from bottom ash from (household) waste incineration:  the facility recovers the valuable metals which are then marketed as commodities.   The eco-innovation lies in the reduction of waste and the re-use of non-ferrous metals together with less use of energy and lower emissions (CO2 and other).   The challenges are the differing interpretations by MS of the notification needed for non-ferrous metal concentrate under the Waste Shipment Regulation and the permit requirements valid for the bottom ash washing process under IED. Another case involved Pharmafilter, a company with ambitions to be active in different MS.   The process is that biodegradable, disposable products are used in hospitals instead of products that need to be sterilised after each use, such as bedpans.   Used products are shredded in a closed system and flushed through the hospital sewer system.   At the installation, solid waste is converted into biogas and waste water is purified.   The innovation is the renewable energy (biogas) and the fact that waste water is purified and medicinal residues are removed and can be reused.   There is a reduction in contamination risks from bacteria.   The challenges are whether this is an IED installation (involving waste processing for (hazardous) waste) and whether the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive applies: a hospital is not considered an agglomeration, although the composition of waste water is equal to the definition of urban waste water.   Because of a lack of experience of eco-innovations at competent authorities, the company encountered a lengthy permitting process. A third case concerned whisky distilleries in Scotland.   These distilleries are using by-products which arise from the brewing and distilling process, pot ale (1st distillation) and spent lees (2nd distillation) as organic material for different purposes.    The by-products (mainly draff) are converted into renewable energy (anaerobic digestion creating bio-gas), thus decreasing fuel demand.   There is feed for the salmon industry (pot ale replaces soy and fishmeal) and cattle and the development of a product used for soil clean\u2013up deriving from by-product.  ", "There is no definition of \u2018distillery wastes\u2019 in the Scottish Waste Management Licensing Regulations and this was interpreted as waste from the manufacture of alcoholic drinks by a distillation process. The final case examined was Opsis, an air quality monitoring system that detects diffuse emissions at chemical installations in order to reduce these. It is a flexible system: depending on the application, and criteria such as path length, monitoring times and the range of gases monitored can be chosen.   The eco-innovation is the resulting clean air.   The challenges are that the Key Environmental Issues that are currently proposed for chemical BREF process (emissions to air) exclude diffuse emissions. This would also mean that the Emissions Trading scheme that could help solve these issues will not be part of the picture and therefore there is no opportunity to use Emissions Trading to quantify the extent of environmental issues and gain information for the reduction of diffuse chemical emissions. 275/451 The way forward will be to collect further details of eco-innovation cases and to analyse them and to establish a shared understanding of the main challenges related to the application of the IED provisions and managing the strategic and operational IED permitting procedure.   There will be opportunities to share information, experiences and solutions between MiW and IMPEL and to organise joint discussions.   The MiW findings can also feed into the IMPEL-IED Guidance project. There were similar issues as in the horizontal aspects of permitting.   This was potentially a difficult area and one in which it would be helpful to have feedback from the permit writers to policy makers. Going beyond BAT A questionnaire had been circulated seeking examples of going beyond BAT and seven responses had been received.    Pieter led an interactive questionnaire exercise at the meeting in Ljubljana to gain more information about practice in different countries concerning going beyond BAT.   The IED includes different articles related to going beyond BAT.    These articles include: \u2022 Strict implementation of BAT Conclusions e.g. lower / stricter end of BAT AELs or permit conditions that require more techniques (articles 14(3) and 15(3) IED) \u2022 Other techniques not described in BAT conclusions (article 14(5)) \u2022 Stricter than BAT conclusions (article 14(4)) \u2022 Emerging techniques (articles 15(5) and 27) \u2022 Environmental quality standards (article 18) The drivers include Environmental Quality Standards (local air quality, dust (PM10) and NOx), River Basin Management Plans, strict implementation of BAT conclusions, promoting emerging techniques, health concerns, national emissions ceilings, climate policies and one planet prosperity.   If a company sees economic benefits in going beyond BAT then it will be more inclined to do so.   The mechanisms include permits, clear regulations and permitting procedures, regulations for better than BAT, programmes to promote better environmental performance, strategies for improving air/water quality and voluntary agreements. The rules and procedures consist of the various pieces of national legislation implementing IED together with national interpretational guidance.   The rules under which stricter conditions can be set are prescribed in regulations or general binding rules and national and regional BAT conclusions which must be taken into consideration. Gaps and obstacles to going beyond BAT include a lack of knowledge that hinders innovation, additional costs, perceived unavailability of techniques/technology, a legislative framework preventing innovation and the unknown.   The sectors where there are examples of going beyond BAT include Energy (NOx), Metals (Dust \u2013 PM10), Poultry and Pigs (Ammonia and Dust), Chemicals and Glass. 276/451 Examples of sustainable growth agreements were Superglass commitments, reduce water use and effluent, enhance innovation, reduce supply chain impacts, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, develop community engagement and improve environmental and economic outcomes.   The primary drivers are the environmental quality standards and River Basin Management Plans.   Primary delivery is through permits and permitting procedures, with some use of voluntary agreements. In the Guidance there will be an explanation of what is meant by going beyond BAT together with details of the relevant articles in the IED.   The Guidance will be illustrated from cases collected by means of the questionnaire.   There could be links to planning and prioritisation.   The group at present consisted of Jamie and Pieter and more members would be welcome. Industrial waste water Members of this group were Malgorzata, Romano and Roberto.   The Commission saw this as an important topic and it was agreed at the meeting in Milan that it would be useful to collect further information about it.", "The group would look at the BREF on waste water treatment plants and seek an overview of checklists used on inspections in waste water treatment plants.   It would also be interesting to know what different countries are doing with permitting, and to see how violations are assessed.    Seven regulating authorities made use of a checklist to perform an inspection at an industrial waste water treatment plant but eight did not.   In nine authorities, where a breach of the limit value is declared within the Self-monitoring report (provided by the operator to the competent authority), this data could be used to give a penalty/fee etc, though in five authorities it could not.   Usually a non-routine inspection is carried out where a breach of limits is detected in the operator report. The report being drafted by the group would contain a chapter on the regulatory framework, a chapter on linked IMPEL projects and a chapter on Best Available techniques.   This latter chapter would include information on the BREF: Common Waste Water and Waste Gas Treatment/ Management Systems in the Chemical Sector, Horizontal BREFs, and a general analysis of waste water technologies used in industrial process.   Chapter 4 would look at inspections in waste water treatment plants and would look at what should be done before and during the inspection.   There would be sections on sampling, procedures and the relevant criteria to be considered for risk assessment.   The final chapter would be the survey results and in the annex there would be a checklist on wastewater treatment plant inspection. The final draft of the report would be ready for the meeting in Lisbon. Report back from the joint  inspection The joint inspection took place on 21 June at the Aluminium foundry at IMPOL LTT d.o.o., Partizanska ulica 38, 2310 Slovenska Bistrica, Slovenia.   Those taking part were Dubravka (Croatia), Fabio (Italy), Ruth (Malta), Mar\u00eda Jes\u1f7bs (Spain), Darja (Slovenia) and Vlado (Slovenia).   The installation is classified into a 2.5. (b) IED group 277/451 according to Annex I of the IED.   An environmental permit is issued for the operation of the installation with processes of  melting of aluminum, including alloys and products suitable for reprocessing with a melting capacity of 1449 tonnes per day.   The installation is part of a bigger industrial complex. On 20 June the inspection team had a preparatory meeting.   Documents to be used during the inspection included an environmental permit and monitoring reports (air and noise).   During the inspection the team focused mostly on air emissions and noise pollution.   There was an introduction by the operator which included a video presentation and information on recent upgrades.   These included the new multi chamber furnace, measures taken to reduce noise and measures taken to reduce air emissions.   The raw materials used are pure aluminium and clean scrap aluminium which results in lower air emissions.    On air emissions, all furnaces in the cast house were checked to see whether the emissions are enclosed and captured through the filtration system.   The filtration system works by integrating a combination of cyclones, injection of active charcoal and lime into the flow of gases.   The air flow is than cleaned on bag filters.    The stack where the probes for monitoring are located was also observed and officers checked monitoring reports of air emissions. For noise, the operator showed the measures to reduce noise pollution and monitoring reports for noise were also checked by inspection team.    The problems which had arisen in the past with noise included handling of raw material in an open storage facility, a cooling tower and a ventilator of an air cleaner.   The limit value for a night period is 48db whereas monitoring had shown it to be 51 - 54db.   Corrective measures were put in place which succeeded in reducing noise by 6-10db thus bringing noise below the limit value of 48db. The main findings were that all emissions from furnaces were well collected and passed through the filtration system.   All air emission results from monitoring reports were found to be within emission limit values and all noise pollution results from noise monitoring reports were also found to be within emission limit values. Officers noted general good housekeeping and clean cast house overall. Some lessons were learnt as a result of the inspection.   A pre-visit meeting with the operator allows the operator to describe what measures have been installed and any future plans that are envisaged for the company to continue to improve the company\u2019s profile and reduce the impact on environment.  ", "There were examples of best practices and new technology (covered storage of clean aluminum scrap, low dust inside the cast house etc).   The general good level of housekeeping was in itself reassuring.   An updated environmental permit is issued prior to the purchase of new equipment to make sure that all equipment purchased is authorised by the competent authority and according to environmental permit conditions. It was good to focus the inspection on one or two items only rather than inspecting all items in the permit since this allowed for a shorter and more focused visit for such a large industry.   It was also good practice that the inspection minutes were written on site in front of the operator and focused on the main findings of the inspection.   The operator had started a new production company in Croatia.   It was good that the inspection was held at the sister company in Slovenia which allowed the representative from Croatia to compare environmental permits and the operations of this company.   Companies benchmark each other very quickly, more quickly than inspection officers.   Cooperation between authorities is very slow and does not allow to quick response by the competent authority.   The fact that the report is written on site allows for less bureaucracy.   In some countries officers do not write a report on site during the inspection, but after the inspection.   This will allow officers to cross check inspection points with photos taken to assure that all 278/451 observations made are listed and correct.   Also officers double check with permit conditions and improvement programme check list. The report is then sent to the operator including any actions with deadlines. The operator then replies back with his answers to the report. Working groups and reporting back Joint Inspections The organisation and preparation for the joint inspection were both splendid.   There had been a proposal for a video conference beforehand but because of technical difficulties a conference call by phone was done instead which had worked well.   The guidance on organising joint inspections was now 80% completed.   One possibility for the future would be to identify a specific sector to inspect though this would then require specialists from that particular field to take part in the inspection.    Alternatively, rather than just current specialists, there could be inspectors who had had experience of that particular field at some point in the past.   Marinus suggested that he would use Basecamp to test reactions on this. There was already a lot of experience from Joint Inspections, particularly about the procedures used for carrying out inspections in other and the technical approach for looking at particularly categories of industrial plants.   It was not necessary to go on site to look at procedures and the focus should be more on the technical part with looking at specific types of industry. Industrial Waste Water The group had worked through the draft of the document and while the structure was broadly the same they had made some adjustments to the document.   It will contain a general overview of the BAT conclusions on Waste Water Treatment.   It will also contain an overview of the main problems that can be found in a waste water treatment plant.   It will include a chapter on inspections in terms of what has to be done before during an inspection such as the information to be collected.   They will provide a checklist to be used during an inspection (which could also be used for a joint inspection).   First there would be a general checklist for water treatment and there could then be more specific ones for different categories of industries. There was a question about emission limit values which Romano thought could be covered by the answers to the survey. Going beyond BAT There was nothing further to report on this. Tools Rikke presented the report on behalf of Wulf.   A questionnaire had been circulated seeking information on the IED requirements for which Tools could be appropriate and there had been many responses.   It was apparent that existing tools varied considerably in usefulness with some being very slow and some being very good.   It was unlikely that tools could be obtained that could fulfil every requirement that might be placed on them. Tools needed to be up-to-date, user friendly and able to meet all requirements.   Something had already been prepared to put into the Guidance.   Manuel, Maria Jes\u1f7bs and Vlado would also take part in this group.", "Horizontal aspects of permitting Horizontal aspects are those obligations of the operator that apply to all installations.   The group had prepared a questionnaire on horizontal aspects of permitting.     This would be used to collect information on how 279/451 horizontal aspects of permitting was dealt with in different countries, to identify best practices and to develop common practices and general rules on horizontal aspects to be used in IED permits.    Horizontal aspects included Environmental inspections, Contact person, Process modification/extension, Consumption of raw materials, water and energy, Maintenance of equipment, Noise and odour, Staff competency and training, Prevention and management of accidents, Environmental Management System (EMS), Energy Efficiency, Site closure, Reports and Communication.   Pieter suggested that storage could be added to that list.   There would be a question on how these aspects were regulated whether through Permit, General Binding Rules, Legislation or in some other way and what was actually required by the above regulatory tool such as a plan, a report, an action, time-period, record keeping, etc.   What is the operator\u2019s obligation regarding the horizontal aspects? Future plans were to send out the questionnaire via basecamp and to receive responses by the end of July. Responses would be evaluated within the working group and a short report would be drafted and presented in the next meeting for comment.   Since the project related to permitting it would be important to maintain a close link with DTRT Permitting.   Simon would act as the link person since he was participating in both projects. Risk assessment criteria Horst gave a brief presentation of the paper on risk assessment that he had uploaded to Basecamp on 25 May. Article 23.4 of the IED (Environmental inspections) requires the competent authority to draw up programmes for routine environmental inspections, including the frequency of site visits for different types of installations. The period between two site visits is to be based on a systematic appraisal of the environmental risks of the installations concerned, not exceeding 1 year for installations posing the highest risks and 3 years for installations posing the lowest risks.   Annex 1 of the Directive lists categories of activities related to different types of installations. The IMPEL project \u201ceasyTools\u201d identified a way of risk classification for different types of installations. They were looking for a common agreement on the classification of high risk installations under the European environmental law. As a result, they agreed to use the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (EIA) and the Seveso Directive together with the IED to classify the installations. The EIA Directive lists all projects that shall be made subject to an environmental impact assessment. The requirements of the Seveso Directive are obligatory for all establishments handling dangerous substances above the qualifying quantities listed in Annex 1 of the Directive. As a result, the types of IED installations can be classified in the following way: Low risk installations: no EIA necessary and no Seveso requirements Medium risk installations: EIA necessary or Seveso requirements High risk installations: EIA necessary and Seveso requirements This is a good starting point for drawing up programmes for routine environmental inspections, including the frequency of site visits for different types of installations. But it is not all since the Directive does not only take the type of installation into account but also contains prescriptions for the risk appraisal of individual installation.   The systematic appraisal of the environmental risks is to be based on at least the following criteria: 280/451 (a) the potential and actual impacts of the installations concerned on human health and the environment taking into account the levels and types of emissions, the sensitivity of the local environment and the risk of accidents; (b) the record of compliance with permit conditions; (c) the participation of the operator in the Union eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009(1) First it is necessary to define the environmental risk: risk is a function of the severity of the consequence (the effect) and the probability this consequence will happen: Risk = f (effect, probability). To adapt this to the requirements of the IED the impact criteria under a) can be used as consequences and the operator performance criteria under b) and c) can be used as probabilities. The higher the impact the bigger the consequence and the better the operator the lower the probability of an adverse effect on the environment and the human health. A scoring system for the impact criteria under a) is necessary.", "The scoring system shall classify the impact of a criterion into low, medium and high. As an example the impact of waste water emissions is low when there are only standard substances in the effluent, it is medium when in addition nutrients are also discharged, and it is high when in addition also dangerous substances are discharged.   Such a scoring system would need to be developed for all impact criteria.   In doing this it should be borne in mind that not all installations will end up in only one category of a given impact criteria. After the scoring system for all impact criteria is developed all installations can be scored for all criteria resulting in an impact profile of the installation. As mentioned above the risk of the installation shall be defined by the impact (profile) and the operator performance. For the operator performance there are two criteria mentioned in the IED: the record of compliance and EMAS. Here again a classification is necessary: good \u2013 medium \u2013 bad operator performance. For compliance the following can be used: good: no relevant non-compliance; medium: only one case of relevant non-compliance ; bad: more than one case of relevant non-compliance or one case of important non-compliance; and for EMAS: good: participation of the operator in EMAS; medium: no EMAS but application of an accepted EMS; bad: no EMS. Now the operator performance has to be combined with the impact profile of the installation to result in the risk profile. The best way to do this is to shift the scorings of the impact profile to the lower end in the case of good operator performance and to the higher end in the case of bad operator performance. In the end the installations with the biggest number high scores in the risk profile belong to the category of installations posing the highest risk and the installations with no high scores and the biggest number of low risk scores in 281/451 the risk profile to the category of installations posing the lowest risk. Coming from this approach IMPEL has developed an internet application for the risk assessment of inspection objects (installations) and for drawing up programs for routine environmental inspections, including the frequency of site visits: https://www.fms.nrw.de/lip/authenticate.do 282/451 Examples for systematic appraisal of the environmental risks of the installations concerned For three different kinds of installations with low, medium and high risk an example scoring for the impact criteria was performed giving the impact profile.   The resulting risk profile depends on the operator performance: good, medium or bad. The risk category depends on the number of high or medium risk criteria in the risk profile and is not the result of an average or medium value of the scoring. Impact Profile Operator Performance Risk Profile Risk Category KI EA EW SP WP SE RA KI EA EW SP WP SE RA KI: Kind of Installation; EA: Emissions to Air; EW: Emissions to Water; SP: Soil Protection; WP: Waste Processing; SE: Sensitivity of the Environment; RA: Risk of Accidents; Green: low or good; Yellow: medium; Red: high or bad 283/451 Remaining work programme 2017 and planning of 2018 Work will continue on the Guidance Book in conjunction with DTRT Permitting (which will provide the lead editorial role for the Guidance).   This would be a combined document which would require a major editing job in the main body of the text and the supporting material.   The first draft of the revised document should be ready by the end of August.   It will be as short as possible with the actual Guidance contained in no more than two pages.   All other information will be contained in factsheets that will be linked to the guidance. Horst would prepare a ToR for the project in 2018.   It would include the guidance to be developed jointly with DRTR Permitting: he would discuss that with Rob and draft the ToR accordingly.   Joint Inspections would continue as this year: Marinus would write something on thematic inspections. IMPEL had the necessary expertise, knowledge and experience to provide training materials for inspectors \u2013 both new inspectors and existing ones.   The training could possibly lead to a diploma which would cover not just technical knowledge but also attitude and behaviour.   This group had many very qualified and experienced inspectors: it would be possible to begin with IED and then add others.   This would fit well with proposals for IMPEL to do more work on training.  ", "The Commission had made it clear that it would like more joint inspections to be carried out and it would be useful to try to obtain money from them for that, possibly under LIFE+.   It would be necessary to have support from MS and from authorities to prepare an application for funding under LIFE+. One possibility would be to have an IMPEL Inspection Academy as another expert group.   This had in fact already been discussed with the Commission. Planning of the Industry and Air expert team meeting For the expert team meeting in Lisbon, there would be a ToR for Oil and Gas in 2018 and also a proposal from Francesco (ISPRA) concerning a UNEP Program that Horst would put onto Basecamp.   Lorna Dempsey from the Environment Agency for England had been invited.   Lorna was the leader of the Prosecutors\u2019 Network\u2019s group on industry and it would be interesting to hear what they are doing. There would be eight topics for discussion at the workshop, four from Industry and Air and four from DTRT Permitting.   The topics from Industry and Air would be Joint Inspections (Marinus), Other than normal operating conditions (Jamie), Other methods of Compliance Assurance (Ruth) and Definitions (Pieter).   Each of the leaders for the topics would produce a short introductory paper of one or two pages for the workshop to describe what it would cover. There would be three different joint inspections in Portugal 1. An intensive poultry or pig rearing unit (cat. 6.6 b) (Chrystalla and Jamie) 2. An animal feed production site (cat. 6.4 b); and 3. A chemical factory (cat. 4.1 h) (Ruth) 12.

Rapporteurs of the working groups to provide more information about the findings of their groups on Basecamp 2. Jamie, Pieter and Jaako to turn their findings on going beyond BAT into a factsheet 3. Horst would include the report on Industrial Waste Water as an Annex to the project report for IMPEL 4. Terry/John would prepare a brief article for the IMPEL newsletter on what had been achieved during the year 1. Welcome and opening of the meeting The Inspector General of IGAMAOT, Mr Nuno Banza, welcomed those present to the meeting and to Lisbon. IGAMAOT considered IMPEL to be an important priority and were very pleased that the meeting was taking place in Lisbon.   It was important to learn from experience in other countries and to hear how they were tackling environmental challenges.   It was therefore a pleasure to see how many different environmental authorities from all parts of Europe were present at the meeting.   He added that Portugal\u2019s experience with IMPEL had been very positive and they had set up an internal environmental network within Portugal. 286/451 He concluded by expressing the hope that the discussions in the workshop would be fruitful and productive and that the work of the projects would be taken forward in a very constructive way. Toni thanked Mr Banza for his kind words and thanked IGAMAOT for hosting the workshop.   The organisation had been carried out very well by Portuguese colleagues.   He welcomed all those present to the combined workshop which would provide an opportunity to discuss the provisional results of both projects \u2013 DTRT Permitting and IED implementation.   It had been agreed that the Guidance Book would be merged and that the two projects would be integrated as far as possible.   The Guidance contained many examples of good practice together with fact sheets giving further information.   This combined workshop would provide a further opportunity to develop the Guidance and to include the contributions from the workshop.", "Horst added that he was very happy to be in Lisbon and also congratulated the Portuguese hosts on the excellent organisation, not least for the three Joint Inspections that had taken place the day before (see Item 6 below).   He added that there were 44 participants at the workshop.   Horst mentioned the work being done by the Commission on Compliance Assurance and said that the outputs of these projects would help with that, not least in providing the basis for future training.   The workshop would also provide an opportunity to hear about progress being made with Waste Water treatment, Going beyond BAT and Tools. 2. IED Inspections in Portugal Roberto and Ant\u00f3nio gave a presentation on IED Inspections in Portugal with the sub-heading What we do, How we do it, Where we are going to? In Portugal there are 166 Seveso establishments and 865 establishments falling under IED: there are 28 inspectors.   In 2016 there were some 700 inspections in total of which roughly 350 were IED inspections.   This compares with a total of some 950 inspections in 2015 (of which 350 IED) and 600 inspections in 2014 (of which 380 IED).   The inspection programme is based on the annual activity plan of IGAMAOT taking into account the following main aspects: results from risk analysis from IRAM; inspection frequency from Seveso Directive and IED Directive; complaints received; and specific requests or governmental requests. The supporting tools for inspections are the Guidance Book for environmental inspections (GAIA); and the general check list with the documents to check out during inspections.   Other tools include documents produced by the Portuguese Competent Authority, national legislation and other standards or regulations and previous inspection reports. The inspections cycle begins with a description of the context followed by a definition of priorities and a definition of goals and strategies with planning and revision. Next comes the preparation of the inspection and the execution and reporting of the inspection:  there is then monitoring and follow up.   The actual phases of the inspection are: preparation; in situ inspection; report; and follow up.   There are three main types of inspections.   Extraordinary inspections are directed to specific subjects and are in response to an environmental complaint, a governmental request, an incident/accident, or verification of an administrative restriction or inquiries determined by the prosecutor.   The main goal of Integrated inspections is to verify the compliance of environmental legislation applied to the object of inspection.   Follow Up inspections are aimed 287/451 at verifying a specific environmental compartment.    The types of reports are: Landfill; Seveso; Environmental; Chemical products; Trans frontier shipment of waste (TFS); Risk analysis reports; and FDS verification. The environmental report is made in an integrated database designated by SGI and covers these issues: 1. Description of the activity; 2. Water consumption; 3. Water discharge; 4. Air; 5. Waste; 6. Noise; 7. Environmental performance; 8. Environmental impact assessment; 9. Other environmental Issues; 10. Other measures and observations. 3. Environmental Permitting in Portugal Teresa Torcato and Elisabete Dias Ramos from the Portuguese Environment Agency gave a presentation on Environmental Permitting in Portugal.    The Portuguese Environment Agency (APA) is a modern public organisation created in 2012 from a merging process involving nine different institutes.   APA is the national public institution whose mission is to develop and monitor the management of environment and sustainable development policies.   It works in close cooperation with other public, private and non-governmental organisations, to ensure a high level of protection and enhancement of environmental systems.   The main areas of activity are air, water, environmental assessment, waste, climate, chemicals, noise, public participation, environmental risks, coastal defence, environmental permitting and sustainable development. There are five strategic goals: \u2022 Increase the level of protection, restoration and upgrading of ecosystems \u2022 Increase the level of protection of people and property in the face of risk situations \u2022 Improve knowledge and information on environmental matters \u2022 Strengthen public participation and ensure the involvement of institutions \u2022 Guarantee excellent performance of assigned tasks APA has about 700 employees of whom 64% have academic degrees and 61% are women.   Its headquarters are near Lisbon and there are five regional offices \u2013 North, Centre, Tejo River Basin, Alentejo and Algarve.   Its infrastructures include Water Resources Monitoring Network, Environmental Documentation Centre, Laboratorial Network, Air Radioactivity Monitoring and Warning Network and Air Quality Network.   There was a peak of nearly 250 permits issued in 2008 which was the deadline for obtaining a permit for activities covered by the IPPC Directive.", "288/451 289/451 The content of the Environmental Permit includes the Identification of the installation, Emission Limit Values (based on BAT Conclusions), Monitoring, Reporting and Expiration Date.   Under the permitting procedure, documentation is available online and the public can participate and comment online: relevant comments are taken into account in the final permit.   For public access to the permit, permits are available online with a brief summary of the permitting process, derogations and participation of the public. For single operator permitting, under the old scenario the position was that there were several autonomous environmental regulations, different procedures, different electronic platforms, duplication of concepts and documents, several fees and many hard copies of the application.    Under the new approach there are several environmental regulations, integrated procedures, harmonisation of concepts, single electronic platform, single electronic application, single fee and single permit.   There are guidelines for the submission of the permit applications, namely necessary documents and the contents they must include in order to supply all the information to the different applicable regulation, single application and one electronic platform.   There is a single decision containing all the following information: all permit decisions from different entities, no duplication of requirements/permit conditions and available, simultaneously, to all competent authorities. Single Environmental Permitting is available to all types of projects that are under the compliance of environmental regulation.   It is integrated in several permit systems of the economic activities, namely energy, food and industrial production.   It is aimed at improving the quality of the procedure through harmonised, integrated and articulated systems.   It eliminates duplications and paper and provides a transparent and efficient procedure.   For the user interface there is a single electronic platform for all environmental systems (SILiAmb) which is interoperable with the electronic platform of the general permitting systems.   There is a framework simulator for the applicable environmental systems and for the automatic calculation of the fee. For a single application, on a block basis, there is common information to all relevant environmental systems. There is an additional block of specific information for each environmental system, if justified. A Single Environmental Permit (SEP) integrates all permits and acts of prior control issued on the environmental domain and establishes the conditions for construction, operation, monitoring and site closure. It holds the environmental record of the installation and makes harmonised information available to all stakeholders.   The concession of an environmental permit will establish a \u201cmerge\" of the several decisions issued for the different environmental systems.   The SEP includes all permitting conditions that the installation has to comply with, distributed by different sections, such as Construction, Operation and Site Closure for instance. For IED permits they do not use standard permits but always draw up permits on a case by case basis.   Vlado said that public involvement in the permitting process in Slovenia sometimes caused problems.   NGOs could appeal against permits which meant that it could take a long time for permits to become valid.   In Portugal, it was possible to take account of what they say and include it in the permit: in cases where it was problematic, and they wished to appeal, they would have to go to the Courts.   APA did not communicate much with Inspectors though this was now beginning to change. 4. Introduction of the Combined Guidance Book 290/451 The Combined Guidance Book was already well developed, but was not yet finalised.   Each step has one or two pages and will have links to factsheets which will provide guidance on good practice for specific technical issues.   It was structured according to the regulatory cycle.   The Guidance Book would be accessible on the IMPEL website. There was still some current project work to incorporate, for example Going beyond BAT and Baseline Reporting.   Another relevant IMPEL project was the one on the Implementation Challenge (and how to help overcome it).   The questionnaire had elicited 65 responses from IMPEL members and some of the things coming out of that project were relevant to the Guidance Book.   Agriculture had been identified as a problem area as was a lack of clarity in Permitting.   Some problems related to definitions and some to the translation of BREFs into permits.   There seemed to be a problem with IMPEL\u2019s outputs in that work had already been done in many of the problem areas and there was a question over how much it was actually being used.   The question of why these areas were still providing challenges was one for IMPEL to consider.  ", "We needed to be creative in how we presented this guidance (to ensure it was used as much as possible) and also on how we organised feedback on it. The Guidance Book contained much useful information and the intention was for it to be used as the basis for training, in cooperation with the IED Implementation Project. 5. IED Implementation/DTRT Permitting Working Groups The meeting divided into groups to consider the following topics: \u2022 Definitions \u2022 Mutual Joint Visits \u2022 Priorities for Permitting \u2022 Strategies for Permitting \u2022 Other than normal operating conditions \u2022 Compliance assurance \u2022 Permitting procedure \u2022 Evaluation and feedback (Permitting) \u2022 Eco-innovation Short summaries of the conclusions of each of these groups which were presented at the meeting can be found in Annex 1 to the note of this meeting.   Those who acted as rapporteurs were requested to put more information about the findings of their respective groups onto Basecamp so that these findings could be incorporated into the Guidance Book as appropriate. 6. Reporting back from the joint inspections (on 26 September 2017) 291/451 6.1 Granel \u2013 Moagens de Cerias, SA (Wheat flour production) Those taking part in this inspection were Antonio Quintas (Portugal \u2013 Main Inspector), Maria Jose Falcao (Portugal), Maria Enroth (Sweden) and Manuel Salgado (Spain, Galicia).   The inspection focused on air emissions and waste management.    During the inspection officers observed: \u2022 Chimneys and their monitoring points \u2022 Location and compression valves of dust filters \u2022 Waste stock areas and waste management \u2022 Control room and maintenance operations explanations \u2022 Septic tanks for waste water storage, and rain water canalisation. \u2022 Chemicals storage room \u2022 Critical points of diffuse emissions to air: charge of bulk flour and discharge of raw materials. The lessons learned from the inspection were that it was valuable for guest inspectors to witness an ordinary inspection.   The preparation meeting beforehand was useful to collect basic information. IED inspections in different countries are similar as they are checking on the same EU regulations but the time and effort of an IED inspection (study of documents, site visit, conclusions and reporting) are different between countries. There are pros and cons with announced and non-announced inspections.   Most of the joint learning is done during discussions before and after the specific inspection.   Know-how, installation understanding and knowledge about relevant BAT are important for focusing on key environmental issues (KEI) and environmental critical points (ECP).   The environmental permit of an installation is the most important tool for inspection.   A relevant permit will consider the key environmental issues (KEI) and environmental critical points (ECP) for an installation in order to facilitate an efficient inspection. 6.2  FISIPE \u2013 producer of acrylic fibres FISIPE is a European producer of acrylic fibres with plant at Lavradio, Portugal, operating since 1976. The process involves: continuous polymerisation; mixing of the polymer with a solvent to produce a syrup; extrusion of the syrup to produce the spun fibre; solvent recovery; cut and bailing. There is also a utilities area, tanks and a silo area for polymer storage. The joint inspection involved looking at the operation of the plant and emissions control with respect to the environmental permit. The permit defines conditions for water consumption, energy consumption, emissions to air and to water, and the production of waste. 292/451 Key areas for the inspection were assessing compliance with the permit conditions for wastewater discharges to the urban wastewater treatment system and verifying whether the company is carrying out the self- monitoring of emissions to air properly. 6.3  Pig Farm, Canha, Montijo Those taking part were Chrystalla Stylianou, Cyprus, Cl\u00e1udia Sim\u00f5es, Portugal, Jamie McGeachy, Scotland and Marta Ramos, Portugal.   The Pig Farm is operated by Operator Porval \u2013 Agropecu\u00e1ria, S.A. and has a permit for the intensive rearing of pigs.   It has a finished production capacity of 4076 production pigs and 790 breeding sows (adult female swine).   The installation is classified into a 6.6 (c) IED group according to Annex I of IED. The main issues and findings were: 1. Slurry management.   The separator was out of service for a long time and the previous inspection required a cover \u2013 Violation of the Permit. 2. Significant changes in the process.   A new cooling water system was installed without notification resulting in higher water abstraction and higher energy consumption.   There was no notification to competent authorities - Violation of the Permit. 3. Management of other waste - dead animals, hazardous waste and packaging waste 4.", "A notification was given to the operator requesting reports, data, licence, insurance/warranty 7 IED Ongoing Working Groups 7.3 Going beyond BAT The group looking at this consisted of Jamie, Pieter and Jaako.   The results of their work were on Basecamp. The paper looks at the main elements of BAT and they had discussed what was meant by going beyond BAT. They had concluded that there were three main competing definitions: any measure not mentioned in BAT; any measure which exceeds the performance levels associated with the BATc; and any measure, including wider considerations, that is outside the scope of the IED and the BATc.   Each of these definitions is useful. The next part involved looking at those articles of the Directive related to going beyond BAT, namely articles 14, 15, 18 and 27.    Article 14 describes how permit conditions must be set and provides flexibility to include stricter conditions in permits.   Article 15 is concerned with the setting of emission limit values.   Article 18 is about Environmental Quality Standards and Article 27 is concerned with emerging techniques. There are several obstacles to going beyond BAT.   One is a lack of knowledge in that people are unaware of which emerging techniques are available.   Another is the potential risk for the operator and the regulating authority though they had been able to find some examples in Germany, The Netherlands and UK. 293/451 The group would turn their findings into a factsheet. 7.4 Tools Members of this group were Rikke, Vladimir, Marinus, Dubravka, Florin, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas, I\u00f1aki, Lone, Manuel, \u015eenay, Tom\u00e1\u0161 and Wulf. The group had looked at Tools needed to implement IED. The group had focussed on the main new tasks of IED and when and where IT Tools should be used.   They also considered which IT Tools operators and authorities have access to (such as tablets). They had begun by looking at the articles in the IED that could be connected to IT Tools and considered those to be the ones relating to risk assessment, annual inspection plans, reminder on follow up actions and creating a report and publishing it.   They also considered creating a list of installations (part of the annual plan), storage and assessment of emission monitoring results and a Tool that makes emission monitoring data publicly available. They sent out a questionnaire and had 16 responses.   These are the options outlined above as voted for in the questionnaire: a tool for the risk assessment of IED-installations 4,9, a tool for creating a list of installations 4,6, a tool for the storage and assessment of emission monitoring results 4,4, a tool for the drawing up of the annual inspection programme 4,2, a tool for creating a report and publishing it 4,1, a reminder tool for required actions 3,4 and a tool to make available to the public the results of emission monitoring 3,4. Examples of Tools with parallel access for the authority and operator included Turkey which has an e- permitting-system that is used where the authority can request information from the applicant or Portugal which has shared tools for waste production, water permit conditions and environmental permits.   The group recommends that the IT equipment of authorities should be broadened to allow parallel access to data, such as approvals or waste documents. This would avoid discussions about the relevant versions of relevant data and also offers the possibility of a quick information exchange. There are arguments for and against the use of IT Tools but in practice they are being used more and more and are inescapable in the end.    They can be a cause of mental stress factors in the daily work and the best way to optimise them is a development process with IT experts and users.   The basic advantages of good IT tools are that they are motivating, because they are efficient and meeting the inspectors\u2018 needs, they are time saving and reduce the lack of resources and they improve the quality of work because they allow  findings to be analysed quickly.   The group recommended national solutions rather than a pan-European tool. 7.5 Industrial Waste Water Romano said that he, Roberto, Malgorzata, Manuel and Rikke contributed to this group.   The first draft of the document was on Basecamp.   The Commission had asked IMPEL to look at this topic and they had tried to 294/451 focus on the waste water from industrial installations.   ", "The group had considered definitions, the regulatory framework, linked IMPEL projects, monitoring and sampling of waste water, waste water management and inspections in waste water treatment plants.    Related IMPEL projects were Integrated Water Approach (2017) and Linking the Water Framework and IPPC/IE Directives.   The draft BREF on monitoring of emissions to air and water from IED installations gives some guidance on measurement and sampling, distinguishing between continuous and periodic measurements, between continuous and periodic sampling, and between composite and spot samples.   In addition, BAT is mentioned in vertical BREFs about waste water. There was a chapter on inspection of installations with waste water discharges which also looked at sampling. There was also a reference to dealing with violations and on what to do with the results of self-monitoring. There was an Annex with a checklist on wastewater treatment plant inspection (based on BAT) and another giving the responses to the survey.   Horst said that the report would be included as an Annex to the project report. 8 Follow up and closure of the meeting Horst and Toni suggested that there should be a single short report for IMPEL covering both projects which would summarise the results of the work over the year and include the joint inspections.   There would be a brief article for the IMPEL newsletter which Terry/John were asked to prepare. It was provisionally agreed that the project meetings in 2018 would be held in Spain, Finland and Scotland. Chrystalla spoke about the work that had been done on the horizontal aspects of permitting.   It was still possible to submit responses and she planned to have a report for the next meeting which would be turned into a factsheet. Ana Garcia spoke briefly about the European Commission\u2019s Compliance Assurance initiative which was launched earlier this year. This initiative sets out actions to support Member States in how they promote, monitor and enforce compliance by economic operators and other duty-holders with EU environment law. During a stakeholders conference on 31 of January, followed by a workshop on tackling waste and wildlife crime and non-compliance which took place on 20 March, IMPEL was invited to draft a position paper contributing to the initiative and providing input for the Action Plan. The position paper identifies 6 areas where IMPEL could play a role, namely: 1. Build strategic relationships 2. Understand the implementation challenges of environmental laws and regulations 3. Develop and build capacity of environmental regulators 4. Establish a European knowledge and innovation centre for practitioners 5. Coordinate inspection and enforcement actions with transboundary relevance 295/451 6. Formalising the feedback loop 296/451 Annex 1 9 Feedback from working groups How to proceed with joint inspections? 1. Goals: Harmonized view on an effective inspection. Practical ways to better compliance. 2. How to share: Focus on 1-2 common problems, bring in experience colleagues, distil 1 wisdom and 1 advice after each joint inspection, seminars/networks within and between MS, implementation/feedback (in own organisation and to policy makers) 3. Joint inspectors must have inspection experience, speak English. No consensus: Sector experience? Also permit writers? 4. Good idea: Base sectors joint inspections on (implementation) new/revised BAT conclusions \u2018Other than normal\u2019 operating conditions 1. Overlap between OTNOC and Article 7 ( a. Accidents) & Article 8 (non-compliance) 2. OTNOC\u2019S should usually be foreseeable things i.e. start-up, flaring, cleaning programs \u2013 element of risk assessment 3. OTNOC triggers specific requirements vs general requirements 4. Foreseeable OTNOCs, dis-apply ELV\u2019s. a. Unexpected OTNOC\u2019s in theory do the same but this may not be appropriate. 5. Confusion from Article 14(1)(f) description, it may not be correct and needs clarification.   (i.e. a. no examples of OTNOC leaks) Priorities for Permitting Discussion started with the questions: \u2022 How do we deal with priorities? \u2022Why do we need priorities? \u2022 How, and what factors help us decide priorities for permitting? 297/451 \u2022 The guidance has identified 8 main factors which impact permit writer resources. The group identified additional key factors which are important in determining priorities for Permitting: 1. Political Priorities and pressures. 2. Effectiveness of the permit writer 3. The competition from different private firms 4. Media Attention 5. Incentives and measures from the government that require immediate issuance of permits 6. The need to maximise the use of resources 7. Changes in BREFs, which impose changes in permits. Strategies for permitting 1. Strategies are action plans and are important to achieve goals and objectives mentioned in the context 2.", "Set principles for strategies, permit should: a. reflect legal requirements b. clear environmental outcome c. be risk-based 298/451 d. be proportionate e. should reflect public participation f. include principle of cost effectiveness g. take into account polluter pays principle h. should help economic growth (guidance, easy to apply for permits etc.) 3. Some additions to the guidance book: a. strategy on derogation b. templates with the aim to speed up procedures for minor changes Definitions 1. Sharing. Wiki together with forum including practical examples would be a useful way to share and use, using different translations, next to legal also practical explanations. 2. Use feedback from inspectors to permitters and legislators. 3. Collected explanations by IMPEL are useful although still some practical issues exist. 4. Nine definitions discussed. Some definitions not yet defined, mainly related to chemical industry example industrial scale, chemical reaction. 5. \u2018Installation\u2019 pivotal definition IED implementation. Other methods for compliance assurance ASSURING 1. Communicating regularly with operators and educating them on updates in legislation to avoid non- compliances. 2. Communicating to the public any non-compliances and fines issued. 3. Stepping in the management of the installations in case of severe opposition to compliance requirements PROMOTING 1. Explain and communicate convenience of being compliant (third part contracting) 2. Environmental compliance criteria within contracts for public services 3. Incentives for compliance (reduced fees for application, frequency and fees for inspections) New Technologies Satellite imaging, Drones, GPS tracking, remote monitoring Defining steps in permitting procedure 1. There is an overall consensus that the steps mentioned under the phases application, decision making and public participation are correct 2. Some small corrections need to be done in the order of the steps 3. How the steps are filled in can be very different per member country (these steps were identified) 4. Adding best practices to the guidance of the different steps would be much appreciated 299/451 5. A platform to exchange operational permitting issues is needed Eco-innovations 1. Many examples on eco-innovation were presented 2. Undefined process: -lack of knowledge -assessing information need and interpreting information 3. - assessing environmental unintended consequences a. unable/unwilling to make decisions 4. - lack of standards a. need for EU standards 5. - Different interpretations of the legislation 6. Solutions: a. engaging all stakeholders (universities, trade bodies, policy makers, operators, NGO\u2019s, general public) 7. - agree on standards Evaluation and feedback 1. Evaluation: identifying opportunities for improvement based on experiences 2. Feedback: communication of these insights to another level 3. Feedback along the regulatory chain 4. Making effective two-way communication 5. Many examples of good practice: 6.

How to proceed with Joint Inspections? Summary 1. Goals: Harmonised view on an effective inspection. Practical ways to better compliance. 2. How to share: Focus on 1-2 common problems, bring in experienced colleagues, distill one piece of \u2018wisdom\u2019 and one piece of advice after each joint inspection, seminars/networks within and between MS, implementation/feedback (in own organisation and to policy makers). 3. Joint inspectors must have inspection experience, speak English. No consensus: Sector experience? Also permit writers? 4. Good idea: Base sectors joint inspections on (implementation) new/revised BAT conclusions. Session 1 \u2022 Inspectors tend to be pre-programmed on their own method.   Joint inspections give other perspectives and help open your mind. \u2022", "Good to see what you can do when additional capacity is available: better, deeper preparation and availability of specialists. \u2022 Are faster inspections possible? Check with colleagues in other countries.   It depends on the quality you want.   Joint inspections could lead to agreement on minimum quality. \u2022 Advice/recommendations are welcome.   Work to common approach and the same framework. Session 2 \u2022 Inspections turned out to be very similar. \u2022 Learned: focus on problems around the site. 303/451 \u2022 Opened view to specific problem, not a common inspection. \u2022 Hoped to get more feedback. Objectives the same, but methods different. \u2022 Big picture the same, small differences, e.g. monitoring and on site signed report. On what subject should we focus? Session 1, results mentimeter survey \u2022 Share ideas on effective inspections plus monitoring of this: 5 \u2022 Inspection tools used during inspections: 5 \u2022 Comments: o Focus on 90%, 100% too much effort. What is a good result/90%? o Checklist, good internet connection, advice on measures to be taken by company. Session 2, results mentimeter survey \u2022 Good practice (measures) identified during inspection: 5 \u2022 Share ideas on effectiveness inspection  plus monitoring this: 3 \u2022 Comments o Which inspection (methods) lead to better compliance? Comparison works if companies are comparable. o What was really done on site? What can you do in a certain time? How to determine the scope? With what sector would you want to start? Session 1, results mentimeter survey \u2022 Chemical industry: 5 \u2022 Other: Intensive rearing pigs/poultry: 2 \u2022 Comments: o Relate sectors for joint inspections to EU agenda BAT conclusions, e.g. in year 3 implementation BAT conclusions prepare joint inspections.   Also inspections to do recommendations for BAT conclusions review (feedback). 304/451 o Compare used approach REACH: decide togather on common focus, prepare togEther, e.g. interpretation, guidebook, reports.   For REACH this is organised by inspection forum European Chemicals Agency. Session 2, results mentimeter survey \u2022 Waste management: 3 \u2022 Chemicals: 3 \u2022 Metals: 2 \u2022 Other: 2 (intensive rearing, feed/food) \u2022 Comments: o Sector not so important. o Link to publication revised BAT conclusions. o Waste management has many issues (air, soil), special attention to bankruptcy (bank guarantee, assurance). What way of sharing of these lessons would you prefer? Session 1 \u2022 Sharing checklists. \u2022 Wisdom of the day from each inspection (e.g. don\u2019t inspect what is known). \u2022 Random checks (e.g. hazardous substances). \u2022 Panel discussion on comparing leading to advice. \u2022 Disseminate inspection report before meeting (now not enough time between inspection and workshops). \u2022 Discussion/feedback on implementing wisdom/advice. \u2022 Exchange through internet, page per sector, structured. Session 2 \u2022 Seminars. 305/451 \u2022 More joint inspections. \u2022 Exchange programme. \u2022 Share in inspectors group at home, national inspection forum. \u2022 If number of inspectors is not too big, sharing is easy, but outside that group more difficult. \u2022 We don\u2019t have to learn how to do the inspections. Procedure not so important. Practical approach in the field is important. \u2022 Focus on common problem instead of being complete. \u2022 Inspector groups per sector and/or theme (soil, waste, etc.). \u2022 Enforcement can help to check new policies and legislation. \u2022 Short summaries. Should there be minimum criteria for the inspectors who join these joint inspections on content and if yes what are these? Session 1 \u2022 Experience in one sector is not a must have, because experienced person might not speak English. \u2022 Use translated BATc to prepare inspection. \u2022 Qualifications can differ between member states, so be careful. \u2022 Some English necessary, technical/environmental English. \u2022 Will to learn. \u2022 Do you have inspection experience now or earlier? For example relevant to interpret reactions. operators. Permitter has other perspective. \u2022 Technical expertise good to have. Session 2 \u2022 Also permit writers in joint inspections. \u2022 Basic knowledge of sector. \u2022 English or common language in group. \u2022 Participation in preparation meeting / teleconference. 306/451 \u2022 Collect experience in your own office to bring to joint inspections. Joint Inspection is one way to identify these good measures and learn from each other.   Is there another way you prefer to do this?   For example, as in Seveso a conference on specific issues. Or maybe an international sector specific knowledge group on inspection related issues. Sesion 1 \u2022 Seveso organises conferences. This is a good way for feedback to policy makers. \u2022 Exchange programmes, including exchange experience when you come back home. \u2022 Some one should be responsible in an organisation for improving inspections. \u2022", "Present results to other policy areas like nature or to permitters, policy makers. Session 2 \u2022 Sector/issue networks. \u2022 Make clear on what exactly you want to exchange. \u2022 Annual conference. 307/451 2. \u2018Other than normal\u2019 operating conditions First Group Purpose of the session was to obtain a better understanding of the concept of OTNOC Two types of BAT AEPLs: BAT-AELs and BAT-(non-AEL)AEPLs These are set for normal operating conditions, not for OTNOC. But what are normal operating conditions? Portugal: OTNOCs: if you cannot comply with ELV this constitutes an emergency. Operator needs to notify the emergency and what was done to get into normal OC. Operator may be fined. In the permit emergencies are defined (chapter on malfunctions/failures/accidents). Emergencies have a time limit, notifications need to be done within a certain time period. Is there a difference between optimal and normal OC? Optimal: is what the installation can achieve as a maximum optimum over some time. Sweden: normal # optimal OC. For optimal OC you also have to look at total impact, total mass emissions. Finland: yes, it is not just complying with emissions standards but you need to also look at yearly loads. Austria: industrial process and abatement: these need to fit together. Normal is not optimal. Normal OC are basis for permit ELVs. Should operations stop immediately in case of OTNOC? What is OTNOC causing? Significant impact? Difficult to assess before court. OTNOC # exceedance of ELVs, but may result in such exceedence Finland: In application already mention foreseeable OTNOCs. Than permit proper requirements can be included. But not all OTNOCs are foreseeable. You can have a general notification/measures requirement for not foreseeable OTNOCs. 308/451 Finland: Example: pulp and paper. Strikes > shutdown and restart > how to operate the wastewater treatment plant. Austria: max period for start and closure power stations. Define foreseeable OTNOCs in the BREFs. Start and closure is straightforward example of foreseeable OTNOC. Cleaning is also a good example. Leaks and malfunctions: not foreseeable - general requirements - what caused the unforeseeable OTNOC? Due to bad operator performance?? Example : Operator cannot stop leakage as he has no spare parts OTNOC should be as short as technically possible. What sort of measures do you take as an authority to end an OTNOC - discuss with operator, notification to take measures, enforcement in case of breach of permit requirements (maintenance). When you don't comply anymore you have to report this When is something OTNOC?: difference between seasons - Scotland: dispensation Provisonal conclusion after this session: we need to assess what role/added value of provision of OTNOCs is in compared to articles 7 and 8 (incidents, reporting non-compliances) ====================================================================== Second Group ELVs under normal conditions >> in case OTNOC they do not apply 309/451 Previous group stressed foreseeable occurrence. Incidents and accidents and non-compliance provisions - what is added value of provision on OTNOCS? In Scotland: normal is optimal - set an ELV at that level - in case of an OTNOC the ELV does not apply Does Scotland describe OTNOCs? Unforeseeable OTNOCs >> rely on article 7 and 8 Foreseeable OTNOCs >> there may be specific requirements in the permit How to define what are normal conditions? In case of obligation of continuous measurement of emissions, operator should provide parameters for normal OC as well as for start and shutdown phase, so measured emissions can be properly assessed. Portugal: accommodate OTNOCS by allowing temporary deviations (for a maximum period of time). Is an accident an OTNOC? If yes, what other obligations would the permit include in addition to the ones based on article 7 of the IED? Incidents and accidents: we need to prevent these, check if EMS is properly working, so learn from handling incidents. Slovenia: regarding respsonses to OTNOCs distinguish between 1) OTNOCS with no environmental impact, for instance malfunctioning of monitoring > production can go on 2) filter break > more emissions > lower production 3) disaster > stop production What is OTNOC: 310/451 \u25cf 20-80 case: fuel source is variable in quality? No should be regulated as normal OC \u25cf Temporary low production due to low market demand? No should be regulated as normal OC \u25cf Technical failure not caused by bad maintenance? Is not OTNOC but incident Start or closure is OTNOC -  ELVs do not apply - this is in the permit.", "Emissions of flares - in permit: flares only allowed for safety reasons - this is an OTNOC Testing, preventive maintenance of tanks are OTNOC Chemical plant in Sardinia, leakage from a tank, due to bad maintenance (maintenance plan was not followed) - is incident/non-compliance not OTNOC Foreseeable - (based on risk assessment) is key characterisc of OTNOC in contrast with incidents. Incineration plant - start and shutdown  - set limits to hours for switching of and on - this should not be a routine but OTNOC 311/451 3. Priorities for Permitting Group 1 \u2022 How do we deal with priorities and Why do we need priorities?   Do we require a special time period for writing a permit?   How do we meet deadlines?   Are there enough resources to meet time frames? \u2022 There are various possibilities, including that of having the need to complete different tasks depending on the resources available. \u2022 A point we want to address this afternoon: We are now the owners/mentors of our work. We need to find a good system of how to set our priorities and what priorities to be set.   The best approach is not always possible. \u2022 Guidance is always addressing certain factors important in setting priorities. \u2022 The environmental Outcome... what do we understand by this? o The investment behind the permits we are issuing. o Statutory deadlines that we have to comply with. Including third party demands, some policy factors. (policies drive our priorities) o The age of the application is another important factor and o The enforcement priority. \u2022 Before talking about other factors... what factors that you know, in some way impacted on permit writing work? o Political priorities can influence Permit writing.... so a permit can be requested to be issued quickly on top of other permits that the permit writer might be working on. o The Netherlands subsidise some projects (for example, the construction of wind turbines), so if that project requires a permit... that can also be requested to have a permit issued immediately. 312/451 o Another issue is with Competition... Chrystalla mentioned Competition within Private companies where these are competing for the same market (for example, Medical or pharmaceutical).   The first one who gets the permit will be able to make money first because they go on the market very quickly. o Deniss from Latvia says that the significant factor is that knowledge of permit writer... permit writers in Latvia are not specialised.   He insists that ideally a Permit writer should be more specialised and issue permits for particular sectors.... Criteria would be specialised Permit Work plan on the basis, on the ability of knowledge of permit writer. o Chrystalla mentioned Public / Media Attention \u2013 Media factors that might influence priorities can be complaints, TV, newspapers... therefore media attention creates priorities for the issue of permits.   Priorities may shift depending on more \u2018HOT\u2019 issues which appear on TV or newspaper or radio and therefore stirs up more attention. o Other priorities include projects which are subsidised or funded by the government... these projects, if they require permits, will take priority for permitting. o Another case in point is if the Government issues funding for particular sectors to improve systems. These too can be priorities. o Priority is the environmental Impact of that particular company which requires permitting. Thus, the company with the largest environmental impact will get more priority for issue of permit. However unfortunately this is not always the case, since political demands/influence take priority. o The age of the application (how long the application has been waiting) can also be a determining factor when deciding priorities. \u2022 Understanding the factors: Understanding whether the points that we have made should be treated in the guidelines as different points. o Political pressures \u2013 Perhaps even though that it is very much linked to enforcement priority sites, it can also be a new point if the facility is a new one which requires pressure but requires immediate Permitting. So, a new point perhaps. o Effectiveness of the permit writer \u2013 this can go as an additional factor. This would increase effectiveness and efficiency of the permit writer since he/she would be more knowledgeable of the industry. o The Competition from different private firms and media attention \u2013 This can be inserted in the definition at the point on Client and third party demands.", "313/451 o Incentives and measures from the government \u2013 most members think that it would be best to go into a new point. o The Environmental Impact \u2013 Could be included with definition point. o The need to maximise the use of resources \u2013 o Changes in Brefs, which imposes changes in the permits. Sometimes there are not sufficient resources to monitor and implement these.   Permit writers thus wait for the operator to apply for any action/ updates to permits to be carried out. 1 & 2) How many IED permit writers are there at present working at ERA or in the other authorities of the different countries? o Italians \u2013 160 installations and 15 permit writers o The Netherlands \u2013 100 installations and 7 permit writers (specialists on noise, emissions etc...) o Latvians \u2013 90 installations and 10 permit writers. o Cyprus \u2013 73 installations and 2 permit writers o Malta \u2013 28 installations and 5 permit writers however these work on other permits and not just on IED installations. o Portugal \u2013 800 installations and 14 permit writers o Belgium (Flanders) 700 installations and 14 permit writers o Spain (Murcia) \u2013 400 IED installations and 15 permit writers 3) Does the permitting team work on a first in and first out option when working with permit applications? o No \u2013 most work on prioritising on the environmental impacts first... o Permit writers also should review the permits in view of changing BREFs, however not enough resources to review. o Are we receiving clear priority setting methodology?   Do we get a work plan?   In priority setting methodology is the main factor is the deadline?   Or perhaps those clients/operators who push hard will get their permit first?   Sometimes is it a matter of who will give you the most complete application... going back and forth is an issue and involves waste of time. 314/451 5) Do your permit writers know the installations that they will permit in the coming year? \u2022 We spoke about the need to have an expiration date. Most countries have permits with no expiration dates. Ruth mentioned that in Malta they still have expiries. \u2022 Various departments are involved in discussing and producing the application to meet with the various difficulties. This is common practice for all countries.   Especially when it comes to large scale operations/facilities. \u2022 In most countries, permit workers cannot do inspections, but sometimes for large installations they do, so as to have a general idea of how the installation works. 6) Refer to the list of factors in the guidance? (page 17 and 18) a) Environmental Outcome \u2013 in our setting priorities, if the environmental impact is high, then the environmental outcome of permitting that installation is high.   All agree with this statement.   Portugal have a different way to dealing with that installation \u2013 reduce the expiration date when permit is issued. Not setting priorities is to set some kind of priorities. There is a general issue with insufficient permitting staff. b) Significant Investment \u2013 incentives etc... - definition has been agreed upon c) Statutory deadline/infringement risk \u2013 definition has been agreed upon d) Client and third party demand \u2013 pressure from competing industries and media to be included. This point should be included in the definition. e) Revenue \u2013 ok - definition has been agreed upon f) Policy Drivers - definition has been agreed upon g) Age of the Application - definition has been agreed upon h) Enforcement priority sites \u2013 this definition is strictly in connection with inspectors and permit writers... based on enforcement and on nothing else.   In our discussion we mentioned additional point that are not related to this point.   This involves political impact/pressures, which are not necessarily political but only enforcement. 315/451 Group 2: \u2022 Dealing with priorities? Why do we need priorities? Special time period for writing of a permit, meeting deadlines, first in, first out basis perhaps.   Which are the factors that are influencing how we set priorities in permitting? \u2022 Additional factors apart from those points mentioned in the guidance. What factors apart from these are setting priorities for every country/agency? Which are the most important factors in setting priorities? o Helena mentioned general knowledge of the installation - any environmental outcome is a priority, importance of preparing basic report of the site (baseline reports), so as to have more information about the environmental impacts that could take place on the particular site to define environmental importance/significance. o", "Thomas mentioned that it depends on lack of staff/resources, thus priorities are based on resources or lack thereof.   This problem is that resources is not exactly included in the 8 factors already discussed.   The need to maximise the use of resources in terms of competences. o Fabio mentioned assessing the effective impact of the activity such as impact on air and water... following this, it is important to assess the green assessment of impact. Another issue is the presence of residential houses around the particular installation.   Fabio mentioned biomass plants.   The amounts of complaints are high even before the plant is constructed. Fabio also mentioned political priorities o Ruth mentioned political pressures on permit writers. o Maria mentioned focusing on the key activities of that installation and good technical knowledge on the subject so as to decrease and minimise its impacts.   The status of the environment is also another important priority. This too can be included with the need to maximise the use of resources in terms of competences. 316/451 o Maria said that the first priority should be to apply the EU directives, then they attain to the dimension of the plant, the technology, location (near population or in ODZ or sensitive area).   She also mentioned that Cooperation between inspectors and permit writers should also be important and set as a priority for Portugal. o Thomas asked whether Portuguese inspectors cooperate with permit writers. In Czech Republic, the inspectors produce their opinion on the permit and this should be set as a priority when permit writers are working on the applications for installations. o Maria from Portugal said that when they find issues with the permit, they ask the national authorities to update the permits accordingly, but they do not have an active participation in writing the permits. o Competences of the ministry to set priorities from the permit writers. Can we include the mentioned factors within the framework of the guidelines as it is right now?   With the points mentioned, do we have to add new points or do these fit in with the already defined definitions? 1& 2) How many IED permit writers are there at present working at ERA or in the other authorities of the different countries? o Italians \u2013 160 installations and 15 permit writers o Czech Republic \u2013 170 installations and 8 permit writers (only IED permits) o Czech Republic \u2013 Thomas not sure \u2013 but approx 10 permit writers for 200 installations. o Sweden \u2013 13   installations o Malta \u2013 28 installations and 4 permit writers (around 1.5 or 2 working on IED) o Lombardia \u2013 100 installations and 10 permit writers (work on other types of permits) o Portugal \u2013 800 installations and 18 permit writers (not all specific on IED) 3) Does the permitting team work on a first in and first out option when working with permit applications? 317/451 No . The majority of members present during the work shop confirmed that their first priority is the environmental impact. 5) Do you know for your permit writers, the installations that you will permit in the coming year? This group was composed mainly of inspectors and thus not everyone was able to answer this question. 318/451 4. Strategies for Permitting First session In the guidance an explanation is included on why there is a need for strategies: strategies are action plans and are important to achieve the goals and objectives mentioned in the context. Participants agree that strategies are also interesting to prioritise your work. If you know what you want to achieve (e.g. all permits BAT proof) the strategy shows you how to achieve this. In the Guidance book DTRT 10 strategies are listed.   For some strategies factsheets are included. Participants were asked to check whether strategies are missing and whether there are good practices we can include in the guidance. Remarks on the guidance: Applying for BAT on page 19 guidance book: the aim is to review in time, but also national laws have deadlines.   You must review permits on BAT.   For existing installations the BATc in the permit should be reviewed within 4 years, for new installations apply BATc when adopted. Rob remarks that you need to prioritise to review in time, because capacity is not always sufficient. Therefore, a strategy is needed to make sure that the permit complies with BAT. Cyprus has a lack of capacity: at the agency the same person carries out inspections and writes the permit.  ", "In general, communication with the operator is difficult.   To separate permitting and inspectors is not considered a good thing in Cyprus.   The advantage of doing both is that you know the plant better.   Disadvantages are that more work and more effort is put into the permit than in inspections. Possible solution for lack of capacity: to issue the permit for a longer or unlimited time.   In Cyprus the validity for a permit is 4 years. Factsheet 2.02 of the Guidance book: Applying BAT In the factsheet BAT a special programme is mentioned in the text.   For the participants this was not clear. Rob suggests that this be clarified in the next version. 319/451 Factsheet 2.03 of the Guidance book: Review of existing permits Some clarification is needed on the time frame. For LCP this seems to be different. In addition, some explanation is needed in the guidance on how to deal with the issue of the main installations vs the other installations.   The directive prescribes main activity. Therefore, how to approach main conclusion? This question should go back to working group (Pieter Roos). Romano: 4 years is for the main activity. On the review of exiting permits the following comments have been made: IT: Every 5 years a review should take place according to the law. When there is a substantial change, the permit needs to be revised. DG: a permit is for an unlimited time. Reviews take place on regular basis. MT: in Malta a permit is valid for 4 years. RO: when new air quality or water quality regulations come into force, the agency/inspection unit requests a revision.   The agency will receive the application, an assessment and an inspection on site takes place.   A meeting at the office is held to assess what should be changed.   Based on the assessment the permit will be revised. MT: same system as RO. To determine what is \u201con regular basis\u201d, a strategy could be developed. GE: new BAT will be translated in national regulation when needed.   Not all BREFs are transposed. When it is transposed in general binding rules, the competent authority is responsible for implementation. PT: when BATc is published, it is binding. Competent authorities must choose which ELV they have to apply to according to new BATc.   Operator can propose which ELV within the limits.   The permit writer then can give derogation on cost efficiency.   Especially on waste water ELV.   In some regions the installation for waste water discharge is different because of different water quality (sensitive water bodies). 320/451 MT: there are some challenges regarding the building and environmental permit.   If you don\u2019t have a building permit, you don\u2019t get an environmental permit.   There is a situation now in Malta where it\u2019s not possible to issue an environmental permit because the building permit cannot be issued (build was illegal) and now the government cannot legalise the situation anymore (although they would like to).   A solution could be to change the legislation to get out of the illegal situation, e.g. by legalising the operator. Rob: interesting to develop a strategy which describes how to solve these types of situation. What type of strategies are important to reach goals of the organisation? Short list of possible strategies IT tools to manage: \u2022 Expiry dates \u2022 Priorities because of legal constrains \u2022 Workload \u2022 Better permits A strategy on how a competent authority should deal with BAT.   The strategy should not only be agreed within the competent authorities but also with other partner organisations. A strategy could also focus on how to improve permits or on how to reach goals of the organisation. In the big 8 (describing the context) the organisation sets its goals. This should not only be goals but also objectives.   Strategies should focus on achieving these goals and objectives.   These goals and objectives should improve the permits.   It\u2019s important to move to outcome instead of output.   The way to do this should be clarified in the guidance. General principles (e.g. prevent waste, re-use waste, energy efficiency) could also be included in the goals.   We have to find performance indicators to monitor this. Rob asks whether there are more issues that should be addressed in guidance? On the derogations factsheet: it doesn\u2019t help a lot what the directive says about derogation. Perform a cost benefit study to prove it is expensive so you can get derogation. We need more guidance on a strategy on this subject. 321/451 MT: strategy on teaming up with the inspectorate.", "For example, if the objective and targets are clear then developing a strategy and action plan together with the inspectorate on this can be achieved. Include templates to speed up the procedures for minor changes. For example, a fast procedure template. Add a strategy that tells what procedure to choose in which situation. Also page 20 of the guidance book there is a statement: \u201con the report of the permit writer\u201d. This statement needs more clarification. Second session NL: In the working group on priorities for permitting it became clear that priorities in organisations are often not set, they can change from one day to another because of developments, politics or media.   Therefore, it can be difficult to follow a certain strategy when these dynamics interfere.   An example of prioritisation can be on environmental impact of permits to be included in the annual plan. It would be very useful to use a set of principles for strategies to give it a good structure. One can distinguish 8 principles for strategies: 1. The permit should reflect legal requirements (e.g. applying BAT) 2. The permit should include clear environmental settings (e.g. standards and outcomes to be met) 3. The permit should be risk based (e.g. risk for human beings and wildlife) 4. The permitting should be proportionate in relation to size and risk. (e.g. a nuclear reactor versus a storm break) 5. The permit should reflect the public participation that took place. 6. The permit should include the polluter pays principle. 7. The permitting process should be cost effective (e.g. GBR vs integrating permitting) 322/451 8. When possible, the permit should support economic growth. (e.g. applying for a permit should be easy for an operator (1 window permitting process). Developing guidance for the operators so they do not have to hire expensive consultants) Participants agreed that this set of principles for strategies is very useful to include in the guidance book. Which good practices on strategies could be included in the guidance book? BE: On general binding rules and permit conditions there is a need for smart balancing in an efficient way, for example, align the revisions of the permit with planning of inspections. Communication in this respect is important when the BREF is written.   In Belgium this process is coordinated and when the BATc is published it can be implemented immediately. When part of the BATc is in general binding rules, a format will be prepared in Brussels (Federal government BE) for same set.   This practice can be part of the strategy. CY: General Binding Rules are difficult to develop for the Ministry.   There is a lack of strategy to make an act on general binding rules or to issue as many permits.   GBR are also seen as a difficult issue for certain sectors: e.g operators (owners) of farms as they sometimes do not have a high education.    In that case it\u2019s felt that permits are easier for this group to comply with. Permits however can interfere with the level playing field within a sector: some have a permit and some do not. It\u2019s important to include in a strategy that to create a level playing field all operators within a specific sector need to have a permit. There can also be an unequal approach when a new BATc is published and some installations are reviewed and others are not. An equal approach is needed and can be included in the strategy. Rob: a strategy is on a higher level. Build on experience within Member States and smart balances on what we can do on general binding rules. NL: In permitting the goals we need to achieve should be clear. To reach these goals we sometimes need to have more flexibility. A practical example: in a chemical plant every tank has its own designated product.   However, the designation changes all the time and therefore the permits need to change. In the permit we could add that changes are allowed unless the product is corrosive or flammable.   Of course, this should be based on the risks that can occur (Risk based permitting). Environmental monitoring system are also part of this. This approach could be transformed into a strategy for permits. 323/451 5. Definitions (as mentioned in IED) Structure guidance A wikipedia type of glossary closely connected to a forum were mentioned several times. Participants thought the present basecamp has too little functionality and overview to be used for a forum.", "The excel sheet as used till now doesn\u2019t work so well because of the limitations of the columns.   There would also be a need for technical knowledgeable editors if this were the way to go on. Next to a clear description, there was also a need for practical examples. In general, most descriptions and clarifications of definitions already collected on basecamp were assessed as very useful.   On the other hand, there were some definitions missing. Especially related to the chemical sector (chemical reaction, industrial scale, mixing). Definitions are sometimes unclear because of the translation. These problems could be clarified by reading other translations. Another idea was using the network to share problems with definitions and share the solutions among each other on maybe a forum as mentioned earlier. Sometimes different words are used for the same meaning.   And advice would be to also look outside the EU (for example, the UN) for definitions and their clarification. Definitions 1. Installation Issue raised was what to do if more operators are responsible for one installation. Or if company parts are connected to a bigger firm. The question to ask is who has the (economic) power to solve non-compliances.   Practical examples would help to learn how to deal with these situations.   In addition, what does technically connected mean?   It happens operators declare that certain parts are not 324/451 technically connected with the main factory. 2. Activities Example heading in Annex I IED: energy industry. Explain categories in relation to aggregation rule.   Explain that top level categories have no real meaning! What about wine making, is that a chemical reaction?   And mixing of chemicals? And what is \u2019industrial scale\u2019\u2019? 3. Permit conditions: point where the emissions leave the installation Explain mixing rule based on additive share (ELV in %). Explain emission inventory and monitoring at key locations as tools for checking compliance (BREF and good practice available) Limits for air emissions, how is it created and how do you measure? Not only concentration but also load is important. How to deal with indirect emissions?   BAT only for direct-channelled emissions and not for indirect and diffuse ones.   And what about the emission to an on-site water cleaning facility?   Is it of any use to identify ELV\u2019s for the stream from the process to the water treatment plant if contaminations can be removed biological in this treatment plant? 4. Compliance assurance; environmental inspection What is the scope, a full or risk based inspection? The question was raised what is a general assessment? In addition, is a risk-based inspection only on most important parts of an installation? In addition, what does integrated inspection mean? Sometimes, integrated means more parallel inspections of parts like water, air, soil. Or an inspection at a complex installation in many days.   An inspection can be an on-site inspection, but also desk studies. 325/451 5. Capacity Use design capacity and not actual used capacity.   In addition, legal binding time of operation can reduce the capacity.   For instance, in case of complaints.   Additional examples are needed to make this definition more clear. 6. Site (baseline report) From all the EC guidance, most participants think ownership is most important for this definition.   Installation is a more important definition compared to site.   In TFS site is more often used, but in fact, they mean installation.   An installation can consist of more sites.   On the other hand, there can be more installations on one site. 7. Permit conditions: relevant hazardous substances Not easy because conditions often change.   Possible solution is to point to Reach or maybe Seveso. Another idea is to identify a list of relevant substances, including their ELV\u2019s and what substances could cause a pollution.   The advice is to use examples but no limited list. 8. Compliance assurance, Operator Any legal person that can restore compliance can be held responsible, broad interpretation.   A solution is the one that owns the permit.   Some mentioned this is not always the case that this is the same one.   Another possibility is to ask (and show) that they have the funds to repair non-compliances. 9. Reactors used in the chemical industry Guidance already collected is good to use. 326/451 6. Other methods for compliance assurance No additional information 327/451 6.   Permitting procedure First session Application phase: Initiative: this can also be started by the competent authority, in case of inspection outcomes (installations for which there is no permit yet) or change in legislation. Pre-application discussion: in Cyprus no pre-application discussion is held (no time available).  ", "Questions from the operator are answered by phone or email.   Pre-application discussions are not mandatory in Europe, but are considered to be useful.   It saves time in the official procedure, it\u2019s a worthwhile time-investment.   You can check a lot of issues such as special planning before official procedure starts. Be aware not to become a free consultant. An option is to judge draft application and draft annexes only once during pre-consultation. In some countries a certified consultant is required to write the application.   Large operators write the application themselves. For smaller operators the competent authority helps. It could be a strategy to check a draft application only once, and send a letter with comments of a limited number of pages.   If more pages are required, the application is rejected (the applicant has to do his homework again). In some countries site visits take place in the pre-application phase, in other countries only during formal procedure. This is not mandatory, but useful. Standard forms: for application are available almost everywhere, however good guidelines are needed and should be available on websites. 328/451 A list of annexes that should accompany the application could be part of the guidance. Submission of application: by mail and hard copy (required by law in some countries), or online. Option of hard copy is still possible, even in cases where an online-application can be done.   Check on completeness by permit writer, or case manager. When application is not complete: interrupt the procedure or stop the procedure. The time to complete the application is up to the competent authority to decide. Croatia: 3 months maximum. For minor changes 15 days or 1 month.   In case of interruption, in some countries the procedure time stops. In other countries not. 2 options: - time starts at submission of application, regardless of completeness. - time starts when the application is formally and technically complete. Notification: Formal my letter and e-mail. Informal by phone or e-mail in some countries. In NL the notification is done by an online system. Publication: Done through website, official gazette, local media and/or sending letters to local inhabitants.   Sometimes small changes are not published.   Hard copy can be viewed at local government offices.   There are issues of confidential information when applications are published on internet. Type of procedure: The decision about what type of procedure will be followed (short or long) is often a legal decision.   In Germany there are three different procedures: - minor changes, only competent authority is consulted - major changes without public consultation - major changes with public consultation The moment this decision is taken depends on the member country.   In Malta and Cyprus it is during the pre- application.   In other countries this can be after submission. 329/451 Second session Decision making Length of a procedure: The Netherlands: public consultation 6 weeks. long procedure 6 months, short procedure 8 weeks. Romania: public consultation 30 days, long procedure 4 months, can be longer if additional information is needed.   Start when application is complete. Cyprus: public consultation 30 days, no legal timeframe for procedures.   Limited availability of staff can be a reason for long procedures. Italy:  150 days to issue the permit. Extra time (60 days) when the application is not complete. Ask for additional information within 30 days after submission of the application. EIA: EIA can be part of the application / environmental permit, but also of the planning permit or building permit. In the latter case, it is not included in the application for the environmental permit. Appropriate assessment: Required if the installation is located inside or near a protected area.   Appropriate assessment is sometimes integrated in the EIA. Advise and consultation: Romania & Cyprus:   Permit writers have other tasks and find it difficult to spend enough time on permit writing. Italy: national committee of experts. The Netherlands: a lot of the advice and consultation is done in the pre-allocation phase. 330/451 General Binding Rules: Not in Romania and Italy; In The Netherlands there are general binding rules, which apply next to the permit. Enforceability check by inspector is common. Fee: In Romania there is a fee for application, for assessment of the application and for the permit. In Italy there is a fee for inspection activities. The level is determined by law, and is related to the impact on the environment (mainly on number and size of emissions). Additional points for the guidance Compliance with BAT:", "most Member States give some time to the operator to comply with BAT (transition period), depending on the kind of adjustments needed and the environmental risks involved. The guidance could pay some attention to this issue. 331/451 7. ECO\u2010Innovations The purpose of the session is to understand the challenges that are faced when taking forward eco\u2010 innovations. Specific issues, difficulties (i.e. BAT/no BREF), setting ELVs, identifying emerging techniques and understanding any legal or practical difficulties. Italy example \u2013 they have had an experience of a waste treatment plant wanting to reuse bottom\u2010ash. The bottom ash would be required to meet end of waste criteria, but legislation specifies that the only legitimate reuse of this material is in cement. But in this specific example the company wanted to recover metal from the bottom ash, before using the remaining material in the production of construction materials or as landfill cover. The operator ultimately wants to classify the recovered material as aggregate or road construction material but there are noItalian standards for this currently. As a consequence of many provincial authorities in Italy having responsibility for the regulation of this industry there is a lot of inconsistency \u2013 some authorities allow this, some don\u2019t. This lack of decision making is a consequence of lack of responsibility at the provincial level without the necessary higher support from regional or national governments.   Similarly, there is no clear path for the operator to get decisions made or to understand what information they actually need to present. This lack of clarity is an issue for both sides. The provincial authority looked for support from outside Italy. The Netherlands has examples of bottom ash recovery, but there are relevant standards, testing standards and analysis. This is still a live issue. Responsibility and experience need to be shared and consistent within and between countries.   A national review is currently underway to review this situation but hasn\u2019t produced any useful outputs.   Appropriate level of empowered governance is needed to make a suitable and consistent decision.   The main issue during permitting of these eco-innovations is timescales for permitting authorities to make decisions and availability of adequate supporting information. In summary, what information is required and sufficient?   Who is empowered and responsible to make any decisions due to the risks?   There is a lack of standards within Europe to ensure a level playing field. Portugal example \u2013 Similar to Italy.   No new technologies generally but operators are required to explore how best to maximise operation \u2013 i.e. water saving/waste minimisation.   As an example, the pulp industry want to utilise biosludge as a fuel source in combustion plant, but don\u2019t want the material to be classified as a waste and as such CO2 incineration.   A basecamp enquiry was made to try and gather experience from elsewhere in Europe. There is a lot of available sludge but no sufficient landfill space to accept it. Moving forward by classifying the material as \u201cfibre\u201d so it can be burned as a fuel in the recovery boiler.   It\u2019s not a waste but a fibre residue.   They have tried to apply the IED in a way that is useful to the operator to allow reuse and improved economy, by integrating the material in another product cycle \u2013 thereby optimising the 332/451 procedures in their operation. Getting to this stage has been difficult due to legislative issues and knowledge gaps. A particular issue has been the requirement to make amendments to the permit to allow this, but the changes are minor in comparison to including waste incineration conditions. The reuse of sludge is not mentioned in the BREF, but there is a vague suggestion in the BAT conclusions \u2013 the BAT conclusions are not clear enough which is causing confusion. Belgium example \u2013 They have a waste treatment plant that makes chemicals from organic waste and plastic, the process is similar to, but not, incineration.   National legislation has caused an issue whereby there is non\u2010 favourable public opinion which is stopping the project.   It\u2019s important that pre\u2010consultation is undertaken for innovative projects to improve public perception. Poland examples \u2013 Pulp and paper industry are utilising cardboard as a raw material, having to educate the public that this isn\u2019t waste and can be more usefully utilised.   The process of developing eco\u2010innovations is also important and we need to get it right.   There is a view of lack of support from European legislation.", "In the case of end of waste for metals, the commission previously provided support and interpretation but they have stopped doing this resulting in inconsistency in interpretation between member states.   Common standards are required as otherwise member states come to different positions. One of the main principles of eco\u2010innovation is to push the operator to reuse and recovery. Scotland example \u2010 Recently had very early enquiries (still at a very early stage and hasn\u2019t yet progressed yet beyond first principles) about waste conversion at breweries, whereby spent grains are converted to higher quality protein. This is intended to be achieved by feeding the grains to flies for maggot production with a conversion rate of about 75%, the resulting maggots have a much high raw protein content than the feedstock and could more effectively be used as raw protein source for animal feed. The maggots would be milled into feed pellets.   While in principle this is an effective eco\u2010innovation, consideration of benefits vs risks as a consequence of conversion has been highlighted as important issue. The maggot production process is very odorous and also intentionally produces very large quantities of flies, we need to be sure that any consequent risks are effectively controlled. Consideration of trade\u2010offs is an important issue when considering any eco\u2010 innovation. The Netherlands example \u2013 Salt treatment and removal example.   Solution is to change the location, but what is the best environmental outcome?   If there are no examples there is a dilemma.   Broad consideration is required as you need to make a decision on the best environmental outcome. Italy example \u2013 red mud landfill from aluminium production. A company from Australia undertook tests to reuse this material and had developed a product that could utilise red mud as a raw material. The proposal was to reuse this material in pellet form to remediate soil and waste water. But the competent authority had no idea about the proposals and didn\u2019t have the knowledge to make decision on whether to allow this project.   A pilot plant was constructed in Italy but as the competent authority was unable to make a decision they lost the opportunity.   The operator lost patience and relocated to the USA where they very quickly gained authorisation.   The root cause of this issue was lack of knowledge and the provincial authority being risk averse and not wanting to make a decision on whether the process was safe to use. Process understanding vs long term management. It\u2019s not lack of information as in this case there was a lot of information, but rather how to interpret the information to make the right decision on what was necessary. 333/451 Flanders example \u2013 eco\u2010innovation can be a matter of public perception.   As an example, they have manure treatment plants to treat excess manure, but locals can halt their development. Nimbyism (not in my backyard) is an issue. Arrangements and solutions  Sufficient knowledge, capacity to consider, risk assessment and weighing different impacts, authority ultimately needs to be empowered to make a decision, responsiveness (what is the CA\u2019s attitude to the proposal?) Latvia example \u2013 the cement industry wants to improve the process and implement cleaner technology, they are achieving this by collaborating with universities.   Innovations with universities is a good approach (Dutch bottom ash is a good example of this). Portugal example \u2013 Operators regularly call in with ideas and opinions.   We are optimising the procedure for a biomass boiler by requiring the installation of a dryer (to dry the fuel) to make the process more efficient.   May need to ask for help from other authorities to achieve a good outcome. Scotland example \u2013 Sector planning, limited roll\u2010out currently but looking to expand to all sectors. Provides an opportunity to try and anticipate eco\u2010innovations within a sector through joint working with associations and operators.   to focus the agenda in a sector for the next few years by exploring early. Other participants at the workshop considered that this is hard to do due to resources. Portugal example \u2013 micro algae CO2 capture at cement plant. This is really easy to allow as it is a passive process with environmental benefits and due to the local climatic conditions works easily. Open discussion \u2013 what policies are there for encouraging the circular economy and using waste streams more?   This is difficult for many authorities as BAT development is handled by separate divisions.   In Scotland, SEPA\u2019s statutory purpose encompasses circular economy but this is not usually a requirement in other authorities.  ", "In The Netherlands green deals bring parties together to speed up sectoral work and develop joint solutions. There is usually a mismatch between regulators and operators and we need to have joint understanding.   There is a lot of uncertainty and lack of technical support.   In many cases there are no relevant standards or guidance. Some issues can only be solved at EU level. 334/451 8. Evaluation and Feedback There was clearly a need to work together, but how? How do you engage feedback and be efficient in the whole chain?   How do you give advice and feedback to other levels and have effective 2\u2010way discussion?   How do you work with permit writers (PW)/inspectors (INSP)? Italy \u2013 they are starting to build a relationship between PW and INSP.   In many cases things are appearing in the permits that can\u2019t be enforced as there is no understanding of the real situation. INSP can make suggestions to PW.   This can resolve the problem but the suggestions are not being taken on\u2010board.   INSP are collecting suggestions but they are not being used. The ultimate decision is up to the people you are working with and the decision can be out of their hands due to lack of staff, additional workload or lack of available guidance.   Feedback is important but it has to be constructive feedback to further the agenda and shared understanding. All INSP authorities give their opinion, the draft permit should be reviewed by the inspector.   Some conditions are too general to enforce.   The draft is also sent to the operator who can make suggestions. Pre\u2010meetings between all parties occur on the application but not the permit. Portugal \u2013 To maintain good communication between PW and INSP, Inspection reports are sent to the permitting agency, common inspections are undertaken as are informal/formal discussions. Co\u2010location of PW and INSP means they all talk.   A shared database is also useful.   Information collation to improve communication is important but there can be resistance to change.   E\u2010tools tools to improve effective communication and access to information. Legislative barriers, if the inspectors find problems it is hard to effect change to the permit as the law states that the operator must make an application to make any changes.   Good communication at the informal level, but this is frustrated by barriers at the formal level.   They are now starting to share documents, but if the operator makes an application then they proceed to enforcement. Poland \u2013 They have an obligation to improve permit faults and there is a legislative requirement to have effective communication between PW and INSP. Spain \u2013 Same authority but split between PW and INSP. There is a requirement for the permit writer to visit the site at least once. Czech Republic \u2013 the application is reviewed by the inspector as part of the app process but the INSP\u2019s views are non\u2010binding. Latvia \u2013 PW and INSP are in the same institution and share information.   They want quality in reporting from their permits but there is a still a lack of collaboration.   INSP like flexibility in the permit to allow the operator room to make changes.   Balance of information is important. Scotland \u2013 currently, permit writer is usually also the inspector.   This gives a good perspective. Though this approach will be changing. How do you get help and request for advice? 335/451 Jan \u2013 improved communication and cooperation is essential but what do you need to achieve this? Situations are different between countries but we need to recognise go practice examples. Open discussion Committee made up of representatives from all levels gives an effective forum to talk about issues and make decisions interpret issues and give an answer. Forum needs to be empowered to make a decision on issues, issue a decree or answer any doubts.   Authorities need to be appropriately empowered to make decisions. Should committees include the operators? The DTRT guidance doc should have examples throughout the guidance and should be embedded, rather than a standalone section.   All examples shouldn\u2019t be mixed, different governmental levels need to be clearly defined. Authorities should be proactive in effective communication between different layers of government. It\u2019s not common to report up the governmental chain in relation to practical measures.   Where provisions aren\u2019t working a channel is effective, only if the uptake is guaranteed.", "336/451 Annex XI Going beyond BAT IMPEL IED IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT 2017 Guidance \u2013 Going Beyond BAT Authors Jamie McGeachy, Pieter Roos, Jaakko Vesivalo Member States Finland, Netherlands, Scotland (UK) Date 22 September 2017 What is going beyond BAT? What is going beyond BAT? What is going beyond BAT? The IED does not include any specific definition of \u201cgoing beyond BAT\u201d. To understand what \u201cgoing beyond BAT\u201d is, it is recommended to have a closer look at the meaning of BAT. The core principle of the IED is to assess whether an installation meets the expected performance levels and achieves an ELV within the BAT-AEL range. This is done by comparing the performance of the techniques employed at an installation with the relevant BAT Conclusions (BATc) and its anticipated performance under normal operating conditions to achieve the BAT-AELs. BAT is about the optimisation of site-specific performance.   It may be the case that an installation has all the most modern technologies and abatement equipment, but if it is not operated or maintained correctly, the performance of this equipment is not optimised, and it may not be BAT.   Similarly an installation could use older technologies, but is operated in such a way that their performance is optimised and the results meet BAT for that installation. The BATc do not define which techniques or technologies should be used by an installation. The practical suitability of particular techniques will vary on a case by case basis and will be site specific \u2013 dependent upon the technical characteristics of the installation, operational limitations, local conditions and any environmental outcomes that are 337/451 necessary to minimise impact and protect the environment as a whole. The BATc will contain BAT - associated emission levels (BAT-AELs). Typically BAT-AELs will be presented as a range.   It should be noted that due to the principle of optimisation where the BATc present a range of emission limits it is not appropriate to simply set the ELV at the top of the BAT-AEL range.   The appropriate ELV from the BAT-AEL range is what protects the environment and can be achieved by the optimised performance of the installation when operating normally. This means that as part of the BAT assessment authorities must assess and ensure that site specific performance is optimised and can achieve the performance levels within the range of the BAT- AELs.   If it is concluded as part of the assessment that site-specific performance is optimised, then BAT for that installation will be reflected by the emission levels associated with this optimised performance, and ELVs set accordingly. Assessing BAT While the BATc do not specify that a particular technology or technique is utilised by an installation, it lists various technologies and techniques that may be applicable.   This is not an exhaustive list and if a technique has not been identified by the BATc this does not mean that it is not BAT. Where a technology or technique has been listed in the BATc, BAT associated emission levels or BAT associated performance levels may also be included.   These will present what is considered to be the normal operating range for BAT techniques or technologies and should be the reference for setting the permit conditions.   These are also a useful reference for determining whether the performance of a particular installation is optimised and should form the basis of any discussions with the operator. It should be noted that the BATc may prohibit the use of certain technologies or techniques, however this is unusual. Environmental regulators can set permit conditions on the basis of techniques that are not described in any of the relevant BATc \u2013 however it must be satisfied that the proposed approach represents BAT. Where an alternative technique is proposed, environmental regulators should utilise Annex III of the IED that contains criteria for determining Best Available Techniques.   These criteria should be considered in assessing whether the proposed alternative technique are based on sufficient justification from the operator and can be considered to be BAT. Different views on Going beyond BAT There are different views on what \u201cgoing beyond BAT\u201d actually means.   The three main competing definitions are detailed below: 338/451 1. Any measure which is not explicitly defined within the BAT Conclusions. This approach involves the strict interpretation of the contents of BATc, meaning that any technique which is not expressly detailed has to be considered to be \u201cgoing beyond BAT\u201d. 2. Any measure which exceeds the performance levels associated with the BATc, i.e. BAT \u2013AELS and BAT-AEPLS.", "BAT, in terms of the BATc is quantified as any measure which can meet the BAT-AELS or BAT-AEPLs.   Therefore if a technique can exceed the anticipated performance levels identified in the BATc then this is going beyond BAT. It is acknowledged however that this approach restricts \u201cgoing beyond BAT\u201d only to measures which are within the scope of the IED and the BATc. 3. Any measure, including wider considerations which are outside the scope of the IED and the BATc.   This approach while also encapsulating the definition in point 2, also allows the environmental regulator the flexibility to consider other measures, including social and economic issues. Regardless of which definition is used, it is considered that where a \u201cgoing beyond BAT\u201d measure is incorporated in permit conditions or assessed as a part of the decision making process in granting or reconsidering a permit that it can subsequently become BAT.   As a consequence \u201cgoing beyond BAT\u201d has an ongoing value in identifying \u201cdevelopments in BAT\u201d particularly where BAT conclusions are to be reconsidered.   As a minimum, it is an essential part of the regulatory cycle to routinely consider measures outside the BAT conclusions and whether they can achieve performance either within (or better than) the BAT-AEL range.   Going beyond BAT is essential for development of IED/BAT; otherwise BAT is a stand still. Legislation Legislation The IED includes four articles related to going beyond BAT: articles 14, 15, 18 and 27. These articles are described below, followed by an explanation and examples gathered through a short questionnaire and sessions as part of the IMPEL project Supporting IED implementation. Article 14 Permit conditions [\u2026] 3. BAT conclusions shall be the reference for setting the permit conditions. 4. Without prejudice to Article 18, the competent authority may set stricter permit conditions than those achievable by the use of the best available techniques as described in the BAT conclusions. Member States may establish rules under which the competent authority may set such stricter conditions. 5. Where the competent authority sets permit conditions on the basis of a best available technique not described in any of the relevant BAT conclusions, it shall ensure that: 339/451 (a) that technique is determined by giving special consideration to the criteria listed in Annex III; and (b) the requirements of Article 15 are complied with. Where the BAT conclusions referred to in the first subparagraph do not contain emission levels associated with the best available techniques, the competent authority shall ensure that the technique referred to in the first subparagraph ensures a level of environmental protection equivalent to the best available techniques described in the BAT conclusions. [\u2026] Article 14 describes how permit condition must be set. It provides flexibility to include stricter conditions in permits. Article 14(3) requires BAT conclusions to be used as the reference for setting permit conditions. This allows less strict, but also stricter conditions. A permit condition that requires two or more techniques to be applied is allowed, even though the BAT conclusions often only require one or a combination of techniques. An example is the use of process integrated measures (like low NOx burners) in combination with end-of-pipe techniques (like catalytic NOx reduction) in combustion plants. As a result the emission levels are at the middle or lower end of the ranges in the BAT-conclusions, making a stricter emission limit value feasible. Article 14(4) allows conditions requiring a better performance than the best available techniques described in the BAT conclusions. This provides flexibility to include very well performing techniques in permit conditions or again a combination of techniques that result in lower emissions than the ranges in the BAT conclusions. Examples can be found in several sectors. One example is waste gas sulphur recovery in existing refinery units that achieve minimum recovery percentages that are higher than in the BAT conclusions. Also for intensive rearing of pigs and poultry combinations of techniques result in lower ammonia and dust emissions than the ranges in the BAT-conclusions. Article 14(5) provides flexibility to allow different or new techniques that perform similar or better than the best available techniques in the BAT conclusions. Many examples show that this paragraph is important for promoting emerging techniques and other innovations: Air scrubbers and bio filters in intensive rearing of pigs and poultry12, water cooling instead of air drying in the fertilizer industry, emission reduction of PAHs in the aluminium anode production (see Example 3 \u2013 Netherlands), etc.", "Article 14(5) emphasizes one of the important pillars of IED to set output based requirement providing freedom for operators to choose techniques they consider best for their situation. Article 15 Emission limit values, equivalent parameters and technical measures [\u2026] 12 For example: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1537511015000653 340/451 3. The competent authority shall set emission limit values that ensure that, under normal operating conditions, emissions do not exceed the emission levels associated with the best available techniques as laid down in the decisions on BAT conclusions referred to in Article 13(5) through either of the following: (a) setting emission limit values that do not exceed the emission levels associated with the best available techniques. Those emission limit values shall be expressed for the same or shorter periods of time and under the same reference conditions as those emission levels associated with the best available techniques; or (b) setting different emission limit values than those referred to under point (a) in terms of values, periods of time and reference conditions. Where point (b) is applied, the competent authority shall, at least annually, assess the results of emission monitoring in order to ensure that emissions under normal operating conditions have not exceeded the emission levels associated with the best available techniques. [\u2026] 5. The competent authority may grant temporary derogations from the requirements of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article and from Article 11(a) and (b) for the testing and use of emerging techniques for a total period of time not exceeding 9 months, provided that after the period specified, either the technique is stopped or the activity achieves at least the emission levels associated with the best available techniques. Article 15(3) requires emission limit values to be within the emission levels associated with the best available techniques in the BAT conclusion. Emission limit values are not necessarily set at the upper level, but can also be at the middle of lower end of the range if that better reflects the best available techniques to be applied. In this way article 15(3) provides legal possibilities for competent authorities to go beyond BAT when setting emission limit values in permit conditions. Article 15(3) is similar to article 14(3), but specifically for emission limit values. Article 15(5) allows nine months exemption of BAT to test emerging techniques. This article is helpful when operators would like to apply a potentially better performing technique, but cannot yet provide proof of its performance, because the technique is not yet or rarely applied at full scale or in a certain sector. An example of the practical application of article 15(5) is in the permit for an installation that tests abatement technology. Article 18 Environmental quality standards Where an environmental quality standard requires stricter conditions than those achievable by the use of the best available techniques, additional measures shall be included in the permit, without prejudice to other measures which may be taken to comply with environmental quality standards. 341/451 Article 18 of the IED on environmental quality standards reflects that the IED uses a combined approach to reduce pollution. On the one hand the IED requires all installations to apply BAT, which are techniques that at (European) sector level are considered technically and economically feasible for all installations in the sector. On the other hand the IED requires industrial activities to be tested against the geographical location and local environmental circumstances, which can be quite different from installation to installation. Article 18 instructs authorities to include stricter conditions than BAT (to go beyond BAT) if necessary for compliance with environmental quality standards on the location of the installation and its surroundings. These additional requirements must be proportional. If the pollution is mainly or also caused by other installations or other sources (like traffic or ships) other measures should be considered first or more measures must be applied. In Europe several cases show that this is implemented in practice and illustrate how this is done (see also text on drivers and mechanisms). Often this is a co-operation between authorities and operators and not just enforcement.", "Examples: - stricter and additional emission limit values for NOx from coal fired power plants (see Example 3 \u2013 Netherlands) - additional abatement for dust and lead in the steel industry (see Example 3 \u2013 Netherlands) - additional emission reduction measures for installation in air quality plan (see Example 4 \u2013 Cologne (Germany)) - stricter water discharge requirements for pulp and paper production in the vicinity of phosphorous sensitive surface waters (see Example 1 - Finland) Article 27 Emerging techniques 1. Member States shall, where appropriate, encourage the development and application of emerging techniques, in particular for those emerging techniques identified in BAT reference documents. [\u2026] Article 27 orders member states to encourage the development and application of emerging techniques. This includes a good application of the articles (14, 15, 18) explained above and good help from authorities to operators wanting to go beyond BAT. It also includes a range of activities outside the IED to promote emerging techniques, like voluntary agreements (See Example 2 \u2013 Scotland (UK))13 and fiscal discounts14. Drivers Drivers What are the reasons to go beyond BAT?   As stated previously the primary reason in the IED for \u201cgoing beyond BAT\u201d is to drive the development of BAT as otherwise BAT will stand still.   However this is not usually the main driver, and it is 13 Another example is the Voluntary Agreement on Energy in The Netherlands: http://www.energieakkoordser.nl/doen/engels.aspx 14 http://english.rvo.nl/subsidies-programmes/mia-environmental-investment-rebate-and-vamil-arbitrary-depreciation- environmental-investments 342/451 usually external factors, outside the scope of the IED which require member states and authorities to require beyond BAT measures are implemented by operators. Member States and authorities have highlighted that the following drivers as being the main factors for going beyond BAT: Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) \u2013 EQS for both emissions to air and to the water environment are the primary driver for going beyond BAT. While EQS are in place at the EU level, in many cases national or local EQS can have stricter limits, for health or environmental protection concerns - meaning that achievement of ELVs within the BAT-AEL range may not be sufficient. The primary EQS for going beyond BAT are in relation to PM2.5 and NOx. River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) \u2013 RBMP requires the protection and improvement of the water environment for the benefit of wildlife, people and the economy \u2013 and specifically requires that all water bodies meet good status. Achieving the goals of the RBMP in many cases supersedes the IED and as a consequence may require that operators go beyond BAT in order to achieve the specific goals of the relevant RBMP. Promoting emerging techniques \u2013 Article 27 of the IED introduced a specific duty on member states to encourage the development and application of emerging techniques, and specifically those identified in BAT reference documents. Depending upon the nature of a member states IED implementing regulations this duty may require environment regulators to proactively require operators to go beyond BAT. National Emissions Ceilings \u2013 The National Emission Ceilings Directive sets national emission reduction commitments for Member States and the EU for five important air pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). These pollutants contribute to poor air quality, leading to significant negative impacts on human health and the environment. Climate and resource-use policy\u2019s \u2013 Some member states have national or regional climate or resource use policies aimed at either emissions reduction, reducing water use, carbon-based energy use, materials use and all forms of waste and pollution beyond compliance standards.   These policies can be highly ambitious. To deliver operators and environmental regulators will need to be clearer, stronger, more innovative and more collaborative \u2013 potentially focusing on techniques which go beyond BAT. Mechanisms Mechanisms 343/451 How does going beyond BAT work in practice? In the end setting conditions that go beyond BAT is also implementing legislation. So the mechanisms for going beyond BAT are very similar to setting conditions on BAT. Sometimes industry is in the lead, sometimes the authorities. Legislation on environmental quality standards and specifically monitoring data showing a possible exceedance of a standard is a reason for operators to send in a permit application, which includes better performing measures than straightforward implementing of BAT conclusions. The same monitoring data provide the justification for competent authorities to set stricter conditions when deciding on a permit application or when reconsidering and updating an existing permit.", "Also for other drivers, like economically driven energy savings or resource efficiency, corporate social responsibility, etc. going beyond BAT follows the normal steps of permit application, drawing up conditions, justification, public partition, decision. Besides the stricter permit conditions themselves conditions related to going beyond BAT are: - additional monitoring requirements - requirements to study feasibility of emerging or other better performing techniques - temporary exemption of BAT (article 15, para 5) - transition periods. Several mechanisms help stricter conditions: - Strict implementation of BAT Conclusions: As stated previously the BATc provide a degree of flexibility in that any approach can be taken to meet the BAT-AELs and BAT-AEPLs.   However some member states have taken an approach of strict implementation of the BAT conclusions, through either drivers in national IED implementing regulations or by setting National or Regional BAT conclusions which must be taken into consideration.   As a minimum this approach drives operators to adopt the BAT standards and where they are identified emerging techniques. - National legislation / General binding rules: National IED implementing Regulations can set rules under which stricter conditions can be set, and as a consequence require operators to go beyond BAT.   These are usually prescribed in either discrete regulations or general binding rules. When better performing measures are needed for more installations in the same sector, member states can draw up general binding rules. In several EU member states rules including stricter conditions are in force, for example for intensive rearing and combustion plants. These rules ease the justification of stricter requirements for individual installations, because the reasons are already included in the general binding rules for the whole sector. It also helps acceptance, because general binding rules streamline and harmonize and make conditions predictable. National / regional BAT conclusions or guidance: Similar to general 344/451 binding rules, but less binding, are guidelines to set stricter conditions if appropriate for certain sectors or for compliance with environmental quality standards.15 - Plans and programmes: Plans and programmes, for example air quality plans, are drawn up to comply with environmental quality standards. In the EU examples exist of plans that include measures for industrial installation (see Example 4 \u2013 Cologne (Germany)). Plans and programmes help to set stricter requirements because of their integral approach of an area: All pollution sources (more than industry) in area are considered and the most (cost) effective measures are chosen. Plans and programmes make decisions more fact based and predictable. - Environmental management systems (EMS): EMS are developed per installation or operator with the aim to improve environmental performance. They can be more general or specific or be integrated in quality assurance system. For all sectors under the IED BAT-conclusions include EMS. - Voluntary agreements: Voluntary agreements can give security and can also promote a level playing field. Both are important conditions for operators for investing in better techniques (See Example 2 \u2013 Scotland (UK))16. - Cost benefit analyses: Cost benefit analyses are a tool to calculate feasibility of measures and choose the best measures against lowest costs. Also additional costs compared to conventional measures can be calculated which might be input to subsidies or fiscal discounts. In another interpretation operators use cost and benefits to choose if an investment outweighs potential image damage and discussion with authorities.17 - Stable and long term policies: Clear regulations and long term policies help improving environmental performance. This is scientifically proven (Porter hypotheses18). Clear regulations and policies give certainty to operators which are a condition for investments. Gaps & Obstacles Gaps & Obstacles It is common for both environmental regulators and operators to highlight potential gaps and obstacles in developing techniques which go beyond BAT.   The most common issues include: Lack of knowledge might hinder innovation \u2013 The operator cannot be expected to innovate on its own. Good help from the competent authority is required to assist with questions of operators to new techniques.   The competent authority should help the operator by: \u2022 help implement successful innovation in ways that create success in terms of sustainable economic growth and 15 Scotland: http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0050/00507617.pdf and https://laqm.defra.gov.uk/documents/LAQM-TG16- April-16-v1.pdf 16 Another example is the Voluntary Agreement on Energy in The Netherlands: http://www.energieakkoordser.nl/doen/engels.aspx 17", "At EU level the Reference document on Economics and Cross-media Effects provides information: http://eippcb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reference/BREF/ecm_bref_0706.pdf 18 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_hypothesis 345/451 improvements to the environment; \u2022 help facilitate engagement with key players and potential partners; \u2022 help facilitate access to Industry specialists and key Industry stakeholders in order to advise and share information and help to signpost to regional, national and European supporting bodies for advice and financial support. Going Beyond BAT can have additional costs \u2013 While this is a legitimate concern, particularly in relation to the IED and the concept of disproportionate cost.   However in the future the environment will be a major business issue, not a \u2018sideline\u2019 issue. Businesses will more often view environmental and social issues as a market driver of business success rather than as a compliance issue involving thoughts about minimum cost and minimum business disruption. For successful businesses, the environment should be viewed as an opportunity, not a problem. This could include for example: \u2022 Consumer demand for environmental credentials. \u2022 Investor requirements for environmental performance. \u2022 Supply-chain requirements for environmental performance. \u2022 Assessment by external ratings bodies (e.g. CDP2, DJSI3). \u2022 Trade association membership standards. \u2022 Expectations of potential employees about environmental performance. \u2022 Social scrutiny (e.g. residents, NGOs) and via social media (e.g. Twitter). Furthermore as the IED specifies that BAT conclusions should be reconsidered on a cyclical 8-10 year timeframe, failure to adequately invest at an early stage may have the effect of increasing future costs as BAT develops over time. Availability of techniques/technology \u2013 There is a misconception that BAT is all about having the right types of technologies, kit and abatement plant at an installation.   This is not the case.   BAT is about the optimisation of site-specific performance.   It may be the case that an installation has all the most modern technologies and abatement equipment, but if it is not operated or maintained correctly, the performance of this equipment is not optimised, and it may not be BAT. Similarly an installation could use older technologies, but is operated in such a way that their performance is optimised and is BAT for that installation. The key to going beyond BAT is innovation, which does not necessarily require additional equipment or technologies. Better design, building, operation, maintenance and decommissioning will lead to better results. However it is acknowledged that if techniques are not available that the IED cannot solve this. Legislative Framework preventing innovation \u2013 Article 27 of the IED specifically requires that member states shall encourage the development and application of emerging techniques and in particular those emerging techniques identified in BAT reference documents.   As a consequence article 27 implies a duty for all member states to promote rather than prevent innovation.   If national IED implementing regulations prevent innovation then the IED may not have been correctly transposed. Interpretation issues can be a legislative obstacle, for example when determining if new processes fall under IED and if so, which environmental requirements apply. Solutions can often be found in better knowledge (see lack of knowledge hinders innovation). A broadly accepted way to prevent legislative obstacles is to integrate and co-ordinate permit procedures and decisions. Finding a balance between clear and flexible legislation can be a challenge, for example in waste legislation, which is closely related to IED. Helpful actions: Stakeholder involvement and 346/451 making sure choices and decision are made well-informed. Example 1 - Finland Going Beyond BAT \u2013 Example 1 - Finland The Regional State Administrative Agency Eastern Finland (ISAVI) has given an environmental permit to Finnpulp Ltd. for operation of a bleached kraft pulp and bio product mill in Kuopio. According to permit condition 2 the permit holder must treat the wastewater of the mill in a way that the emissions to the watercourse are less than following limit values: In order to prevent contamination of the watercourse it has been necessary to set the limit values for the waste water discharge stricter than suggested in the permit application. Additionally it has been necessary to set the limit value for phosphorus below the range set in the BAT/BREF, because phosphorus is limiting nutrient in the watercourse below the discharge point. In order to prevent internal loading, also sulphate has been set an emission limit value. The place of waste water discharge from Finnpulp Ltd is Kelloselk\u00e4 in Kallavesi -lake. The affected area reaches downstream rather far further south. The water body of Kallavesi is according to Water Framework Directive classified in good ecological and chemical condition.", "The most critical parameter for the state of the water body is the biomass from phytoplankton. Limiting nutrient in Kallavesi is phosphorus. Its concentration in water is influenced not only by the phosphorus load but also among others by the concentration of sulphate, if increased sulphate concentration in water limits the normal turnover in spring and autumn, or it inhibits the natural chemical bonding of phosphorus with iron and sedimentation. Increase of the phosphorus concentration and the following eutrophication and increase of basic production could lead to the change of the ecological state of Kallavesi from good into satisfactory. When considering the permit conditions for the waste water and allowed wastewater discharges into the watercourse, Emission Monthly Average Yearly Average CODCr 30 t O2/d 24 t O2/d AOX 450 kg/d 400 kg/d P(tot) 25 kg/d 20 kg/d N(tot) 420 kg/d SS 1 200 kg/d 1 000 kg/d Sulphate 55 t/d 347/451 the permit authority had to assess the relation of the waste water discharge to BREF limit values and the tolerance of receiving water body. In the application the applicant has presented an examination, in which from the applicant presented waste water load would not alter the good ecological state of the main water body Kallavesi. This examination is nevertheless not sufficient when deciding limit values for waste water discharges. In addition it had to be estimated, if the waste water load causes significant damage or risk outside the water body Kallavesi but smaller watercourses inside the affected area. According to 20\u00a7 of the Environmental Protection Act it is also necessary to take the precautionary principle into account when considering the permit conditions and emission limit values. Therefore the limit values of the allowed waste water load are set in the way, that beforehand estimated the limit for significant environmental damage or risk of it would not be exceeded under any thinkable hydrological circumstances and/or emergency conditions in the mill. Example 2 \u2013 Scotland (UK) Going Beyond BAT \u2013 Example 2 \u2013 Scotland (UK) The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) uses Sustainable Growth Agreements19 as a mechanism to drive going beyond BAT. Sustainable Growth Agreements (SGAs) are voluntary formal agreements between SEPA and an organisation (or organisations) that focus on practical action to deliver environmental outcomes and help achieve One Planet Prosperity. Most SGAs are signed with individual businesses, but some will also be with groups of businesses, trade bodies, local authorities, Non-Governmental Organisations and others. Through an SGA, SEPA can help organisations collaborate with experts, innovators and stakeholders on different approaches that could improve environmental performance and also help create commercial and social success. SGAs are an important tool to encourage organisations to embed compliance (a minimum requirement) and help set their own \u2018beyond compliance\u2019 targets which hopefully will also improve profitability; for example by driving reductions in water, energy and materials use and all forms of waste. Under an SGA, SEPA can help organisations collaborate with experts, innovators and stakeholders on different approaches that could improve environmental performance and also create commercial success (e.g. innovative technologies or redesigning processes) and help create social success (e.g. community regeneration support). New opportunities for growth can also be explored, for example through new product lines, synergies with other businesses, or enhanced reputation and improved market position. An organisation may also decide to work more with supply chains (e.g. suppliers, transport, distribution or customers) to achieve better environmental compliance and outcomes. Through the SGA, it is intended these organisations will become leaders, championing the benefits of environmental 19 Sustainable Growth Agreements (SGA) as a mechanism for going beyond compliance. https://www.sepa.org.uk/media/286874/superglass_sustainable_growth-agreement.pdf 348/451 excellence. SEPA\u2019s 1st SGA is with a company called Superglass.   Through the development of Superglass products and processes, Superglass aims to maximise their economic and environmental benefits, by utilising the best possible practices. In doing so, Superglass is striving to move beyond compliance. Superglass is a manufacturer of glass mineral wool products. The manufacturing process uses more than 80% recycled glass and this post-consumer waste is sourced from around the UK. The type of insulation products manufactured at the site provide thermal, acoustic and fire insulation properties which are used in our walls, floors and roofs to retain heat in homes, schools and businesses. Research has shown that over its lifetime, typical glass wool saves over 300 times the energy used in its manufacture and transport. Superglass products therefore have a generic British Research Establishment Green Guide rating of A+.", "As an IED annex 1 activity Superglass has held a Permit for the site since 2005. In 2012, new management committed to investing in the factory and fully engaging with SEPA. Superglass has invested in projects to lower ammonia emissions, introduced a new Preventative Maintenance system, built a new resin batch plant, introduced new fiberising technology, replaced the furnace recuperator, introduced an Environmental Management System and vastly improved housekeeping. SEPA\u2019s Regulatory Strategy One Planet Prosperity describes the 21st century environmental challenges that Scotland and other countries across the world face, including over-use of natural resources and climate change. According to the ecological footprint measure, Scotland needs approximately three planets to sustain its current way of living. There is, however, only one planet and most nations around the world face the dilemma of significantly overusing the planet\u2019s capacity to support human activity. All parts of our communities, businesses and government will have key roles to play to enable Scotland to successfully tackle this 21st century challenge of creating social and economic success within planetary constraints. In terms of environmental regulation, this effectively means that SEPA needs to get all those it regulates to meet their legal obligations and reach compliance; and also help as many regulated entities as possible move beyond compliance. Superglass is entering into a Sustainable Growth Agreement to firmly entrench this compliance performance and to help Superglass go beyond compliance. Superglass\u2019s commitments include: \u2022 To proactively seek innovative solutions to reduce water use and waste production and to maximise the opportunity to reuse, recover or recycle effluents and wastes that are produced; \u2022 To continue to explore opportunities for innovation, trials and the development of new products that will enhance the range of products Superglass manufacture; 349/451 \u2022 To continue to work with supply chains, transport and distribution companies and customers for better environmental outcomes; \u2022 To explore opportunities to reduce energy use within the entire site including the investigation of the reuse of heat produced by the furnace to the ovens and exploration of increasing the use of renewable energy sources; \u2022 Develop local community engagement with an emphasis on building positive community relationships; and \u2022 To work with SEPA to identify new emerging opportunities in order to improve economic, social and environmental outcomes. It should be noted that as a focus of an SGA is beyond compliance only some of these commitments have directly correlation to requirements of the IED.   Commitment areas which are out with the scope of the IED are highlighted in red. Example 3 \u2013 Netherlands Going Beyond BAT \u2013 Example 3 \u2013 Netherlands Competent authorities in The Netherlands included in permits of the metals, energy and chemical industry conditions stricter than the BAT-AELs or at the lower end of the BAT-AEL ranges to fit new or extended industrial installations in areas with a lot of industry near residential areas or nature. Meeting legal requirements (quality standards) was an important driver as well as corporate social responsibility of the operators. High efficiency and low NOx energy production20 For the time being, energy from fossil energy sources will be essential to an affordable and reliable energy supply. There are two new coal-fired power stations in the port of Rotterdam, which provide a significant contribution to the energy supply. The new power stations of Uniper and Engie are capable of co-firing biomass, have an extremely high efficiency of 46 per cent and are prepared for the capture and storage of CO2. The power stations also have modern scrubbing systems for particulate matter and NOx. Reducing particulate matter, heavy metals and dioxins in steel industry21 Tata Steel builded a bag filter installation to complete a major environmental improvement project at its IJmuiden steel plant in the Netherlands. Tata Steel intends the facility to reduce emissions of fine particles, heavy metals and dioxins from the sintering process by at least 75%. This project has involved the construction of two huge, technologically sophisticated installations, each the size of an apartment block. The EUR100 million new facility will contain 45,000 m\u00b2 of bag filters, the equivalent of more than six football pitches. It consists of two parts, one for dedusting the sinter plant and one for capturing and cleaning the gases from the sintering process. The dedusting facility has been operational since autumn 2011 and immediately made a contribution to IJmuiden\u2019s environmental performance, lowering fine particle 20 https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/cargo-industry/energy-industry/fossil-energy 21 https://www.tatasteeleurope.com/en/news/news/2013/2013_IJmuiden_air_filter_corp 350/451 emissions by 7% in that year.", "Preventing emission particulate matter fertilizer production22 Innovative cooling reduces particle emissions during the cooling of fertilizer granules in the installations of OCI Nitrogen in The Netherlands. To expand capacity, a new permit was required. The lower levels imposed by the competent authority presented a serious challenge, because traditional air-cooling systems produce fine particles. The company concerned, OCI Nitrogen, opted for indirect water cooling, but this technology could not be applied directly. Now that is has been installed and several troubles have been solved, the particle emission has been reduced from 174 tonnes a year to zero. Moreover, energy consumption in this cooling section has been reduced by 75% and production has increased by 20%. Reducing PAHs emission of aluminium anode production23 The sustainable production of anodes is part of the policy of Aluchemie. Aluchemie invested in the world's largest fume treatment plant of its kind in the world, which was opened in 2009. The plant cleans emissions resulting from the production process. This results in a 98% reduction of PAH's emission (poly aromatic carbohydrates). Example 4 \u2013 Cologne (Germany) Going Beyond BAT \u2013 Example 4 \u2013 Cologne (Germany) To meet the air quality standards in the Cologne area in Germany the competent authorities formulated an air quality plan24 that includes measures aimed at the industry (besides other sources like traffic). The measures use existing legislation that provides authorities legal options to require additional emission reduction, but the authority also puts efforts in co-operation with the industries concerned to implement the measures voluntarily. In the context of the proportionality assessment of the interests concerned, the autority must provide proof that the concrete plant makes a relevant contribution to the harmful pollutant emissions. The pollution analysis shows a share of the industry of 9% at the NOx overload location. The aim of the air pollution control plan is to reduce emissions through industrial measures 2 \u03bcg/m3. The measures focus on two large industrial sources (Evonik Carbon Black GmbH, Werk Kalscheuren and Basell Polyolefine GmbH). These installations are state of the art, but the air quality situation requires additional emission reduction going beyond BAT. Concrete technical measures are included in the plan. 22 http://www.ocinitrogen.com/EN/Pages/Press%20releases/Press-Release---Cool-wins-Responsible-Care-prize.aspx 23 http://www.aluchemie.nl/en/mens-en-milieu/milieu-en-maatschappij.html 24 http://www.bezreg- koeln.nrw.de/brk_internet/leistungen/abteilung05/53/luftreinhalteplaene/luftreinhalteplan_huerth.pdf 351/451 Annex XII How to deal with Inspections of Wastewater treatment plants Wastewater treatment plants: how to deal with inspections 352/451 Introduction to IMPEL The European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law (IMPEL) is an international non-profit association of the environmental authorities of the EU Member States, acceding and candidate countries of the European Union and EEA countries. The association is registered in Belgium and its legal seat is in Brussels, Belgium. IMPEL was set up in 1992 as an informal Network of European regulators and authorities concerned with the implementation and enforcement of environmental law. The Network\u2019s objective is to create the necessary impetus in the European Community to make progress on ensuring a more effective application of environmental legislation. The core of the IMPEL activities concerns awareness raising, capacity building and exchange of information and experiences on implementation, enforcement and international enforcement collaboration as well as promoting and supporting the practicability and enforceability of European environmental legislation. During the previous years IMPEL has developed into a considerable, widely known organisation, being mentioned in a number of EU legislative and policy documents, e.g. the 7th Environment Action Programme and the Recommendation on Minimum Criteria for Environmental Inspections. The expertise and experience of the participants within IMPEL make the network uniquely qualified to work on both technical and regulatory aspects of EU environmental legislation. Information on the IMPEL Network is also available through its website at:www.impel.eu 353/451 Title of the report: Wastewater treatment plants: how to deal with inspections Number report: 2017/xxx Authors (IED Implementation Project team \u2013 Subgroup \u201cWastewater\u201d): \u2022 Romano Ruggeri (Italy) \u2022 Roberto Borghesi (Italy) \u2022 Ma\u0142gorzata Budzy\u0144ska (Poland) \u2022 Manuel Salgado (Spain) \u2022 Rikke Cochran (Denmark) Total number of pages: 83 Report: 27 Annexes: 55 Executive Summary The present Report is the result of the work of the Subgroup \u201cWastewater\u201d, that is part of the \u201cIED Implementation\u201d project team.

MAIN RESULTS OF THE SURVEY 376 ANNEX 1: CHECKLIST ON WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT INSPECTION 379 ANNEX 2: ANSWERS TO THE SURVEY 409 355/451 1. Definitions25 Urban waste water: Domestic waste water or the mixture of domestic waste water with industrial waste water and/or run-off rain water Domestic waste water: waste water from residential settlements and services which originates predominantly from the human metabolism and from household activities Industrial waste water: Any waste water which is discharged from premises used for carrying on any trade or industry, other than domestic waste water and run-off rain water Primary treatment: treatment of urban waste water by a physical and/or chemical process involving settlement of suspended solids, or other processes in which the BOD5 of the incoming waste water is reduced by at least 20 % before discharge and the total suspended solids of the incoming waste water are reduced by at least 50 % Secondary treatment: treatment of urban waste water by a process generally involving biological treatment with a secondary settlement or other process in which the requirements established in Table 1 of Annex I of Council Directive 91/271 are respected Appropriate treatment: Treatment of urban waste water by any process and/or disposal system which after discharge allows the receiving waters to meet the relevant quality objectives and the relevant provisions of Council Directive 91/271 and other Community Directives 2. Regulatory framework 2.1. Directive 2000/60/EC  - Water framework Directive In 2000, the European Union took a groundbreaking step when it adopted the Water Framework Directive (WFD). It introduces a new legislative approach to managing and protecting water, based not on national or political boundaries but on natural geographical and hydrological formations: river basins. It also requires coordination of different EU policies, and sets out a precise timetable for action, with 2015 as the target date for getting all European waters into good condition. Waters must achieve good ecological and chemical status, to protect human health, water supply, natural ecosystems and biodiversity. The definition of ecological status looks at the abundance of aquatic flora and fish fauna, the availability of nutrients, and aspects like salinity, temperature and pollution by chemical pollutants. Morphological features, such as quantity, water flow, water depths and structures of the river beds, are also taken into account. The WFD classification scheme for surface water ecological status includes five categories: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. \u2018High status\u2019 means no or very low human pressure. \u2018Good status\u2019 means a \u2018slight\u2019 deviation from this condition, \u2018moderate status\u2019 means \u2018moderate\u2019 deviation, and so on. 25 From Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste-water treatment 356/451 2.2. Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste-water treatment The Council Directive 91/271/EEC concerning urban waste-water treatment was adopted on 21 May 1991. Its objective is to protect the environment from the adverse effects of urban waste water discharges and discharges from certain industrial sectors (see Annex III of the Directive) and concerns the collection, treatment and discharge of: \u2022 Domestic waste water \u2022 Mixture of waste water \u2022 Waste water from certain industrial sectors (see Annex III of the Directive)", "The areas into which urban waste water entering collecting systems shall be discharged are divided into: (a) sensitive areas; and (b) less sensitive areas. This is illustrated in the figure below: Figure 1: Discharging scheme Four main principles are laid down in the Directive: \u2022 Planning: - The Collection and treatment of waste water in all agglomerations of >2000 population equivalents (p.e.); 357/451 - Secondary treatment of all discharges from agglomerations of > 2000 p.e., and more advanced treatment for agglomerations >10 000 population equivalents in designated sensitive areas and their catchments; - A requirement for pre-authorisation of all discharges of urban wastewater, of discharges from the food-processing industry and of industrial discharges into urban wastewater collection systems; \u2022 Regulation \u2022 Monitoring by Competent authorities or appropriate bodies: - Monitoring of the performance of treatment plants and receiving waters; - Controls of sewage sludge disposal and re-use, and treated waste water re-use whenever it is appropriate. - Discharges from urban waste water treatment plants to verify compliance with the requirements of Annex I.B. \u2022 Information and reporting: - Information collected by competent authorities or appropriate bodies in complying with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be retained in the Member State and made available to the Commission within six months of receipt of a request. Specifically the Directive requires: \u2022 The Collection and treatment of waste water in all agglomerations of >2000 population equivalents (p.e.); \u2022 Secondary treatment of all discharges from agglomerations of > 2000 p.e., and more advanced treatment for agglomerations >10 000 population equivalents in designated sensitive areas and their catchments; \u2022 A requirement for pre-authorisation of all discharges of urban wastewater, of discharges from the food- processing industry and of industrial discharges into urban wastewater collection systems; \u2022 Monitoring of the performance of treatment plants and receiving waters; \u2022 Controls of sewage sludge disposal and re-use, and treated waste water re-use whenever it is appropriate. The Directive states that the discharge of industrial waste water into collecting systems and urban waste water treatment plants is subject to prior regulations and/or specific authorizations by the competent authority or appropriate body. Industrial waste water entering collecting systems and urban waste water treatment plants shall be subject to such pre-treatment as is required in order to : \u2022 protect the health of staff working in collecting systems and treatment plants, \u2022 ensure that collecting systems, waste water treatment plants and associated equipment are not damaged, \u2022 ensure that the operation of the waste water treatment plant and the treatment of sludge are not impeded, \u2022 ensure that discharges from the treatment plants do not adversely affect the environment, or ensure that receiving waters comply with other Community Directives, \u2022 ensure that sludge can be disposed of safety in an environmentally acceptable manner. 358/451 2.3. Directive 2010/75/EU - Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) To control industrial emissions, the EU has developed a general framework based on integrated permitting. This means the permits must take account of a plant\u2019s complete environmental performance to avoid pollution being shifted from one medium - such as air, water and land - to another. Priority should be given to preventing pollution by intervening at source and ensuring prudent use and management of natural resources. Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and the Council on industrial emissions (the Industrial Emissions Directive or IED) is the main EU instrument regulating pollutant emissions from industrial installations. Best available techniques (BAT) conclusions are the reference for setting permit conditions for installations covered by Chapter II of Directive 2010/75/EU. The competent authorities should set emission limit values which ensure that, under normal operating conditions, emissions do not exceed the emission levels associated with the best available techniques as laid down in the BAT conclusions. The most specifically focused in waste water treatment are the Conclusions for common waste water and waste gas treatment/management systems in the chemical sector (WWT BAT - Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/902 of 30 May 2016). Although other BAT conclusions and reference documents deal with waste  water treatment. Independently operated treatment of waste water not covered by Directive 91/271/EEC and discharged by an installation covered by Chapter II of the Directive is an activity subjected to the IED permit.", "With regard to indirect releases of polluting substances into water, the effect of a water treatment plant may be taken into account when determining the emission limit values of the installation concerned, provided that an equivalent level of protection of the environment as a whole is guaranteed and provided this does not lead to higher levels of pollution in the environment. 2.4. Regulation (EC) No 166/2006: the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 established the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR), in the form of a publicly accessible electronic database. This database meets the requirements of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN- ECE) Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers, signed by the EU in May 2003. This register is available to the public free of charge on the internet. The information it contains can be searched using various criteria (type of pollutant, geographical location, affected environment, source facility, etc.). The register contains information on releases of pollutants to air, water and land, as well as off-site transfers of pollutants present in waste-water and waste. The register covers 91 pollutants listed in Annex II, including greenhouse gases, other gases, heavy metals, pesticides, chlorinated organic substances and other inorganic substances; release data to water for each pollutant exceeding threshold value (according to Annex II of the Regulation) have to be produced by the operator. Releases are reported when the level of emissions exceeds a certain threshold and originates from one of the 65 activities listed in Annex I. The majority of these activities are also regulated under the Directive on 359/451 industrial emissions and comprises, in particular, the establishments covered by the following sectors: energy production, mineral industry, chemical industry, waste and wastewater management, and paper and wood production and processing. Where available, the register also provides some information on pollution from diffuse sources. The regulation is a key instrument in delivering the requirements of the Aarhus convention as it provides the public with the opportunity to be involved in further developing the register and preparing amendments. 2.5. Recommendation 2001/331/EC minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States (RMCEI) The RMCEI contains non-binding criteria for the planning, carrying out, following up and reporting on environmental inspections. Its objective is to strengthen compliance with EU environment law and to contribute to its more consistent implementation and enforcement in all Member States. The RMCEI covers all industrial installations, companies and facilities that need authorisation, permit or licensing requirements under EU law. Such installations are also called \u201ccontrolled installations\u201d in the RMCEI. This Recommendation suggests that all environmental inspection tasks should be carried out according to a minimum criteria applied in the organising, carrying out, following up and publishing the results of such tasks, in order to strengthen the compliance with environmental law. Besides providing general obligations for MS, such as aiming for high environmental protection and cross- border cooperation, the RMCEI deals with four main areas: \u2022 Establishing plans for environmental inspections of installations \u2022 Performing inspection \u2022 Reporting on inspection \u2022 Investigating serious accidents, incidents and occurrences of non-compliance. 360/451 3. Linked IMPEL projects 3.1. Integrated water approach (2017) The implementation of EU legislation on water and land has been identified as one of the top challenges in recent IMPEL research. The objective of this project is to identify, both from the regulatory and technological point of view, how the water resource is managed today in the industry sector subjected to the Integrated Environmental Permitting (IEP) regulation. The main aim of this project is to compare and share, among the IMPEL members, the implementation of EU legislation relating to water resources management and protection in industrial installations and activities. New approaches for reducing fresh water consumption and over-abstraction of water are to be identified, enhancing water reuse through process analysis, water balance and utilities optimization. This project is also focused on the implementation of innovative technologies for industrial water treatment able to provide energy saving, sludge production minimization and re-use of treated waste waters, allowing to respect the required discharge limits. 3.2. Linking the Water Framework and IPPC/IE Directives (2010-2013) The IED Directive 2010/75/EU and Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC are two of the most wide-reaching items of EU environmental law. They have presented many challenges to the Member States. Installations regulated under IPPC may impact on the water environment, such as through direct or indirect discharges of pollutants, water abstraction, etc.", "IPPC requires installations to operate in conditions of compliance with Best Available Techniques (BAT). They are also required to respect environmental quality standards established in EU law, including those derived under EU water law. However, the relationship between the two sets of obligations is often far from simple. Therefore a phased IMPEL project was started in 2010 to investigate the relationship between both directives. The analysis focused on pressures from point source pollution due to organic (e.g. untreated/partially treated waste water from agglomeration and industry), nutrient and chemical substance emissions. 361/451 4. Monitoring and sampling of wastewater: JRC Reference Report on Monitoring of Emissions to Air and Water from IED installations (Draft 2017) 4.1. Monitoring regimes The chapter \u201cMonitoring of emissions to water \u201cof the BREF \u201cReference Report on Monitoring of Emissions to Air and Water from IED installations\u201d includes information on: \u2022 water pollutants \u2022 continuous/periodic measurements \u2022 surrogate parameters \u2022 toxicity tests and whole effluent assessment \u2022 costs. This BREF gives some guidance on measurement and sampling, distinguishing between continuous and periodic measurements, between continuous and periodic sampling, and between composite and spot samples. In the case of continuous (on-line) measurements, no discrete samples are taken. Two types of continuous monitoring techniques can be considered: 1. Fixed in-situ (or in-line) continuous reading instruments. Here the measuring cell is placed in the duct, pipe or stream itself. These instruments do not need to withdraw any sample to analyse it and are usually based on optical properties. Regular maintenance and calibration of these instruments is essential. 2. Fixed on-line (or extractive) continuous reading instruments. This type of instrumentation continuously extracts samples of the emission along a sampling line, transport them to an on-line measurement station, where the samples are analysed continuously. This type of equipment often requires certain pre-treatment of the sample. In the case of periodic measurements, sampling may be carried out continuously or periodically: \u2022 For continuous sampling, the samples are taken continuously with a fixed or variable flow rate. If the sampling flow rate is adjusted continuously to the waste water flow (flow-proportional), the samples are representative of the bulk water quality. This requires either continuous on-line measurement of the flow rate or a sufficient number of discrete samples for the relevant time period to allow the determination of changes in the waste water composition.   This method is most suitable for taking representative samples of waste water discharges when the flow rate and concentration of the parameter of interest vary significantly. However, this method can involve higher costs, in particular, depending on the number of samples to be analysed; therefore, it is only applied in extraordinary cases. 362/451 \u2022 For periodic sampling, the samples are taken at different intervals, typically depending on time or waste water volume flow rate. One example is flow-proportional sampling, in which a predefined amount of sample is taken for each predefined volume of waste water discharged. Continuous (on-line) measurement Sampling type Sample type Continuous Direct measurement in the effluent flow without extraction No discrete samples Time-proportional extraction Flow-proportional extraction Periodic measurement (analysis of each separate sample) Sampling type Sample type Continuous Time-proportional extraction Discrete samples for short time intervals or composite samples for longer time intervals (e.g. 24 hours) Flow-proportional extraction Periodic Time-proportional extraction Flow-proportional extraction Instantaneous extraction Spot samples The following main sample types for periodic measurements can be distinguished: \u2022 Composite samples are, by far, the most commonly used samples. They are obtained by mixing appropriate proportions of periodically (or continuously) taken samples. Composite samples provide average compositional data. Consequently, before combining samples, it should be verified that such data are desired and that the parameter(s) of interest do(es) not vary significantly during the sampling period. It is assumed that this is generally the case for industrial waste water. \u2022 Spot samples are discrete samples taken at random time intervals. They are generally not related to the waste water volume discharged, but typically used when treating batches of waste water. The application depends on the parameter, its variations, and the waste water matrix in the industrial sector. Several water parameters can be measured continuously as well as periodically. A number of parameters, such as pH, temperature and turbidity, are typically measured continuously, because the results are used for process control and are important to run the waste water treatment plant properly.", "Examples of water parameters that can be continuously measured include the following: \u2022 Water flow; \u2022 pH, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity by direct electrochemical measurements; \u2022 nitrate and ammonia by specific ion electrodes; \u2022 metals by anodic stripping voltammetry; \u2022 ammonia, phosphate, total phosphorus (TP), and iron by spectrophotometry; \u2022 TOC by combustion and IR spectrometry. 363/451 Periodic measurements are defined as the determination of a measurand at specified time intervals. In general, these measurements are based on periodic sampling at fixed intervals, which can be time-, volume- or flow- dependent, followed by an analysis of the parameters under investigation in the laboratory (on-site, off-site). A measurement plan has to be defined, to ensure that emission measurements are adequate for the given measurement objective. The location of the sampling point(s) should ensure that the sample is representative of the effluent discharge. It is recommended to accurately describe and mark the sampling point on the process flowsheet, if possible supplemented with photographs to facilitate identification of the exact location. Also the sampling point should be constructed to fit sampling equipment and with room for personnel to service the equipment. Monitoring in BAT conclusions is usually based on flow-proportional composite samples. However, time proportional composite samples may lead to equally representative results provided that the variations in the concentrations or flows are small. Taking composite samples over a period of 24 hours is usually automatic; instruments automatically withdraw a portion of sample at the appropriate volume discharged or time. It is advisable that the total sample volume is as large as is reasonably practicable to accommodate. In addition, it is necessary to consider the stability of the target parameter over the total sample collection time, as samples may deteriorate while being kept in the automated sampling device. In order to preserve the composite sample, it is often cooled and chemicals might be added. 4.2. Sampling equipment The choice of sample container is of major importance to preserve the integrity of the samples (e.g. to prevent sample contamination or losses due to adsorption or volatilisation). For the sampling of waste water, plastic containers are generally recommended for most parameters. Glass containers are generally used for the measurement of oil, grease, hydrocarbons, detergents, and pesticides [ 152, ISO 1992 ]. EN ISO 5667-3:2012 includes detailed provisions on the types of containers to be used, depending on the parameter. This standard is complementary to other, more specific measurement standards which provide more detailed information on the required type of container and its pretreatment. Typical simple devices used for manual sampling include buckets, ladles, or wide-mouthed bottles that may be mounted on a handle of a suitable length. Another possibility is to use Ruttner or Kemmerer samplers which consist of a tube with a hinged lid at each of its ends. Automated sampling to obtain flow- or time-proportional samples can be carried out with several different devices which may be using a chain pump (paternoster pump), a peristaltic pump or compressed air and/or vacuum. EN ISO 5667-3:2012 provides general information on the preservation and handling of water samples, including maximum storage times. To preserve pollutant concentrations that may change during sample storage, the following measures may be necessary, depending on the waste water composition and the pollutant concerned: \u2022 storage of the sample in the dark; 364/451 \u2022 cooling of the sample; \u2022 filtration of the sample; \u2022 stabilisation of the sample with acids, alkalis, or other chemicals; \u2022 re-dissolution of precipitates. 5. Waste water management: Best Available techniques in different industrial sectors Waste water management, collection and treatment, as well as water saving measures, are part of the BAT Conclusions issued for different industrial sectors. The following BAT Conclusions covering waste water treatment have been issued so far: \u2022 Decision (EU) 2016/902 (CWW: Common Waste Water and Waste Gas Treatment/ Management Systems in the Chemical Sector) \u2022 Decision 2014/687/EU (PP: Pulp and paper) \u2022 Decision 2014/738/EU (REF: Refining of Mineral Oil and Gas) \u2022 Decision 2012/135/EU (IS: Iron and Steel Production) \u2022 Decision (EU) 2017/302 (IRPP: Intensive Rearing of Poultry & Pigs) \u2022 Decision 2013/163/EU (CLM: Production of Cement, Lime and Magnesium Oxide) \u2022 Decision 2013/732/EU (CAK: Production of Chlor-alkali) \u2022 Decision 2013/84/EU (TAN: Tanning of Hides and Skins) \u2022 Decision (EU) 2015/2119 (WBP: Wood-based Panels Production) \u2022 Decision (EU) 2016/1032 (NFM: Non-ferrous Metals Industries) \u2022 Decision 2012/134/EU (GLS: Manufacture of Glass) \u2022 Decision (EU) 2017/1442 (LCP: Large Combustion Plant)", "The BREF \u201cCommon Waste Water and Waste Gas Treatment/ Management Systems in the Chemical Sector\u201d is particularly focused in the treatment of wastewater; a short description of this BREF and a list of the main requests of the above listed BAT Conclusions for a proper management of waste water is given below. 5.1. BREF Common Waste Water and Waste Gas Treatment/ Management Systems in the Chemical Sector This BREF for Common Waste Water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector concerns the activities specified in Sections 4 and 6.11 of Annex I to Directive 2010/75/EU, namely: \u2022 Section 4: Chemical industry; \u2022 Section 6.11: Independently operated treatment of waste water not covered by Council Directive 91/271/EEC and discharged by an installation undertaking activities covered under Section 4 of Annex I to Directive 2010/75/EU. 365/451 This document also covers the combined treatment of waste water from different origins if the main pollutant load originates from the activities covered under Section 4 of Annex I to Directive 2010/75/EU. Chapter 2 of the BREF provides data and information concerning the environmental performance of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) at chemical sites. Chapter 3 describes in more detail the techniques to prevent or, where this is not practicable, to reduce the environmental impact of operating installations in this sector that were considered in determining the BAT. This information includes, where relevant, the environmental performance levels (e.g. emission and consumption levels) which can be achieved by using the techniques, the associated monitoring and the costs and the cross-media issues associated with the techniques. Chapter 4 presents the BAT conclusions as defined in Article 3(12) of the Directive. Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/902 of 30 May 2016 established best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste water and waste gas treatment/management systems in the chemical sector. In particular, these BAT conclusions cover the following issues referred to water treatment: \u2022 environmental management systems; \u2022 water saving; \u2022 waste water management, collection and treatment; \u2022 waste management; \u2022 treatment of waste water sludge. The techniques listed and described in these BAT conclusions, althought  generally applicable, are neither prescriptive nor exhaustive. Other techniques may be used that ensure at least an equivalent level of environmental protection. 5.2. BAT in wastewater management: an insight in the BREFs Some common key BATs can be found in the issued BAT Conclusions; these are here listed as they are generally present in the waste water management of all the industrial sectors: Environmental management systems In order to improve the overall environmental performance, BAT is to implement and adhere to an environmental management system (EMS). Establish and maintain an inventory of waste water streams, as part of the environmental management system, that incorporates information about the characteristics of the waste water. Sampling and Monitoring \u2022 Monitoring of key process parameters (including continuous monitoring of waste water flow, pH and temperature) at key locations (e.g. influent to pretreatment and influent to final treatment). \u2022 BAT is to use ISO 5667 for water sampling and to monitor the emissions to water at the point where the emission leaves the installation. 366/451 \u2022 Monitor emissions to water in accordance with EN standards with at least a fixed the minimum frequency (varying for the different industrial sectors). Emission levels \u2022 Emission levels associated with the best available techniques (BAT-AELs) for emissions to water usually refer to values of concentrations (mass of emitted substances per volume of water), expressed in \u00b5g/l or mg/l. Unless otherwise stated, the BAT-AELs refer to flow-weighted yearly averages of 24-hour flow-proportional composite samples, taken with the minimum frequency set for the relevant parameter and under normal operating conditions. Time-proportional sampling can be used provided that sufficient flow stability is demonstrated. \u2022 In some cases, yearly average is an average of all daily averages taken within a year, weighted according to the daily production, and expressed as mass of emitted substances per unit of mass of products/materials generated or processed (pulp and paper industry).", "The BAT-associated emission levels (BAT-AELs), set in the CWW BATc, apply to direct emissions to a receiving water body from: - (i) the activities specified in Section 4 of Annex I to Directive 2010/75/EU; - (ii) independently operated waste water treatment plants specified in Section 6.11 of Annex I to Directive 2010/75/EU provided that the main pollutant load originates from activities specified in Section 4 of Annex I to Directive 2010/75/EU; - (iii) the combined treatment of waste water from different origins provided that the main pollutant load originates from activities specified in Section 4 of Annex I to Directive 2010/75/EU. Reducing emissions to water \u2022 Reduce the volume and/or pollutant load of waste water streams, to enhance the reuse of waste water within the production process. \u2022 Maximise internal recycling. \u2022 Remove insoluble and soluble polluting substances: - Removal of insoluble substances by recovering oil (API Separators (APIs), Corrugated Plate Interceptors etc.); removal of insoluble substances by recovering suspended solids and dispersed oil (Sand Filtration, dissolved Gas Flotation (DGF) etc.) - Removal of soluble substances including biological treatment and clarification: Biological treatment techniques may include Fixed bed systems or Suspended bed systems. \u2022 In order to prevent the contamination of uncontaminated water and to reduce emissions to water, BAT is to segregate uncontaminated waste water streams from waste water streams that require treatment (Water and drainage system for segregation of contaminated and uncontaminated water streams). \u2022 Avoid sending non-contaminated water to general waste water treatment. Reducing the volume of waste water sludge In order to reduce the volume of waste water sludge requiring further treatment or disposal, and to reduce its potential environmental impact, BAT is to use one or a combination of the techniques given below. \u2022 Conditioning. Chemical conditioning (i.e. adding coagulants and/or flocculants) or thermal conditioning 367/451 \u2022 Thickening/dewatering. Thickening can be carried out by sedimentation, centrifugation, flotation, gravity belts, or rotary drums. Dewatering can be carried out by belt filter presses or plate filter presses. \u2022 Stabilisation. Sludge stabilisation includes chemical treatment, thermal treatment, aerobic digestion, or anaerobic digestion. \u2022 Drying. Sludge is dried by direct or indirect contact with a heat source. Treatment \u2022 BAT is to use an integrated waste water management and treatment strategy that includes an appropriate combination of the techniques - Process-integrated techniques: Techniques to prevent or reduce the generation of water pollutants. - Recovery of pollutants at source: Techniques to recover pollutants prior to their discharge to the waste water collection system. - Waste water pretreatment: Techniques to abate pollutants before the final waste water treatment. Pretreatment can be carried out at the source or in combined streams. - Final waste water treatment by, for example, preliminary and primary treatment, biological treatment, nitrogen removal, phosphorus removal and/or final solids removal techniques before discharge to a receiving water body. \u2022 BAT is to pretreat waste water that contains pollutants that cannot be dealt with adequately during final waste water treatment by using appropriate techniques. In general, pretreatment is carried out as close as possible to the source in order to avoid dilution, in particular for metals. Sometimes, waste water streams with appropriate characteristics can be segregated and collected in order to undergo a dedicated combined pretreatment. Use an adequate pretreatment for each final flow. \u2022 When further removal of organic substances, nitrogen or phosphorus is needed, BAT is to use tertiary treatment (pulp and paper industry). Prevent or reduce odour emissions In order to prevent or to reduce odour emissions from waste water collection and treatment and from sludge treatment, BAT is to use one or a combination of the techniques given below. (a) Minimise residence time of waste water and sludge in collection and storage systems, in particular under anaerobic conditions. (b) Chemical treatment. Use chemicals to destroy or to reduce the formation of odorous compounds (e.g. oxidation or precipitation of hydrogen sulphide). (c) Optimise aerobic treatment. This can include:  (i) controlling the oxygen content;  (ii) frequent maintenance of the aeration system; (iii)  use of pure oxygen;  (iv) removal of scum in tanks. (d) Enclosure. Cover or enclose facilities for collecting and treating waste water and sludge to collect the odorous waste gas for further treatment. (e) End-of-pipe treatment. This can include: (i) biological treatment;  (ii)  thermal oxidation.   Biological treatment is only applicable to compounds that are easily soluble in water and readily bioeliminable. 368/451 5.3.", "Waste water technologies used in industrial process: general analysis The main unit processes used at the final WWTPs are: \u2022 physical-chemical and biological treatment or only biological treatment: - Complete mix activated sludge (CMAS) flat tank - CMAS tower biology - membrane bioreactor - activated sludge without further specification; - fixed-bed reactor - expanded-bed process - biological treatment without further specification \u2022 physical-chemical treatment only: - neutralisation - precipitation/coagulation/flocculation - crystallisation - skimming - oil-water separation - oxidation with H2O2 - stripping - activated carbon filtration. With respect to the final solids (TSS) removal step, the following techniques are applied at the WWTPs: \u2022 sedimentation \u2022 ultrafiltration, including membrane bioreactor \u2022 sand filtration \u2022 filtration without further specification \u2022 flotation \u2022 reverse osmosis Depending on the organic load of the influent, a variety of pretreatment processes are used, including: \u2022 additional activated sludge processes \u2022 trickling filters \u2022 fixed-bed reactors \u2022 anaerobic pretreatment \u2022 oxidation \u2022 oil-water separation 369/451 \u2022 stripping. Several of the WWTPs apply nitrogen and/or phosphorous removal: \u2022 biological nitrification/denitrification \u2022 chemical phosphorous precipitation. Unit for waste water sludge reduction: Conditioning, Thickening/dewatering, Stabilisation, Drying. 6. Inspections in wastewater treatment plants: indications The aim of the inspection is to check compliance of the operator with the operating/environmental conditions set in the issued permit. 6.1. Before the inspection: desktop study The inspection team should be fully prepared for the inspection. It should therefore gather all the relevant information and data that is available. The collection and evaluation of existing information about the installation is critical for the success of the inspection. Examples of information to be collected are listed below: \u2022 Reports of previous inspections of the site \u2022 Application for the permit \u2022 Environmental permit/s and Self monitoring plan: provisions for water treatment and discharge \u2022 Monitoring data at the discharging point included in the Environmental reports submitted by operators (build the trend) \u2022 List of analytical methods used in the installation \u2022 Layout of the water treatment plant: waste water streams and sections of the plant (partial discharging point to avoid mixing) \u2022 BREF for Common Waste Water and Waste Gas Treatment/ Management Systems in the Chemical Sector and sectorial BREF \u2022 List of EMS technical procedures related to management of the treatment. The issues that should be taken into account while examining self-monitoring results (Self monitoring register - last lab analysis) are as follows: \u2022 Checking if the self-monitoring is done in line with the permit, i.e. checking the frequency, parameters measured, equipment used. \u2022 Checking if the reference methods for taking samples and making measurements and analysis were used. \u2022 Checking whether a certified (accredited) laboratory did collection of samples and analysis. \u2022 Check data about efficiency of the treatment (trend). \u2022 Checking if emission limit values are breached. 370/451 On the basis of the evaluation of the collected information the following has to be prepared: \u2022 Relevant questions which will be used for the operator\u2019s interview \u2022 A check list to facilitate the inspection \u2022 An outline of the \u201ccritical\u201d ELV (i.e. those parameters which significantly contribute to the pollution load coming out of the installation) \u2022 The list of BATs (according to the issued permit) which the operator should have installed and operated \u2022 The list of documentation to be provided by the operator (e.g. self-monitoring records, annual reports submitted to the authorities) \u2022 Agenda of the inspection (see next subsection) \u2022 Analytical devices for an on-site sampling of the discharged water. The preliminary analysis of the collected documentation must enable a better understanding of the cycle of the water treatment plant and its past and current critical points. Advantages of using a checklist (see Annex to have an example) are: \u2022 to ensure all necessary aspects will be inspected; \u2022 a better organisation of the interview and site visit; \u2022 time rationalisation; \u2022 fast assessment of the non-compliance situations. 6.2. During the inspection The aim of the inspection will be to check compliance of the operator with the operating/environmental conditions set in the issued permit. The checklist and the operating/environmental conditions set in the issued permit will be the \u201eguidance\u201d throughout the inspection. If necessary, take samples, and/or define the samples that should be taken by a certified (accredited) laboratory or try to be on site when the samples are taken randomly so the inspector knows it is done right.", "During the documentation checking, the following items should for example be verified: \u2022 Self monitoring register (last lab analysis); \u2022 Assess change in treatment efficiency by comparing the most recent data with the trend (check permit conditions if present) \u2022 Maintenance operations register; \u2022 Communications to Competent Authority (threshold breaches etc); \u2022 Liquid Waste input/output register; \u2022 EMS Procedures. 371/451 During the inspection visit, the sections of the waste water treatment plant have to be investigated, with the following main purposes: \u2022 Check correspondence of the points of discharge with those indicated in the permit \u2022 Check the waste water streams in order to assess that compliance with the limits is not achieved by dilution \u2022 Check procedures, competences (training\u2026) and tools used by the operator or third company to take samples \u2022 Check if all the sections of the plant are working \u2022 Check how the sludge (produced by the treatment) is treated and which is the final destination (use in agriculture, incineration, landfill etc) \u2022 Check which parameters are continuously monitored (flow, pH etc); check maintenance of devices and calibration \u2022 Check how rain water is managed (first flush collection and treatment) \u2022 System to collect not treated water in case of heavy rain \u2022 Check if any kind of pretreatment is needed for the pollutants that will not be affected by the final treatment \u2022 Check if treated water is re-used or discharged. 6.3. Sampling Sampling is the action to extract a (waste) water mass with a view to investigating a number of clearly defined properties. A representative sample is a sample whose composition corresponds to that of the wastewater to be investigated or a specific part thereof. 6.3.1 Auditing When the inspection group is auditing the sampling and analysis activities of the operator (or of a third part), the aim of the site inspection should be to check: \u2022 the compliance of the operator with the reference methods adopted for taking samples and making measurements and analysis, related to conditions set in the monitoring plan (and permit); \u2022 the qualified competences of the operators (training, personnel certification registrations etc.); \u2022 the accredited laboratory collected samples and analysis, and relative signature of the responsible. ISO 5667 establishes general requirements for sampling, preservation, handling, transport and storage of all water samples including those for biological analyses. 6.3.2 Performing sampling Some Inspection Authorities can perform sampling by their own. In order to ascertain whether the limits of acceptability, as set by current legislation, are complied with, the sampling of the waste water must be carried out at the sampling point, immediately before the effluent point in the receiving body. The sampling well must be easily accessible and of adequate size. The sampling may be instantaneous (withdrawing a suitable volume of effluent in one solution), medium composite (obtained by mixing a number of samples, taken in a given period of time; from it you get the 372/451 required volume for analysis), continuous (continuous withdrawal of a portion of the effluent for a certain time period to obtain the volume required for the analysis). Devices and tools should preferably be made of inert material. The preference is for stainless steel because teflon (PTFE) is very expensive and the other materials have limitations: \u2022 corrosion resistant steel (stainless steel) is suitable for all groups of parameters. \u2022 thermoplastic (PE, PVC) is unsuitable for the sampling of organic compounds, but is suitable for the other applications. \u2022 fluoropolymer (PTFE, TFE) is suitable for all groups of parameters. The sample bottles must be clean and made of the proper material and of the correct size to transport and store waste water samples. A proper bottle should be used for each group of pollutant: Pollutant Bottle Volume (minimum) Metals Plastic 50 ml VOC Glass 40 ml (vials 100% off) Total hydrocarbons Fats and oils Chlorinated / phosphoric pesticides Phenols and / or aldehydes IPA Dark glass 250 ml Microbiology - E.Coli glass / plastic sterile 300 ml \u2013 1 l Handle the following filling rate of the sample bottle: \u2022 Complete the bottle for volatile parameters for 100% off; \u2022 Do not fill the mineral oil bottle by more than 80%; \u2022 Fill in the bottle for inorganic parameters for 90%. \u2022 If the parameter to be analyzed is not known, go to the lowest fill rate of 80%.", "Samples should be transported as soon as possible in the laboratory; however, they should not be kept longer than 4 hours at temperatures above 10 \u00b0 C; as far as the samples for microbiological analysis are concerned, they should be maintained both during transport and in the laboratory at a temperature of 3- 5 \u00b0C. A sampling lists and labels for the sampling bottles should be prepared in advance. The sampling lists contain all the information required for sampling such as: \u2022 Name and object code of the loader; \u2022 Description and code of the sampling point; \u2022 Lab Info Number; \u2022 Sampling method (stitch / collect); \u2022 Analyse parameters; \u2022 Conservation. 373/451 Use clean gloves and prevent the sample from being contaminated from the environment 6.4. Dealing with violations A survey covering all aspects from permit procedure to inspection and sampling/analysis has been conducted (Annex 2). 19 member states and country regions answered the survey. The overall results are described in section 7. Of all the answers to the survey, can be distinguished two basic systems of dealing with the violation. One of them is the case where further proceedings are conducted by the Authority, the second is where proceedings are handled over to police, public prosecutor and competent judicial authorities. Among countries in which permit is not issued by the same Authority that check compliance with permit conditions it is usually the inspection who conduct proceedings (but not in all cases). If a breach of the limit value is declared within the self-monitoring report, provided by the operator to the competent authority, these data are possible to be used to take further actions. There is no country when that data cannot be used in any action. But that actions differs in countries. This may be a penalty imposed directly on the basis of these measurements or measurements may be the introduction to other verifying actions leading to penalty. In that first situation after receiving measurement results for an appropriate period of time, Inspection Authority is checking it and, in case of non-compliance with the values set in the permit, a decision imposing an administrative penalty is issued. At the request of the operator, the Authority may postpone the deadline for payment of the administrative penalty if it carries out the enterprise (project/operation) which may constitute a basis for postponing the penalty. If the enterprise has been completed in due time, as confirmed by the quality of the purified effluent, the penalty is discontinued. The operator has also the right to appeal against the decision imposing the penalty to the second instance authority. In the second situation, a breach of the limit values declared within the self-monitoring report does not constitute itself an automatic evidence of the violation. It has to be technically verified and that should be performed by the inspection authority. Often after submitting self-monitoring report with declared breach of emission limit value competent authority make action for verifying non-compliance and it this is done by asking the operator for more details or by making site inspection. In some countries penalty can be set only after one inspection on the plant where those results are observed. Self-monitoring reports are also used as tools for checking the compliance with the permit conditions. If non-compliance is noticed from such reports than an inspection on site is undertaken in order to enforce the permit condition. Usually this means that the operator is punished by a penalty for breaching the permit conditions but also a permit suspension may be taken into consideration. Punishment may be imposed but two more analysis has to be done and the inspector has to be present during sampling. If the average value of three result (one from self-monitoring) exceeds the limits, then the authority can issue a penalty. When such a breach is reported, the Authority requests further corrective action to rectify that breach. Moreover, should the operations result in exceedance of the emission limit values indicated in the permit, the operator is required to designate a mixing zone as stipulated in the requirements of the Water Framework Directive or to apply for derogation from achieving the required emission levels. 374/451 In other systems competent authority itself can\u2019t issue a fine. If there are exceedances of the terms of approval, this will be excluded by the state/ the municipality - and may end with a police report and a fine. The police conduct investigations.", "If there has been a crime, police hands over the case to the public prosecutor. If the case goes to the court, the competent authority is called to the court as a witness. The fine is imposed by the court. Authority may also order a stop of the discharge of waste water. In most countries the sanction for exceedance of wastewater discharge quality are imposed by inspection bodies on the basis of control measurements. In fewer cases penalties are imposed by permitting authority or other competent authority, usually after non-compliance are reported to that authority by inspection. Operator may have a right to ask for postponing the deadline for payment, to appeal to higher instance authority, to submit a complaint against penalty report to the competent court, to spread the penalty into instalments. The smallest number of cases is when penalties are imposed only by court. Type of punishment for exceeding the permissible conditions depends on the severity of the crime and if done on purpose or on pure negligence, and on the impact in the environment. Usually the punishment is to impose a fine. Only in cases where there is an imminent threat of damage to the environment or if operator does not restore the non-compliance situation or if it\u2019s a second breach, authority may issue a decision, like closure of the plant or part of it, withdrawal of the permit. Type of punishment: \u2022 fine by authority (some with maximum upper limit, like for instance 4000 euros), \u2022 monetary fines by court, \u2022 jail, \u2022 restriction operation, \u2022 prohibiting operation by court, \u2022 suspension of the permit, \u2022 cancelation of the permit, \u2022 remediate measures, \u2022 closing down part or whole installation, \u2022 official warning, \u2022 order of penalty payment \u2022 administrative enforcement, \u2022 withdrawal permit, \u2022 withdrawal of bank guaranties. 6.5. EMS Procedures Importance is checking the Environmental Management System (EMS) that operator should implement. EMS are considered in every BAT conclusions, as Best Available Practice, but it is not compulsory having a EMS certification (EMAS, ISO14001), as far as could be an internal process. Checking compliance of EMS procedures is particularly relevant when the EMS is not certified. It is fundamental checking how the operator is able to tackle possible malfunctions of the waste water treatment plant, causing environmental critical situations. 375/451 During the inspection visit, the sections of the waste water treatment plant have to be investigate, with the following main purposes: \u2022 List of procedures/instructions of Environmental Management System (EMS) to understand how the process is covered by documentation \u2022 List of critical devices for the environment (e.g. parts, devices, instruments of measures in the treatment waste water plant) to focus the main environmental aspects \u2022 Maintenance procedures and related registrations (check frequencies and manner registration on waste water treatment plant) \u2022 Checking performance and taking corrective action. Does the company take action systematically following the examination of deviations and near deviations as a means to improve the compliance performance? \u2022 Monitoring and measurement. Does the company communicate in this annual report the performance in relation to all relevant regulatory requirements? \u2022 Environmental Emergency scenarios and related actions. 6.6. Relevant criteria to be considered for risk assessment (IRAM tool) Pursuant to the Industrial Emission Directive (IED) all inspections should be planned in advance. The competent authority must draw up inspection plans and programs for installations and establishments, including the frequency of site visits. These frequencies should be based on a systematic risk appraisal. Within the IMPEL project \u201cEasy tools\u201d a new rule based methodology was developed and tested, called Integrated Risk Assessment Method (IRAM). Each installation is rated against impact criteria; when assessing the risk for IPPC (IED) installations examples of appropriate impact criteria include \u201cQuantity/quality of water pollution\u201d. Releases to water are therefore among the criteria identified to set priorities, and it is worth to mention how they are declined in the IRAM risk assessment: 376/451 7. Main results of the Survey A survey has been handed out at the first stage of the project containing preliminary questions to MS about waste water treatment. There have been 19 replies from 15 countries. There is no such situation in any MS that parameters of the quality of treated wastewater are stated only in law. In majority of cases \u2013 16 answers from 12 MS parameters are stated both in low and in permit. In 3 MS parameters are stated only in permit.", "There are many different systems regulating the manner in which waste water permits are issued. Also permits are issued by various Authorities, both as regards the administrative area to which the body is responsible and the competence of authority. Of all countries where the discharge conditions are defined both in the law and in the permit, in 8 MS (12 answers) permit can specify more restrictive conditions than in low, and in 2 MS permit can specify more and less restrictive conditions. In 2 MS permits can not specify other than the law conditions. The reasons for having possibility of setting in permit restrictive conditions are as follows. In these cases (and they are particular not regular situation) permit conditions are related to the state of the recipient water body (lower water quality than more restrictive conditions for waste water discharged) or to the quality of the water used in the industrial processes (higher quality parameters for raw water than higher quality parameters for waste waters). There are more reasons for possibility of setting only more restrictive conditions in permit than those prescribed by law. \u2022 situation where special care must be given to recipient bodies which belongs to sensitive areas or other areas of environmental importance. \u2022 in terms of requiring monitoring of parameters which are not specifically indicated in law or impose stricter emission limit values; \u2022  if Best Available Techniques allow to attain smaller values and also if facilities are located in specific delicate places; 377/451 \u2022 condition more restrictive than e.g. BREF/BAT-conclusions if it is necessary regarding WFD, which is implemented in an executive order which again in turn must be implemented in the permit; \u2022 if water quality standards are not met by applying BAT-AELs. Permit determining the quality parameters of discharged waste water (whether it is an IPPC or sector permit) is issued by the same authority that inspect installation in 9 MS (11 answers). Permit is issued and inspected by different authority in also 9 MS (11 answers). 2 MS (3 answers) occurred in these 2 groups. The reason is that in that 2 cases permit conditions can be checked both by issuing authority and by different one. In majority of cases where permit is issued by the same authority than the one that check compliance, permit issues and check compliance is done by different departments or different group of people in one department or different team within the same authority or section who is checking compliance work and do research independent from the permitting section and management of both sections is different. Advantages, which respondents of survey indicated, of that system over the other, is that experts who perform inspection may have better knowledge about the facility and can monitor the environmental performance of the facility more effectively. When it\u2019s the same authority it provides an integrated approach and knowledge from the approval process is utilized in the inspection. Inspectors who write authorization know very well the operations and thus can effectively carry out their checks. This enables better handing over of the case files and continuous communication between permitting and compliance teams thereby facilitating mutual understanding of permit conditions and compliance issues such as enforceability. The authority who make the inspections knows the conditions established in the permit and the complete administrative file of the activity. More knowledge and experience in one authority, more exchange of knowledge, better transfer of information. Advantages of the system where permit is issued by different authority than the one that check compliance with permit conditions is improving the transparency on the decisions and avoiding corruption. Disadvantages is that issuing authority may not know an installation good or even does not see an installation at all. That system increases the need of communication between authorities which results in amount of correspondence between authorities and extended time for writing permit. Notwithstanding respondents indicated involving inspecting authority into decision main process as a good habit. Analytical measurements of the discharged treated waste water are conducted by operator (itself or by hired third party laboratory), by inspection authority (itself or by hired laboratory). The operator is responsible for performing monitoring in all 15 MS (19 answers) who responded to the survey. Regarding countries where permit issue and inspect different authority, operator is also responsible for sending results to permitting authority in 8 MS (12 answers) and in 4 MS for sending results to inspection authority.", "It means in 3 of that MS operator is responsible to send results to both permitting authority and inspecting authority. In 4 MS operator is responsible for sending results to permitting/inspecting authority. The inspection authority has a checklist to perform an inspection in an industrial waste water treatment plant in 7 MS (11 answers). It can be either dedicated/separate checklist or part of complex checklist, checklist made individually for purpose of installation. Inspection authority doesn\u2019t have a checklist in 8 MS. There are cases where inspection of the industrial waste water treatment plant is included in the inspection of the whole industrial plant and no checklists are used but an agenda for the inspection. Also, there are cases where no such standard checklists exist, and case specific checklists are prepared using the particular permit and making reference to previous on-site inspections before any inspection at such an installation. 378/451 Sampling and analysis should be performed by an accredited laboratory in every MS, but not in all cases not accredited sampling or not accredited measurements are treated as invalid. It might be some exceptions, although very rare or special approval has to be issued. In court that analysis or measurements could be easily challenged or just would be unacceptable. In some countries measurements or sampling without accreditation is the basis for issuing a decision imposing an administrative penalty.

In permit? Other way? How? TURKEY Defined in Bylaw and in permit. Also by special provision and communiques. (e.g. some communiques for sampling, analyzing, wastewater treatment, sensitive regions, and some kind of industrial  wastewater control.) CYPRUS The parameters of the quality of treated wastewater are stated in the Permit. If the treated wastewater is discharged to the recipient water body or soil, parameters are laid down in the Waste Discharge Permit or in the Industrial Emission Permit if the installation falls under the provisions of the IED. ROMANIA The quality parameters for waste water are stated both in the law (Government Decision) and in the permit. By the Government Decision no 188/2002 is established maximum allowed concentration for many quality parameters; these maximum concentrations differ on the place of discharge (municipal sewerage or directly to a water body, e.g. river). By the permit are set maximum allowed concentration for specific parameters that characterise the waste waters from a certain installation. CZECH REPUBLIC In legislation and In permit DENMARK If the waste water is discharged to the recipient it\u2019s part of the permit. Are the waste water discharged to public waste water treatment plants it\u2019s regulated in a permission granted by the municipality. The permit is either approved by the state or municipality depending om the type of industry. ESTONIA In law and in permit. SLOVAK REPUBLIC Yes. In law \u2013 Water Act, BAT Conclusions. In permit SLOVENIA Both in law (actually it is a decree) and in permit. FINLAND In permit PORTUGAL The limit values are established in the water permit that is autonomous and included as one annex of the environmental permit on IPPC installations. The law states also quality parameters for wastewater on non-IPPC installations, that are included on the water permit also. MALTA They are always specified in permit and based on national guidance documents and legislation such as the Water Policy Framework Regulations LN 194 of 2004 as amended transposing the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and related legislation. Moreover, consideration is taken on the type of activity being carried out and the nature of the effluent generated by the specific process within the installation which may require the monitoring of additional parameters. The parameters identified as requiring monitoring from a specific installation are included as part of the permit together with the associated emission limit vales, frequency of testing and reporting requirements. SPAIN (NAVARRA) Some parameters are specifically stated in permit. This parameters must be periodically 412/451 controlled according to permit. General parameters are stated in law. This must be controlled only if there is any problem or question which forces its analysis, but in a general way must be attained SPAIN (GALICIA) In permit. If the treated waste water is discharged to the recipient body, parameters are laid down in the permit, either in the integrated environmental permit (IEP) in IPPC/IED installations or in the specific discharge permit issued by the Water Authority at basin level in non IPPC/IED installations. IEPs are issued by Regional authorities. SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) If the wastewater destination is the municipal network the limits are stated by the city council. If the wastewater destination is the river the limits are stated by the national government. SPAIN (CANTABRIA) The parameters of quality of treated wastewater are stated in law, in the Stated legislation for Public domain hydraulic (mainly rivers) and by the autonomous community of Cantabria legislation for waters of discharge to collector or coast. The representative parameters are established in permits and could be more restrictive than law. These permits established the controls and analysis that should be done. SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) Both, in law -european, national and regional-, and in permits. The main applicable legislation (non-exhaustive list) are the following: National law: \u2022 Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2001, de 20 de julio, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Aguas. \u2022", "Real Decreto 849/1986, de 11 de abril, por el que se aprueba el Reglamento del Dominio P\u00fablico Hidr\u00e1ulico, que desarrolla los t\u00edtulos preliminar I, IV, V, VI y VII de la Ley 29/1985, de 2 de agosto, de Aguas. Regional law: \u2022 Ley 9/2010, de 30 de julio, de Aguas para Andaluc\u00eda. \u2022 Decreto 109/2015, de 17 de marzo, por el que se aprueba el Reglamento de Vertidos al Dominio P\u00fablico Hidr\u00e1ulico y al Dominio P\u00fablico Mar\u00edtimo-Terrestre de Andaluc\u00eda. European law: \u2022 Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy. Best Available Techniques (BAT) reference documents (BREFs) NETHERLAND For bigger installations/plants in individual permits. They are based on BAT-AELs, stated in the BREFs. Smaller installations/plants sometimes have general binding rules (specific parameters) for the quality of the treated waste water. They are also based on BAT-AELs. ITALY Both in low and in permits. The National Decree n.152/06 establishes maximum allowed concentration for water discharge into water bodies and sewage. POLAND Both in low and in permits QUESTION 2: PERMIT 413/451 Can permit specify more / less restrictive discharge conditions than law? TURKEY No, not in permit. But in some region, more strict discharged water quality standards are defined by special provision than in bylaw according to receiving water body pollution level ROMANIA In some specific cases the conditions established throughout the permit can be more or less restrictive than the condition established by law. In these particular cases the permit conditions are related to the state of the recipient water body (lower water quality than more restrictive conditions for waste water discharged) or to the quality of the water used in the industrial processes (higher quality parameters for raw water than higher quality parameters for waste waters). CYPRUS Yes. The Permit can specify more restrictive discharge conditions than law in the cases where special care must be given to recipient bodies where belonging to sensitive areas or other areas of environmental importance. CZECH REPUBLIC Permit can specify more restrictive discharge conditions than law and can not specify less restrictive discharge conditions than law DENMARK There must always be a legal basis for the condition. But the condition can be more restrictive than e.g. BREF/ BAT-conclusions if it is necessary regarding WFD, which is implemented in an executive order which again in turn must be implemented in the permit. ESTONIA More restrictive discharge condition are in the permit SLOVAK REPUBLIC Permit can specify more restrictive discharge conditions than law and can not specify less restrictive discharge conditions than law. SLOVENIA No FINLAND The discharge conditions are set in the permit only. PORTUGAL The permit can establish its own values. Usually they are the same that the ones on the law MALTA Yes the permit may specify more restrictive discharge conditions than those prescribed by law in terms of requiring monitoring of parameters which are not specifically indicated in law or impose stricter emission limit values. SPAIN (NAVARRA) Yes if Best Available Techniques allow to attain smaller values and also if facilities are located in specific delicate places. SPAIN (GALICIA) Yes In some basins\u2019 Management Plans, more restrictive discharge conditions than in law are laid down. Water quality conditions for the recipient body may lead also to more restrictive discharge conditions. SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) More restrictive limits can be stated in the permits by the government (city council or national government). Less restrictive limits can not be stated. SPAIN (CANTABRIA) Yes, the permit can be more restrictive but not less restrictive than law. SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) Yes, permits can specify more restrictive discharge conditions than law. Conditions less restrictive than law only can be specified by permits in justified cases. 414/451 NETHERLAND More restrictive: Possible if water quality standards are not met by applying BAT-AELs. Less restrictive: Possible if there are good reasons for derogation (e.g. specific production not mentioned in BREFs) ITALY IED permits can fix more restrictive threshold limits at the discharging point, according to the site-specific situation of the water body receptor (e.g. quality of the water of the river). POLAND Yes, more restrictive. QUESTION 3: PERMIT Is the permit (determining the quality parameters of discharged waste water) issued by the same authority than the one that check compliance with permit conditions?   Comment please to this, whether such a system is right / not good? Advantages / disadvantages TURKEY Same authority.", "But Permit issues are carried by permit department and compliance check is done by inspection department. In my opinion, this separate system is not so efficient. When permit and compliance check are issued by the same authority, experts may have more knowledge about the facility and can monitor the environmental performance of the facility more effectively. ROMANIA In Romania we have a particular situation: the conditions for waste water discharges are established by two permits: water management permit and environmental permit. Of course, the conditions are the same, but those two permits are issued by two different organizations: the water management permit is issued by the \u201eRomanian Waters\u201d National Administration (throughout of its river basin administrations) while the environmental permit is issued by National Environmental Agency (throughout its county agencies). The inspections are undertaken by National Environmental Guard (for both permits) and inspection bodies of \u201eRomanian Waters\u201d National Administration (but only in respect with water management permits). Overlapping of competences in both sectors permitting and inspection of waste water discharged could create issues in implementation and enforcement of water law. To prevent that joint inspections between National Environmental Guard and inspection bodies of \u201eRomanian Waters\u201d National Administration are foreseen and undertaken periodically, especially in case of big IED Installations. CYPRUS The permit is issued by the same authority (Department of Environment) with the one that checks compliance with permit conditions. However, the authority is consisted by two distinctive groups, the permitting and the inspection group, thus the permitting and the inspections are carried out by different people. The system is effective since the good communication between the two groups is quite important for the implementation of the Environmental Laws, for the preparation of adequate, solid permits and the performing of good inspections CZECH REPUBLIC Permit write - Regional authority Permit can check - Regional authority and Czech environmental inspectorate. Regional authority issue permit for IPPC installation and CEI is involved in permit process and can apply involving their requirements in the permit through statement submit to regional authority in issuing permit process. The system is proven. 415/451 DENMARK It\u2019s  the same authority that approves the permit and performs inspection (check compliance with the permit condition). I think it\u2019s a good idea that it\u2019s the same authority because it provides an integrated approach and knowledge from the approval process is utilized in the inspection. If the waste water is discharged to public waste water treatment plants is it regulated in a permission granted and inspected by the municipality. The public waste water treatment plant is regulated by a permission approved by the municipality and inspected by the state. ESTONIA No, the permit is issued and controlled by different authority. Our system helps to avoid any kind of corruption. SLOVAK REPUBLIC Yes. In Slovak republic the permit is issued by the permitting authority \u2013 The Slovak Environmental Inspectorate. The same authority also enforces the conditions of permit. This system is based on the Competence Act and is proven. Inspectors who write authorization know very well the operations and thus can effectively carry out their checks \u2013 this is advantage. SLOVENIA No. Agency issue the permit and inspectorate inspect. It is good except if it would be one person then an issuing authority would know an installation better. Usually an issuing authority does not see an installation at all. FINLAND At the moment no. From 2019 onwards permitting and compliance monitoring will be under the same roof. PORTUGAL The permitting and inspection authority are not the same in Portugal. Nevertheless the permitting authority can also do compliance check on water permit conditions. The system improves the transparency on the decisions, but increases the need of communication between authorities. MALTA Compliance with the permit conditions is checked by a different team within the same authority issuing the permit. This enables better handing over of the case files and continuous communication between permitting and compliance teams thereby facilitating mutual understanding of permit conditions and compliance issues such as enforceability. SPAIN (NAVARRA) If discharges are to public sewage system yes If discharges are to river directly not. Basin authorities are responsible SPAIN (GALICIA) Yes. Discharge permits are issued by Water Authorities of Water Basins. Permits may be issued by Water Authorities belonging to the Regional administration, in the case of basins within the boundaries of a region, or to the National administration, in the case of basins going beyond the boundaries of a region.", "If the treated waste water is discharged to the public sewage network, parameters are laid down in the permit issued by the municipality concerned. IEPs of IPPC/IED installations include permit conditions regarding waste water discharge and both IPPC Service (permitting Service) of the Regional Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning and Water Authorities participate in drafting discharge conditions but Water Authorities have the final word. In checking compliance both Environmental Inspection of the Regional Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning and Water Authorities participate but as in the case of 416/451 permitting, the Water Authorities have the final word. The system is right when both Authorities are aligned in their action. Otherwise some overlapping and lack of coordination may arise. SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) Yes, the permit is made by the same authority (Regional Deputy Environment Ministry of Castilla \u2013 La Mancha region, Spain) that the one that check compliance with permit conditions, but in the field of wastewater there is a feedback of the national government. In other words, there is a feedback. We send the reports to them and if they detect any non-compliance, they send it to us. It has the advantage that the same authority that knows the permit can do a better follow up of the delivered documentation. On the other hand, the work of the national government is very useful because they have a complementary task to ours. SPAIN (CANTABRIA) Depends of the competence of the place where the waste water is discharged. The Environmental Integrated Authorization (EIA) is issued by the same authority than the one that check compliance with permit conditions only when the waste water is competence of the Community of Cantabria. In the other cases (mainly discharges to the rivers), it is separated the authorization of the inspection. There are not problems in neither cases, although the advantage of been the same authority is a better transfer of information. SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) Yes, the same authority that issued the permit controls its compliance. In our opinion, that's a good system because the authority who make the inspections knows the conditions established in the permit and the complete administrative file of the activity. NETHERLAND Yes, by the same authority. This system works fine as long as the section who is checking compliance can work and do research independent from the permitting section. Management of both sections is different. Both sections have the same goal to protect the water quality. Advantage More knowledge and experience in one authority. More exchange of knowledge. ITALY In Italy the authority issuing IED permits is different from the one responsible of the inspections. Anyway, inspection competent authorities usually participate to the permitting procedure. POLAND Permit is issued and inspected by different authorities. 417/451 QUESTION 4: MONITORING Who runs the analytical measurements of the discharged water? Operator / Inspection Authority / third part-who? TURKEY For self-monitoring, analysis is done by accredited laboratory. Results are checked during inspection. Besides, If discharged wastewater flow is more than 10.000 m3/day, the operator has to set online monitoring system which is connected to network of authority. In permit procedure and compliance check the samples are taken by the laboratory. Permit writer also has to be present and check the sampling procedure. Operator pays the analysis. ROMANIA All three: the operator has the duty to carry out its self monitoring obligation set up by the permit conditions and this could be done through its own laboratory or by third party laboratories; the \u201eRomanian Waters\u201d National Administration holds its own laboratories through which it can perform analytical measurements. CYPRUS The operator has the duty to carry out self-monitoring as set up by the permit conditions and this is done by accredited third party laboratories.; The Inspection Group (Department of Environment) is supported by the State General Laboratory, a public accredited laboratory. DoE may take samples during routine inspections under the control of the implementation of either the Waste Discharge Permits or Industrial Emissions Permits and carry them to SGL for analytical measurements CZECH REPUBLIC Third part \u2013 laboratory with accreditation. Operator can carry out measurement if have accreditation for sampling and analysing. Inspection authority - CEI \u2013 can take sample (but can not use those measurement in administrative procedure) and submit sample to the laboratory for analysing. DENMARK Usually it is the third part and only in special cases the company. The results is send to the authority (state or the municipality depending on who has approved the permit).", "The third part is paid by the operator. ESTONIA The operator, who has the duty to carry out self-monitoring obligation (set up by permit conditions). In case of suspicion or problems \u2013 Inspection Authority. SLOVAK REPUBLIC An operator can perform a measurement if he has a sampling and analysis accreditation or can do so by an accredited laboratory. The inspection authority cannot take samples and is not equipped to analyze them. The inspection authority has an accredited laboratory for this purpose. Third part \u2013 Accredited laboratory. SLOVENIA Accredited laboratory. FINLAND Operator or third party (consultant) paid by the operator. PORTUGAL The operator can do its own measurements. The inspection authority takes samples when needed to do cross-check during inspections. MALTA The permit obliges the operator to ensure that analytical measures are taken in a determined manner at their own expense. Such monitoring is to be carried out by a 3rd party and at an accredited laboratory. Monitoring can only take place after the Authority approves a method statement in accordance with the permit conditions or in accordance with a monitoring plan submitted as part of the application documentation. 418/451 SPAIN (NAVARRA) Operator \u2013 self control (is own laboratory) or external laboratory (UNE-EN 17.025) Inspection Authority \u2013 according to annual planning, samples are sent to external laboratory (UNE-EN 17.025) Organism \u2013 if water is discharged to rivers, basin authorities can take samples according to its own procedure SPAIN (GALICIA) All three: the operator has the duty to carry out its self-monitoring obligation set up by the permit conditions and this is done by accredited third party laboratories.; very few operators have accredited laboratories available and usually only for a limited number of parameters and not all of them. The Inspection Service is supported by the Environmental Laboratory of Galicia, (LMAG in its Spanish and Galician acronym) a public accredited laboratory of the Regional Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning to take samples and to analyse them to carry out periodic analytical measurements during routine inspections of IPPC/IED installations. SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) It is made by a third part, it is an authorized control organization (OCA). SPAIN (CANTABRIA) The type or frequency of the analytical measurements depends on the permit. The usual controls are: - Self monitoring by the operator (Installation owner)) - Scheduled or discretionary inspections by Inspection Authority - Monthly, quarterly, biannual or annual control by third part, accredited entity collaborating with the administration SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) The analytical measurements of the discharge water may be runs by operator (self monitoring), by authority (inspection) or by third-party. Third party are regional or national ministry authorised entities. NETHERLAND The operators of the installations and the Inspection Authorities run the measurements of the discharged waste water. Sometimes operators have outsourced these activities to third parties. ITALY Operator is obliged to perform self monitoring measurements at the discharging point: these are usually performed by a third part (accredited laboratory) on behalf of the operator. Inspection authorities do perform both sampling and analytical measurements; in Italy regional environmental inspection authorities own their own laboratory. POLAND The operator is required to ensure that emission measurements are carried out by an accredited laboratory. If the operator has his own accredited laboratory, he performs analysis himself (rarely) if not \u2013 third party (most) \u2013 accredited laboratory. 419/451 QUESTION 5: SELF MONITORING Is the operator responsible for performing monitoring analysis and sending results to the authority? To the one who issued the permit? To other? Which is the frequency set in the permit to send analytical results to the competent authority? TURKEY See question 4 ROMANIA As I indicated to the previous question, the operator is responsible for carrying out the self monitoring of its waste water discharges as well as to send the self monitoring results to the competent authorities, both inspection and permitting authorities. The frequencies for reporting are set up though permit conditions and may vary from quarterly to yearly depending on the size of the installation and its impact on water. CYPRUS The operator is responsible for carrying out the self-monitoring and this is done by third party laboratories. Results are submitted to the DoE once every year or whenever the DoE asks them, or during inspections. The frequencies for reporting are set up though permit conditions usually annually and immediately in case of no compliance. CZECH REPUBLIC Operator is responsible for performing monitoring analysis and in case of non-compliance operator have to inform inspection authority about breach of permit.", "Results (summary) from monitoring operator have to send every year as a part of self- monitoring report to the Regional authority (permit writer). Regional authority make self- monitoring report public available via information system IPPC (web page). The frequency for sending self-monitoring report is set in permit (and in legislation too) and is yearly. Operator have not obligation send results from analytical measurement to the Czech environmental inspectorate automatically, but have to send measurements on request and have to submit measurement during inspection. DENMARK See question 4 ESTONIA The operator is responsible for performing monitoring analysis to the permit giver. To the inspector upon request. The frequency is set in the permit, it can vary from monthly to annually. SLOVAK REPUBLIC Yes. Operator is responsible for performing monitoring analysis and in case of non-compliance operator have to inform inspection authority about breach of permit. Results (summary) from monitoring operator have to send every year as a part of self- monitoring report to the permit authority - SEI. The frequency for sending self-monitoring report is set in permit (and in legislation too) and is yearly. Operator have obligation send results from analytical measurement to the Slovak Environmental Inspectorate automatically, but have to send measurements on request and have to submit measurement during inspection. SLOVENIA Operator has to hire an accredited laboratory and then send report to issuing authority. Ones per year. FINLAND Yes, to the monitoring authority and to the concerned municipal environmental authority. The frequency is set in the permit and can vary from monthly to annually. 420/451 PORTUGAL The operator is responsible to perform monitoring analysis and send its results to the permiting authority. The frequency is usually one trimester. MALTA Yes the operator of permitted installations is responsible to submit results of the performed analysis to the Authority which issued the permit and is checking on compliance (same Authority as described above) on an annual basis as part of an Annual Environmental Report. Each permit would then specify the type and frequency of the required analysis. For example, certain operators are required to collect and submit quarterly data on certain parameters discharged into the marine environment. Additional monitoring requirements other than the Annual Environmental Reports, and as stated in the environmental permit may also be submitted on a regular basis as agreed upon with the Authority. SPAIN (NAVARRA) Yes, usually is established in the permit Yes, to the one who issued the permit. For facilities not included in the 2010/75/UE Directive range, sometimes local authorities Every three or six months or every year. SPAIN (GALICIA) The operator is responsible for carrying out the self-monitoring and this is done by third party laboratories (with very few exceptions). Results are submitted to the IPPC Service (Permitting service). In IPPC/IED installations, the IPPC/IED Services provides all the results of self-monitoring to the Inspection Authority for routine inspections. The frequencies for reporting are set up though permit conditions and may vary from monthly, quarterly to yearly depending on the size of the installation and its impact on water. SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) The operator is  responsible for sending monitoring results to the authority. It sends these results to the same authority that issues the permit. The frequency depends on the importance of the plant. An usual frequency is one year. SPAIN (CANTABRIA) The operator is responsible for performing monitoring analysis and sending results to the authority who issued the permit with the frequency set in the permit (changeable: monthly, quarterly, biannual or annual). SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) Yes, the Andalusian law (Decreto 109/2005) regulates the operator obligation for performing analysis and sending to the authority who issued the permit. The frequency to sending the analytical results is established in each permit, although it is variable, from once in each year to even several sendings per month NETHERLAND An operator in the Netherlands is responsible for performing monitoring analysis, not for sending results to the competent authority (due to reducing administrative expenses for the industry). Incidents (with the possibility that permit conditions, e.g. limit values, are exceeded) should be reported to the authorities. ITALY The operator is responsible for performing monitoring analysis according to the contents of the Self Monitoring Plan which is part of the IED permit and sets frequencies, methods and parameters. Results are sent once per year (within the 30th of January) to the Authority who issued the permit, the inspection authority and other involved authorities (municipalities ecc.) POLAND Yes, to both: authority who issued the permit and inspecting authority.", "Measurement results are submitted: 421/451 1) in the case of periodic measurements performed more than once a month - within 30 days of the end of the quarter in which the measurements were made; 2) in other cases - within 30 days of the end of the measurement. QUESTION 6: INSPECTION Does the inspection authority have a checklist to perform an inspection in a industrial water treatment plant? If yes, please attach it TURKEY Yes but not available in English ROMANIA Up to now we do not use such tools in our inspections.. CYPRUS No, the DoE doesn\u2019t have a specific checklist to perform an inspection in an industrial waste water treatment plant. The inspection is based on the terms of the IED Permit. CZECH REPUBLIC No DENMARK Some have \u2013 it\u2019s part of the inspection of the whole industrial plant. Denmark has 98 municipalities and they decide for themselves how they are performing the inspection. There are some guidelines from the state. ESTONIA No checklist are used. SLOVAK REPUBLIC No. The inspection authority checks the individual permit conditions. SLOVENIA No FINLAND Inspection of the industrial waste water treatment plant is included in the inspection of the whole industrial plant. No checklists are used but an agenda for the inspection. PORTUGAL No MALTA No such standard checklists exist. Case specific checklists are prepared using the particular permit and making reference to previous on site inspections before any inspection at such an installation.

Items regarding waste water discharge make up the chapter SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) Yes, we have a check-list for each type of plant. A part of this check-list is related to wastewater. 423/451 SPAIN (CANTABRIA) When the inspection of the waste water is competence of the Community of Cantabria, we have a check list with all the conditions imposed in the EIA (atmosphere, noise, residues\u2026 included waste waters), it\u2019s adapted for each installation. SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) The check lists are made individually before each inspection and incorporates all the specific conditions established in the permit. There's not general checklist available, but we attach a couple of particular examples NETHERLAND Yes, there are different checklists and instruction manuals. The instruction manual for sampling waste water is attached (in Dutch). ITALY A general checklist for waste water discharge has been issued by the network of environmental agencies. POLAND Yes, in our system we have 3 checklist regarding waste water: 1. Municipal waste water treatment plants 2. Water and waste water management 3. Industrial plants (general) We can modify them according to our needs 424/451 QUESTION 7: INSPECTION", "If a breach of the limit value is declared within the Self monitoring report (provided by the operator to the competent authority), can this data be used to give a penalty/fee etc ? TURKEY No. Two more analysis has to be done and the inspector has to be present during sampling. If the average value of three result (one from self monitoring) exceeds the limits, than the authority can issue a penalty ROMANIA We use the self monitoring reports as tools for checking the compliance with the permit conditions. In case we notice from such reports that the results of analytical measurements are not complying with the maximum allowed concentration for one ore more quality parameters set un in the permit than a an inspection (site visit) is undertaken in order to enforce the permit condition. Usually this means that the operator is punished by a penalty for breaching the permit conditions but also a permit suspension may be taken into consideration CYPRUS Yes CZECH REPUBLIC Yes, but often after submitting self-monitoring report (with declared breach of emission limit value) competent authority make action for verifying non-compliance (ask operator for more detail or make site inspection). DENMARK If there are exceedances of the terms of approval, this will be excluded by the state/ the municipality - and may end with a police report and a fine. The police conduct investigations and hands over the case to the public prosecutor if there has been a crime. The competent authority may also order a stop of the discharge of waste water. The competent authority itself can issue no fine. The fine is imposes by the court. ESTONIA Yes (fee) SLOVAK REPUBLIC Yes, but often after submitting self-monitoring report (with declared breach of emission limit value) competent authority make action for verifying non-compliance (ask operator for more detail or make site inspection). SLOVENIA Yes FINLAND Yes PORTUGAL Yes, usually only after one inspection on the plant where those results are observed MALTA When such a breach is reported, the Authority requests further corrective action to rectify that breach. Moreover, should the operations result in exceedance of the emission limit values indicated in the permit, the operator is required to designate a mixing zone as stipulated in the requirements of the Water Framework Directive or to apply for derogation from achieving the required emission levels. There is a mechanism in the permits which requires the operators to declare the non compliance upon identification.   Thus the authority is not only notified upon the submission deadline of the quarterly or annual reporting episode. SPAIN (NAVARRA) Yes, but only if the self monitoring report comes from a UNE-EN 17025 laboratory SPAIN (GALICIA) Yes SPAIN (CASTILLA LA If there is a breach of the limit value in the sent report, a penalty procedure can be started. 425/451 MANCHA) SPAIN (CANTABRIA) When the inspection of the waste water is competence of the Community of Cantabria, the Self monitoring report provided by the operator can be used to give a penalty/fee only if it is done by an accredited laboratory; although the usual procedure would be to check it with measurements made by the administration. SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) Yes, obviously the knowledge noncompliance with the limit values can be used to give a penalty or fee. If the breach is declared within the self monitoring report, the noncompliance evaluation must be determined under Decreto 109/2015 criteria. In any case, the common mechanism to issue a penalty is associated within the inspections performed by the authority. The self monitoring report is usually used for increase or relax the authority control of the activity. NETHERLAND It is possible to use this data when this is specifically addressed in the permit of the operator. The authorities want to use these data also in other situations, but that is not possible yet in the Netherlands. This is subject of discussion (with the industry). ITALY A breach of the limit values declared within the Self monitoring report (provided by the operator to the competent authority), does not constitute itself an automatic evidence of the violation without a technical check that should be performed by the inspection authority. Therefore, a non compliance declared in the report of the operator is not enough for a sanction but it has to be technically verified by the inspection authority. POLAND Yes, decision imposing administrative punishment 426/451 QUESTION 8: ENFORCEMENT Based on what measurements, in case of non-compliance, does the authority issue a penalty? Conducted by authority? By operator? Other? TURKEY", "If the sample taken during inspection does not comply with the standards, inspection authority applies sanction. ROMANIA As previous mentioned the measurement can be carried out by operator, third parties or competent authority. If any of these measurements unravel beaching of permit conditions regarding ELVs than a penalty may be issued by the inspection authority.. CYPRUS Mainly when conducted by the authority but exceedances of ELV recorded in self- monitoring reports may also lead to penalty procedures. CZECH REPUBLIC Conducted by accredit laboratory. In case that operator have own accredited laboratory is possible used operator measurement for issuing penalty DENMARK See question 7 ESTONIA Measurement can be carried out by competent authority. In case of non compliance penalty may be issued by Inspection Authority. SLOVAK REPUBLIC Yes. Conducted by accredit laboratory. In case that operator have own accredited laboratory is possible used operator measurement for issuing penalty. SLOVENIA Inspection react on a base of a monitoring report prepared by an accredited laboratory. FINLAND In case of non-compliance the competent authority asks the police to conduct investigations, if the non-compliance is because of a crime. If the investigations show to a crime, the police hands over the case to the public prosecutor. If the case goes to the court, the competent authority is called to the court as a witness. The competent authority itself can issue no penalties. PORTUGAL The penalty is issued by the inspection authority only after one inspection on the plant, and it is based on evidences collected during the inspection namely the monitoring results performed by the operators. MALTA The Authority issues a penalty based on the type, gravity and duration of a non compliance with permit condition. This also depends on whether the operator rectifies such a non compliance within the timeframes agreed upon with the authority. SPAIN (NAVARRA) Accredited laboratories (UNE-EN 17.025) and inspection organisms (UNE-EN 17.020) SPAIN (GALICIA) Mainly when conducted by the authority but exceedances of ELV recorded in self- monitoring reports may also lead to penalty procedures. SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) Yes, a penalty procedure can be started by the authority that has issued the permit. SPAIN (CANTABRIA) It is the competent authority who issues a penalty in case of non-compliance. SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) The authority may issue a penalty in noncompliance cases based in measurements conducted mainly by the authority and, to a lesser extent, by the operator and third-part. NETHERLAND Mostly on measurements conducted by the authority. Sometimes based on a message and/or measurements of the operator (see answer 7). Violation of rules can also be prosecuted by the Public Prosecution Service (`Openbaar Ministerie\u00b4/OM). Its field of work is criminal law. Some civil servants of the competent 427/451 authority are called special investigating officers (\u00b4buitengewoon opsporingsambtenaar\u00b4). They are managed directly by the Public Prosecution Service. The Public Prosecution Service and the courts together make up the judiciary. The Public Prosecution Service decides who has to appear before a court and on what charge. ITALY A penalty can be issued on the based on the results of the analysis performed by the competent authority; it can also be  issued on the basis of a negative result of a technical assessment following a breach of the limits detected in the annual report of the operator. POLAND Conducted by operator in accredited laboratory (own or external) QUESTION 9: ENFORCEMENT What is the type of punishment for exceeding the permissible conditions? Fine / decision / other TURKEY Just giving fine or fine with stopping the facility. ROMANIA In this case a penalty is issued and also the suspension of the permit is asked until the operator complies with the ELVs. If the operator doesn\u2019t comply within 6 months then the cancelation of the permit is asked by the inspection authority. The suspension and cancelation of the permit is issued by the decision of permitting authority. CYPRUS Out of the court fines can be imposed by the DoE inspectors up to 4000 Euros for every offence. Additionally when offences are taken to court, monetary fines can be imposed or/and the operator can go to jail according with the provisions of the Law. For very serious offences which include cases in which human health and the environment are seriously threatened, the Chief Inspector can ask the court to prohibit operation. CZECH REPUBLIC Most often are imposed fine, but is possible impose remediate measures and in case of serious non-compliance is possible impose restriction operation or closing down part or whole installation.", "DENMARK See question 7 ESTONIA Fine and administrative procedure and injunction SLOVAK REPUBLIC First, remedial measures are imposed and, in the event of a serious breach, non- compliance may impose a fine, limit operation or shut down operations. SLOVENIA Both a fine and a decision. A decision is a curative measure to solve the problem. An administrative fine in restrictive measure and do not solve a problem but it has an educational effect. FINLAND Depends on the severity of the crime and if done on purpose or on pure negligence, and on the impact in the environment from fine to jail. PORTUGAL Usually is a fine. The operator may be ordered by the inspection authority to cease the discharge when the measurements are exceeding the conditions on the permit or in other situations like when is making an unauthorized discharge. MALTA When exceeding permissible conditions, the authority may decide to take Administrative action, legal Action or withdrawal of bank guarantees SPAIN (NAVARRA) Usually fine 428/451 Exceptionally partial or total closure SPAIN (GALICIA) Both fines and decisions. In our legal system administrative offences are classified in non- serious, serious and very serious offences. Penalties provided for on-serious and serious offences are in general fines and the obligation to restore the situation to its original state. For very serious offences, which include cases in which human health and the environment are seriously threatened, additionally a decision to prohibit operation can be the result. SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) The sanction can be a fine or the withdrawal of the permit in the more important cases. It can also include criminal liability and in this case the competent authority is the Criminal Court. SPAIN (CANTABRIA) Fine and/or decision. SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) Usually the type of punishment for exceeding the permissible conditions is to impose a fine. Only in cases where there is an imminent threat of damage to the environment, authority may take decisions, like activity clausure, against the operator. In any case, that\u2019s regulated in wastewater and environmental quality laws. NETHERLAND Administrative sanctions are: Official warning Order of penalty payment in a cease and desist letter (`Last onder dwangsom\u00b4) Administrative enforcement Withdrawal permit ITALY According to the non compliance the penalty can be an administrative fine or follow a penal path. Furthermore, Competent Authority sets a deadline within which the operator has to comply again with the permit. The further step (whether the operator does not restore the compliance situation or in case of a second breach) is the closure of the plant and the withdrawal of the permit. POLAND Decision imposing administrative punishment (=Q7) 429/451 QUESTION 10: ENFORCEMENT Who imposes a penalty? (Licensing authority / inspection body / court / other) TURKEY Inspection body ROMANIA The penalty is imposed by the inspection authority (National Environmental Guard and inspection bodies of \u201eRomanian Waters\u201d National Administration). The operator may to submit a complaint against penalty report to the competent court within 30 days after the penalty report is issued or communicated. The court may decide to maintain the penalty, to reduce the level of penalty, to replace the penalty with a warning or even to cancel the penalty report. CYPRUS The Inspectors of the DoE can impose out of the court fines. Additionally when offences are driven to court, the court can imposes monetary fines or/and can send the operator to jail according with the provisions of the Law. CZECH REPUBLIC Inspection authority, and is possible impose fine by Permit authority DENMARK See question 7 ESTONIA Inspection Authority. Criminal cases - court SLOVAK REPUBLIC Inspection authority. The court may change the decision to inspect the fine. SLOVENIA Inspector FINLAND Court PORTUGAL Inspection body or the water permitting authority. MALTA The inspection body and the licensing (permitting) body form part of the same authority. In cases referred for court action, the court imposes penalties as prescribed in the law. SPAIN (NAVARRA) Licensing authority (local or regional government); inspection body only proposes to start the penalty procedure Court only if there is exceptionally serious effects or a legal resource SPAIN (GALICIA) Depending of the classification of the offences (non-serious, serious and very serious), penalties are imposed by officials at different levels of the Regional Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning. The penalties corresponding to very serious offences are imposed either by the Regional Ministry or by the Government.", "Inquiries leading to the penalties are carried out by lawyers (civil servants) of the Legal Services of the Regional Government The Permitting Service (IPPC Service) and the Inspection Service participate in the procedure providing all the information available: inspection minutes and reports, self- monitoring reports etc SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) The inspection body proposes the start of the civil sanctions and the procedure is analyzed by the Juridical Service. It could in some cases arrive to the Legal Authority. SPAIN (CANTABRIA) The penalty is imposed by the Authority with competence in the place where the waste water is discharged. SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) Usually the penalties are impose by the license authority, who is assisted by the inspection 430/451 authority. NETHERLAND The inspection body is competent for administrative sanctions. Criminal prosecution is done by Public Prosecution Service. ITALY The inspection authority assesses the non compliances and report to the Competent Authority suggesting the measures to be taken; the last one imposes the penalty. POLAND Inspecting body QUESTION 11: LAB ANALYSIS Should sampling and lab analysis have to be performed by an accredited entity? In the case of sampling or analysis without accreditation, are measurements considered invalid? TURKEY Yes should be. The facility can do analyses by itself for its own check. In the case of sampling or analysis without accreditation, the measurements are considered invalid. ROMANIA At least once a year the operator has to perform the self-monitoring through an accredited laboratory. If this requirement is not fulfilled then a breaching of the permit condition is took into consideration. CYPRUS The accredited entity must be accredited for sample collection (which includes planning of sampling) and for analysing each of the parameters included in the discharge conditions. If both accreditations (accreditation for sampling and accreditation for analysing samples in laboratory) cannot be proofed, the measurements are not considered invalid but can be easily challenged in court procedures.   In these cases, the results regarding the parameters for which the entity lacks accreditation are not considered invalid but again can be challenged in court procedures. CZECH REPUBLIC Sampling and lab analysis have to be perform by an accredited entity. DENMARK Usually sampling and analysis should be accredited but in special cases the company can do it themselves. The measurements are considered invalid. ESTONIA Sampling and lab analysis should be accredited. SLOVAK REPUBLIC Sampling and laboratory analysis have to be perform by an accredited entity. SLOVENIA Yes \u2013 accredited laboratory. FINLAND Sampling and lab analysis should be accredited. PORTUGAL Sampling can be done without accreditation, and the results are considered valid. The analysis procedure is determined by law and that procedure is accredited by a national accreditation organism. In case of divergence in wastewater analysis performed by the operator and the inspection the result obtained from the analysis carried out by the National environmental lab serve as proof. MALTA Lab analysis has to be usually carried out at a laboratory accredited to at least EN ISO 17025:2005/Corr 1:2006 and preferably for each and every test. In case analysis is to be carried out without accreditation, this would be subject to a specific approval by the Authority upon submission of further details on the proposed analytical methods and 431/451 laboratory. SPAIN (NAVARRA) Yes, not accredited entities or laboratories are not considered as acceptable It depends of the case, but sampling by accredited entities are strongly preferred. In court would be unacceptable SPAIN (GALICIA) Definitely yes. The accredited entity must be accredited for sample collection (which includes planning of sampling) and for analysing each of the parameters included in the discharge conditions. The accreditation is issued by the Entidad Nacional de Acreditaci\u00f3n (ENAC) which is the agency entitled by the government to operate in Spain as the only National Accreditation Body, pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 765/2008 that regulates the functioning of accreditation in Europe. If both accreditations (accreditation for sampling and accreditation for analysing samples in laboratory) cannot be proofed, the measurements are considered invalid. If may happen that the entity is accredited for analysing some parameters and not others. In these cases, the results regarding the parameters for which the entity lacks accreditation are considered invalid and the operator is requested to repeat the sampling and analysis for those parameters. Additionally all staff participating in the sampling and analysing must be internally qualified by the accredited entity. Qualification procedures are checked by ENAC. SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) Yes, it can be done by an accredited entity. SPAIN (CANTABRIA)", "The sampling and lab analysis have to be performed by an accredited entity if not they are considered invalid. SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) The response is affirmative for both questions. Only if the sampling and lab analysis is performed by operator (self monitoring) can be out of accreditation. NETHERLAND Yes, the laboratory should have an accreditation. ITALY Sampling and lab analysis have to be performed, on behalf of the operator, by an accredited entity. In the case of sampling or analysis without accreditation, measurements are considered invalid. POLAND Yes, only accredited entity. In the case of sampling without accreditation or analysis without accreditation, measurements are considered invalid. For measurements performed in a non-accredited laboratory, inspecting body will impose administrative punishment by way of a decision. 432/451 QUESTION 12: LAB ANALYSIS Does the inspection authority perform sampling and analysis on its own? TURKEY In some special cases, the laboratory department and inspection department of Ministry can do inspection together. In this cases laboratory department takes samples, do the analysis and send to results to inspection department. ROMANIA The National Environmental Guard doesn\u2019t but the \u201eRomanian Waters\u201d National Administration does. CYPRUS The Inspection authority performs only sampling. The inspection authority (Department of Environment) is supported by the State General Laboratory, a public accredited laboratory. DoE takes samples during routine inspections under the controlling of the implementation of either the Waste Discharge Permits or Industrial Emissions Permits and carry them to SGL for analytical measurements. CZECH REPUBLIC Perform sampling yes (but can not use those measurement in administrative procedure), perform analysis no, have to ask accredited lab. DENMARK Usually not on waste water from industries. ESTONIA Yes (if there were not violation) SLOVAK REPUBLIC No, the inspection authority must require an accredited body to collect and analyze it. SLOVENIA No. But sometimes hire an accredited laboratory. FINLAND On surface water quality yes, not on waste water discharge. PORTUGAL Only sampling. Analysis are being done on accredited public labs. MALTA The Authority does not usually perform sampling and analysis on its own but it requires operators to conduct such measurements at their own expense as directed by the Authority. The authority is however empowered to take all the necessary samples and carry out sampling  tests as it deems necessary SPAIN (NAVARRA) Yes, sampling is performed by public accredited organism  (UNE-EN 17.020); samples are sent to accredited laboratory (UNE-EN 17.025) SPAIN (GALICIA) Yes, but supported by the Environmental Laboratory of Galicia (LMAG in its Spanish and Galician acronym) both for sample collection and analysis. Environmental Inspectors are qualified for water sample collection SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) No, they are performed by authorized inspection entities. SPAIN (CANTABRIA) When the inspection of the waste water is competence of the Community of Cantabria, there are sources to perform sampling and analysis on its own. SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) Yes, the inspection authority has its own accredited entity for sampling and lab analysis. NETHERLAND The inspection authorities perfom sampling on their  own. Most of the analysis is done by a central accredited laboratory. Some specific parameters are analysed by other, commercial, accredited laboratories. ITALY Yes. Regional environmental inspection agencies have their own laboratories. 433/451 POLAND Yes, if authority believes that the measurements submitted by the subject are doubtful or if authority wants to verify the measurements of the operator but inspection authorities own measurements can not be the basis for the legal imposition of the penalty. They may be the reason for not recognizing the results of the operator and only considering measurements of operator not valid may impose a penalty. QUESTION 13: LAB ANALYSIS Which compliance criteria is adopted to the measure and its uncertainty in relation to the limit? TURKEY Discharged wastewater quality limits are defined in Bylaw for each industrial sector. A communique defines also sampling procedure and analyzing methods ROMANIA Don\u2019t know. CYPRUS Uncertainty is taken into account to decide whether the limit is exceeded or not. CZECH REPUBLIC The results of accredited lab is accepted and compared with emission limit DENMARK That is set in the permit. The state has some guidelines. ESTONIA It is set in the permit SLOVAK REPUBLIC The results of accredited laboratory are accepted and compared with emission limit. SLOVENIA --- FINLAND That is set in the permit. PORTUGAL The compliance criteria are stablished in the permit. The uncertainty is taken in account to check on the compliance during inspection. MALTA The Authority currently obliges operators to abide by the monitoring specifications and minimum performance criteria delineated in 2009/90/EC.", "SPAIN (NAVARRA) Value + uncertainity must be lower than limit SPAIN (GALICIA) Uncertainty must be taken into account to decide whether the limit is exceeded or not. SPAIN (CASTILLA LA MANCHA) The used criteria is the uncertainty of the measurement device. SPAIN (CANTABRIA) When the inspection of the waste water is competence of the Community of Cantabria, the measurement uncertainty is considered to check the compliance with the limit SPAIN (ANDALUCIA) If the lab value is IN the uncertainly interval, it's consider non evaluable; if it's UNDER the uncertainly interval, it's consider compliance with the limit value; and if it's ABOVE the uncertainly interval, it's consider non-compliance with the limit value. NETHERLAND In the Netherlands there are two kinds of emission limit values: theoretical and empirical (based on a dataset) with different uncertainty in relation to the limit. Rounding of figures is also taken into account. ITALY A national guideline has been issued (http://www.isprambiente.gov.it/it/pubblicazioni/pubblicazioni-del-sistema- agenziale/l2019analisi-di-conformita-con-i-valori-limite-di) to manage with uncertainties in 434/451 the comparison with threshold limits. POLAND Uncertainty of measurement is an expanded uncertainty calculated using an expansion factor of k = 2, which corresponds to a confidence level of approximately 95%. 435/451 Annex XIII Joint Inspections: Proposal of Scheme and Contents OBJECTIVE Improve the inspections and surveillance applying to EU legislation The Commission considers that improvements may be appropriate by Assessing options for complementing national inspections and surveillance in a targeted way at EU level, including26 \u2022 More systematic use of peer-review inspections, drawing on existing initiatives of IMPEL (the network of national inspectors) \u2022 improve the efficiency and quality of IED inspection programmes; \u2022 sharing experiences and best practices; \u2022 addressing common problems and challenges; \u2022 documenting different tools, practices, findings and other resources; \u2022 awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of IED inspection programmes.

If more participants, there should be more inspection teams. \u2022 Visiting inspectors should be able to speak English. \u2022 The inspection will be done in English so the company where the inspection will take place should be preferably a multinational one. If this is not possible the host company will arrange for a translator of the host language to English. Be aware that working with translators cost more time because of translation so the focus area should be limited or the inspection time increased. PROCEDURE T = joint inspection date See also attachment with schematic process T-2 months \u2022 The host country identifies a company that is willing to receive the international inspection team. \u2022 The company should not be to big and complicated. T-2 weeks The host country sends (at least): \u2022 An agenda with the main items to be inspected. \u2022 A summary of the findings of the last inspection. \u2022 An overview of documents the host will use for preparation of the \u2022 Inspection. The host country sends (optional, if available): \u2022 If available in English also info on the company (homepage) \u2022 the most important rules that apply \u2022 a summary of the relevant Bref. \u2022 a brief explanation of their system (IRI annex a can be used for this).", "Special notices on the Agenda 437/451 \u2022 Identify time for the practical issues concerning the `visiting' part. \u2022 It is important to limit the inspection subjects/focus so that there is enough time to ask questions. \u2022 Presentation from the company should be limited in time and should be focussed on the environmental and safety issues. A typical agenda could consist of the following items and order. \u2022 Day 1 afternoon of site: Presentation of host inspector. Short presentation of the facility to visit. Show the documents and tools used for preparation as mentioned at the preparing teleconference. \u2022 Day 2 morning on site: Site visit starting with introduction team and short presentation by company. Followed by the actual inspections and close out to the company \u2022 Day 2 afternoon on or of site: participants discus the major findings and how they would report it an deal with it. After that the visiting inspectors will prepare a presentation to the plenary meeting with the major findings, strong and weak points and opportunities of improving. \u2022 Day 2 joint diner inspection team \u2022 Day 3 morning: compare procedures and checklists used between visiting and host country. Summarize the major differences and put in a short presentation.. \u2022 Day 3 or 4: presentation of major findings and procedural differences to the plenary meeting T-1 week The host country organises a two hour telephone conference with the visiting inspectors with a clear agenda with decision points. Agenda items for telephone conference. \u2022 Practical issues (transport, time, safety clothing/shoes/other protection gear etc) \u2022 Addition info concerning the agenda during the joint visit \u2022 An overview of the company and the major risks and issues \u2022 The subject to inspect at the joint inspection \u2022 In case of more than one inspection group the division of inspection subjects \u2022 The regulations that will be inspected and methods that will be used \u2022 If time allows. The host country will share their procedure, explanations of usual data bases, documents, and information about the site visit. Otherwise this item will be explained during Day 1 at the preparing meeting just before the joint inspection. T-1 week 438/451 The visiting inspectors prepare an overview for the procedures and checklists they use for this type of inspection. The host inspector drafts a presentation for the plenary meeting with what has been done during the joint inspection. During The JISG Meeting. \u2022 The roles should be clear. The host company executes the inspections and visiting inspectors observe and ask questions. It is the task of the host to identify and report possible non compliances. \u2022 If non compliances are discovered, the host will deal with this separately with the company. After the JISG Meeting: \u2022 All inspectors will make a short report with their major findings of the inspection and will compare this with each other. \u2022 The major findings will be put in the already prepared presentation by the host inspector. \u2022 A first draft of the presentation for next day will be set up.   The visiting inspectors fill in the lessons learned form (see attachment). On first day of meeting IED workshop \u2022 Time should be claimed for an additional learning opportunity for the visiting inspectors and host. They will compare their procedures. What\u2019s extra and what\u2019s less. \u2022 The visiting inspectors will share their major findings with the host inspector on the methods and procedure used and will discuss possible improvements. \u2022 The visiting and host inspectors finalise the presentation to the meeting. \u2022 After this meeting one of the JSG inspection team will present the results from the JS.

Put in strategy during visit.; F.I. have or plan a separate meeting apart from the join team with the company. \u2022 Not enough discussion time after the joint inspections and or reporting time; Put this part in the program. When focused there should be additional time should be available for this program item 447/451 When, where and who Type of industry Subject Lessons Milano, Italy, march 2017 Fabio Colonna (IT) Robert Gross (AT) Dubravka Pajkin Tuckar (HR) Jaakko Vesivalo (FL) malgorsata budzynska (PL) Cyril Burda (SK) Energy power plant A2A S.p. A. Cassano d\u2019adda Content \u2022 Inspector and company sign a document with all findings during the inspection. So there is less uncertainty about what has been found. \u2022 Online information from Cems on status (start up, normal operation) and emission to air and measurements on emission to water is a useful inspection tool. Company knows the authorities can see their performance and will report more earlier in case of problems with emissions. Possible downside is that responsibility shifts from company to authority and it also costs time to keep track of. Joint inspection procedural \u2022 Teleconference maybe left out in case of clear agenda and documentation from host. But it is also a good reminder to visiting inspectors to set their mind on the inspection to come and preparation at home. . \u2022 Teleconference with video and chat function like webex can be a powerful tool to communicate in distance. \u2022 Improve learning opportunity by sharing procedures and checklists used for this type of inspection between each other. \u2022 More time needed do discuss these procedures and draw conclusions. Claim some time during plenary meeting to do so. 448/451 When, where and who Type of industry Subject Lessons Slovenia, Ljubljana, 21th of June 2017 Dubravka Pajkin Tuckar, Croatia Fabio Colonna, Italy Ruth Ciarlo`, Malta Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Mallada Viana; Spain Darja Stani\u010d- Racman, Slovenia Vladimir Kaiser, Slovenia Aluminium Foundry air emissions and noise pollution \u2022 The fact that a pre-visit meeting is held with the operator allows the operator to describe what measures have been installed and any future plans that are envisaged for the company to continue to improve the company\u2019s profile and reduce emissions. \u2022 Allowed inspectors to visit a modern plant. An example of best practices and new technology (covered storage of clean aluminum scrap, low dust inside the cast house etc.) \u2022 No reason to be suspicious in view of good general housekeeping. \u2022", "It was good practice by the operator to communicate beforehand with the competent authority regarding any equipment that is envisaged to be introduced. An updated environmental permit is issued prior to the purchase of such equipment to make sure that all equipment purchased is authorized by the competent authority and according to environmental permit conditions. \u2022 It was good to focus the inspection on one or two items only rather than inspecting all items in the permit since this will allow for a shorter and more focused visit for such large industries. \u2022 It was also good practice that the inspection minutes were written on site in front of the operator focused on the main findings of the inspection. \u2022 Inspection preparation \u2013 preparatory meeting important prior to inspection. Operator started new production company in Croatia. It was good that the inspection was held at the sister company in Slovenia and see environmental permit, which allows Croatia to compare environmental permits, and operations of this company. \u2022 Companies benchmark each other very quickly, more quickly than inspection officers. Cooperation between authorities is very slow and does not allow to quick response by the competent authority. 449/451 When, where and who Type of industry Subject Lessons \u2022 The fact that the report is written on site, allows for less bureaucracy. \u2022 The writing of reports is different in some countries, where officers do not write a report on site during the inspection as in the case of Slovenia, but the report is written after the inspection. This will allow officers to cross check inspection points with photos taken to assure that all observations made are listed and correct. Also officers double check with permit conditions and improvement program check list which allows for a full report. The report is then sent to the operator including any actions with deadlines that might be given to the operator. The operator than replies back with his answers to the report. \u2022 Prior to the inspection an inspection plan is prepared so as to remind the inspector about the points that need to be checked during the inspection. Portugal, Lisbon, general remarks \u2022 When there will be more inspections at the same time during future IED meetings, it is important that the meeting agenda accommodates preparation of the report and the presentation. So there will be maximal learning opportunity for the teams, the meeting and the Impel community! No standard rules, only specific permits for IED installations. \u2022 Last development going from several permits on specific themes like waste, air etc. now one integrated permit. \u2022 All inspections are unannounced. Also the ones at the complex companies. \u2022 Typically an integrated inspections within one working day with, depending on the complexity of the company,  a team of several colleagues. \u2022 Recently going from analog to digital reporting in a new recently developed system. 450/451 When, where and who Type of industry Subject Lessons Portugal, Lisbon, 27th of September 2017 Roberto Valadares, Rui Cabrita (PT, host), Fabio Colonna (IT) and Malgorzata Budzynska (P). Chemical Factory (cat. 4.1 h); water discharges, air emissions water consumptions and some other aspects like legionella and energy use \u2022 Allowed inspectors to visit a big plant. \u2022 Focus on many items: an occasion to learn items generally not dealt with. \u2022 According the Portuguese procedures operators has to send data required by the inspectors during the site visit; the most of work will be in the office after operator sends data \u2022 Accurate preparation \u2013 preparatory meeting important prior to inspection. \u2022 Good atmosphere during the inspection: good cooperation of the operators \u2022 Companies benchmark each other very quickly, more quickly than inspection officers.

There are pro\u2019s and con\u2019s with both. Non-announced inspections often create stress to operator and difficulties in collecting relevant information. It does not necessary give more information about non compliances. Obviously you get to see more \u201cevery day\u201d operation/ordinary housekeeping if you come non-announced. \u2022 Most of the joint learning is done during discussions before and after the specific inspection. \u2022 Know-how, installation understanding and knowledge about relevant BAT are important prerequisites for focusing on key environmental issues (KEI) and environmental critical points (ECP). \u2022 The environmental permit of an installation is the most important tool for inspection. \u2022 A relevant permit will consider the key environmental issues (KEI) and environmental critical points (ECP) for an installation in order to facilitate an efficient inspection."]}

That earlier study showed that improving the environmental performance of existing LCPs by applying best available techniques potentially could have reduced NO X emissions by up to 59 %, and SO 2 emissions by as much as 80 % in the year 2004. These earlier emission reduction estimates were based on data from 450 electricity-generating LCPs in the then EU-25 that had been included in the now-discontinued European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER).", "Since 2004, data reported by Member States shows that emissions of NO X , SO 2 and dust from all LCPs have fallen. More specifically, between 2004 and 2009, EU-27 total emissions of NO X from the sector decreased by 30 %, of SO 2 by 53 % and of dust by 58 % (AMEC, 2012). It is important to note that not all this reduction has occurred solely due to a further implementation of best available techniques (BAT), but rather by a combination of factors also including, for example, the economic recession and its subsequent impactson energy demand,increased uptake of renewable energy and the closure of certain power plants. This report presents results from an updated assessment of the hypothetical emission reduction potential of NO X , SO 2 and dust from European LCPs for the year 2009. This new assessment is based upon improved statistics increasing the accuracy of the analysis compared to the earlier report, notably the latest available emission and fuel-use data from 2009 reported by Member States under the Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC) (LCPD; EU, 2001). The European Commission has proposed an enhanced focus on implementation in the context of the 7th EnvironmentAction Programme. Filling gaps in the knowledge base in order to optimise policy responses will become increasingly important in the face of the challenges and opportunities to enhance cross-cutting policy coherence. Compared with the existing situation, emissions from LCPs are expected to further decrease in the future with the implementation of the Industrial Emission Directive (2010/75/EU) (IED; EU, 2010) and its more stringent emission limit values (ELVs) that are to be met by 2016 for existing plants. The publication of the latest 2009 LCPD dataset has therefore provided an opportunity to assess the magnitude of the difference between actual emissions reported for that year and the level of emissions that would theoretically occur were the same set of plants to achieve emission levels corresponding with the IED ELVs. For comparative purposes, the report also presents a comparison of the reported 2009 emissions with the LCPD ELVs and the lower BAT associated emission levels (BATAELs) \u0160 the latter to serve as a proxy for a potential 'maximum feasible' emission reduction. The LCP pollutants NO X and SO 2 are major contributors to acid deposition, leading to soil and freshwater acidification, which damages plants and aquatic habitats and can corrode building materials. Both pollutants also contribute to the formation of secondaryparticulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere following their release, while NO X also react with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight to form ground-level ozone (O 3 ). At present, primary and secondary PM and O 3 are Europe's most problematic pollutants in terms of harm to human health (EEA, 2012a). NO X , SO 2 and dust adversely affect local air quality, but also contribute to transboundary pollution causing harm to health and environment even at distant locations. Approach This report presents an estimation of the theoretical emission reduction potential from Europe's largest thermal power plants and compares the 2009 emissions data reported under the LCPD (EEA, 2012b) with the future applicable ELVs as defined in the IED, excluding all exempted circumstances. Executive summary 6 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union A comparison of the reported 2009 emissions with the LCPD ELVs and the BREF lowerAELs is also provided. The 2009 LCPD dataset used is the most recent emissions dataset available for LCPs, and it also contains information on the thermal capacity of each facility, its fuel types and fuel use. Of the 3 310 plants in the dataset, 1 595 (48 %) met the criteria for further analysis by being identifiable as an Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) or Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant and being operational. Of these 1 595 plants, most (1 592) reported NO X emissions, 1 119 reported SO 2 and 1 173 reported dust. The remaining 1 715 plants were not considered in the scope of this report. The LCPD covers other types of industrial combustion plants beyond ESI and CHP plants such as refineries, and iron and Box ES.1 Legislative context Large combustion plants are defined in the EU LCP Directive (2001/80/EC) as those plants having a rated thermal input of 50 MW or greater. Emissions of three pollutants (SO 2 , NO X and dust) are regulated by the directive.", "According to the directive's Annex VIII(B), Member States must establish a plant-by-plant inventory of the total annual SO 2 , NO X and dust emissions and total annual energy input by fuel type (i.e. biomass, other solid fuels, liquid fuels, natural gas or other gases). A summary of this information must be reported to the Commission every three years; the latest available data covers 2007\u01522009. In addition, the Commission has asked for the plant-by-plant data to be made available. Large combustion plants are also regulated under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive (consolidated version: EU, 2008) which may lead to stricter and/or additional obligations on the plants than those required under the LCPD itself. In particular, the IPPC Directive requires installations operating activities within its scope to apply the best available techniques (BAT), i.e. the most effective and advanced stage of operations considered technically andeconomically viableforthesectorforcontrolling andreducingpollution. Theemissionlimit valuesinthe permits have to be based on BAT, taking into account local considerations. In order to describe and define the BAT at the EU level, the European Commission develops and adopts the BAT reference documents (BREF), which serve as guidance for competent authorities when defining permit conditions. In 2006 the European Commission adopted the large combustion plant BREF (LCP BREF) which describes the BAT as well as the range of emission levels achievable by applying BAT \u0160 the so-called Associated Emission Levels (AEL) with the lower end (lower BAT-AEL) being the most stringent and the upper end the least stringent. The IPPC Directive and the LCPD were superseded by the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) (2010/75/EU) which entered into force on 6 January 2011 and which had to be transposed into national legislation by 7 January 2013. The IED regulates the emissions from LCPs by requiring the application of BAT and the BAT-AELs, set out in BAT conclusions which have a legal effect, as well as by setting mandatory 'minimum' emission limit values (ELVs) for SO 2 , NO X and dust. These limit values will apply for existing combustion plants from 2016 onward, with some longer transitional periods for particular groups of plants. The European Commission is presently revising the LCP BREF, with the aim of establishing BAT conclusions, to be adopted in the course of 2014. This report does not assess the compliance of individual plants or Member States under these directives. Neither does it evaluate the implementation of the IPPC, LCPD or IED through national regulations. steel facilities. Such facilities were not included in the study. Further, 'opt-out' plants which have elected to manage their emissions via other permissible LCPD methods such as closing down after a set period were excluded, as were those where there was insufficient information to allow their classification. The 2009 LCP dataset was supplemented by data from the Platts European Energy Power Plants (EEPP) dataset (Platts, 2011) that contains technical information on most electric power plants in Europe. The Platts dataset was used to distinguish between ESI and CHP plants when sector code information was not reported in the LCP dataset, and also to improve the level of detail concerning use of 'other solid fuels' and 'biomass' at Member State level. Executive summary 7 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union Four main steps were performed in the assessment: i. determination of the thermal capacity, and fuel use per fuel type at each plant; ii. estimation of flue gas volumes; iii. calculation of the theoretical NO X , SO 2 and dust emissions for three cases: \u0152 assuming that all plants have emissions not exceeding the LCPD ELVs; \u0152 assuming that all plants have emissions not exceeding the IED ELVs; \u0152 assuming that all plants have emissions not exceeding the BREF lowerAELs; iv. comparison of the pollutant emissions calculated for each of the three cases aggregated by Member State with the reported emissions for the year 2009. The robustness of the updated assessment compared to the earlier EEA 2008 report is notably improved in two main respects: \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 (1 595) is greater than the number (450) upon which the findings of the earlier report were based, which strengthens the applicability of the analysis; \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 used in this study.", "Such data was not available when the previous reporting was performed, which meant a number of assumptions had to be made concerning the fuel type and fuel consumption at the individual plant level. The accuracy of results in the current study is therefore significantly improved. It is important to note the theoretical nature of this study. It assumes the same application of the IED ELVs (and the LCPD ELVs and the BREF lowerAELs) across all plants covered, and does not consider derogations or the detailed flexibilities (temporary and permanent) that are included in the scope of the IED. For example, no differentiation was made for ESI and CHP plants addressed in National Emission Reduction Plans (NERPs) or under Member StateAccession Treaty derogations. Thus, the study does not provide a detailed modelling of IED implementation. The report also does not take into account any changes that may have occurred since 2009 \u0160 for example, reduced industrial activity because of the economic recession, plant closures, replacement of old plants with newer, more efficient and cleaner technologies, changes in fuel mixes, operational/management changes and evolution of abatement equipment. Results and key findings A small number of large-scale coal plants and plants co-combusting coal with other fuels dominate the reported emissions for all three pollutants. Just 50 plants (i.e. 3 % of the 1 595 plants addressed in this report) contribute 50 % of NO X emissions, with 454 (28 %) responsible for 90 % of emissions. The situation is more striking for SO 2 with only 20 plants (1 %) responsible for 50 % of total emissions and 165 (10 %) contributing 90 %. For dust, just 21 plants (1 %) contribute 50 % and 175 (11 %) contribute 90 % of the total reported emissions. In general, a good correlation is noted at the Member State level between the 2009 emissions reported under the LCPD for the electricity generation sector and those reported under the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) ( 1 ), although some potential errors in official reporting were identified and are described. Unfortunately, a detailed plant-by-plant comparison is not possible because there is no direct link established between the two datasets ( 2 ). The results of the present study clearly indicate that EU-27 emissions of the air pollutants NO X , SO 2 and dust from the selected LCPs could potentially be significantly lower if all plants operating in 2009 were to meet the ELVs set out in the IED (Table ES.1 and Figure ES.1). Specific findings of the report are listed below. \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 X emissions from LCPs considered in this study have the potential to be 36 % lower than in 2009 if all plants meet the IED ELVs and 69 % lower if plants achieve the more stringent BATAEL. For SO 2 , the potential emission reductions are 66 % and 94 %, respectively, and 64 % and 79 %, respectively, for dust. \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 from just a relatively few very large coal and coal co-combustion plants. \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 from LCPs below the level of the IED emission limits that have to be achieved by 2016. However, in some of the newer Member States, emissions are still significantly above the IED levels. ( 1 ) European Pollu tant Release and Transfer Register (http://prtr.ec.europa.eu/). ( 2 ) Under future reporting by Member States concerning their implementation of the IED, establishing such a link should be facilitated. Executive summary 8 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 reported 2009 emissions are consistent with, or below, the LCPD ELVs. There are a number of derogations (exemptions) granted under the LCPD that are not taken into account in this analysis, such a plants granted longer transitional periods and/or which rely on derogations such as controls on desulphurisation rates being implemented in place of attaining ELVs. It is clear that meeting the ELVs of the IED would reduce emissions of SO 2 and dust from these LCPs by more than 60 % compared to 2009 emission levels. Such reduction of emissions would obviously deliver substantial benefits in terms of improvements to human health and the environment.", "A recent assessment from the EEA showed that the estimated damage costs to health and the environment caused by air pollution from the energy-generating sector (excluding carbon dioxide (CO 2 )) in 2009 was EUR 26\u015271 billion (EEA, 2011).An assessment of the costs to industry and consumers to achieve such lower emissions is beyond the scope of this report. In the following figures comparisons are made by Member State between reported emissions for 2009 and the theoretical application of ELVs for NO X (Figure ES.2), SO 2 (Figure ES.3) and dust (Figure ES.4). Table ES.1 Gap between  2009 emissions and emissions based on the LCP emission limits, the IED emission limits, and the lower BAT AELs, by pollutant for the 1 595 plants assessed in this report (*) Reported emissions 2009 Potential emissions based on LCPD ELVs Potential emissions based on IED ELVs Potential emissions based on lower BAT AELs Emissions (kt) Emissions (kt) % reduction compared to 2009 emissions Emissions (kt) % reduction comparedto2009 emissions Emissions (kt) % reduction comparedto2009 emissions NO X 1 138 1 077 \u0152 5 % 728 \u0152 36 % 358 \u0152 69 % SO 2 1 662 876 \u0152 47 % 572 \u0152 66 % 98 \u0152 94 % Dust 77.6 55.1 \u0152 29 % 28.2 \u0152 64 % 16.4 \u0152 79 % Note: * Care is needed when interpreting the values in Table ES.1 as there are uncertainties inherent in the estimation of the derogations have not been taken into account. NO X Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom report the highest 2009 NO X emissions from LCPs (Figure ES.2). However, emissions from Germany are already largely consistent with the IED ELVs, while some scope exists to reduce emissions further to the levels of the lower BATAELs values. Greece, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom have the largest absolute differences in terms of tonnes of NO X from 2009 emissions to the IED ELVs. SO 2 Bulgaria, Greece, Poland and Romania have the highest reported 2009 SO 2 emissions of the EU-27 Member States (Figure ES.3), and together account for the largest difference between 2009 emission levels and the IED ELVs. In particular, Bulgaria and Romania together, contribute almost 40 % to the total SO 2 emissions for the EU-27 and, similarly, account for a large fraction of the EU-27 SO 2 emissions that in 2009 lay above the IED ELVs. Dust The same four Member States (i.e. Bulgaria, Greece, Poland and Romania) also reported the highest 2009 dust emissions, significantly above emission levels that would be consistent with the IED ELVs (Figure ES.4).

Recognising the uncertainty inherent in the assessment, a sensitivity analysis was performed concerning the influence of the fuel calorific values used to estimate the flue gas volumes and, hence, ultimately the emissions. The analysis showed that the highest impact on the certainty of the study results is related to lignite and its wide range of possible calorific values. In order to raise the overall certainty for future assessments and to assist in the verification of plant emissions, it would be beneficial if plant-specific information on the calorific value of fuels used were made publicly available.

The pollutants NO X and SO 2 are major contributors to acid deposition, leading to soil and freshwater acidification, which damages plants and aquatic habitats, and can corrode building materials.", "Both pollutants also contribute to the formation of secondary PM in the atmosphere following their release, while NO X also react with VOCs in the presence of sunlight to form ground - level O 3 .At present, primary and secondary PM and O 3 are Europe's most problematic pollutants in terms of harm to human health (EEA, 2012b). NO X , SO 2 and dust adversely affect local air quality, but also contribute to transboundary pollution causing harm to health and environment even at distant locations. The introduction of air pollution legislation over the past decades and the subsequent implementation of emission prevention and abatement measures in the power plant sector has led to a significant reduction in the level of emissions from LCPs. Since 2004, data reported by Member States shows that emissions of NO X , SO 2 and dust from plants covered by the LCP Directive have fallen significantly. More specifically, between 2004 and 2009, EU-27 emissions of NO X from the sector decreased by 30 %, of SO 2 by 53 % and of dust by 58 % (AMEC, 2012). However, despite the reductions in emissions that have occurred, the electricity and heat production sector still remains an important source of key air pollutants that contribute to poor air quality in Europe (EEA, 2012a). 1.1.1 EU legislation concerning large combustion plants The LCPD (2001/80/EC) covers combustion plants with a rated thermal input equal to or exceeding 50 MW which are operated for power and/or heat generation purposes as well as certain industrial plants. It entered into force on 27 November 2001. The directive sets specific ELVs for the pollutants SO 2 , NO X and dust (PM). The directive distinguishes between new plants (licensed after 1 July 1987), which had to meet the LCPD ELVs immediately, and existing plants (licensed before 1 July 1987), which could choose, by 1 January 2008, to: \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 (NERP), which sets an annual maximum level of emissions for the plants covered by it. A NERP has been implemented by 8 Member States ( 3 ) for part or all of their existing LCPs. In addition, existing plants can be exempted from compliance with the emission limits and from inclusion in the NERP on condition that the operator undertook not to operate the plant for more than 20 000 hours between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015. In 2009, there were approximately 239 such plants, and these are referred to as 'opted out' plants. The IPPC Directive (originally 96/61/EC, but consolidated in 2008 as Directive 2008/1/EC) covers a number of industrial activities (including combustion plants with a rated thermal input exceeding 50 MW) and aims to reduce their overall environmental impact through a process of integrated permitting. Emission limit values set in those permits have to be based on best available techniques (BAT), taking into account certain local considerations. The interaction between the IPPC Directive and the LCPD is such that the latter sets ( 3 ) These Member States are CzechRepublic, France, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Introduction 14 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union minimum obligations which are not necessarily sufficient to comply with the IPPC Directive. The IPPC Directive and the LCPD are being replaced by the IED (2010/75/EU) is a recast of seven existing directives. The IED entered into force on 6 January 2011 and had to be transposed into national legislation by Member States by 7 January 2013. The IED aims to achieve further benefits to the environment and human health by reducing harmful industrial emissions through the better application of BAT.Amongst the key changes is a stricter definition of BAT, leaving less flexibility for competent authorities to set ELVs outside the BAT ranges. The IED also has tighter minimum ELVs for LCPs to be applied from 1 January 2016 for existing plants. There is also the possibility under the IED of using minimum desulphurisation rates or less strict ELVs in case of plants having a limited number of operating hours. These options are not considered for the purposes of the hypothetical assessment described in this report. 1.1.2 Best available techniqu es and emission limits The present LCP BREF was adopted in 2006 following an exchange of information between the European Commission, the Member States, industry and environmental NGOs (European Commission, 2006).", "The BAT associated emission levels (BAT-AELs) given in the BREF are expressed as a range of values taking into consideration factors such as the age of the plants, process management and the range of techniques considered to be BAT. The BAT-AELs range from the lower BAT (most stringent) to the upper BAT (least stringent). The BATAELs are expressed as flue gas pollutant concentrations. While not legally binding under the IPPC Directive, the BATAELs provide information on the best environmental performance associated with technically and economically viable techniques. A revision of the LCP BREF started in October 2011, a process which is expected to lead to new LCP BAT conclusions to be adopted under the IED in the course of 2014. These BAT conclusions will have a much more binding role under the IED than was previously the case under the IPPC Directive. 1.2 Objectives of thisreport Emissions from existing LCPs are expected to decrease in the future with the implementation of the IED and its more stringent ELVs that are to be met by 2016. The publication of the latest 2009 LCPD dataset provided an opportunity to assess the difference between actual emissions reported for that year and the level of emissions that would hypothetically occur were all LCPs to achieve the default IED ELVs. The report also presents a comparison of the reported 2009 emissions with the LCPD ELVs and the BREF lowerAELs. It is important to note the theoretical nature of this study. It assumes the same application of the IED ELVs (and the LCPD ELVs and the BREF lowerAELs) across all plants covered, and does not consider derogation or the detailed flexibilities (temporary and permanent) that are included in the IED. Thus, the study does not provide a detailed modelling of future IED implementation. The report also does not take into account any changes that may have occurred since 2009 \u0160 for example, reduced industrial activity because of the economic recession, plant closures, replacement of old plants with newer, more efficient and cleaner technologies, changes in fuel mixes, operational/ management changes and evolution of abatement equipment. 15 Data and methods Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union 2 Data and methods 2.1 Datasets used in this study The latest available LCP (2009) dataset (EEA, 2012b) was used as the main data source for the purposes of this report. However, not all required data are available from this source and thus the methodology developed also required certain assumptions and approximations. The Platts EEPP dataset (Platts, 2011) was used to provide more detailed technical information on coal and biomass type used on a Member State basis. The E-PRTR was used for cross - checking emissions from the LCP dataset. Each of these datasets has its own terminology, and each also represents a different scale of the emissions sources. At the most detailed scale is the Platts EEPP dataset, in which information is provided for individual units (i.e. boilers, turbines, etc.). One or more units that discharge waste gases through a common stack form a LCP. One or more plants on the same site comprise a 'facility' under the E-PRTR Regulation. These datasets are discussed in further detail below. 2.1.1 Large combustion plan t inventory dataset Starting in 2004, Member States were required to establish an inventory of annual SO 2 , NO X and dust emissions from plants under the LCPD (Annex VIII(B)) requirements. The inventory contains information on a plant-by-plant basis including the amount of fuel used per category of fuel (biomass, other solid fuels, liquid fuels, natural gas, other gases). In addition, the Commission has asked Member States to also report for each plant, sometimes on a voluntary basis, information on the rated thermal input, the plant type or sector in which it is operated and its age category. Information on whether the plant has opted-out of the LCPD is also reported. Of the 3 310 plants in the dataset for 2009, 1 595 (48 %) met the criteria for further analysis by being identifiable as an ESI or CHP plant and being operational. Of these 1 595 plants, most (1 592) reported NO X emissions, 1 119 reported SO 2 and 1 173 reported dust. The remaining 1 715 plants were not considered in the scope of this report. The LCPD covers other types of industrial combustion plants beyond ESI and CHP plants such as refineries, and iron and steel facilities. Such facilities were not included in the study.", "Further, 'opt-out' plants which have elected to manage their emissions via other permissible LCPD methods such as closing down after a set period were excluded, as were those where there was insufficient information to allow their classification. Only the electricity-producing plants, ESI and CHP sectors, are used in this report. Most Member States voluntarily provided the sector codes but a few did not \u0160 for example, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, while Italy only distinguishes between 'refinery' and 'non-refinery'. For these plants it was necessary to use other sources of information to distinguish between a plant producing only electricity (ESI) or also heat (CHP) or only heat (others like refinery or district heating, etc.). The main shortcoming of the LCP dataset for the purpose of comparing emissions with applicable emission limit values or BAT levels (expressed as concentrations) is that the fuel type grouping is not detailed enough to calculate flue gas volumes with a sufficient degree of certainty, especially for 'biomass' and 'other solid fuels'. More specifically, biomass can be solid, liquid or gaseous, and 'other solid fuels' can be (sub)bituminous coal, anthracite or lignite. Each of these fuel types produces a different specific flue gas volume when combusted. The LCP data was therefore complemented by using data from the Platts EEPP dataset at a Member State level to improve the assessment's certainty. The EEPP dataset was used to distinguish between ESI and CHP by assuming all LCPs with gas turbines produce electricity and for all others to determine if the plant was producing only heat or also electricity. Where it was not possible to identify the sector activity of a LCP using this approach \u0160 for example, industrial parks with several LCPs on the same site \u0160 the LCPs were excluded from the study. Data and methods 16 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union 2.1.2 European Pollutant Re lease and Transfer Register 2009 dataset The E-PRTR ( 4 ) 2009 dataset (v4.1) ( 5 ) was used to cross-check the LCP emissions data for consistency. The E - PRTR provides annual NO X , SO X and PM 10 emissions from industrial facilities covering 65 activities. In 2009, 2 252 E-PRTR facilities reported being 'Thermal power stations and other combustion installations', of which 1 732 facilities reported it as their main activity, which is considered equivalent to the LCP ESI and CHP sectors. One or more pollutants were reported by 1 288 facilities above the E-PRTR reporting thresholds for NO X , SO X and PM 10 . 2.1.3 Platts European Energy Power Plants dataset (Platts, 2011) The EEPP (version Dec. 2011) (Platts, 2011) is a commercial dataset containing information on most European power plants. The data is available at unit level, which represents a set, block, aggregate or section of power generation equipment. Information on unit name, geographic location, operating status, electrical capacity (MW e ) , primary and alternate fuel type (but not fuel use), equipment vendors for the boiler (or reactor ), turbine and/or engine, as well as generator/ alternator, steam conditions, pollution control equipment and cooling system data are included in the dataset. The dataset contains more detail on the biomass (wood, peat, bio-derived liquid fuel) and coal (anthracite, (sub)bituminous coal, lignite) fuel types compared to that provided in the LCP dataset. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, the EEPP dataset was linked to the LCP dataset and used at an aggregated Member State level to complement the LCP dataset. The chemical composition of the fuels was used to calculate the flue gas volume with higher accuracy. The following section and Annex I provide further details of the calculations for the different fuel types. In most cases, individual units contained in the Platts dataset cannot be matched with LCP plants and therefore information was aggregated by Member States. The sector code information was ( 4 ) See http://prtr.ec.europa.eu. ( 5 ) The E-PRTR dataset (v4.1) represents the status of the E-PRTR dataset as on 9 June 2012. It contains 2009 data reported in 2011 that has subsequently been corrected by reporting countries. See http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/E-PRTR4.1. used to distinguish between ESI and CHP sectors for Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. In some cases, the EEPP was not up to date so further information was gathered via publicly available sources. 2.2 Methodology The LCP dataset is the only official dataset available at EU level that contains both emissions and information on the fuel consumption at individual plant level.", "The Platts dataset was used for increasing the level of detail concerning the coal and biomass fuel types. Together, these datasets provide the necessary parameters to calculate emission levels (based upon ELVs) and make the comparison with actual emissions. Four main steps were performed in the assessment: 1. determination of the thermal capacity, and fuel use per fuel type at each plant; 2. estimation of flue gas volumes; 3. calculation of the theoretical annual NO X , SO 2 and dust (and also PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) emissions when: \u0152 assuming that all plants have emissions not exceeding the LCPD ELVs; \u0152 assuming that all plants have emissions not exceeding the IED ELVs; \u0152 assuming that all plants have emissions not exceeding the BREF lowerAELs; 4. comparison of the pollutant emissions calculated for each of the three cases aggregated by Member State with the reported emissions for the year 2009. Each step is described in more detail below. Step 1: Thermal capacity per plant \u0160 fuel use per fuel type To calculate the progress of Member States towards the LCPD and IED ELVs and the lower BATAELs, knowledge of the thermal capacity at each plant is needed. The LCP dataset contains data on the total thermal input capacity per plant and provides fuel use broken down into five categories: biomass, other solid fuels, liquid fuels, natural gas and other gases. Data and methods 17 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union Step 2: Estimation of flue gas volumes To calculate the level of expected emissions consistent with LCPD and IED ELVs and the lower BATAELs, estimates of flue gas volumes were calculated based on fuel type and fuel use information. The calculations start with the estimation of the stoichiometric volumes of flue gases due to the combustion of different fuel types. The combustible components of fuels are principally carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), and in lesser quantity sulphur (S). Complete combustion of a fuel is possible only in the presence of an adequate supply of oxygen (O) usually in the form of air (Box 2.1). Ambient air contains 21 % oxygen, 78 % nitrogen (N 2 ) and 1 % other gases (for example, argon (Ar ), CO 2 and water vapour ). The products of a stoichiometric combustion with oxygen from the air are CO 2 , H 2 O (water ) and SO 2 , which pass through the chimney along with the N 2 in the air. N 2 and the other gases do not take part in the combustion process, but some N 2 reacts with oxygen to form NO and NO 2 (reported as NO X ). As an example, the flue gas volume in the combustion of 1 kg of light fuel oil is illustrated in Figure 2.1. Annex I provides details of the calculation of the flue gas volume of other fuels (based upon Babcock & Wilcox Co., 2007). For the ideal combustion of 1 kg of light fuel oil containing 86 % carbon, 14 % hydrogen and 0.05 % sulphur, theoretically about 14 kg of air is required. This is the minimum air that would be required if the mixing of fuel and air by the burner and combustion is perfect. Box 2.1 Theoretical combustion [C + H (fuel)] + [O 2 + N 2 (Air)] \u00e0 (Combustion Process) \u00e0 [CO 2 + H 2 O + N 2 (Heat)] Considering: 1 mol C + 1 mol O 2 = 1 mol CO 2 \u00e0 12 kg C + (2 x16/12) kg O 2 = (44/12) kg CO 2 Such that: 1 kg C + 2.667 kg O 2 \u00e0 3.667 kg CO 2 And similarly for H 2 and S: 1 kg H 2 + 8 kg O 2 \u00e0 9 kg H 2 O 1 kg S + 1 kg O 2 \u00e0 2 kg SO 2 The flue gas volume is calculated by taking the molecular weight (m) of the combustible components and air combined in the volume of 1 molecule (mol) of the ideal gas at normalised (N) gas conditions (1 013.25 mbar, 0 \u00b0C) . This equates to 22.4 L. Using the values in Figure 2.1, the combustion of 1 kg of light fuel oil therefore leads to a net flue gas volume of 12.1 Nm\u00b3: CO 2 -gas: 22.4 L * 3.161 kg/44 m = 1.6092 Nm\u00b3", "SO 2 -gas: 22.4 L * 0.001 kg/64 m = 0.0004 Nm\u00b3 N 2 -gas: 22.4 L * 11.188 kg/28 m = 8.9504 Nm\u00b3 Water vapour: 22.4 L * 1.238 kg/18 m = 1.5406 Nm\u00b3 = 12.1006 Nm\u00b3 (wet flue gas) = 10.5600 Nm 3 (dry flue gas) The dry flue gas volume per unit energy produced (MJ) in a stoichiometric combustion process using 1 kg of light fuel oil is therefore 0.281 Nm\u00b3/MJ using the default net calorific value (43.0 MJ/kg) (IPCC, 2006). Since the LCPD and IED ELVs and the BAT AELs are also expressed as an emission factor per Nm\u00b3, the flue gas volumes can be directly used to calculate emissions. In reality, unlike the theoretical example above, combustion works with a surplus of oxygen. The LCPD requirements state that the amount of surplus oxygen depends on fuel type and the technology used (e.g. gas turbine). The following excess oxygen values are used for the flue gas calculations in this report: Data and methods 18 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union Figure 2.1 Calculation of stoichiometric flue gas volume from atomic composition of light fuel oil Source: 2007.

It is difficult to estimate accurately the flue gas volumes for biomass and lignite because it itself contains oxygen and this oxygen takes part in the combustion process. Furthermore, the chemical composition of biomass can vary significantly. Since the LCP dataset does not contains details on biomass type (i.e. solid, liquid or gaseous), the Platts dataset was used to obtain further detail on the type of combusted biomass in order to differentiate between wood, peat, biogas (landfill gas, sewage digester gas), wastewater sludge and bio-derived liquid fuel. The Platts dataset shows that 68 % of the units that have biomass as a main fuel use wood, and in most cases wood is an alternative fuel in co-combustion units. In Finland, Ireland and Sweden, peat is also used as a main fuel (11 % of the units). In some cases, there is no extra information available on the type of biomass. As wood is the main biomass fuel type, the chemical composition of wood pellets was used to calculate the calorific value and flue gas volumes for all biomass. Wood pellets are often the main biomass source burned in electrical power plants because of their high combustion efficiency. The pellets themselves are densely compacted sawdust or other wastes from sawmilling, with low moisture content (below 10 %). Furthermore, the ELVs for 'wood' and 'peat' are the same, so there is no refinement necessary for further analysis. The Platts dataset was also used to differentiate between the different types of 'other solid fuels' from the LCP dataset because of the variability in flue gas volumes in the combustion of anthracite, (sub) bituminous coal and lignite ( 6 ). Using the coal details from Platts at a Member State level, the following grouping of coal types was used for the analysis: \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 anthracite, bituminous coal; \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 (sub)bituminous coal; mixed coal consisting of Platts coal mix: bituminous/lignite, bituminous/(sub) bituminous. For each Member State, a weighted average was calculated across the distribution of different coal groups using the electrical capacity (MW e ) of the units from the Platts dataset. Annex II provides a detailed summary. Step 3: Estimation of NO X , SO 2 , dust, PM 10 and PM 2.5 emissions corresponding to the IED and LCPD ELVs and the lower BATAELs Case 1:All plants have emissions not exceeding the lower BATAELs Plant-level emissions were estimated using ( 6 )", "The value of the flue gas volume corresponding to each fuel type is a sensitive parameter in the assessment. Use of a higher flue gas volume value implies lower emission concentrations will subsequently be estimated. Annex II provides further examples of the flue gas volume calculations by fuel type. Data and methods 19 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union emission factors corresponding to the BAT lowerAELs that are provided based on the age of the plant. The LCP dataset contains plant ages and their distribution is presented in Figure 2.2. For the 'new-new' and 'old-new' plants (terminology of the LCPD), the BATAELs of new plants were applied, while for the 'existing' plants, unknown and empty cells, theAELs for existing plants were applied. If the estimated value was higher than the 2009 emission, then the 2009 emission was retained since this means the reported emission is already lower than theAEL. The difference in such cases is termed the 'surplus reduction' throughout this report \u0160 that is, the difference between the estimated emission corresponding to the lower BATAELs (or LCPD ELVs) and the reported emission, where the latter is lower. As information on the emission abatement beyond theAEL is lost by simply retaining the 2009 emissions,an estimation of this 'surplus reduction' or excess was made in such situations. Case 2:All units have emissions not exceeding the LCPD ELVs Emissions at plant level were estimated using emission factors corresponding to the regular - case LCPD ELVs and using the same Figure 2.2 Age distribution of the 1 595 LCPs considered in this report 'New-new' 16% 'Old-new' 22 % 'Existing' 40 % Unknown 17 % Empty cell s 5 % plant age assumptions as was done for the BATAELs. If the estimated value was higher than the 2009 emission at plant level, the latter was retained since this means that the reported emission is already lower than the LCPD ELVs. The 'surplus reductions' were also calculated. Case 3:All plants have emissions not exceeding the IED ELVs Emissions at plant level were estimated using emission factors corresponding to the IED ELVs. The same plant age assumptions were applied as for the calculation of the BATAELs and the LCPD ELVs. If the estimated value was higher than the 2009 unit emission, the latter was retained since this means that the current emission is already lower than the IED ELVs. The 'surplus reductions' were also calculated. Actual emissions for NO X , SO 2 and dust were obtained from the 2009 LCP dataset as previously described. While the LCP dataset contains data on dust emissions, no information is provided concerning the PM 2.5 or PM 10 fractionation. These fractions were therefore estimated using default average emission factors for averaged abatement technologies from the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook (EEA, 2009). The fuel type used strongly influences the PM emission factors. Dust emissions from gaseous fuels consist of 100 % PM 10 and PM 2.5 emissions, while the fractions from the combustion of different coal types are 66 % PM 10 and 30 % PM 2.5 . The combustion of liquid fuels entails a distribution of 75 % PM 10 and 50 % PM 2.5 . Step 4: Comparison of the pollutant emissions calculated for each of the three cases with the reported emissions for the year 2009 The calculated emissions in the three cases described above were aggregated at Member State level. The theoretical emission reduction potential of NO X , SO 2 and dust was then estimated by comparing with the reported LCP emissions for 2009.

The ELVs are specified for different fuel types. Figure 3.1 shows that in 2009, 56 % 'other solid fuels' (in terms of thermal input (TJ)) and 35 % natural gas of the total fuel use were used by the selected 1 595 plants. The use of biomass, liquid fuels and other gases is much smaller, between 2 and 4 %. Using data from the EEPP dataset to determine the average distribution within the 'other solid fuels' group (hard coal, lignite, mixed coal) revealed that 63 % used hard coal, 34 % lignite and 3 % mixed coal. The use of biomass, liquid fuels and other gases is much smaller, between 2 and 4 %. The biggest impact in reduction can therefore be expected for coal/lignite and natural gas. Where a plant uses only one fuel type, a direct link to the emissions and the fuel type used is possible. However, where plants use a multi-fuel mixture, it is not possible to simply link emissions to just one fuel type since only total emissions per pollutant are available and fuels may be used either consecutively or simultaneously. If no fuel type makes up more than 95 % of the total fuel usage, the combustion plant is considered 'multi-fuel'. Figure 3.2 shows that coal and biomass represent the highest share in emissions as illustrated in the distribution of plants using different single fuel types. Comparison of Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 shows that 35 % of the total fuel is natural gas, which is used by 47 % of the 1 595 plants. 'Other solid fuels' comprises 56 % of the total fuel, which is used by less than 37 % (i.e. 14 % plus the largest share (23 %) of the multi-fuel plants') of the total number of plants. Results and discussion 21 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union This implies that gas plants normally have smaller thermal and electrical capacities than coal plants. 3.2 Comparison of 2009 NO X emissions with LCPD and IED ELVs and lower BAT AELs The effect on NO X emissions corresponding to a hypothetical full implementation of the lower BATAELs and the LCPD and IED ELVs has been estimated (Table 3.1). If the estimated emission limit (BAT, LCPD or IED) is higher than the 2009 plants emission, then the latter will be retained since this means that the current reported emissions are already lower than the respective limit values. The largest reduction (69 %) would be achieved if all plants reached the most stringent limit values from the lower BATAELs. The least reduction (5 %) is related to the LCPD ELV. The NO X emissions in 2004 analysed in the previous EEA report (EEA, 2008) for the EU-25 were 20 % higher than the LCPD ELVs whereas, in 2009, a similar comparison (again based on EU-25) shows emissions are only 6 % higher. It should be noted however that the two studies employ different methodologies, so any comparison of values should be undertaken carefully. This confirms that good progress has been made by Member States in reducing their emissions since the previous report. Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom have the highest reported 2009 NO X emissions from the selected LCPs (Figure 3.3). However, emissions reported by Germany are already consistent with all but the most stringent lower BATAELs. Figure 3.3 also shows that for a number of Member States (Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden), the potential emission reductions are almost the same when comparing the theoretical IED and LCPD ELVs. This suggests the 2009 emissions are close to or already below the limit values.", "Table 3.1 Gap between  2009 NO X emissions and emissions based on the LCP emission limits, the IED emission limits, and the lower BAT AELs Reported emissions 2009 Potential emissions based on LCPD ELVs Potential emissions based on IED ELVs Potential emissions based on lower BAT AELs Emissions (kt) Emissions (kt) % reduction compared to 2009 emissions Emissions (kt) % reduction comparedto2009 emissions Emissions (kt) % reduction comparedto2009 emissions NO X 1 138 1 077 \u0152 5 % 728 \u0152 36 % 358 \u0152 69 % For the plants where the 2009 emission was already lower than the ELVs, the 'surplus reductions' (i.e. the emission reduction already achieved below the limit values) was calculated. These amounted to 1 155 kt for the LCPD, 190 kt for IED and 8 kt for lower BAT emission levels. The surplus reductions are negligible compared with the lower BATAEL, implying that only a very limited number of plants already reach the lower BATAEL. The surplus reduction already achieved compared with the LCPD ELVs is high for a number of Member States, especially for Czech Republic, Germany and Poland, which suggests that these Member States have more stringent ELVs than required or plants in any case operate below the level of the LCPD ELVs. It is noted that a small number of very large plants account for a substantial share of the total emissions (Figure 3.4) with only 50 (or 3 %) of the 1 595 plants accounting for 50 % of emissions, and 454 (or 28 %) accounting for 90 % of emissions. Germany, Poland and the UK account for 27 of the largest emitting plants, together representing more than 30 % of the total EU-27 emissions. It is important to note, however, that a small number of large plants may actually be more efficient than smaller plants; the absolute magnitude of emissions from a plant does not necessarily inform on relative operating efficiencies. In terms of the cross-checking performed of reported emissions, only 40 of the 50 plants representing 50 % of the NO X emissions could be linked to E-PRTR facilities. For 28 of these plants, there is little difference (+/\u0152 5 %) between the two datasets; however, two plants (one each in Bulgaria and Greece) have reported emissions that are significantly greater than the E-PRTR facility at 32 % and 155 %, respectively (Table 3.2). The reasons for such significant differences are not clear. Overall, the NO X emissions from the selected LCPs account for 85 % of the total E-PRTR 'Thermal power stations and other combustion installations' sector Results and discussion 22 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union Figure 3.3 2009 NO X emissions (kt) compared  with LCPD and IED emiss ion limits, and the lower BAT AELs (1 595 plants) NO X emissions (kt) 2009 5. 61 2. 95 0.6 4.2 74.8 9. 58 .0 33.1 14.8 174.1 76.2 13.7 13.6 67. 21 .0 2. 80 .5 2. 52 0.1 174. 62 3. 15 2.6 2.5 9.7 87.1 7.3 196. 4 LC P EL V 5. 21 2. 14 5.1 3.3 74.5 8. 98 .0 31.4 12.1 173.5 70.5 13.4 11.8 61. 60 .6 2. 80 .5 0. 72 0.1 174. 62 1. 45 0.5 2.4 9.7 74.7 7.2 180. 0 IE D EL V 5. 01 0. 92 6.6 2.0 58.4 8. 25 .9 21. 28 .4 169.7 37.6 12.8 7.9 53. 00 .5 1. 50 .5 0. 61 8.4 88.2 9. 53 1.4 1.9 8.5 45.5 6.8 86. 9 Lowe r BA T AE L 3.2 6.0 9. 10 .7 19.3 6. 12 .2 11. 84 .4 90.9 12.4 5.2 4.1 35. 20 .3 0. 70 .3 0. 21 2.7 37.5 5. 59 .9 0.8 2.1 22.7 5.7 49. 3 0 50 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 0 Austri a Belgiu m Bulgaria Cyprus Czech  Republic Denmar k Estonia Finlan d France German y Greec e Hungar y Irelan d Ital y Latvi a Lithuani a Luxembourg Malt a Netherland s Poland Portuga l Romani a Slovakia Slovenia Spai n Sweden United Kingdo m Results and discussion 23 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union emissions.

The largest reduction (94 %) would be achieved if all plants reached the most stringent limit values of the lower BATAEL and the least reduction (47 %) to the LCPD ELV. Figure 3.5 Total 2009 SO 2 emissions in the EU-25 and the EU-27 compared w ith LCPD and IED emission limits, and the lower BAT AELs The previous report (EEA, 2008), which was based on 450 facilities from the 2004 EPER dataset, indicated that reported emissions of SO 2 were 61 % above the estimated emission corresponding to the LCPD ELVs. Figure 3.5 shows the 2009 (EU-25) SO 2 emissions were 39 % higher than the LCPD ELVs, a positive evolution compared to the earlier study based on 2004 data. The 2009 EU-27 emissions are 90 % higher than the LCPD ELVs largely due to the reported emissions from the two most recent EU Member States, Bulgaria and Romania, both of which report emissions significantly above the SO 2 LCPD ELV (Figure 3.6). It is important to note that both these Member States had derogations in place in 2009.

The highest SO 2 emissions were reported by Bulgaria, Poland and Romania. Compared to the reported 2009 emissions, Bulgaria, Estonia ( 7 ), Greece and Romania would achieve the largest reduction percentage (98\u015299 %) if the selected plants in these countries reached the lower BATAELs.", "The largest reduction effort in absolute tonnes SO 2 would have to be realised by Bulgaria, Greece, Poland and Romania. For a number of Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden), the reduction needed to reach the LCPD and IED ELVs is small. This means that the 2009 emissions are close to or already below the limit values for these Member States, which means that the 2009 emissions are retained and no further reduction can be realised. It is likely these Member States have ELVs that are more stringent than the LCPD and IED ELVs. For the plants where the 2009 emission was already lower than the ELVs, the 'surplus' reduction was calculated. This amounted to 1 044 kt for LCPD, 236 kt for IED and 15 kt for lower BAT. For many Member States, especially Czech Republic, Germany and the United Kingdom, the surplus reduction compared with the LCPD ELVs is high. Inthe caseofGermany, the large differencebetween the LCPD and IED ELVs, and the lower BATAEL is two-fold. On the one hand, the lower BATAELwith a SO 2 concentration of 20 mg/Nm 3 is extremely low. On the other, the lower BATAEL doesnot reflect the special situation of combustion plants fuelled with high-sulphur containing lignite (Umweltbundesamt, personal communication). The next revision of the LCP BREF will consider such issues. Even much more than for NO X , a limited number of very large plants account for a large share of the total SO 2 emissions. Only 20 (1 %) of the 1 595 plants represent 50 % of the total emissions, while 165 (10 %) represent 90 % of the emissions. Bulgaria, Greece and Romania account for 14 of the 20 largest emitting plants, together representing 76 % of the total emissions. All 20 plants could be linked to E-PRTR facilities and, for most, the reported emissions compared reasonably well. The exception was for four plants in Bulgaria, where ( 7 ) In Estonia, oilshale is the main fuel type used by power plants. Thereis no emission limit value for oil shale so the 'mixed coal' factor was used for the comparisons against the three emission limits. for three plants the reported LCP emissions were only 63\u015280 % of those reported to E - PRTR and one, 'Toplofikatsia Sliven', where the emissions were 73 % higher than E - PRTR. This most likely represents an error in either the E - PRTR or the LCPD reporting. The 2009 SO 2 emissions from the 'other solid fuels' plants are the highest (73 %) of total emissions followed by the 'multi-fuel' plants (24 %), which are dominated by the coal co-combustion plants. Therefore, the largest reduction potential can be found in the 'other solid fuels' and 'multi-fuel' plants. SO 2 emissions from natural gas, other gases and biomass are negligible. Liquid fuel emissions are low and decreasing not just because of the lower S-content of the fuel, but also because of the limited utilisation of liquid fuels in power plants (Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2).

Dust emissions were not analysed in the previous report so no comparisons with the earlier study are made. A 79 % reduction would potentially be realised if all plants achieve emissions consistent with the lower BATAELs, and a smaller reduction (29 %) by achieving the LCPD ELV (Figure 3.7). Bulgaria, Greece, Poland and Romania have the highest 2009 dust emissions (Figure 3.7), which were still above the LCPD ELVs for dust by 2009. In moving toward emissions at the level of the IED ELVs, the largest reduction effort in tonnes of dust will have to be realised by Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Poland and Romania. Since the health impact of dust and dust fractions (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) differs largely, it was decided to estimate the dust fractions even though they are not directly available from the LCP dataset used in this study (Figure 3.8). Details of the simple approach used to estimate the PM 2.5 and PM 10 fractions is provided in the methodology section of this report. The results show that PM 10 emissions account for 82 % (range 75\u015288 %) of total dust emissions on average, and PM 2.5 account for 54 % (range 40\u015267 %) on average. For the plants where the 2009 emission was already lower than the emission limits, the 'surplus reduction' was calculated to be 170 kt for LCPD, 21 kt for IED and 4 kt for lower BATAELs. The surplus reductions are small compared with the lower BATAEL values and high compared with the IED ELVs. As with NO X and SO 2 , a very limited number of very large plants account for a very large share of the total emissions. Only 21 (1 %) of the 1 595 plants represent 50 % of the total 2009 dust emissions, while 175 (11 %) plants represent 90 % of the emissions. Bulgaria, Greece and Romania account for 17 of the top 21 emitting plants and these 17 together represent 82 % of emissions from the top 21 pants, or 40% of total emissions. The disaggregation of the emissions per fuel type was calculated by linking the emissions to the 'single fuel type' reported in the LCP dataset. The results show that very large coal ('other solid fuels') plants and coal co-combustion ('multi-fuel') plants account for most of the dust emissions with 69 % and 26 %, respectively. Dust emissions are negligible from natural gas and other gases fuel types, and those from liquid fuels are also low, because of the limited utilisation of liquid fuels in power plants (Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2). The largest reduction potential can therefore be found in the 'other solid fuels' and 'multi-fuel' plants. The lower BATAELs are strict for existing and new coal-using plants, and so the theoretical achievement of levels of emissions consistent with theAELs would yield high emission reductions.

Two important sources of possible uncertainty were quantified using a sensitivity analysis on: 1. the impact of parameters used to estimate the flue gas volume; 2. the effect of different flue gas volumes on Member State level emissions. As previously described, the 2009 emissions data officially reported to the European Commission under the LCPD is used in this report. This report does not evaluate uncertainty due to the quality and completeness of the LCP dataset. Gaps in the reporting of emissions by Member States were filled in the context of a study done for the European Commission (AMEC, 2012) and gaps in the type and nature of some plants were filled where necessary using the Platts EEPP and publicly available information sources. Quantitative information on potential errors and uncertainties in the datasets and approach used is not available and therefore it is not possible to provide a full uncertainty analysis with information on confidence intervals of the calculated emissions. 4.2 Scope of the sensitivity analysis The calculations used to estimate the emissions are based mainly on information in the LCP dataset. However, in order to relate this information to AELs and ELVs, which are given in concentration units (mg/Nm\u00b3), additional information is needed to convert them. Most important is the fuel composition and the calorific values taken from the literature i.e. from IPCC, 2006 and for lignite from Euracoal, 2013. This data is specific for the atomic composition for each of the fuel types but the calorific value is given as a range. For the calculation of flue gas volumes withinthisstudy,theaveragecalorificvaluewasused for each fuel type. In order to assess the impact of the range of the calorific values within the calculation and for the overall study results, a sensitivity analysis was performed and is presented in Section 4.3. Since the calorific value is the most uncertain parameter for the study results, this was addressed in the sensitivity analysis to explore the uncertainty and its impacts on the calculated emissions. 4.3 Sensitivity analysis on the impact of parameters used to estimate the flue gas volume The estimated flue gas volume per fuel is an important parameter because the emissions for NO X , SO 2 and dust (mg/Nm\u00b3) are calculated based on the flue gas volume, which in turn is dependent on the calorific value assumed for each fuel.", "The range of flue gas volumes for each of the seven fuel types corresponding to the lower, upper and average calorific values are presented in Figure 4.1, illustrating the effect of this uncertainty. Table 4.1 shows that for liquid fuels and biomass the differences in the flue gas are small and remain within 5 % of the average. The fuels with the highest uncertainty are lignite and 'other gases'. The given uncertainties for each of the fuel types are in line with the ranges of the calorific values. The high uncertainty of 'Other gases' has a lesser impact on Uncertainty analysis 31 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union Figure 4.1 The range of flue gas volumes corresponding to the lower, upper range and average net calorific values for each of the seven fuel types addressed in this study the overall certainty because it is not often used in plants compared to lignite (Figure 3.1). 4.4 Sensitivity analysis on the impact of the calorific value for NO X emissions In order to estimate the impact of the fuel calorific value on the estimated NO X emissions, a sensitivity analysis was performed showing the emissions in an aggregated form for all EU Member States. Figure 4.2 shows the effects on the results due to different calorific values of the fuels. There is a clear difference for eachAEL and ELV. The reported NO X emissions in 2009 are the baseline to show the effect that is represented in Figure 4.2 by the columns. For the three emission limits, the average calorific value for each fuel is the same. These values show the level of emissions that would have been realised if the respectiveAEL or ELVs would have been fulfilled. Note that this figure is an aggregation of all plants under the scope of this study.

This is the case as many plants already have lower emissions compared to the LCPD ELV and some have lower compared to the IED ELV. In the analysis, these lower emissions (for 2009) were used to calculate the emissions instead of the respective AEL or ELVs. Using the reported emission data for this report significantly reduces the uncertainty and is therefore very low especially for the LCPD ELVs. Table 4.2 provides an overview of the deviation between the emissions related to the average fuel net calorific value and the lower and upper ranges of the net calorific values. 4.5 Sensitivity analysis on the impact of the net calorific value for SO 2 emissions In order to estimate the impact of the range in fuel net calorific values on the estimated SO 2 emissions, a similar sensitivity analysis was performed showing the emissions in an aggregated form for all Member States. Figure 4.3 illustrates the effects on the results due to different net calorific values of the fuels.", "The 2009 SO 2 emissions are used as the baseline to show the effect that is represented in Figure 4.3 by the columns. The indicated emissions would have been realised if the respectiveAEL or ELVs had been fulfilled.

The SO 2 result for the LCPD ELV is quite different compared to that for the NO X fuel net calorific value deviation, and is almost the same as deviation for the IED ELV. This is the case since only a few plants already have 2009 emissions that are lower than the LCPD and IED ELVs. Thus, the effect of the fuel net calorific value is more important for SO 2 than for NO X emissions. 4.6 Sensitivity analysis on the impact of the net calorific value for dust emissions In order to estimate the impact of the range in fuel net calorific values on the estimated dust emissions, a sensitivity analysis was performed showing the aggregated emissions for Member States. Figure 4.4 illustrates the effects on the results due to different net calorific values of the fuels and once again the reported 2009 dust emissions are represented by the columns. For eachAEL and ELV, a slightly different picture appears. For the lower BATAELs as well as for the LCPD and IED ELVs, the average net calorific value for each fuel is the same. The analysis shows that the effect of the fuel calorific value is almost the same for theAEL and ELVs taking into account the upper and lower net calorific values. Similar to SO 2 results, the LCPD ELV for the fuel net calorific value variation show almost the same deviation from the average as is the case for the IED ELV.Additionally, the LCPD ELV fuel net calorific value has less effect because the reported emissions are used and the better performing plants meet the LCPD ELV. 4.7 Conclusions of the sensitivity analysis on the impact of the net calorific values for emissions In general, the effect of uncertainty across the range of fuel net calorific values on the calculated emissions is between 2.5 % (LCPD ELV for NO X ) and 35 % (lower BATAEL for SO 2 ). However, the upper end of the uncertainty range is high because the sensitivity analysis is analysing the effect on emissions of the calorific value at the lower or upper end. In reality, the calorific value will only differ slightly within a Member State and is highly dependent on the origin of the fuels. In order to improve the level of certainty of the results presented in this study, it is recommended that future data reporting should include the calorific value of each fuel in use in a plant or even Member State. This is most important for the fuel category 'other solid fuels' as it is used in the LCP dataset and herein for lignite. Especially if 'other solid fuels' would be subdivided in three groups regarding the calorific values as made in this study, the methodology would be strengthened because the assumption used to distinguish 'other solid fuels' into 'hard coal', 'mixed coal' and 'lignite' would become obsolete.

Emissions of NO X from all LCPs declined by 30 % during the period to 2009, and SO 2 and dust by more than 50 %.", "The main purpose of this study was to assess the theoretical emission reduction potential of selected electricity-generating plants by comparing the reported 2009 emissions of NO X , SO 2 and dust with: i. the IED ELVs; ii. the current ELVs of the LCPD; and iii. the lowerAELs contained in the LCP BREF. The conclusions were based upon the official 2009 emissions reported by 1 595 LCPs under the LCPD (EEA, 2012b). 5.1 Emission reduction potential of NO X , SO 2 and dust The key findings of this study are that NO X emissions could be 5\u015269 % lower, SO 2 47\u015294 % lower and dust 29\u015279 % lower if all selected plants achieved the LCPD ELVs or the 'lower end of BAT' AELs (Table 5.1). The future implementation of the IED and its mandatory ELVs is expected to deliver emission reductions between these various ranges for the respective pollutants. While the potential scope to further reduce emissions may appear high given the reduction already reported in emissions between 2004 and 2009, these results are broadly consistent with an independent analysis performed in the context of the recent revision of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-range TransboundaryAir Pollution (CLRTAP) Gothenburg Protocol, in which EU-27 emissions of NO X , SO 2 and PM 10 from the electricity and heat production sector were forecast to fall by 22 %, 58 % and 39 %, respectively, by 2020 (IIASA, 2012). Indeed, based on the results of this report, it appears several Member States are close to meeting or have already achieved the IED emission limits (Figure ES.2 for NO X , Figure ES.3 for SO 2 and Figure ES.4 for dust), although importantly there may be individual plants that have further reductions to make.

As progress towards the implementation of the IED ELVs takes place, the largest reduction efforts will have to be made by Greece, Spain, Poland and the United Kingdom. For a relatively large number of Member States (including Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden), the theoretical reduction that would be realised by reaching the NOx LCPD and IED ELVs is almost the same. For the purposes of this study, where the reported 2009 emissions were already below the limit values these emission values were retained for the assessment and no further reduction was assumed. It is also clear that just a limited number of very large plants account for a substantial share of the total NO X emissions. Only 50 (3 %) of the examined 1 595 plants were responsible for 50 % of the total emissions, while 454 (28 %) accounted for 90 % of the emissions. Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom account for 27 of the largest emitting plants, together representing more than 30 % of the total EU - 27 emissions. It is important to note, however, that a small number of large plants may actually be more efficient than smaller plants; the absolute magnitude of emissions from a plant does not necessarily inform on relative operating efficiencies. The highest 2009 SO 2 emissions for LCPs are reported by Bulgaria, Poland and Romania. The largest future reductions will have to be realised by these three Member States, as well as by Greece.", "For a number of Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden), the reduction that should be realised by reaching the LCPD ELV and IED ELV is almost the same. For SO 2 , just 20 (1 %) of the examined 1 595 plants account for 50 % of the total emissions, while 165 (10 %) contributed 90 % of the total emissions. Bulgaria, Greece and Romania account for 14 of the largest emitting plants and together for almost 40 % of the total EU-27 LCP emissions. Bulgaria, Greece, Poland and Romania have the highest 2009 dust emissions. If emissions are to reach levels consistent with the IED ELVs, the largest reduction effort in tonnes dust will have to be realised by these Member States, as well as by Estonia. For a number of Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden), the reduction that should be realised by achieving the LCPD and IED ELVs is almost the same. Only 21 (1 %) of the examined 1 595 plants represent 50 % of the total reported 2009 dust emissions, while 175 (11 %) of the 1 595 plants represent 90 % of the emissions. Bulgaria, Greece and Romania account for 17 of the largest emitting plants and together account for just over 40 % of the total EU-27 dust emissions. 5.2 Applicability of the approach In the earlier EEA report assessing the theoretical scope to reduce emissions from electricity-generating LCPs (EEA, 2008), the fuel type use at EPER facilities was estimated using reported CO 2 emissions. As a result, the level of uncertainty was relatively high as the fuel type distribution could only be roughly estimated given the lack of detailed fuel information available from the pollutant register. In this report, the level of certainty is greatly enhanced since the assessment is based upon the officially reported LCP dataset, which contains detailed information on the thermal capacity, fuel type, fuel usage and emissions for each plant. Of the 3 310 plants in the LCPD dataset, 1 595 plants were identified as being in the ESI and CHP sectors and were selected for use within this report. The plants used in this study are deemed to adequately represent the proportion of electricity producers at the Member State and EU-27 levels and, along with supplementary information obtained from the Platts dataset (Platts, 2011), allows for a meaningful indication of the difference between 2009 emissions and the future potential emission reductions that would occur with a theoretical full implementation of the IED ELVs. Flue gas volumes were estimated using the composition of the fuel and average net calorific values based on the officially reported 2009 LCP fuel type and fuel usage. Where applicable, data from the Platts dataset was used to further improve the level of quality and reduce the uncertainty in this report compared to the previous study. \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 between ESI and CHP plants for three Member States (Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden) where only a generic sector code had been reported under the LCPD. \u0002 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 \u00021 average distribution on coal types (hard coal, lignite, mixed coal) and biomass (wood was retained as main biomass fuel type) for the plants using 'other solid fuels' and 'biomass' on a Member State basis. These refinements were needed because flue gas calculation is highly dependent on the type of coal and biomass. Conclusions 36 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union For the assessment of the theoretical emission reductions of NO X , SO 2 and dust through implementation of the LCPD and IED ELVs and the lower BATAELs, the respective emissions limit andAEL values could be applied directly on the calculated flue gas volumes per fuel type. The results of these calculations are the theoretical emissions per fuel type and per plant. The emissions per fuel type were then aggregated to obtain emissions per plant and then totalled to obtain emissions per Member State. For multi-fuel plants, it was not possible to relate the emissions to the different fuel types used. Consequently, the calculation of the estimated emissions under the ELVs was performed on a plant - by-fuel\u0152type basis, while the comparison with the 2009 emissions was done on a plant basis. 5.3 Uncertainty The emission calculations in this report were determined using an average fuel calorific value.", "A sensitivity analysis was performed in order to assess the sensitivity of this parameter. Due to different ranges of the calorific values that can be assumed for each fuel, the choice of value can have an impact on the overall results in the study. The effect was quantified on an aggregated EU level and is between 2.5 and 35 % depending on the pollutant type and the respectiveAEL or ELVs to which the effect is being compared to. The analysis showed that the highest impact on the certainty of the study results is related to lignite and its wide range of possible calorific values. In order to raise the overall certainty for future studies using this methodology, it is recommended that Member States (or plants) using 'other solid fuels', a category in the LCP dataset, should report the calorific value of their fuels. 37 Glossary Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union AEL associated emission level BAT best available techniques BREF Reference document on best available techniques for large combustion plants, as adopted in 2006 under the IPPC Directive CO 2 carbon dioxide EEA European Environment Agency; http://www.eea.europa.eu Eionet European Environmental Information and Observation Network ELV emission limit value EPER European Pollutant Emission Register E-PRTR European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register; http://prtr.ec.europa.eu ETC/ACM European Topic Centre onAir pollution and Climate change Mitigation EU European Union EU-25 the 25 Member States following the enlargement of the EU in 2004 EU-27 the 27 Member States following the enlargement of the EU in 2007 GJ gigajoule = 10 9 joules IED Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/ EU) IPPC Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control kt kilotonne = 1 000 tonnes (metric) = 1 000 000 kg = 1 gigagram (Gg) Glossary LCP large combustion plant LCPD Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC) LRTAP UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution MW megawatt = 10 6 watt MW e megawatt electrical (capacity) MW th megawatt thermal (capacity) NMVOC non-methane volatile organic compound NO X nitrogen oxides PM particulate matter PM 10 particulate matter that passes through a size-selective inlet with a 50 % efficiency cut-off at 10 \u00b5m aerodynamic diameter PM 2,5 particulate matter that passes through a size-selective inlet with a 50 % efficiency cut-off at 2.5 \u00b5m aerodynamic diameter SO 2 sulphur dioxide VOC volatile organic compound Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union 38 References References AMEC, 2012, Analysis and summary of the Member States' emission inventories 2007-2009 and related information under the LCP Directive (2001/80/EC) , Final report to the European Commission,AMEC Environment and Infrastructure UK.

(2007). Heavy fuel oil An example calculation of the flue gas weight due to the combustion of 1 kg of heavy fuel oil is provided below, assuming a S-content of 1 % and 0.7 % non - combustible compounds and impurities. The combustion of 1 kg of heavy fuel oil therefore leads to a total dry flue gas volume of 10.14 Nm 3 . The net calorific value of 1 kg of heavy fuel oil amounts to 39.8\u015241.7 MJ/kg (lower\u0152upper net calorific values). The dry flue gas volume in a stoichiometric combustion process of heavy fuel oil amounts to 0.249 Nm 3 /MJ when calculated with the average net calorific value. Blast furnace gas Fuel type 'other gases' in the LCP dataset is mainly 'blast furnace gas' from the steel industry that is used for electricity generation. Blast furnace gas contains large amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and CO 2 gas, of which the latter will not take part in the combustion process. The composition of the gas is highly variable, the values from http://www. gutenberg.org/files/22657/22657-h/chapters/gases. html were used. Annex I 40 Reducing air pollution from electricity-generating large combustion plants in the European Union The combustion of 1 Nm\u00b3 of blast furnace gas therefore leads to a total flue gas volume of 2.494 Nm 3 . The net calorific value of 1 Nm 3 of blast furnace gas amounts to 1.535\u01526.4 MJ/kg (lower\u0152upper net calorific values). The dry flue gas volume in a stoichiometric combustion process of blast furnace gas amounts to 537 Nm 3 /MJ when calculated with the average net calorific value. Natural gas The combustion of 1 Nm\u00b3 of natural gas leads to a total flue gas volume of 10.669 Nm\u00b3. The net calorific value of 1 Nm 3 of natural gas amounts to 31.7\u015241.9 MJ/kg (lower\u0152upper net calorific values).

{"pubmed_id": "17", "text": ["Rural development | EUR-Lex Rural development policy is the second pillar of the European Union\u2019s (EU) common agricultural policy. It seeks to help the EU\u2019s rural areas address economic, environmental, and social challenges. It has three long-term objectives: - Foster the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry; - Manage natural resources sustainably and implement climate action measures; - Achieve balanced territorial development in rural areas, including job creation and maintenance. Funding: - The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) is the main funding tool. - EAFRD budget for 2021\u20132027 is \u20ac95.5 billion, including \u20ac8.1 billion from the Next Generation EU recovery instrument (post-COVID-19 response). Implementation: Rural development is carried out via 7-year programmes, designed in partnership with the EU. These focus on six priorities: 1. Knowledge transfer and innovation; 2. Competitiveness of all types of farming and sustainable forest management; 3. Food chain organization; 4. Ecosystem restoration, preservation, and enhancement; 5. Resource efficiency and transition to a low-carbon economy; 6. Social inclusion, poverty reduction, and economic development in rural areas. Legal Framework: - Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 outlines the principles and rules for EAFRD implementation. - The transitional regulation (23 December 2020) extended 2014\u20132020 rules for 2021\u20132022 with minor updates, ensuring a smooth transition to the new CAP from 2023.

{"pubmed_id": "18", "text": ["Making the most of waste electrical and electronic equipment | EUR-Lex SUMMARY OF: Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE? To protect the environment and human health by: - preventing the creation of WEEE, - promoting reuse, recycling, and recovery of EEE waste, - supporting resource efficiency and recovery of secondary raw materials. Directive (EU) 2024/884 (amending): - Clarifies cost responsibility for waste management; - Introduces a review clause for potential revisions by 2026. KEY POINTS - Recasts and repeals Directive 2002/96/EC. - Categorizes WEEE (e.g., large/small equipment, screens, lamps, etc.). - Excludes some EEE types (e.g., military, implantable medical devices). Member State obligations: - Promote design of easily dismantled and recoverable EEE. - Minimize WEEE in unsorted municipal waste. - Ensure free return of WEEE for private households and distributors. - Prohibit disposal of untreated separately collected WEEE. - Enforce minimum annual collection rate: * 45% of sold EEE weight (2016), * 65% or 85% of WEEE generated (2019 onward). Transition delay until 2021 allowed for: Bulgaria, Czechia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia. Other duties: - License and inspect treatment plants; - Register all EEE producers/importers; - Impose legal penalties for non-compliance; - Require producers to: * meet treatment and recovery targets, * finance waste collection/treatment from non-household users (post-13 August 2005 products), * inform the public on return/collection systems. Following EU court judgment: - Photovoltaic panel waste from post-13 August 2012 must be handled by producers; - Extended producer responsibility applies to items placed on the market after 15 August 2018. Implementing Acts: - Regulation (EU) 2017/699: methodology for calculating EEE and WEEE weight. - Regulation (EU) 2019/290: producer registration and reporting format. - Decision (EU) 2019/2193: recovery target calculation, verification, and reporting rules. REVIEW: By 31 December 2026, the Commission must assess and potentially revise Directive 2012/19/EU. FROM WHEN DO THE RULES APPLY? - Directive 2012/19/EU: had to be transposed by 14 February 2014. - Directive (EU) 2024/884: to be transposed by 9 October 2025. BACKGROUND WEEE (e.g., fridges, phones) is growing rapidly\u2014from 9 million tonnes (2005) to 13.5 million tonnes (2021). Contains valuable resources and hazardous materials needing proper handling. KEY TERMS - WEEE: Discarded electrical or electronic items. - EEE: Equipment relying on electric current or electromagnetic fields. MAIN DOCUMENT Directive 2012/19/EU of 4 July 2012 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (OJ L 197, 24.7.2012, pp. 38\u201371).
