Deformity and Decline in Amphibian Populations: A Case Study On a field trip in the summer of 1995, a group of elementary and middle school students from Henderson, Minnesota, made a gruesome discovery as they caught leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) for a summer science project: 11 of the 22 frogs they found were severely deformed. Some of the frogs had missing or extra limbs, others had legs that were too short or bent in odd directions, and still others had bony growths coming out of their backs (FIGURE 1.1). The students reported their findings to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, which investigated and found that 30%\u201340% of the frogs in the pond the students studied were deformed. FIGURE 1.1 Deformed Leopard Frog With its misshapen and extra leg, this individual shows one of the types of limb deformities that have become common in leopard frogs and other amphibian species. News of the students\u2019 discovery traveled fast, capturing public attention and spurring scientists to check for similar deformities in other parts of the country and in other amphibian species. It soon became apparent that the problem was widespread. In the United States, misshapen individuals were found in 46 states and in more than 60 species of frogs, salamanders, and toads. In some localities, more than 90% of the individuals were deformed. Deformed amphibians were also found in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Worldwide, the frequency of amphibian deformities was high and increasing. Adding to the alarm caused by the gruesome deformities were observations, beginning in the late 1980s, of another disturbing trend: global amphibian populations seemed to be in decline. By 1993, over 500 populations of frogs and salamanders from around the world were reported to be decreasing in size and some were under threat of extinction. In some cases, entire species were in danger; across the globe, hundreds of species were extinct, missing, or critically endangered (FIGURE 1.2). Since 1970, an estimated 200 species of frogs have gone extinct and the rate of extinctions is increasing (Alroy 2015). FIGURE 1.2 Amphibians in Decline In many regions of the world, amphibian species face increased risk of extinction. Each set of numbered circles is associated with one color-coded region on the map. (Map after AmphibiaWeb. 2019. https://amphibiaweb.org/declines/declines.html. University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. Accessed 25 Sep 2019; B. G. Holt et al. 2013. Science 339: 74\u201378. Data archived at http://macroecology.ku.dk/resources/wallace.) Species in other groups of organisms were also showing signs of decline, but scientists were especially worried about amphibians for three reasons. First, the decline appeared to have started recently across wide regions of the world. Second, some of the populations in decline were located in protected or pristine regions, seemingly far from the effects of human activities. Third, some scientists view amphibians as \u201cbiological indicators\u201d of environmental conditions. They hold this view in part because amphibians have permeable skin and eggs that lack shells or other protective coverings, which increases their sensitivity to toxic pollutants. In addition, most amphibians spend part of their lives in water and part on land. As a result, they are exposed to a wide range of potential threats, including water and air pollution as well as changes in temperature and in the amount of ultraviolet (UV) light in their environment. Moreover, many amphibians remain close to their birthplace throughout their lives, so the decline of a local population is likely to indicate a deterioration of local environmental conditions. Because amphibians worldwide were showing declining numbers and frequent deformities, scientists initially tried to find one or a few global causes that might explain these problems. However, as we\u2019ll see in this chapter, the story turned out to be more complicated than that: a single \u201csmoking gun\u201d has not emerged. What, then, has caused the global decline of amphibian populations? Introduction We humans have an enormous impact on our planet. Our activities have transformed over half of Earth\u2019s land surface and have altered the composition of the atmosphere, leading to global climate change. We have introduced many species to new regions, an action that can have severe negative effects on both native species and human economies.", "Even the oceans, seemingly so vast, show many signs of deterioration due to human activities, including declining fish stocks; widespread bleaching of once-spectacular coral reefs; the formation of large \u201cdead zones,\u201d regions where oxygen concentrations have dropped to levels low enough to kill many species; and acidification. Global changes like those we\u2019ve just described can occur when humans take actions without giving much thought to how our actions might affect the environment. In such situations, we have repeatedly been surprised by the unintended and harmful side effects of our actions. Fortunately, we are beginning to realize that a better understanding of how the natural systems of our environment work can help us to anticipate the consequences of our actions and fix the problems we have already caused. Our growing realization that we must understand how natural systems work brings us to the subject of this book. Natural systems are driven by the ways in which organisms interact with one another and with their physical environment. Thus, to understand how natural systems work, we must understand those interactions. Ecology is the scientific study of how organisms affect\u2014and are affected by\u2014other organisms and their environment. In this chapter, we\u2019ll introduce the study of ecology and its relevance for humans. We\u2019ll begin by exploring a theme that runs throughout this book: connections in nature. CONCEPT 1.1 Events in the natural world are interconnected. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.1.1 Explain how interactions between organisms and their environment can affect other organisms and potentially lead to unexpected consequences. Connections in Nature From what you have read or observed about nature, can you think of examples that might illustrate the phrase \u201cconnections in nature\u201d? In this book, we use that phrase to refer to the fact that events in the natural world can be linked or connected to one another. These connections occur as organisms interact with one another and with their physical environment. This does not necessarily mean that there are strong connections among all the organisms that live in a given area. Two species may live in the same area but have little influence on each other. But all organisms are connected to features of their environment. For example, they all require food, space, and other resources, and they all interact with other species and the physical environment as they pursue what they need to live. As a result, two species that do not interact directly with each other can be connected indirectly by shared features of their environment. Connections in nature are revealed as ecologists ask questions about the natural world and examine what they\u2019ve learned. To illustrate what this process can teach us about connections in nature, let\u2019s return to our discussion of amphibian deformities. Early observations suggest that parasites cause amphibian deformities Nine years before the Minnesota students made their startling discovery, Stephen Ruth was exploring ponds in Northern California when he found Pacific tree frogs (Pseudacris regilla) and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) with extra limbs, missing limbs, and other deformities. He asked Stanley Sessions, an expert in amphibian limb development, to examine his specimens. Sessions found that the deformed amphibians all contained a parasite, now known to be Ribeiroia ondatrae, a trematode flatworm. Sessions and Ruth hypothesized that the parasite caused the deformities. As an initial test of this hypothesis, they implanted small glass beads near the developing limb buds of tadpoles. These beads were meant to mimic the effects of Ribeiroia, which produces cysts near the areas where limbs form in a tadpole as it transitions into an adult frog. In a 1990 paper, Sessions and Ruth reported that the beads caused deformities similar to (but less severe than) those Ruth had found. A laboratory experiment tests the role of parasites When Ruth first observed deformed amphibians in the mid-1980s, he assumed that they were an isolated, local phenomenon. By 1996, Pieter Johnson, then an undergraduate at Stanford University, had learned of the Minnesota students\u2019 findings and of the paper by Sessions and Ruth. Although Sessions and Ruth provided indirect evidence that Ribeiroia may have caused amphibian deformities, they did not infect P. regilla or A. macrodactylum with Ribeiroia and show that deformities resulted. Furthermore, the two amphibian species they used in their experiments (the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, and the axolotl salamander, A. mexicanum) were not known to have limb deformities in nature.", "Building on the work done by Sessions and Ruth (1990), Johnson and his colleagues set out to provide a more direct test of whether Ribeiroia parasites can cause limb deformities in amphibians. They began by surveying 35 ponds in Santa Clara County, California. They found Pacific tree frogs in 13 of the surveyed ponds, and 4 of these ponds had deformed frogs. Concentrating on 2 of the ponds with deformed frogs, they found that 15%\u201345% of the tadpoles undergoing metamorphosis had extra limbs or other deformities (Johnson et al. 1999). One source of concern was that the deformities might be caused by pollutants, such as pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or heavy metals. However, none of these substances were found in water from the 2 ponds. Johnson and his colleagues then turned their attention to other factors that might cause the deformities. Aware that Sessions and Ruth had hypothesized that parasites could be the cause, Johnson et al. noted that of the 35 ponds they surveyed, the 4 ponds with deformed frogs were the only ponds that contained both tree frogs and the aquatic snail Helisoma tenuis. As shown in INTERACTIVE FIGURE 1.3, this snail is the first of two intermediate hosts required for the Ribeiroia parasite to complete its life cycle and produce offspring. The parasite also requires an amphibian or fish as a second intermediate host. In addition, dissections of abnormal frogs collected from the two ponds they studied in detail revealed Ribeiroia cysts in all the frogs with deformed limbs. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 1.3 The Life Cycle of Ribeiroia The parasitic flatworm Ribeiroia uses three different kinds of hosts: snails, fishes or larval amphibians, and birds or mammals. Many other parasites have similarly complex life cycles. Some parasites, like Ribeiroia, can alter the appearance or behavior of their second intermediate host in ways that make the host more vulnerable to predation by their final or definitive host. Like the findings of Sessions and Ruth, Johnson\u2019s observations provided only indirect evidence that Ribeiroia caused deformities in Pacific tree frogs. Next, Johnson and his colleagues returned to the laboratory to perform a more rigorous test of that idea. They did this by using a standard scientific approach: they performed a controlled experiment in which an experimental group (that has the factor being tested) was compared with a control group (that lacks the factor being tested). Johnson et al. collected P. regilla eggs from a region not known to have frog deformities, brought the eggs into the laboratory, and placed the tadpoles that hatched from them in 1-liter containers with one tadpole per container. Each tadpole was then assigned at random to one of four treatments, in which 0 (the control group), 16, 32, or 48 Ribeiroia parasites were placed in its container; these numbers were selected to match parasite levels that had been observed in the ponds. Johnson and his colleagues found that as the number of parasites increased, fewer of the tadpoles survived to metamorphosis, and more of the survivors had deformities (FIGURE 1.4). In the control group (with zero Ribeiroia), 88% of the tadpoles survived, and none had deformities (Johnson et al. 1999). The link had been made: Ribeiroia could cause frog deformities. Furthermore, since exposure to Ribeiroia killed up to 60% of the tadpoles, the results also suggested that the parasites could contribute to amphibian declines. FIGURE 1.4 Parasites Can Cause Amphibian Deformities The graph shows the relationship between the numbers of Ribeiroia parasites that tadpoles were exposed to and their rates of survival and deformity. Initial numbers of tadpoles were 35 in the control group (0 parasites) and 45 in each of the other three treatments. (After P. T. J. Johnson et al. 1999. Science 284: 802\u2013804.) Estimate the number of tadpoles in the control group that survived, as well as the number that had deformities. A field experiment suggests that multiple factors influence frog deformities A few years after Johnson and his colleagues published their research, other scientists showed that Ribeiroia parasites could cause limb deformities in other amphibian species, including western toads (Anaxyrus boreas), wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), and leopard frogs (L. pipiens, the species in which the Minnesota students had discovered deformities). While Ribeiroia was clearly important, some researchers suspected that other factors might also play a role. Pesticides, for example, were known to contaminate some of the ponds in which deformed frogs were found.", "To examine the possible joint effects of parasites and pesticides, Joseph Kiesecker conducted a field experiment in six ponds, all of which contained Ribeiroia, but only some of which contained pesticides (Kiesecker 2002). Three of the ponds in Kiesecker\u2019s study were close to farm fields, and water tests indicated that each of these ponds contained detectable levels of pesticides. The other three ponds were not as close to farm fields, and none of them showed detectable levels of pesticides. In each of the six ponds, Kiesecker placed wood frog tadpoles in cages made with a mesh through which water could flow but tadpoles could not escape. Six cages were placed in each pond; three of the cages had a mesh through which Ribeiroia parasites could pass, while the other three had a mesh too small for the parasites. Thus, in each pond, the tadpoles in three cages were exposed to the parasites, while the tadpoles in the other three cages were not. The results showed that Ribeiroia caused limb deformities in the field (FIGURE 1.5). No deformities were found in frogs raised in cages whose small mesh size (75 \u03bcm) prevented the entry of Ribeiroia, regardless of which pond the cages were in. Deformities were found in some of the frogs raised in cages whose larger mesh size (500 \u03bcm) allowed the entry of Ribeiroia. In addition, dissections revealed that every frog with a deformity was infected by Ribeiroia. However, a greater percentage of frogs had deformities in the ponds that contained pesticides than in the ponds that did not (29% vs. 4%). Overall, the results of this experiment indicated that (1) exposure to Ribeiroia was necessary for deformities to occur, and (2) when frogs were exposed to Ribeiroia, deformities were more common in ponds with detectable levels of pesticides than in ponds without detectable levels of pesticides. FIGURE 1.5 Do the Effects of Ribeiroia and Pesticides Interact in Nature? To test the effects of Ribeiroia and pesticides on frog deformities in the field, screened cages were placed in six ponds. Three of the six ponds contained detectable levels of pesticides; the other three did not. (After J. M. Kiesecker. 2002. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99: 9900\u2013 9904. \u00a9 2002 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.) Based on the results shown here, do pesticides acting alone cause frog deformities? Do the results indicate that pesticides affect frogs? If so, do they indicate how? Explain. Based on these results, Kiesecker hypothesized that pesticides might decrease the ability of frogs to resist infection by parasites. To test whether pesticides had such an effect, Kiesecker (2002) brought wood frog tadpoles into the laboratory, where he reared some in an environment with pesticides and others in an environment without pesticides, then exposed all of them to Ribeiroia. The tadpoles exposed to pesticides had fewer white blood cells (indicating a suppressed immune system) and a higher rate of Ribeiroia cyst formation (FIGURE 1.6). Together, Kiesecker\u2019s laboratory and field results suggested that pesticide exposure can affect the frequency with which parasites cause deformities in amphibian populations. This conclusion has since been supported by other studies. Field surveys and laboratory experiments in Rohr et al. (2008), for example, indicated that exposure to pesticides can increase the number of trematode infections and decrease survival rates in several frog species. As in Kiesecker\u2019s study, one reason for the increased number of parasitic infections appeared to be that the frogs\u2019 immune response was suppressed by the pesticide. FIGURE 1.6 Pesticides May Weaken Tadpole Immune Systems In a laboratory experiment, wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles were exposed to low or high concentrations of the pesticide esfenvalerate and then exposed to 50 Ribeiroia parasites per tadpole. The tadpoles were then examined for (A) numbers of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell used in the immune response) and (B) numbers of Ribeiroia cysts. Two types of controls were used: one in which only parasites were added to the tadpoles\u2019 containers (\u201ccontrol\u201d), and another in which both parasites and the solvent used to dissolve the pesticide were added (\u201csolvent control\u201d). Error bars show one SE of the mean (see WEB STATS REVIEW 1.1.2). (After J. M. Kiesecker, 2002. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99: 9900\u20139904. \u00a9 2002 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.) What was the purpose of using two types of controls in this experiment? Connections in nature can lead to unanticipated impacts As we have seen, the immediate cause of amphibian deformities is often infection by Ribeiroia parasites.", "But we also noted in the Case Study that amphibian deformities are occurring more often now than in the past. Why has the frequency of amphibian deformities increased? One possible answer is suggested by the results of Kiesecker (2002) and Rohr et al. (2008): pesticides may decrease the ability of amphibians to ward off parasite attack, and hence deformities are more likely in environments that contain pesticides. The first synthetic pesticides were developed in the late 1930s, and their use has risen dramatically since that time. Thus, it is likely that amphibian exposure to pesticides has increased considerably through time, which may help to explain the recent rise in the frequency of amphibian deformities. Other environmental changes may also contribute to the observed increase in amphibian deformities. For example, the addition of nutrients to natural or artificial ponds (used to store water for cattle or crops) can lead to increases in parasite infections and amphibian deformities (Johnson et al. 2007). Nutrients can enter a pond when rain or snowmelt washes fertilizers from an agricultural field into it. Fertilizer inputs often stimulate increased growth of algae, and the snails that harbor Ribeiroia parasites eat algae (to refresh your memory of the parasite\u2019s life cycle, see Interactive Figure 1.3). Thus, as the algae increase, so do the snail hosts of Ribeiroia. An increase in snails tends to increase the number of Ribeiroia found in the pond. Here, a chain of events that begins with increased fertilizer use by people ends with increased numbers of Ribeiroia, and hence increased numbers of deformed amphibians. As this example illustrates, events in the natural world are connected. As a result, when people alter one aspect of the environment, we can cause other changes that we do not intend or anticipate. When we increased our use of pesticides and fertilizers, we did not intend to increase the frequency of deformities in frogs. Nevertheless, we seem to have done just that. The indirect and unanticipated effects of human actions include more than bizarre deformities in frogs. Indeed, some changes we are making to our local and global environment appear to have increased human health risks. The damming of rivers in Africa has created favorable habitat for snails that harbor trematode parasites that cause schistosomiasis, thereby increasing the spread of an infection that can weaken or kill people. Globally, the past few decades have seen an increase in the appearance and spread of new diseases, such as AIDS, Lyme disease, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and West Nile virus. Many public health experts think that the effects of human actions on the environment have contributed to the emergence of these and other new diseases (Weiss and McMichael 2004). For example, West Nile virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and infects birds and humans, is thought to have been introduced into North America by people in 1999 (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 1.7). Furthermore, the incidence of West Nile virus in humans is influenced by factors such as human population size, the extent of land development, the abundance and identity of mosquito and bird species, and variations in temperature and rainfall (Reisen et al. 2006; Landesman et al. 2007; Allan et al. 2009). Each of these factors can be affected by human actions, either directly (e.g., by urban or agricultural development) or indirectly (e.g., as a result of climate change; see Concepts 25.2 and 25.3). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 1.7 Rapid Spread of a Deadly Disease Within 13 years, West Nile virus had spread from its North American point of entry (New York City) to all of the lower 48 states. Birds are a primary host for West Nile virus, which may help to explain its rapid spread. Mosquitoes transmit the disease from birds and other animal hosts to people. Numbers show the cumulative number of human cases in each state by December 31, 2018. Not shown: Data for Alaska (1 case in 2018), Hawaii (1 case in 2014), and Puerto Rico (1 case in 2012). (Data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) As we\u2019ve seen, connections in nature can cause human actions to have unanticipated side effects. Moreover, if you live in a city, it can be easy to forget the extent to which everything you do depends on the natural world. Your house or apartment shelters you from the elements and keeps you warm in winter and cool in summer. Similarly, you obtain food from a grocery store, clothes from a shop or department store, water from a faucet.", "Ultimately, however, each of these items\u2014and everything else you use or own\u2014comes from or depends on the natural environment. No matter how far from the natural world our day-to-day activities take us, people, like all other organisms on Earth, are part of an interconnected web of life. Let\u2019s turn now to the study of these connections, the scientific discipline of ecology. Self-Assessment 1.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 1.2 Ecology is the scientific study of interactions between organisms and their environment. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.2.1 Summarize how the inquiries of ecologists and environmental scientists differ. 1.2.2 Outline how ecologists use spatial and temporal scales when testing their hypotheses. What Is Ecology? In this book, ecology is defined as the scientific study of interactions between organisms and their environment. This definition is meant to include the interactions of organisms with one another because, as we have seen, organisms are an important part of one another\u2019s environment. Ecology can also be defined in a variety of other ways, such as the scientific study of interactions that determine the distribution (geographic location) and abundance of organisms. As will become clear as you read this book, these definitions of ecology can be related to one another, and each emphasizes different aspects of the discipline. A more important point for our purpose here is that the term \u201cecology,\u201d as used by ecologists, refers to a scientific endeavor. We emphasize this point because \u201cecology\u201d has other meanings in its public usage. People who are not scientists may assume that an \u201cecologist\u201d is an environmental activist. Some ecologists are activists, but some are not. Furthermore, as a scientific discipline, ecology is related to\u2014yet different from\u2014other disciplines such as environmental science. Ecology is a branch of biology, while environmental science is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates concepts from the natural sciences (including ecology) and the social sciences (e.g., politics, economics, ethics). Compared with ecology, environmental science is focused more specifically on how people affect the environment and how we can address environmental problems. While an ecologist might examine pollution as one of several factors that influence the reproductive success of wetland plants, an environmental scientist might focus on how economic and political systems could be used to reduce pollution. Public and professional ideas about ecology often differ Surveys have shown that many people think that there is a \u201cbalance of nature,\u201d in which natural systems are stable and tend to return to an original, preferred state after a disturbance, and that each species in nature has a distinct role to play in maintaining that balance. Such ideas about ecological systems can have moral or ethical implications. For example, the view that each species has a distinct function can lead people to think that each species is important and irreplaceable, which in turn can cause people to feel that it is wrong to harm other species. As summarized by one interviewee in a survey on the meaning of ecology (Uddenberg et al. 1995, as quoted in Westoby 1997), \u201cThere is a certain balance in nature, and there is a place for all species. There is a reason for their existence and we are not free to exterminate them.\u201d Public views on the balance of nature with stable, orderly systems were once held by many ecologists. However, ecologists now recognize (1) that natural systems do not necessarily return to their original state after a disturbance and (2) that random effects often play important roles in nature. For example, as we will see in Unit 5, current evidence suggests that different communities can form in the same area under similar environmental conditions. Therefore, unless they provide careful qualifications, few ecologists today speak of a balance of nature. Some ecological concepts have remained unchanged through time. In particular, early ecologists and modern ecologists would agree that events in nature are interconnected (via the physical environment and via interactions among species). As a result, a change in one part of an ecological system can alter other parts of that system, including those that govern life-supporting processes such as the purification and replenishment of air, water, and soil. Overall, although the natural world may not be as predictable or as tightly woven as early ecologists may have thought, species are connected to one another. For some people, the fact that events in nature are interconnected provides an ethical imperative to protect natural systems.", "A person who feels an ethical obligation to protect human life, for example, may also feel an ethical obligation to protect the natural systems on which human life depends. The scale of an ecological study affects what can be learned from it Whether they study individual organisms or the diversity of life on Earth\u2014or anything in between\u2014 ecologists always draw boundaries around what they observe. An ecologist interested in frog deformities might ignore the birds that migrate above the study site, while an ecologist studying bird migrations might ignore the details of what occurs in the ponds below. It is not possible or desirable to study everything at once. When they seek to answer a particular question, ecologists must select the most appropriate dimension, or scale, in both time and space, for collecting observations. Every ecological study addresses events at some scales but ignores events at other scales. A study on the activities of soil microorganisms, for example, might be conducted at a small spatial scale (e.g., measurements might be collected at centimeter to meter scales). For a study addressing how atmospheric pollutants affect the global climate, on the other hand, the scale of observation would be large indeed and might include Earth\u2019s entire atmosphere. Ecological studies also differ greatly in the time scales they cover. Some studies, such as those that document how leaves respond to momentary increases in the availability of sunlight, concern events on short time scales (seconds to hours). Others, such as studies that use fossil data to show how the species found in a given area have changed over time, address events at much longer time scales (centuries to millennia or longer). Ecology is broad in scope Ecologists study interactions in nature across many levels of biological organization. For example, some ecologists are interested in how particular genes or proteins enable organisms to respond to environmental challenges. Other ecologists study how hormones influence social interactions in animals, or how specialized tissues or organ systems allow animals to cope with extreme environments. However, even among ecologists whose research is focused on lower levels of biological organization (e.g., from molecules to organ systems), ecological studies usually emphasize one or more of the following levels: individuals, populations, communities, ecosystems, landscapes, or the entire biosphere (FIGURE 1.8). FIGURE 1.8 An Ecological Hierarchy As suggested by this series of photographs, life in the reef ecosystem can be studied at a number of levels, from individuals to the biosphere. These levels are nested within one another, in the sense that each level is composed of groups of the entity found in the level below it. A population is a group of individuals of a single species that live in a particular area and interact with one another. Many of the central questions in ecology concern how and why the locations and abundances of populations change over time. To answer such questions, it is often helpful to understand the roles played by other species. Thus, many ecologists study nature at the level of the community, which is an association of interacting populations of different species that live in the same area. Communities can cover large or small areas, and they can differ greatly in terms of the numbers and types of species found within them (FIGURE 1.9). FIGURE 1.9 A Few of Earth\u2019s Many Communities These photographs show (A) a wetland community in Tanzania; (B) a dense rainforest in Monteverde, Costa Rica; (C) a sand dune with heather (Calluna vulgaris) in bloom on Texel Island, Holland; and (D) a coral reef with a variety of corals and sponges in the Gulf of Mexico, Cozumel. Ecological studies at the population and community levels often examine not only the effects of the biotic, or living, components of a natural system, but also those of the abiotic, or physical, environment. For example, a population or community ecologist might ask whether features of the abiotic environment, such as climate and soils, influence the fertility of individuals or the relative abundances of the different species found in a community. Other ecologists are particularly interested in how ecosystems work. An ecosystem is a collection of communities of organisms (e.g., plants, birds) plus the physical environment in which they live. An ecologist studying ecosystems might want to know the rate at which a chemical (such as nitrogen) enters a particular community, as well as how the species living there affect what happens to the chemical once it enters the community.", "For example, ecosystem ecologists studying amphibian deformities might document the rates at which nitrogen from fertilizers enters ponds that do and do not contain deformed amphibians, or they might determine how the presence or absence of algae affects what happens to nitrogen once it has entered the ponds. Across larger spatial regions, ecologists study landscapes, which are areas that vary substantially from one place to another, typically including multiple ecosystems. Finally, global patterns of air and water circulation (see Concept 2.2) link the world\u2019s ecosystems into the biosphere, which consists of all living organisms on Earth plus the environments in which they live. The biosphere forms the highest level of biological organization. Over recent decades, as we will see in Unit 7, ecologists have acquired new tools that improve their ability to study the big picture: how the biosphere works. As just one example, ecologists can now use satellite data to answer questions such as, How do different ecosystems contribute to ongoing changes in the global concentration of carbon dioxide (CO ) in the atmosphere? 2 Some key terms are helpful for studying connections in nature Whether we are discussing individuals, populations, communities, or ecosystems, all chapters of this book incorporate the principle that events in the natural world are interconnected. For example, in Unit 3, we will see how an explosion in the population size of an introduced species (the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi) altered the entire Black Sea ecosystem. Because we stress connections in nature in every chapter, and hence may discuss ecosystems in a chapter about organisms, or vice versa, we describe here a handful of key terms that you will need to know as you begin your study of ecology. These terms are also summarized in Table 1.1. TABLE 1.1 Key Terms for Studying Connections in Nature Term Definition Adaptation A feature of an organism that improves its ability to survive or reproduce in its environment Natural selection An evolutionary process in which individuals that possess particular characteristics survive or reproduce at a higher rate than other individuals because of those characteristics Producer An organism that uses energy from an external source, such as the sun, to produce its own food without having to eat other organisms or their remains Consumer An organism that obtains its energy by eating other organisms or their remains Net primary production (NPP) The amount of energy (per unit of time) that producers fix by photosynthesis or other means, minus the amount they use in cellular respiration Nutrient cycle The cyclic movement of a nutrient between organisms and the physical environment A universal feature of living systems is that they change over time, or evolve. Depending on the questions or time scale of interest, evolution can be defined as (1) a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time or as (2) descent with modification, the process by which organisms gradually accumulate differences from their ancestors. We will discuss evolution in the context of ecology more fully in Chapter 6, but here we define two key evolutionary terms: \u201cadaptation\u201d and \u201cnatural selection.\u201d An adaptation is a genetically based characteristic of an organism that improves its ability to survive or reproduce within its environment. Adaptations are of critical importance for understanding how organisms function and interact with one another. As we\u2019ll see in Concept 6.3, although several mechanisms can cause evolutionary change, only natural selection can produce adaptations consistently. In the process of natural selection, individuals with particular characteristics tend to survive and reproduce at a higher rate than other individuals because of those characteristics. If the characteristics being selected for are heritable, then the offspring of individuals favored by natural selection will tend to have the same characteristics that gave their parents an advantage. As a result, the frequency of those characteristics in a population may increase over time. If that occurs, the population will have evolved. Consider what happens within the body of a person taking an antibiotic. Some of the bacteria that live inside that person may possess genes that provide resistance to the antibiotic. Because of those genes, those bacteria will survive and reproduce at a higher rate than will nonresistant bacteria (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 1.10). Because the trait on which natural selection acts (antibiotic resistance) is heritable, the offspring of the resistant bacteria will tend to be resistant. As a result, the proportion of resistant bacteria in the person\u2019s body will increase over time, and the bacterial population will have evolved.", "INTERACTIVE FIGURE 1.10 Natural Selection in Action As shown in this diagram, in which a sieve represents the selective effects of an antibiotic, natural selection can cause the frequency of antibiotic resistance in bacteria to increase over time. The remaining four key terms that we\u2019ll introduce here concern ecosystem processes. One way to look at how ecosystems work is to consider the movement of energy and materials through a community. Energy enters the community when an organism such as a plant or bacterium captures energy from an external source, such as the sun, and uses that energy to produce food. An organism that can produce its own food from an external energy source without having to eat other organisms or their remains is called a producer (such organisms are also called primary producers or autotrophs). An organism that obtains its energy by eating other organisms or their remains is called a consumer (or a heterotroph). Per unit of time, the amount of energy that producers capture by photosynthesis or other means, minus the amount they lose as metabolic heat in cellular respiration, is called net primary production (NPP). Changes in NPP can have large effects on ecosystem function, and NPP varies greatly from one ecosystem to another. Each unit of energy captured by producers is eventually lost from the ecosystem as metabolic heat (FIGURE 1.11). As a result, energy moves through ecosystems in a single direction only\u2014it cannot be recycled. Nutrients, however, are recycled from the physical environment to organisms and back again. The cyclic movement of a nutrient such as phosphorus between organisms and the physical environment is referred to as a nutrient cycle. Life as we know it would cease if nutrients were not cycled, because the molecules organisms need for their growth and reproduction would be much less readily available. FIGURE 1.11 How Ecosystems Work Each time one organism eats another, a portion of the energy originally captured by a producer is lost as heat given off during the chemical breakdown of food by cellular respiration. As a result, energy flows through the ecosystem in a single direction and is not recycled. Nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen, on the other hand, cycle between organisms and the physical environment. Describe the three main steps by which a nutrient cycles through an ecosystem. Whether they are concerned with adaptations or NPP, populations or ecosystems, the scientists who study ecological systems have not produced a fixed body of knowledge. Instead, what we know about ecology changes constantly as ideas are tested and, if necessary, revised or discarded as new information emerges. As we will see in the next section, ecology, like all branches of science, is about answering questions and seeking to understand the underlying causes of natural phenomena.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1.3.1 Compare the advantages and disadvantages of using field observations, field experiments, and lab experiments to test ecological hypotheses. 1.3.2 Describe the importance of hypotheses, controls, replication, and data analysis to the scientific process. Answering Ecological Questions The studies of amphibian deformities that we discussed earlier in this chapter illustrate several ways in which ecologists seek to answer questions about the natural world. The study by Johnson and his colleagues (1999), for example, had two key components: observational studies in the field and a controlled experiment in the laboratory. In the observational part of their work, the researchers surveyed ponds, noted the species present, and observed that tree frog deformities were found only in ponds that contained both tree frogs and a snail that harbored the Ribeiroia parasite. These observations suggested that Ribeiroia might cause deformities, so Johnson and his colleagues performed a laboratory experiment to test whether that was the case (it was). Kiesecker (2002) extended these results in two experiments, one performed in the field, the other in the laboratory. To examine the effects of pesticides on frog deformities, Kiesecker compared results from three ponds with pesticides with results from three ponds without detectable levels of pesticides. While this approach had the advantage of allowing the effects of Ribeiroia to be examined under different field conditions (in ponds with and without pesticides), Kiesecker could not control the conditions as precisely as he did in his laboratory experiment.", "The constraints of working in the field meant, for example, that he could not start out with six identical ponds, then add pesticides to three of them but not to the other three\u2014an experiment that would test more directly whether pesticides were responsible for the results he obtained. As this example suggests, no single approach works best in all situations, so ecologists use a variety of methods when seeking to answer ecological questions. Ecologists use experiments, observations, and models to answer ecological questions In an ecological experiment, an investigator alters one or more features of the environment and observes the effect of that change, a procedure that allows scientists to test whether one factor has a cause-and-effect relationship with another. When possible, such experiments include both a control group (which is not subjected to alterations) and one or more experimental groups. When performing an experiment, ecologists have a range of types and scales to choose from, including laboratory studies, small-scale field studies that cover a few square meters, and large-scale field studies in which entire ecosystems, such as lakes or forests, are manipulated (FIGURE 1.12). FIGURE 1.12 Ecological Experiments The spatial scale of experiments in ecology range from (A) laboratory experiments to (B) small-scale field experiments conducted in natural or artificial environments to (C) large-scale experiments that alter major components of an ecosystem, as seen in this clear-cut watershed. In some cases, however, it can be difficult or impossible to perform an appropriate experiment. For example, when ecologists are seeking to understand events that cover large geographic regions or occur over long periods, experiments can provide useful information, but they cannot provide convincing answers to the underlying questions of interest. As an example, let\u2019s consider global warming. CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION APPROACHES USED TO STUDY GLOBAL WARMING As we will see in Figure 25.11, temperature data show that Earth\u2019s climate is warming, but the future magnitude and effects of global warming remain uncertain. We are not sure, for example, how the geographic ranges of different species will change as a result of the projected temperature increases. There is only one Earth, so of course even if we wanted to, we could not apply different levels of global warming to copies of the planet and then observe how the ranges of species change over time in each of our experimental treatments. Instead, we must approach such problems using a mixture of observational studies, experiments, and modeling approaches. Field observations reveal that many species have shifted their ranges poleward or up the sides of mountains in a manner that is consistent with the amount of global warming that has already occurred (Parmesan 2006). Field observations can also be used to summarize the environmental conditions under which species are currently found, and experiments can be used to examine the performance of species under different environmental conditions. To put all this information together, scientists can use results from observational studies and experiments to develop quantitative models that predict how the geographic ranges of species will change depending on how much the planet actually warms in the future. The observation that global warming has already altered the geographic ranges of species brings us to a topic addressed in many chapters of this book: climate change. This term refers to a directional change in climate (such as warming) that occurs over three decades or longer. As you\u2019ll read in later chapters, climate affects nearly all aspects of ecology, such as the growth and survival of individuals, interactions between members of different species, and the relative abundances of species in ecological communities. These observations suggest that changes to climate may have far-reaching effects\u2014and they do, as shown by the changes that have already occurred in the physiology, survival, reproduction, or geographic ranges of hundreds of species (Parmesan 2006). (See ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 1.1 for further information on the ecological effects of climate change.) Experiments are designed and analyzed in consistent ways When ecologists perform experiments, they often take the three additional steps described in ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 1.1: they replicate each treatment, they assign treatments at random, and they analyze the results using statistical methods. Replication means that each treatment, including the control, is performed more than once. An advantage of replication is that as the number of replicates increases, it becomes less likely that the results are due to a variable that was not measured or controlled in the study.", "Imagine that Kiesecker had performed his field experiment with only two ponds, one with detectable levels of pesticides and the other without. Suppose he had found that frog deformities were more common in the single pond that contained pesticides. While pesticides might have been responsible for this result, the two ponds could have differed in many other ways, too, one or more of which might have been the real cause of the deformities. By using three ponds with pesticides and three ponds without pesticides, Kiesecker made it less likely that each of the three ponds with pesticides also contained something else\u2014some variable not controlled in his experiment\u2014that increased the chance of frog deformities. In his experiment, Kiesecker accounted for the possible effects of some uncontrolled variables: he showed, for example, that the number of snails and the frequency of their infection by Ribeiroia were similar in all six ponds, thus making it unlikely that the ponds with pesticides had many more Ribeiroia than the ponds without pesticides. ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 1.1 A key step in any ecological experiment occurs well before it is performed: the experiment must be designed carefully. In a controlled experiment, an experimental group, which has the factor being tested, is compared with a control group, which does not. Different levels of the factor being tested are often referred to as different treatments. For example, in the experiment by Johnson et al. (1999) discussed earlier in this chapter, the control group received a treatment of 0 parasites per container, while members of the experimental group were assigned to one of three other treatments (16, 32, or 48 parasites per container). The design of many ecological experiments includes three additional steps: replication, random assignment of treatments, and statistical analyses. Replication and random assignment of treatments are used to reduce the chance that variables not under the control of the experimenter will unduly influence the results of the experiment. Once the experiment has been completed, statistical analyses are used to assess the extent to which the results from the different treatments differ from one another. Several features of experimental design can be illustrated by the layout used in field studies performed by Richard B. Root and colleagues at Cornell University. In one such study, Carson and Root (2000) examined how herbivorous (planteating) insects affected a plant community dominated by the goldenrod Solidago altissima. Their first step was to define their research question: Does plant abundance, growth, or reproduction differ between insecticide-treated and control plots? To find out, they divided a field of goldenrods into the grid of 5 \u00d7 5 m plots shown in FIGURE A. The experiment ran for 10 years and used two treatments: a control, in which natural processes were left undisturbed, and an insect removal treatment, in which an insecticide was applied annually to reduce the numbers of herbivorous insects. Carson and Root selected 30 plots at random for use in the experiment; half of those plots were then selected at random to receive the insecticide treatment, while the remaining plots served as controls. Thus, there were 15 replicates for each treatment. Statistical analyses of the results indicated that herbivorous insects had major effects on the plant community, as is also suggested by the photograph in FIGURE B. Figure A Carson and Root\u2019s Field Experiment This aerial photograph shows the field divided (by mowing) into 112 plots, each 5 \u00d7 5 m. Thirty of these plots were used in the experiment described here; the rest of the plots were used in other experiments. Figure B Carson and Root\u2019s Results A plot sprayed with insecticide (right) is shown surrounded by several control plots. Ecologists also seek to limit the effects of unmeasured variables by assigning treatments at random. Suppose an investigator wanted to test whether insects that eat plants decrease the number of seeds the plants produce. One way to test this idea would be to divide an area into a series of plots (see Ecological Toolkit 1.1), some of which would be sprayed regularly with an insecticide (the experimental plots) while others would be left alone (the control plots). The decision as to whether a particular plot would be sprayed (or not) would be made at random at the start of the experiment. Assigning treatments at random would make it less likely that the plots that receive a particular treatment share other characteristics that might influence seed production, such as high or low levels of soil nutrients.", "Finally, ecologists use statistical analyses to determine whether their results are \u201csignificant.\u201d To understand why, let\u2019s turn again to Kiesecker\u2019s experiment. It would have been surprising if Kiesecker had found that rates of frog deformities in ponds with pesticides were exactly equal to those in ponds without pesticides. But how different would those rates have to be to show that the pesticides are having an effect? Since the results of different experimental treatments will rarely be identical, the investigator must ask whether an observed difference is due to the experimental treatments and not to chance. Statistical methods are often used as a standardized way to help make this decision. We describe general statistical principles and one statistical method, the t-test, in WEB STATS REVIEW 2.2. There are many different types of statistical analyses; books such as those by Zar (2009), Sokal and Rohlf (2011), and Gotelli and Ellison (2013) provide examples of which statistical methods to use under various circumstances. What we know about ecology is always changing The information in this book is not a static body of knowledge. Instead, like the natural world itself, our understanding of ecology is constantly changing. Like all scientists, ecologists observe nature and ask questions about how nature works. For example, when the existence of amphibian deformities became widely known in 1995, some scientists set out to answer a series of questions about those deformities. There were many things they wanted to know: How many species were afflicted by deformities? Did amphibian deformities occur in a few or many geographic regions? What caused the deformities, and did these causes differ among species or geographic regions? The questions stimulated by the discovery of amphibian deformities illustrate the first in a series of four steps by which scientists can learn about the natural world. These four steps constitute the scientific method, which can be summarized as follows: 1. Observe nature and ask a well-framed question about those observations. 2. Use previous knowledge or intuition to develop possible answers to that question. In science, such possible explanations of a well-framed question are called hypotheses. 3. Evaluate competing hypotheses by performing experiments or gathering carefully selected observations. 4. Use the results of those experiments, observations, or models to modify one or more of the hypotheses, to pose new questions, or to draw conclusions about the natural world. This four-step process is iterative and self-correcting. New observations lead to new questions, which stimulate ecologists to formulate and test new ideas about how nature works. The results from such tests can lead to new knowledge, still more questions, or the abandonment of ideas that fail to explain the results. Although this four-step process is not followed exactly in all scientific studies, the back-and-forth between observations, questions, and results\u2014potentially leading to a reevaluation of existing ideas\u2014captures the essence of how science is done. We\u2019ve already seen some examples of how the process of scientific inquiry works: as answers to some questions about amphibian deformities were found, new questions arose, and new discoveries were made. You can explore one such discovery in ANALYZING DATA 1.1, which examines whether introduced species can cause amphibian populations to decline. Indeed, new discoveries occur in all fields of ecology, suggesting that our understanding of ecological processes is, and always will be, a work in progress. ANALYZING DATA 1.1 Introduced predators are one of many factors thought to have contributed to amphibian population declines, although only a few studies have tested this hypothesis. In one such study, Vance Vredenburg* assessed the effects of two introduced fish species, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), on a frog species in decline, the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa). Prior to any experimental manipulations, Vredenburg surveyed 39 lakes. For each lake, he noted whether introduced trout were present and then estimated frog abundance; the data from his survey include the following: Lake status Trout absent Trout present Average frog density (per 10 m of shoreline) 184.8 15.3 Vredenburg then performed experiments in which he compared frog abundances in three categories of lakes: removal lakes (from which he removed introduced trout), fishless control lakes (that had never contained trout), and fish control lakes (that still contained trout). The data obtained from these experiments appear in the graph. Error bars show one SE of the mean. 1.", "From the survey data in the table, construct a bar graph showing the average density of frogs in lakes with and without trout (see WEB STATS REVIEW 1.1.2 for a description of bar graphs). What can you conclude from these data? In your answer, distinguish between causation and correlation. 2. Explain why two types of control lakes were used in the experiment. 3. Consider the data for removal lakes 1, 2, and 3. For each of these lakes, calculate (a) the average number of frogs (per 10 m of shoreline) for the 1-year period that ends just before the time frame during which trout were removed and (b) the average number of frogs (per 10 m of shoreline) for the 1-year period that starts a year after the removal of trout began. What can you conclude from these calculations? 4. What do the survey and experimental results suggest about (a) the effect of introduced trout on amphibian populations and (b) prospects for population recovery once trout are removed? * See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise.

Self-Assessment 1.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Deformity and Decline in Amphibian Populations As we\u2019ve seen in this chapter, amphibian deformities are often caused by parasites, but they can also be influenced by other factors, such as exposure to pesticides or fertilizers. Studies have also suggested that a range of factors can cause amphibian abundances to drop. Such factors include habitat loss, parasites and diseases, pollution, climate change, overexploitation, and introduced species. A consensus has yet to be reached on the relative importance of these and other factors that affect amphibian declines. For example, Stuart et al. (2004) analyzed the results of studies on 435 amphibian species that have experienced rapid declines since 1980. Habitat loss was the primary cause of decline for the largest number of species (183 species), followed by overexploitation (50 species). The cause of decline for the remaining 207 species was listed as \u201cenigmatic\u201d: populations of these species were declining rapidly for reasons that were poorly understood. Skerratt et al. (2007) argued that many such enigmatic declines were caused by pathogens such as the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a fungus that causes a lethal skin disease. This conclusion has now been supported by many other studies (e.g., Voyles et al. 2009; Berger et al. 2016). Although the fungus continues to spread rapidly and has driven hundreds of amphibian populations to extinction, there are signs of hope. For example, McMahon et al. (2014) have shown that some amphibians can acquire resistance to B. dendrobatidis when exposed to live or dead fungus, while others have found evidence of resistance in wild populations (Eskew et al. 2015; Voyles et al. 2018). Other researchers have emphasized the importance of ongoing climate change. Hof et al. (2011), for example, project that by 2080, climate change will harm more amphibian species than will B. dendrobatidis. The impacts of factors such as disease and climate change are not mutually exclusive, however. Indeed, Rohr and Raffel (2010) found that while disease often led to amphibian declines, climate change also played a key role. In particular, the impact of increased temperature variability appears to have decreased the resistance of frogs to B. dendrobatidis (Raffel et al. 2012). Collectively, these and other studies of amphibian population declines suggest that no single factor can explain most of them. Instead, the declines seem to be caused by complex factors that often act together and may vary from place to place. Consider, for example, the effects of pesticides. Although pesticides appear to increase the incidence of frog deformities, many studies have failed to link pesticides to decreases in the size of amphibian populations. However, many of these negative findings came from laboratory studies that held other factors constant and examined the effect of pesticides alone on amphibian growth or survival. Rick Relyea, of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, repeated such experiments, but with an added twist: predators. In two of six amphibian species studied, pesticides became up to 46 times more lethal if tadpoles sensed the presence of a predator (Relyea 2003). The predators were kept separate from the tadpoles by netting, but the tadpoles could smell them.", "In Relyea\u2019s experiments, the ability of some tadpoles to cope with pesticides was reduced by stress caused by the presence of a predator. The mechanism by which these two factors act together is unknown. In general, although we know that a broad set of factors can cause frog deformities and declines (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 1.13), relatively little is known about the extent to which these factors interact or how any such interactions exert their effects. In this and many other areas of ecology, we have learned enough to solve parts of the mystery, yet more remains to be discovered. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 1.13 Complex Causation of Amphibian Deformities and Declines As we have seen, amphibian deformities can be caused by parasites such as Ribeiroia. However, other factors\u2014many of them a result of human actions\u2014may interact to cause amphibian deformities and declines. (After A. R. Blaustein and P. T. J. Johnson. 2003. Sci Am 288: 60\u201365.) CONNECTIONS in NATURE MISSION IMPOSSIBLE? As we emphasized in the opening pages of this chapter, people have begun to realize that it is important for us to understand how nature works, if only to protect ourselves from inadvertently changing our environment in ways that cause us harm. Does the fact that the natural world is vast, complex, and interconnected mean that it is impossible to understand? Most ecologists do not think so. Our understanding of natural systems has improved greatly over the last 100 years. Ongoing efforts to understand how nature works are sure to be challenging, but such efforts are also enormously exciting and important. What we learn, and how we use that knowledge, will have a great impact on the current and future well-being of human societies. Whatever your career path, we hope this book will help you understand the natural world in which you live, as well as how you affect\u2014and are affected by\u2014that world. Unit 1 The Physical Environment KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 2.1 Climate is the most fundamental component of the physical environment. CONCEPT 2.2 Winds and ocean currents result from differences in solar radiation across Earth\u2019s surface. CONCEPT 2.3 Large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns establish global patterns of temperature and precipitation. CONCEPT 2.4 Regional climates reflect the influence of oceans and continents, mountains, and vegetation. CONCEPT 2.5 Seasonal and decadal climate variation are associated with changes in Earth\u2019s position relative to the sun and the strength of atmospheric pressure cells. CONCEPT 2.6 Salinity, acidity, and oxygen concentrations are major determinants of the chemical environment. Climate Variation and Salmon Abundance: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 Grizzly bears of the Pacific Northwest feast seasonally on the salmon that arrive in huge numbers to reproduce in the streams of the region (FIGURE 2.1). Salmon are anadromous; that is, they are born in freshwater streams, spend their adult lives in the ocean, and then return to spawn in the freshwater habitats where they were born. Grizzlies capitalize on the salmon\u2019s reproductive habits, gorging themselves on this rich food resource. These normally aggressive bears will forgo their usual territorial behavior and tolerate high densities of other bears while fishing for salmon. FIGURE 2.1 A Seasonal Opportunity Grizzly bears feed on salmon migrating upstream in streams and rivers in Alaska to reproduce. The size of the salmon run each year depends in part on physical conditions in the Pacific Ocean, many miles away. Bears are not the only species that rely on salmon for food. Salmon have been an important part of the human economy of the Pacific Northwest for millennia. The fish were a staple of the diets of Native Americans in this region as well as a central part of their cultural and spiritual lives. Salmon are now fished commercially in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean, providing a $3 billion economic base for coastal communities across the North Pacific. Commercial salmon fishing is a risky venture, however. Successful reproduction for salmon depends on the health of the streams in which they spawn. The construction of dams, increased stream sediments due to forest clear-cutting, water pollution, and overharvesting have all been blamed for declines in salmon populations, primarily from the California coast northward to British Columbia (Pacific Fishery Management Council 2008). Despite efforts to mitigate this environmental degradation, the recovery of salmon stocks has been marginal at best in the southern portion of the region.", "Researchers, environmental advocates, and government policy experts have focused primarily on the deterioration of freshwater habitat as a cause for the declines in salmon. In 1994, however, Steven Hare and Robert Francis at the University of Washington suggested that changes in the marine environment, where salmon spend the majority of their adult lives, could be contributing to the declines in salmon abundance. In particular, they noted that records of fish harvests covering more than a century indicated that multi-decadal periods of low or high fish production have occurred repeatedly, separated by abrupt changes in production rather than gradual transitions (FIGURE 2.2). In addition, Nathan Mantua and colleagues (1997) noted that periods of high salmon production in Alaska corresponded with periods of low salmon production at the southern end of the salmon range, particularly in Oregon and Washington. They found telling quotes in commercial fishing publications that told the same story: when the fishing was poor in Washington and Oregon, it was good in Alaska, and vice versa. FIGURE 2.2 Changes in Salmon Harvests over Time Records of commercial harvests of (A) sockeye salmon and (B) pink salmon in Alaska over 65 years show abrupt drops and increases in production. Red lines represent annual catch; purple lines are a statistical fit to the data. (After S. R. Hare and R. C. Francis. 1995. In Climate Change and Northern Fish Populations. Can Spec Publ Fish Aquat Sci 121. R. J. Beamish [Ed.], pp. 357\u2013372. National Research Council of Canada: Ottawa. \u00a9 Canadian Science Publishing or its licensors.) From Pacific Fisherman (September 1915): \u201cNever before have the Bristol Bay [Alaska] salmon packers returned to port after the season\u2019s operations so early.\u201d [That is, it was a bad year, with few fish to catch.] \u201cThe spring [chinook salmon] fishing season on the Columbia River [Washington and Oregon] closed at noon on August 25, and proved to be one of the best for some years.\u201d From Pacific Fisherman 1939 Yearbook: \u201cThe Bristol Bay Red [Alaska sockeye salmon] run was regarded as the greatest in history.\u201d \u201cThe [chinook] catch this year is one of the lowest in the history of the Columbia [Washington].\u201d Hare and Francis hypothesized that the abrupt shifts in salmon production were associated with longterm climate variation in the North Pacific. The nature and cause(s) of these underlying climate shifts, however, were unclear. Additional work by Mantua and colleagues found good correspondence between the multi-decadal shifts in salmon production and changes in sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific. How widespread is this variation in climate and its effects on salmon and the associated marine ecosystem? As we will see at the end of this chapter, the research on variation in salmon production led to the discovery of an important long-term cyclic climate pattern that affects a large area. View the script for the video Introduction The physical environment is the ultimate determinant of where organisms can live, the resources that are available to them, and the rate at which their populations can grow. Therefore, an understanding of the physical environment is key to understanding all ecological phenomena, from the outcome of interactions between bacteria and fungi in the soil to the exchange of carbon dioxide between the biosphere and the atmosphere. The physical environment includes climate, which consists of long-term trends in temperature, wind, and precipitation. Radiation from the sun ultimately drives the climate system as well as biological energy production. Another aspect of the physical environment is the chemical composition of air and water, which includes salinity (concentrations of dissolved salts), acidity, and concentrations of gases in the atmosphere and dissolved in water. Soil is an important component of the physical environment because it is a medium in which microorganisms, plants, and animals live. Soil also influences the availability of critical resources, particularly water and nutrients. This chapter will focus on climate and the chemical environment; we will cover soil development and nutrient supply in Chapter 22. This chapter will provide a framework for characterizing the physical environment, including its variability, at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. We will begin by exploring the processes that create the climate patterns we see at global to regional scales. CONCEPT 2.1 Climate is the most fundamental component of the physical environment. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 2.1.1 Outline the difference between weather and climate, with specific reference to their temporal scales. 2.1.2 Explain the importance of weather variability for ecological processes. 2.1.3", "Summarize how temperature is determined by the gains and losses of energy at Earth\u2019s surface. Climate Each day we experience the weather around us: the current temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and cloud cover. Weather is an important determinant of our behavior: what we wear, the activities we engage in, and our mode of transportation. Climate is the long-term description of weather at a given location, based on averages and variation measured over decades. Climate variation includes the daily and seasonal cycles associated with changes in solar radiation as Earth rotates on its axis and orbits the sun. Climate variation also includes changes over years or decades, such as large-scale cyclic weather patterns related to changes in the atmosphere and oceans (El Ni Southern Oscillation, discussed later in this chapter, is one example). Longer-term climate change occurs as a result of changes in the intensity and distribution of solar radiation reaching Earth\u2019s surface, as well as changes in the overall energy balance. Earth\u2019s climate is currently changing because of increases in concentrations of gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide that are emitted into the atmosphere as a result of human activities. These gases absorb energy and radiate it back to the surface, creating a greenhouse effect. Climate controls where and how organisms live Where organisms live, their geographic distribution, and how they function are determined by climate. Temperature regulates the rates of biochemical reactions and physiological activity for all organisms. Water supplied by precipitation is an essential resource for terrestrial organisms. Freshwater organisms are dependent on precipitation for the maintenance and quality of their habitats. Marine organisms depend on ocean currents that influence the temperature and chemistry of the waters they live in. We usually characterize climate\u2014or any aspect of the physical environment\u2014at a given location by the average conditions. However, the geographic distributions of organisms are influenced by extreme conditions more than average conditions because extreme events are important determinants of mortality. Temperature and moisture extremes can affect even long-lived organisms such as forest trees. For example, record high temperatures, along with a severe drought from 2000 to 2003, contributed to widespread mortality in large stands of pin pines (Pinus edulis) in the southwestern United States (Breshears et al. 2005) (FIGURE 2.3). These long-lived plants could no longer survive in the region where they had existed for centuries. Thus, the physical environment must also be characterized by its variability over time, not just by average conditions, if we are to understand its ecological importance. The frequency and severity of extreme temperature events have increased in association with global climate change (National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2016; Jentsch et al. 2007). Climate change has increased the probability of large-scale mortality of vegetation such as the die-off in pin pines (see ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 2.1). FIGURE 2.3 Widespread Mortality in Pin Pines Extreme high temperatures and a historic drought from 2000 to 2003 killed large areas of pin pines (Pinus edulis) throughout the southwestern United States. (A) Here, stands in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico, begin to show substantial needle death due to water and temperature stress, combined with a bark beetle outbreak in October 2002. (B) By May 2004, most of the trees had died. The timing of changes in the physical environment is also ecologically important. The seasonality of rainfall, for example, is important in determining the availability of water for terrestrial organisms. In regions with a \u201cMediterranean-type\u201d climate, the majority of precipitation falls in winter. Although these regions receive more precipitation than most desert areas, they experience regular dry periods during summer. Lack of water during summer limits the potential growth of plants and promotes fires. In contrast, some grasslands have the same average annual temperature (the average temperature measured over an entire year) and precipitation as these Mediterranean-type ecosystems, but precipitation during the summer is higher. Climate also influences the rates of abiotic processes that affect organisms. The rate at which rocks and soil are broken down to supply nutrients to plants and microorganisms, for example, is determined by climate. Climate can also influence the rates of periodic disturbances, such as fires, floods, and avalanches. These events kill organisms and disrupt biological communities, but they subsequently create opportunities for the establishment and growth of new organisms and communities. Global energy balance drives the climate system The energy that drives the global climate system is ultimately derived from solar radiation.", "On average, the top of Earth\u2019s atmosphere receives 342 watts (W) of solar radiation per square meter each year. About a third of this solar radiation is reflected back out of the atmosphere by clouds, fine atmospheric particles called aerosols, and Earth\u2019s surface. Another fifth of the incoming solar radiation is absorbed by ozone, clouds, and water vapor in the atmosphere. The remaining half is absorbed by land and water at Earth\u2019s surface (FIGURE 2.4). FIGURE 2.4 Earth\u2019s Energy Balance Average annual energy balance for Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere, including gains from solar radiation and gains and losses due to emission of infrared radiation, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux. The numbers are gains and losses of energy, given as percentages of the average annual incoming solar radiation at the top 2 of Earth\u2019s atmosphere (342 W/m ). (After J. T. Kiehl and K. E. Trenberth. 1997. Bull Am Meteorol Soc 78: 197\u2013208. \u00a9 American Meteorological Society. Used with permission.) What component of Earth\u2019s energy balance would be influenced by an increase in greenhouse gases? What would the effect on Earth\u2019s energy balance be if there were an increase in atmospheric aerosols? If Earth\u2019s temperature is to remain the same, these energy gains from solar radiation must be balanced by energy losses. Much of the solar radiation absorbed by Earth\u2019s surface is emitted to the atmosphere as infrared radiation (also known as longwave radiation). Earth\u2019s surface also loses energy and is cooled when water evaporates, because the change in phase from liquid water to water vapor absorbs energy. Heat loss due to evaporation is known as latent heat flux. Energy is also transferred through the exchange of kinetic energy by molecules in direct contact with one another (conduction) and by the movement of currents of air (wind) and water (convection). Energy transfer from the warm air immediately above Earth\u2019s surface to the cooler atmosphere by convection and conduction is known as sensible heat flux. The atmosphere absorbs much of the infrared radiation emitted from Earth\u2019s surface (and from clouds) and reradiates it back to Earth\u2019s surface. This reradiation represents a major energy gain. The atmosphere contains several gases, known as greenhouse gases, that absorb and reradiate infrared radiation. These gases include water vapor (H O), carbon dioxide (CO ), methane (CH ), and nitrous oxide (N O). Some of these 2 242 greenhouse gases are produced through biological activity (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O), linking the biosphere to the climate system. Without these greenhouse gases, Earth\u2019s climate would be considerably cooler than it is (by approximately 33\u00b0C, or 59\u00b0F). As noted earlier, increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases due to human activities are altering Earth\u2019s energy balance, changing the climate system, and causing global climate change (FIGURE 2.5; see Concept 25.2). FIGURE 2.5 Increasing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide The trend in monthly atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations measured at Mauna Loa Observatory. Average annual carbon dioxide concentrations have risen by 30% since they were first monitored at the Mauna Loa Observatory in 1958 by Charles Keeling. Similar measurements are now made globally by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (After U.S. NOAA, Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division. https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/full.html; C. D. Keeling et al. 2001. I. Global Aspects, SIO Reference Series, No. 01-06. Scripps Institution of Oceanography: San Diego, CA. Data last updated August 2019.) Our discussion of Earth\u2019s energy balance has focused on average annual transfers of energy to and from Earth as a whole. But not every location on Earth receives the same amount of energy from the sun. Let\u2019s consider how these differences in solar radiation affect the circulation of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and ocean waters. Self-Assessment 2.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 2.2 Winds and ocean currents result from differences in solar radiation across Earth\u2019s surface. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 2.2.1 Draw connections between differential heat gain across Earth\u2019s surface and the development of atmospheric circulation cells. 2.2.2 Explain how surface winds and ocean currents move heat between the tropics and the poles. Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulation It\u2019s hot near the equator and cold at the poles. Why is this true, and how does it relate to global climate patterns? Near the equator, the sun\u2019s rays strike Earth\u2019s surface perpendicularly. Toward the North and South Poles, the angle of the sun\u2019s rays becomes steeper, so the same amount of energy is spread over a progressively larger area of Earth\u2019s surface (FIGURE 2.6).", "In addition, the amount of atmosphere the rays must pass through increases toward the poles, so more radiation is reflected or absorbed before it reaches the surface. As a result, more solar energy is received per unit of area in the tropics (between latitudes 23.5\u00b0N and S) than in regions closer to the poles. This differential input of solar radiation not only establishes latitudinal gradients in temperature, but also is the driving force for climate dynamics such as warm and cold fronts and large storms (e.g., hurricanes). In addition, the movement of Earth around the sun, in combination with the tilt of Earth\u2019s axis of rotation, results in changes in the amount of solar radiation received at any location over the course of the year, as we\u2019ll see in Concept 2.5. These changes are the cause of seasonal climate variation: winter\u2013spring\u2013summer\u2013fall changes at high latitudes and wet\u2013dry shifts in tropical regions. FIGURE 2.6 Latitudinal Differences in Solar Radiation at Earth\u2019s Surface The angle of the sun\u2019s rays affects the intensity of the solar radiation that strikes Earth\u2019s surface. Atmospheric circulation cells are established in regular latitudinal patterns A surface warmed by the sun emits infrared radiation and warms the air above it. As we have just seen, the heating of Earth\u2019s surface varies with latitude, and it can also vary with topography. Such differential warming creates pockets of warm air surrounded by cooler air. Warm air is less dense (has fewer molecules per unit of volume) than cool air, so as long as a pocket of air remains warmer than the surrounding air, it will rise (a process called uplift; INTERACTIVE FIGURE 2.7). Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by molecules of air on the air and surface below it. This pressure decreases with increasing altitude, so as a pocket of warm air rises, it expands. This expansion cools the rising air. Cool air cannot hold as much water vapor as warm air, so as the air continues to rise and cool, the water vapor contained within it begins to condense into droplets and form clouds. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 2.7 Surface Heating and Uplift Differential solar heating of Earth\u2019s surface leads to the uplift of pockets of air over the warmest surfaces. The condensation of water into clouds is a warming process (another form of latent heat flux), which may act to keep the pocket of air warmer than the surrounding atmosphere and enhance its uplift, despite its cooling due to expansion. You may have observed this process on a warm summer day when bubble-shaped cumulus clouds formed thunderstorms. When there is substantial heating of Earth\u2019s surface and a progressively cooler atmosphere above the surface, the uplifted air will form clouds with wedge-shaped tops. The clouds reach to the boundary between the troposphere, the atmospheric layer above Earth\u2019s surface, and the stratosphere, the next atmospheric layer above the troposphere. This boundary is marked by a transition from progressively cooler temperatures in the troposphere to warmer temperatures in the stratosphere. Thus, the air pocket ceases to rise once it reaches the warmer temperatures at the boundary of the stratosphere. Differential heating and storm formation explain why the tropics receive the most precipitation of any area on Earth. The tropics receive the most solar radiation and thus experience the greatest amount of surface heating, uplift of air, and cloud formation. The uplift of air in the tropics creates a band of low atmospheric pressure relative to zones to the north and south. When air rising over the tropics reaches the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, it flows toward the poles (FIGURE 2.8). Eventually, this poleward-moving air cools as it exchanges heat with the surrounding air and meets cooler air moving from the poles toward the equator. Once the air reaches a temperature similar to that of the surrounding atmosphere, it descends toward Earth\u2019s surface, a process known as subsidence. Subsidence creates regions of high atmospheric pressure around latitudes 30\u00b0N and S, which inhibit the formation of clouds, and Earth\u2019s major deserts are found at these latitudes. FIGURE 2.8 Tropical Heating and Atmospheric Circulation Cells The heating of Earth\u2019s surface in the tropics causes air to rise and release precipitation. The tropical uplift of air creates a large-scale pattern of atmospheric circulation in each hemisphere known as a Hadley cell, named after George Hadley, the eighteenth-century British meteorologist and physicist who first proposed its existence. Additional atmospheric circulation cells are formed at higher latitudes (FIGURE 2.9).", "The polar cell, as its name indicates, occurs at the North and South Poles. Cold, dense air subsides at the poles and moves toward the equator when it reaches Earth\u2019s surface. The descending air at the poles is replaced by air moving through the upper atmosphere from lower latitudes. Subsidence at the poles creates an area of high pressure, so the polar regions, despite the abundance of ice and snow on the ground, actually receive little precipitation and are known as polar deserts. An intermediate Ferrell cell (named after American meteorologist William Ferrell) exists at mid-latitudes between the Hadley and polar cells. The Ferrell cell is driven by the movement of the Hadley and polar cells and by exchange of energy between tropical and polar air masses in a region known as the polar front. FIGURE 2.9 Global Atmospheric Circulation Cells and Climate Zones The differential heating of Earth\u2019s surface by solar radiation gives rise to atmospheric circulation cells, which determine Earth\u2019s major climate zones. These three atmospheric circulation cells establish the major climate zones on Earth. Between 30\u00b0N and S is the tropical zone, or simply the tropics. The temperate zones lie between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0N and S, and the polar zones are above 60\u00b0N and S (see Figure 2.9). Atmospheric circulation cells create surface wind patterns We\u2019ve seen how the differential heating of Earth leads to zones of high and low atmospheric pressure. These pressure differences are important in explaining the movement of warm and cold air masses across Earth\u2019s surface. Winds flow from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. Thus, the areas of high and low pressure formed by atmospheric circulation cells give rise to consistent patterns of air movement at Earth\u2019s surface, known as prevailing winds. We might expect these winds to blow in straight lines from high- to low-pressure zones. However, from the standpoint of an observer on Earth, the prevailing winds appear to be deflected to the right (clockwise) in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left (counterclockwise) in the Southern Hemisphere (FIGURE 2.10A). The apparent deflection is associated with the rotation of Earth: to an observer on Earth\u2019s surface rotating around the planetary axis, the path of the wind appears curved (FIGURE 2.10B). This apparent deflection is known as the Coriolis effect. To an observer in a fixed position in outer space, however, there is no apparent deflection in the direction of the wind. FIGURE 2.10 The Coriolis Effect on Global Wind Patterns (A) The Coriolis effect results from Earth\u2019s rotation. (B) Visualization of the Coriolis effect using rockets. As a result of the Coriolis effect, surface winds blowing toward the equator from the high-pressure zones at 30\u00b0N and S are deflected to the west from the perspective of Earth\u2019s surface. These winds are known as the trade winds because of their importance to the global transport of trade goods in sailing ships during the fifteenth through the nineteenth centuries. Winds blowing toward the poles from those zones of high pressure, called westerlies, are deflected to the east. The presence of continental land masses interspersed with oceans complicates this idealized depiction of prevailing wind patterns (FIGURE 2.11). FIGURE 2.11 Prevailing Wind Patterns The difference in heat capacity between the oceans and the continents leads to seasonal changes in atmospheric pressure cells that influence prevailing wind patterns. Water has a higher heat capacity than land, so it absorbs and stores more energy without its temperature changing than land does. For this reason, the land surface warms up more than ocean water in summer, but in winter the oceans retain more heat, and thus remain warmer, than land at the same latitude. As a result, seasonal air temperature changes are less extreme over the oceans than they are on land. In summer, air over the oceans is cooler and denser than that over land, and semipermanent zones of high pressure (highpressure cells) form over the oceans, particularly around 30\u00b0N and S. In winter, the opposite situation exists: the air over the continents is cooler and denser than that over the oceans, so high-pressure cells develop in the temperate zones over large continental areas. Because winds blow from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, these seasonal shifts in pressure cells influence the direction of the prevailing winds.", "The effect of land areas on the development of these semipermanent pressure cells is more pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere because continental land masses make up a larger proportion of Earth\u2019s surface in the Northern Hemisphere. Ocean currents are driven by surface winds Wind moving across the ocean surface pushes the surface water. As a result of the Coriolis effect, the water appears to move at an angle to the wind. From the perspective of an observer on Earth, it is deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. For this reason, the pattern of ocean surface currents is similar to, but not identical to, the pattern of prevailing winds. The speed of ocean currents is usually only about 2%\u20133% of the wind speed. An average wind speed of 10 m per second (22 miles per hour) would therefore produce an ocean current moving at 30 cm per second (0.7 miles per hour). In the North Atlantic Ocean, current velocities may be as high as 200 cm per second (4.5 miles per hour). Like air in the atmosphere, water in the ocean can move vertically as well as horizontally. Generally, the surface and deep layers of ocean water do not mix, because of differences in their temperature and salinity (concentration of dissolved salts). The surface waters\u2014those above 75\u2013200 m (250\u2013600 feet)\u2014are warmer and less saline, and therefore less dense, than the deeper, cooler ocean waters. When warm tropical surface currents reach polar regions, particularly the coasts of Antarctica and Greenland, their water loses heat to the surrounding environment and becomes cooler and denser. The water eventually cools enough for ice to form, which increases the salinity of the remaining unfrozen water. This combination of cooling and increasing salinity increases the density of the water, which sinks to deeper layers. The dense downwelling currents that result move toward the equator, carrying cold polar water toward the warmer tropical oceans. These deep ocean currents connect with surface currents again at zones of upwelling, where deep ocean water rises to the surface. Upwelling occurs where prevailing winds blow nearly parallel to a coastline, such as off the western coasts of North and South America. The force of the wind, in combination with the Coriolis effect, causes surface waters to flow away from the coast (FIGURE 2.12), and deeper, colder waters rise to replace them. Upwelling also occurs in the westward-flowing equatorial Pacific Ocean. As a result of the Coriolis effect, water just to the north and south of the equator is deflected slightly away from the equator, causing divergence of surface water and a zone of upwelling. FIGURE 2.12 Upwelling of Coastal Waters (A) Wind blowing parallel to the coast causes surface water to flow away from the coast, pulling deep water upward to replace it. (B) Upwelling influences surface water temperatures off the west coast of North America. Ocean temperatures are shown in \u00b0C. Upwelling has important consequences for the local climate, creating a cooler, moister environment. Upwelling also has a strong effect on biological activity in the surface waters. When organisms in the surface waters die, their bodies\u2014and the nutrients they contain\u2014sink. Thus, nutrients tend to accumulate in deep water and in sediments at the ocean bottom. Upwelling brings these nutrients back to the photic zone, the layer of surface water where there is enough light to support photosynthesis. Upwelling zones are among the most productive open ocean ecosystems because these nutrients increase the growth of phytoplankton (small, free-floating algae and other photosynthetic organisms), which provide food for zooplankton (freefloating animals and protists), which in turn support the growth of their consumers such as fish. Ocean currents influence the climates of the regions where they flow. For example, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift, a current system that flows from the tropical Atlantic northward to the North Atlantic (see Figure 2.11), contributes to warmer winters in Scandinavia than in locations at the same latitude in North America. In addition, winds blowing eastward across the Atlantic pick up heat from the ocean, which also contributes to a warmer climate in northern Europe. Winter temperatures on the west coast of Scandinavia are approximately 15\u00b0C (22\u00b0F) warmer than those on the coast of Labrador. This temperature difference is reflected in the vegetation: deciduous forests are common on the Scandinavian coast, while boreal forests of spruce and pine dominate the coast of Labrador.", "The Gulf Stream also keeps the North Atlantic ice-free most of the winter, whereas sea ice forms at the same latitude off the North American coast. Ocean currents are responsible for about 40% of the heat exchanged between the tropics and the polar regions. Thus, ocean currents are sometimes referred to as the \u201cheat pumps\u201d or \u201cthermal conveyers\u201d of the planet. A large system of interconnected surface and deep ocean currents that links the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, sometimes called the great ocean conveyor belt, is an important means of transferring heat to the polar regions (FIGURE 2.13). FIGURE 2.13 The Great Ocean Conveyor Belt An interconnected system of surface and deep ocean currents transfers energy between tropical and polar regions. The red lines represent shallow currents, and the blue lines represent deeper currents. (After Hugo Ahlenius, UNEP/GRID-Arendal. 2007. http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/world-ocean thermohaline-circulation1.) Now that we have seen how the differential heating of Earth\u2019s surface generates prevailing winds and ocean currents, let\u2019s examine the effects of these atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns on Earth\u2019s climates, including global patterns of temperature and precipitation. Self-Assessment 2.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 2.3 Large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns establish global patterns of temperature and precipitation. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 2.3.1 Outline the determinants of global temperature and precipitation patterns. 2.3.2 Explain how a region\u2019s seasonal changes in temperature are affected by its location, whether it is near a large body of water or at the center of a large continent. 2.3.3 Summarize how air density and air exchange cause a decrease in air temperature with increases in elevation on a mountain. Global Climate Patterns Earth\u2019s climates reflect a variety of temperature and precipitation regimes, from the warm, wet climate of the tropics to the cold, dry climate of the Arctic and Antarctic. In this section, we examine these global patterns of temperature and precipitation and explore how both climate averages and climate variation are influenced by prevailing winds and ocean currents. Oceanic circulation and the distribution and topography of continents influence global temperatures The global pattern of solar radiation (see Figure 2.5) largely explains why temperatures at Earth\u2019s surface become progressively cooler from the equator to the poles (FIGURE 2.14). Note, however, that these changes in temperature are not exactly parallel with changes in latitude. Why do temperatures vary across the same latitude? Three major influences alter the global pattern of temperature: ocean currents, the distribution of land and water, and elevation. As we saw in the previous section, ocean currents contribute to a warmer climate in northern Europe than at North American locations of the same latitude. Similarly, the influence of the cold Humboldt Current is noticeable on the west coast of South America, where temperatures are cooler than at similar latitudes elsewhere. FIGURE 2.14 Global Average Annual Temperatures Average annual air temperatures tend to vary with latitude, but oceanic circulation and topography alter this pattern. The difference in heat capacity between the oceans and the continents is not reflected in the average annual temperatures shown in Figure 2.14. Why is this so? Because the annual temperature variation is not depicted in that figure. Air temperatures over land show greater seasonal variation, with warmer temperatures in summer and colder temperatures in winter, than those over the oceans (FIGURE 2.15). This seasonal change has a major impact on the distribution of organisms, as we will see in later chapters. FIGURE 2.15 Annual Seasonal Temperature Variation Seasonal temperature variation is expressed as the difference in average monthly temperature between the warmest and coldest months (in \u00b0C). (After A. H. Strahler and A. N. Strahler. 2005. Physical Geography, 3rd ed. John Wiley and Sons: Hoboken, NJ. Compiled by John E. Oliver.) What is the effect on continent size on the magnitude of seasonal temperature variation? Elevation above sea level has an important influence on continental temperatures. Note in Figure 2.14 the large difference in temperature between the Indian subcontinent and Asia. The sharp change in air temperature in this region is due to the influence of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. The change in elevation is extreme here, from about 150 m (500 feet) on the Ganges Plain in India to over 8,000 m (28,000 feet) in the highest peaks of the Himalayas in only 200 km (120 miles). Why is it colder in mountains and highlands than in surrounding lowlands? Two factors contribute to the colder climates found at higher elevations.", "First, at higher elevations there are fewer air molecules to absorb the infrared energy radiating from Earth\u2019s surface. Thus, even though highlands may receive as much solar radiation as nearby lowlands, the heating of air by the ground surface is less effective because of the lower air density. Second, highlands exchange air more effectively with cooler air in the surrounding atmosphere. Because the atmosphere is warmed mainly by infrared radiation emitted by Earth\u2019s surface, the temperature of the atmosphere decreases with increasing distance from the ground. This decrease in temperature with increasing height above the surface is known as the lapse rate. In addition, wind velocity increases with increasing elevation because there is less friction with the ground surface. As a result, the decrease in air temperature with increasing elevation tends to follow the lapse rate. Patterns of atmospheric pressure and topography influence precipitation The locations of the Hadley, Ferrell, and polar circulation cells suggest that precipitation should be highest in the tropical latitudes between 23.5\u00b0N and S and in a band at about 60\u00b0N and S and should be lowest in zones around 30\u00b0N and S (see Figure 2.8). The African continent displays the pattern closest to this idealized precipitation distribution. However, there are substantial deviations from the expected latitudinal precipitation pattern in other areas, particularly in the Americas (FIGURE 2.16). These deviations are associated with the semipermanent high-pressure and low-pressure cells discussed earlier (see Figure 2.10) as well as with large mountain chains. FIGURE 2.16 Average Annual Terrestrial Precipitation The latitudinal pattern of precipitation deviates from what would be expected based on atmospheric circulation patterns alone (see Figure 2.8). (Courtesy of the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment [SAGE] through their Atlas of the Biosphere, https://nelson.wisc.edu/sage/data and-models/maps.php. Data from CRU 0.5 Degree Dataset [M. G. New et al. 2000. J Climate 13: 2217\u20132238.]) Pressure cells influence the movement of moist air from oceans to continents as well as cloud formation. For example, high pressure over the South Pacific Ocean decreases precipitation along the central west coast of South America. One of the driest deserts in the world, the Atacama, located along the Pacific coast of Chile, is associated with the presence of this high-pressure cell and with the blockage of air masses moving from the east by the Andes. In contrast, high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean increases the flow of moist air to southeastern North America, particularly in summer, increasing precipitation and supporting the occurrence of forests there. Mountains also influence precipitation patterns by forcing air moving across them to rise, which enhances local precipitation. The effects of mountains, as well as those of oceans and vegetation, on regional climate patterns are addressed in the next section. Self-Assessment 2.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 2.4 Regional climates reflect the influence of oceans and continents, mountains, and vegetation. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 2.4.1 Describe the changes in an air mass that moves from a maritime zone across mountains on both the leeward and windward slopes. 2.4.2 Illustrate how energy exchange components are influenced by vegetation and subsequently affect climate. Regional Climate Influences You may have noticed that as you travel from a coastal area to an inland location, the climate changes. This change in climate can be abrupt, particularly when you travel across a mountain chain. The daily variation in air temperature increases, humidity decreases, and precipitation decreases. These climate differences result from the effects of oceans and continents on regional energy balance and the influence of mountains on air flow and temperature. The vegetation often reflects these regional climate differences, exemplifying the effects of climate on the distributions of species and biological communities. The vegetation also has important effects on the climate through its influence on energy and water balance. Proximity to oceans influences regional climates Earlier we noted that water requires greater energy input to change its temperature (i.e., it has a higher heat capacity) than land. As a result, seasonal temperature changes are smaller over oceans than over continental areas (see Figure 2.15). In addition, oceans provide a source of moisture for cloud formation and precipitation. Coastal terrestrial regions that are influenced by an adjacent ocean have a maritime climate. Maritime climates are characterized by little variation in daily and seasonal temperatures, and they often have higher humidity than regions more distant from the coast.", "In contrast, areas centered in large continental land masses have a continental climate, which is characterized by much greater variation in daily and seasonal temperatures. Maritime climates occur in all climate zones, from tropical to polar. In the temperate zones, the influence of oceans on coastal climates tends to be accentuated on west coasts in the Northern Hemisphere and on east coasts in the Southern Hemisphere because of the prevailing wind patterns. Continental climates are limited to mid-and high latitudes (primarily in the temperate zones), where large seasonal changes in solar radiation accentuate the effect of the low heat capacity of land masses. The influence of land and water on climate can be exemplified by comparing the seasonal temperature variation in locations at similar latitudes and elevations in Siberia (FIGURE 2.17). Sangar, a town on the Lena River in the middle of the Asian continent, exhibits more than double the seasonal temperature variation of Khatyrka, on the Pacific coast. Note that the maximum and minimum temperatures occur slightly later in the year in the maritime climate (Khatyrka), another reflection of the high heat capacity of the ocean and its effect on local climate. FIGURE 2.17 Average Monthly Temperatures in a Continental and a Maritime Climate The difference in seasonal temperature variation between two locations in Siberia at about the same latitude and elevation illustrates the effect of the high heat capacity of ocean water. (Data from NOAA GHCN-Monthly, version 2; T. C. Peterson and R. S. Vose. 1997. Bull Am Meteorol Soc 78: 2837\u20132849.) Mountains influence wind patterns and gradients in temperature and precipitation The effects of mountains on climate are visually apparent in the elevational patterns of vegetation, particularly in arid regions. As we move up a mountain, grasslands may abruptly change to forests, and at higher elevations, forests may give way to alpine grasslands. These abrupt shifts in vegetation patterns reflect the rapid changes in climate that occur over short distances in mountains as temperatures decrease, precipitation increases, and wind speed increases with elevation. What causes these abrupt changes? The climates of mountains are the product of the effects of topography and elevation on air temperatures, the behavior of air masses, and their own generation of unique local wind patterns. Air moving across Earth\u2019s surface is forced upward when it encounters a mountain range. This uplifted air cools as it rises, and water vapor condenses to form clouds and precipitation. As a result, the amount of precipitation increases with elevation. This enhancement of precipitation in mountains is particularly apparent in north\u2013south-trending mountain ranges on the slopes that face into the prevailing wind (the windward slopes). In the temperate zones, where the prevailing winds blow toward the east, moving air encounters the western slopes of mountain ranges (such as the Sierra Nevada and coastal ranges in the North America) and loses most of its moisture as precipitation before cresting over the summits. The loss of moisture, as well as the warming of the air as it moves down the eastern slopes, dries the air mass (FIGURE 2.18A). This rain-shadow effect results in lower precipitation and soil moisture on the slopes facing away from the prevailing wind (the leeward slopes) and higher precipitation and soil moisture on the windward slopes. The rain-shadow effect influences the types and amounts of vegetation on mountain ranges: lush, productive plant communities tend to be found on the windward slopes, and sparser, more drought-resistant vegetation on the leeward slopes (FIGURE 2.18B). FIGURE 2.18 The Rain-Shadow Effect (A) Precipitation tends to be greater on the windward slope of a mountain range than on the leeward slope. (B) Vegetation on west-facing and east-facing slopes in the Sierra Nevada of California reflects the rain-shadow effect. Which slope aspect (north, south, east, or west) on a north\u2013south-trending mountain range in the tropical zone would have the highest precipitation, and which aspect would be in the rain shadow? Mountains can also generate local wind and precipitation patterns. Differences in the direction that mountain slopes face (referred to as the slope exposure or aspect) can cause differences in the amounts of solar radiation the slopes and surrounding flatlands receive. As we saw in the case of the large-scale circulation patterns that generate Hadley cells (see Figure 2.7), differences in solar heating of the ground surface can cause the uplift of air pockets that are warmer than the surrounding air.", "In the morning, east-facing slopes receive more solar radiation from the rising sun and thus become warmer than the surrounding slopes and lowlands. This differential heating creates localized upslope winds in the mountains. Depending on the moisture content of the air and the prevailing winds at higher elevations, clouds may form on the eastern flanks of the mountains. These clouds can generate local thunderstorms that may move off the mountains and into surrounding lowlands, increasing local precipitation. At night, the ground surface cools, and the air above it becomes denser. Nighttime cooling is more pronounced at high elevations because the thinner atmosphere absorbs and reradiates less energy and allows more heat to be lost from the ground surface. Air can flow like water, with the cold, dense air moving downslope and pooling in low-lying areas. As a result, valley bottoms are the coldest sites in mountainous areas during clear, calm nights. This cold air drainage influences vegetation distributions in the temperate zones because of the higher frequency of subfreezing temperatures in low-lying areas. Daily upslope and nightly downslope winds are a common feature of many mountainous areas, particularly in summer when the input of solar radiation is highest. At continental scales, mountains influence the movement, position, and behavior of air masses, and as a result, they influence temperature patterns in surrounding lowlands. Large mountain chains, or cordilleras, can act to channel the movement of air masses. The Rocky Mountains, for example, steer cold Arctic air through the central part of North America to their east and inhibit its movement through the intermountain basins to their west. Vegetation affects climate via surface energy exchange Climate determines where and how organisms can live, but organisms, in turn, influence the climate system in several ways. First, the amount and type of vegetation influence how the ground surface interacts with solar radiation and wind and how much water it loses to the atmosphere. The amount of solar radiation that a surface reflects, known as its albedo, is influenced by the presence and type of vegetation as well as by soil and topography. A coniferous forest, for example, is darker in color, and thus has a lower albedo, than most types of bare soil or grasslands, so the forest absorbs more solar energy. The texture of Earth\u2019s surface is also influenced by vegetation. A rough surface, such as a savanna of mixed trees and grasses, allows greater transfer of energy to the atmosphere by wind (convection) than a smooth surface such as a grassland. This is because the vegetation disrupts air flow at the ground surface, causing turbulence that brings more surface air into the atmosphere. Finally, vegetation can cool the atmosphere through transpiration (evaporation of water from inside a plant via its leaves). The amount of transpiration increases with the amount of leaf area per unit of ground surface area. The sum of water loss by transpiration and by evaporation is referred to as evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration transfers energy (latent heat) as well as water into the atmosphere, thereby reducing air temperature and soil moisture. What happens to climate when the type or amount of vegetation is altered? This question is particularly important because of the current high rates of deforestation in the tropics: since 1990 about 129 million hectares (500,000 square miles) of tropical forest have been cut (FAO 2015). Loss of the trees increases the albedo of the land surface as bare soil is exposed and the trees are partially replaced with lighter-colored grasses (FIGURE 2.19). The higher albedo decreases the absorption of solar radiation, resulting in less heating of the land surface. However, the lower heat gain from solar radiation is more than offset by lower evapotranspirative cooling (lower latent heat flux) due to loss of leaf area (Foley et al. 2003). Lower evapotranspiration rates not only reduce surface cooling, but also lead to lower precipitation because less moisture is returned from the ground surface to the atmosphere. Thus, the outcome of tropical deforestation may be a warmer, drier regional climate. Widespread deforestation may lead to climate change that is significant enough to inhibit reforestation and may thus lead to long-term changes in tropical ecosystems. The conversion of natural grasslands to crop production\u2014a widespread human practice\u2014can also affect climate, as you can evaluate in ANALYZING DATA 2.1. FIGURE 2.19 The Effects of Deforestation Illustrate the Influence of Vegetation on Climate The conversion of forest to pasture in the tropics results in a number of changes in energy exchange with the atmosphere.", "(After J. A. Foley et al. 2003. Front Ecol Environ 1: 38\u201344.) In Chapter 25 we will return to the effects of human activities on climate, especially over the past two centuries. Human activities, however, are not the only cause of long-term climate change. We turn next to the natural climate variation that has occurred throughout Earth\u2019s history. ANALYZING DATA 2.1 We\u2019ve learned that the type and amount of vegetation can influence energy exchange at Earth\u2019s surface. As a result, human alteration of the land surface, such as tropical deforestation, can lead to changes in regional climate. Determining whether temperatures are likely to get warmer or cooler after such an alteration requires knowledge of the magnitude and direction of the changes in energy balance components. For example, what happens when humans replace short-grass steppe, a type of grassland characteristic of the western Great Plains of the United States, with croplands? This vegetation change occurred along the South Platte River of northeastern Colorado in the latter part of the twentieth century, and its effects were evaluated by Chase and colleagues (1999). * Some of their data are presented here in the form of questions for your evaluation. 1. First consider changes in albedo. When sparse stands of light-colored grass (albedo = 0.26, meaning that 26% of incoming solar radiation is reflected) are replaced by dark green irrigated crops (albedo = 0.18), how does this2 influence absorption of solar radiation? If the incoming solar radiation is 470 watts per square meter (W/m ), what is the difference in energy gain due to solar radiation as a result of the vegetation change? Would this change in albedo alone cause warming or cooling? 2. Next consider heat exchange due to sensible heat flux, including convection, which is related to the roughness of the surface. A dryland (nonirrigated) crop has approximately three times greater surface roughness than short-grass steppe. Which surface would have greater heat loss due to convection, assuming that surface temperatures are warmer than the atmosphere: a cropland or short-grass steppe? The estimated difference in heat exchange due to sensible heat flux associated with the land use change to a dryland crop is about 40 W/m2. Would a combination of change in albedo (Question 1) and in surface roughness cause cooling, no net change, or warming? 3. Replacing short-grass steppe with irrigated crops, which have a higher leaf area per area of ground surface and higher soil moisture, alters the amount of energy lost via evapotranspiration (latent heat flux). Would this change result in more or less heat loss to the atmosphere relative to the short-grass steppe? 4. Taking both sensible and latent heat flux into account, the combined estimated difference in heat exchange associated2 with the land use change to irrigated cropland is about 60 W/m . Including the change in albedo from Question 1, would an irrigated crop surface have cooler or warmer temperatures relative to short-grass steppe? Satellite Image of the South Platte River Drainage Basin, Colorado The Rocky Mountains are to the west. The green circles and rectangles are irrigated cropland found along the South Platte River flowing eastward. The surrounding area is a mix of dryland crops and short-grass steppe.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 2.5.1 Explain how the tilt of Earth\u2019s axis influences (1) seasonal changes in air temperature in temperate and polar zones and (2) seasonal changes in precipitation in the tropics. 2.5.2 Outline how seasonal changes in surface heating in temperate and polar lakes influence water density and result in the stratification of water. 2.5.3 Describe how cyclic change in the position and strength of high- and low-pressure cells, which occurs during the ENSO for example, influences weather and climate variability. Climate Variation over Time As noted at the beginning of this chapter, understanding climate variation is critical to understanding ecological phenomena such as the distributions of organisms.", "Climate variation at daily to multi-decadal time scales determines the range of environmental conditions experienced by organisms as well as the availability of the resources and habitats they need to survive. Long-term climate variation over hundreds and thousands of years influences the evolutionary history of organisms and the development of ecosystems. As we will see, the global climate has changed substantially over the course of Earth\u2019s history. In this section, we will review climate variation, from seasonal to decadal time scales. Seasonality results from the tilt of Earth\u2019s axis The amount of sunlight striking any point on Earth\u2019s surface varies as Earth makes its 365.25-day journey around the sun. Earth\u2019s axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5\u00b0 relative to the sun\u2019s direct rays (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 2.20). Thus, the angle and intensity of the rays striking any point on Earth change as Earth orbits the sun. This influence of the tilt of Earth\u2019s axis overrides the variation associated with seasonal changes in the distance between Earth and the sun due to Earth\u2019s slightly elliptical orbit. Earth is closest to the sun in January (at a point called the perihelion: 237 million km or 147 million miles) and farthest away in July (at the aphelion: 245 million km or 152 million miles). As we will see later, however, the effect of Earth\u2013sun distance on climate is important over much longer time scales. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 2.20 The Tilt of Earth\u2019s Axis Causes Seasonal Changes As Earth orbits the sun over the course of a year, its orientation relative to the sun changes because of the tilt of its axis of rotation. The resulting changes in the intensity of solar radiation create seasonal climate variation. (After C. D. Ahrens. 2005. Essentials of Meteorology. Thomson Brooks/Cole: Boston, MA.) The temperate and polar zones experience pronounced changes in temperature associated with variation in solar radiation over the year. Summer occurs in the Northern Hemisphere from June to September, when that hemisphere is tilted toward the sun; at the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is oriented away from the sun and experiences its winter. The difference in solar radiation, and thus the temperature variation, between summer and winter increases from the tropics toward the poles. The seasonal changes in the angle of the sun affect not only the intensity of solar radiation, but also the length of the day. Above 66.5\u00b0N and S, the sun does not set for several days, weeks, or even months in summer. During the winter at these same latitudes, the sun does not rise high enough to warm the surface. Because air temperatures regularly drop below freezing during winter in the temperate and polar zones, seasonality in these zones is an important determinant of biological activity and strongly influences the distributions of organisms. Seasonal changes in solar radiation are relatively small in the tropics compared with those in the temperate and polar zones. As a result, seasonality in the tropics is marked primarily by changes in precipitation rather than by changes in temperature. These seasonal changes are associated with the movement of the zone of maximum air uplift and precipitation, known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ. This zone of maximum uplift corresponds with the part of the tropics where the sun strikes Earth most directly. Thus, the ITCZ moves from 23.5\u00b0N in June to 23.5\u00b0S in December, bringing the wet season with it (FIGURE 2.21). FIGURE 2.21 Wet and Dry Seasons and the ITCZ Seasonality of precipitation in the tropics is associated with movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) between the tropics of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Thus, Tampico, Mexico, reaches its maximum precipitation levels from July to October and has a dry season from November to April, whereas Vi\u00e7osa, Brazil, has a wet season from October to February and a dry season from April to August. (Data from NOAA GHCN-Monthly, version 2; T. C. Peterson and R. S. Vose. 1997. Bull Am Meteorol Soc 78: 2837\u20132849.) Seasonal changes in aquatic environments are associated with changes in water temperature and density Aquatic environments in the temperate and polar zones also experience seasonal changes in temperature, but as we have seen, they are not as extreme as those on land. Liquid water becomes denser as it gets colder, and it has the unique property of being most dense at 4\u00b0C. Ice is less dense than liquid water and therefore forms on the surfaces of water bodies in winter.", "Because it has a higher albedo than open water, ice on the surface of lakes or polar oceans effectively prevents warming of the water below it. Differences in water temperature (and thus water density) with depth result in the stratification, or layering, of water in oceans and lakes. Stratification has important implications for aquatic organisms because it determines the movement of nutrients and oxygen. Surface waters in lakes and oceans mix freely, but they are underlain by colder, denser layers of water that do not mix easily with the surface waters. In oceans, the surface waters mix with the subsurface layers only rarely\u2014for example, in upwelling zones. In temperate-zone lakes, seasonal changes in water temperature and density result in seasonal changes in stratification (FIGURE 2.22). In summer, the surface layer, or epilimnion, is the warmest and contains active populations of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The epilimnion is underlain by a zone of rapid temperature decline, called the thermocline. Below the thermocline is a stable layer of the densest, coldest water in the lake, known as the hypolimnion. In summer, dead organisms from the epilimnion will drop to the hypolimnion and bottom (benthic) zone, carrying nutrients and energy away from the surface layers. FIGURE 2.22 Lake Stratification Lake stratification, which occurs primarily in summer in temperate and polar regions, results from the effects of temperature on water density. Seasonal changes in water temperature result in the turnover of water that mixes little during summer and winter. (After S. Dodson. 2004. Introduction to Limnology. McGraw Hill: New York.) Why would seasonal changes in lake stratification be unlikely to occur in tropical lakes? During the fall, the air above the water surface cools, and the lake loses heat to the atmosphere. As the epilimnion cools, its density increases until it is the same as that of the layers below it. Eventually, the water at all depths of the lake has the same temperature and density, and winds blowing on the surface lead to a mixing of surface and deep layers, known as lake turnover. This mixing is important for recycling of the nutrients that are lost from the epilimnion during summer. In addition, lake turnover moves oxygen into the hypolimnion and the sediments at the lake bottom. The replenishment of nutrients at the surface and of oxygen at the bottom, where it is used up by the respiration of aerobic bacteria during summer, increases biological activity throughout the lake. Turnover occurs again in spring when the surface ice melts and the lake water has a uniform density once again. Climate variation over years and decades results from changes in atmospheric pressure cells Peruvian fisherman have long been aware of times when the normally productive ocean waters hold few fish and the weather becomes extremely wet. They named these climate episodes El Ni, for the Christ child, because they usually started around Christmas. El Ni events are associated with a switch (or oscillation) in the positions of high-pressure and low-pressure cells over the equatorial Pacific, which leads to a weakening of the easterly trade winds that normally push warm water toward Southeast Asia. Climatologists refer to this oscillation and the climate changes associated with it as El Ni Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. Its underlying causes are still not well understood. The frequency of ENSO is somewhat irregular, but it occurs at intervals of 3\u20138 years and generally lasts for about 18 months. During El Ni events, the upwelling of deep ocean water off the coast of South America ceases as the easterly winds weaken or, in some events, shift to westerly winds. ENSO also includes La Ni events, which are stronger-than-average phases of the normal pattern, with high pressure off the coast of South America and low pressure in the western Pacific. La Ni events usually follow El Ni events but tend to be less frequent. ENSO is associated with unusual climate conditions, even at localities distant from the tropical Pacific, through its complex interactions with atmospheric circulation patterns (FIGURE 2.23). El Ni events are associated with unusually dry conditions in the Malay Archipelago, other parts of Southeast Asia, and Australia. The likelihood of fires in the grasslands, shrublands, and forests of these areas increases as precipitation decreases and vegetation dries out. In contrast, in the southern United States and northern Mexico, El Ni events may increase precipitation, while the ensuing La Ni events bring drought conditions.", "The increased plant growth associated with an El Ni event, followed by dry La Ni conditions, intensifies fires in the southwestern United States (Veblen et al. 2000). FIGURE 2.23 El Ni Southern Oscillation (ENSO) El Ni events have widespread climate effects that vary seasonally, altering temperature and precipitation patterns at a global scale. (Courtesy of NOAA Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Project.) Similar atmospheric pressure\u2013ocean current oscillations occur in the North Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic Oscillation affects climate variation in Europe, in northern Asia, and on the east coast of North America. Another long-term oscillation in sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure, known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO, was described for the North Pacific after its influence on salmon numbers was discovered, as described in the Case Study earlier in this chapter. The PDO affects climate in ways similar to ENSO and can moderate or intensify the effects of ENSO. The effects of the PDO are felt primarily in northwestern North America, although southern parts of North America, Central America, Asia, and Australia may also be affected. The PDO and the North Atlantic Oscillation have been linked to longterm droughts in the United States (e.g., the U.S. Dust Bowl in the 1930s; see the Case Study for Chapter 25). We will return to the PDO in the Case Study Revisited. Long-term changes in climate have occurred throughout Earth\u2019s history, including glacial\u2013interglacial cycles and extended periods of much warmer climate than what is occurring now. These long-term climate fluctuations are associated with differences in the amount of solar radiation received and the concentrations of greenhouse gases. This topic is covered in more depth in WEB EXTENSION 2.1. Self-Assessment 2.5 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 2.6 Salinity, acidity, and oxygen concentrations are major determinants of the chemical environment. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 2.6.1 Outline what determines the salinity and acidity of soils and waters. 2.6.2 Explain why oxygen concentrations vary depending on elevation, the influence of water on diffusion, and biological consumption. The Chemical Environment All organisms are bathed in a matrix of chemicals. Water is the primary chemical constituent of aquatic environments, along with variable amounts of dissolved salts and gases. Small differences in the concentrations of these dissolved chemicals can have important consequences for the functioning of aquatic organisms, as well as for terrestrial plants and microorganisms that are dependent on water and dissolved chemicals in the soil. Terrestrial organisms are immersed in a gaseous atmosphere that is relatively invariant, consisting primarily of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (20%), water vapor (1%), and argon (0.9%). The atmosphere also contains trace gases, including the greenhouse gases, which play a critical role in Earth\u2019s energy balance, and pollutants derived from human activities, which can have important effects on atmospheric chemistry. We will discuss the effects of air pollutants and greenhouse gases in Chapter 25. Here we briefly review three chemical variables that influence biological and ecological function: salinity, acidity, and the availability of oxygen. All waters contain dissolved salts Salinity refers to the concentration of dissolved salts in water. Salts are ionic compounds, composed of cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negatively charged ions) that disassociate when placed in water. Dissolved salts are important from a biological perspective because they influence properties of water that affect the ability of organisms to absorb it, as we will see in Concept 4.3. Salts also have direct influences on organisms as nutrients (as we will see in Concept 22.1) and can inhibit metabolic activity if their concentrations are too high or too low. Although all waters contain dissolved salts, we often think about salinity in the context of oceans, which account for 97% of the water on Earth; 70% of Earth\u2019s surface is under salty ocean waters. The salinity of the oceans varies between 33 and 37 parts per thousand; this variation is a result of evaporation, precipitation, and the freezing and melting of sea ice (FIGURE 2.24). The salinity of ocean surface waters is highest near the equator and lowest at high latitudes. FIGURE 2.24 Global Variation in Salinity at the Ocean Surface Variations in the salinity of ocean surface waters reflect the concentrating effect of evaporation, dilution by melting sea ice, and precipitation. What are the salts that make water saline, and where do they come from? Ocean salts consist mainly of sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, sulfate, bicarbonate, and potassium.", "These salts come from gases emitted by volcanic eruptions early in Earth\u2019s history, when its crust was cooling, and from the gradual breakdown of minerals in the rocks that make up Earth\u2019s crust. The salinity of water bodies is determined by the balance of inputs and losses of salts and water. Most landlocked bodies of water become more saline over time, reflecting a balance between water inputs from precipitation, water losses due to evaporation, and inputs of salts. When these inland \u201cseas\u201d occur in arid areas (e.g., the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea), their salinities usually exceed that of ocean water because of high rates of evaporation and its concentrating effect. The types of salts that contribute to their salinity vary, reflecting the chemistry of the minerals in the rocks that make up their basins. Despite the high salinity levels in these inland lakes, some organisms have managed to thrive in their waters, including algae and cyanobacteria. High levels of salinity occur naturally in waterlogged soils adjacent to oceans, such as those in salt marshes. Soils may also become more saline in arid regions as water from deeper soil layers is brought to the surface by plant roots or through pumping of groundwater for irrigation. As this transported water evaporates, it leaves its salts behind. If there is little precipitation to leach the salts to deeper soil layers, or if drainage of the water is impeded by impervious layers beneath the soil, high rates of evapotranspiration will result in a progressive buildup of salts at the soil surface. This process, known as salinization, occurs naturally in some desert soils and is a common occurrence in irrigated agricultural soils of arid regions (FIGURE 2.25). Salinization contributed to agricultural decline in ancient Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and is a problem today in California\u2019s Central Valley, Australia, and other regions. FIGURE 2.25 Salinization Salinization of soils is disrupting agricultural production in many areas, especially in arid regions. Organisms are sensitive to the acidity of their environment Acidity and its converse, alkalinity, are measures of the ability of a solution to behave as an acid or a base, + respectively. Acids are compounds that give up protons (H ) to the water they are dissolved in. Bases take up \u2013 protons or give up hydroxide ions (OH ). Examples of common acids include the citric, tannic, and ascorbic acids found in fruits. Examples of common bases include sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and other carbonate minerals in rock. Acidity and alkalinity are measured as pH, which is equal to the negative of the + logarithm (\u2013log10) of the concentration of H . Thus, one pH unit represents a 10-fold change in the+ concentration of H . Pure water has a neutral pH of 7.0. Solutions with pH values higher than 7.0 are alkaline (basic), and solutions with pH values lower than 7.0 are acidic. The pH values of water have important effects on organismal function. Changes in pH values can directly affect metabolic activity. The pH values of water also determine the chemistry and availability of nutrients, as we will see in Concept 22.4. Organisms have a limited range of pH values that they can tolerate. Natural levels of alkalinity (when the pH of the environment exceeds 7) tend not to be as important as levels of acidity as a constraint on organismal function and distributions. In the oceans, pH does not vary appreciably, because the chemistry of seawater buffers changes in pH\u2014 that is, the salts in seawater bind free protons and thereby minimize changes in pH. Thus, pH tends to be more variable in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems than in the ocean. Increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to human activities are increasing the acidity of the oceans with negative effects on marine ecosystems. Marine animals that build shells using calcium carbonate are less able to construct and maintain their shells under more acidic conditions (Orr et al. 2005). We will discuss this phenomenon more thoroughly in Concept 25.1. On land, the pH of surface waters and soils varies naturally. What causes this variation? Water can become more acidic over time through the input of acidic compounds derived from several sources, most associated with soil development (which is covered in more detail in Concept 22.1). Two of the main components of soil are mineral particles from the breakdown of rocks, and organic matter from the decomposition of dead plants and other organisms.", "Some rock types, such as granites, generate acidic salts, while other rock types, such as limestones, generate basic salts. Soils become more acidic as they age because the basic salts leach away more easily and because decomposition and leaching of plant matter adds organic acids to the soil. The emission of acidic pollutants into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels, as well as overuse of agricultural fertilizers, can increase the acidity of soil and water. We will cover these sources of acidity in more detail in Concept 25.3. Oxygen concentrations vary with elevation, diffusion, and consumption There was no oxygen in the atmosphere when life on Earth first evolved, and oxygen was toxic to the earliest forms of life. Even today, there are organisms that are intolerant of oxygen. However, with the exception of some archaea, bacteria, and fungi, most organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic processes and cannot survive in hypoxic (low-oxygen) conditions. Hypoxic conditions can also promote the formation of chemicals (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) that are toxic to many organisms. In addition, oxygen levels are important for chemical reactions that determine the availability of nutrients. Oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere have been stable at about 21% for the past 65 million years, so most terrestrial environments have invariant oxygen concentrations. However, the availability of atmospheric oxygen decreases with elevation above sea level. As we have seen, the overall density of air decreases with elevation, so there are fewer molecules of oxygen in a given volume of air at higher elevations. We will discuss the repercussions of this variation for human health in Concept 4.1. Oxygen concentrations can vary substantially in aquatic environments and in soils. The rate of diffusion of oxygen into water is slow and may not keep pace with its consumption by organisms. Waves and currents mix oxygen from the atmosphere into ocean surface waters, so its concentration is usually stable there. Oxygen concentrations are low in the deep ocean and in marine sediments, where biological uptake is greater than replenishment from surface waters. The same holds true in deep lakes, lake sediments, and flooded soils (e.g., in wetlands). Oxygen concentrations are highest in freshwater ecosystems with moving water (streams and rivers) because mixing with the atmosphere is greatest there. Self-Assessment 2.6 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Climate Variation and Salmon Abundance The research of Steven Hare and Robert Francis on salmon production in the North Pacific contributed to the discovery of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. As noted earlier, the PDO is a multi-decadal shift in sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure cells. A review of existing records of sea surface temperatures over the past century indicated that the PDO was associated with alternating 20-to 30-year periods of warm and cool temperatures in the North Pacific (FIGURE 2.26A). The length of the phases of the PDO differentiates it from other climate oscillations, whose phases tend to be much shorter (e.g., 18 months\u20132 years for ENSO). The warm and cool phases of the PDO influenced the marine ecosystems that Pacific salmon depended on, and thus shifted salmon production north or south, depending on the phase (FIGURE 2.26B). FIGURE 2.26 Effect of the PDO on Salmon Catch in the Northwest United States (A) Summer average PDO index, 1965\u20132012. Red and blue bars indicate ocean temperatures that are warmer or cooler than average, respectively. (B) Departures from the average (123,131 fish) in numbers of adult Chinook salmon returning to the Columbia River (Washington and Oregon) to spawn, 1965\u20132012. (After W. T. Peterson et al. 2013. Ocean Ecosystem Indicators of Salmon Marine Survival in the Northern California Current. National Marine Fisheries Service: Newport, OR.) How frequently does the cool phase of the PDO correspond to a greater-than-average catch of salmon? Conversely, how often does a warm phase of the PDO correspond to a lower-than-average catch of salmon? The PDO has been linked to changes in the abundances and distributions of many marine organisms and, through its climate effects, changes in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems (Mantua and Hare 2002). Its effects have been found primarily in western North America and eastern Asia, but effects have also been reported in Australia. Thus, the influence of the PDO on climate extends throughout the Western Hemisphere.", "Evidence for the existence of climate changes associated with the PDO dates back to the 1850s, in the form of instrumental temperature records, and to the 1600s, in the form of information from corals and tree rings. The mechanisms underlying the PDO are unclear, but its effect on climate is significant and widespread (TABLE 2.1).

J. Mantua. 2001. In The Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change, Vol. 1, M. C. McCracken and J. S. Perry (Eds.), pp. 592\u2013594. Wiley: New York. CONNECTIONS in NATURE CLIMATE VARIATION AND ECOLOGY Two aspects of the PDO are particularly important in the context of ecology. First, the realization that the PDO existed was driven initially by an attempt to understand variation in the size of an animal population. This observation underscores the relationship between physical conditions (the topic of this chapter), the functioning of individual organisms and their growth and reproduction (Chapters 4 and 5), and population and community processes (Units 2 and 5, respectively). This relationship is one of the central themes of ecology that will form a common thread throughout this book. Ultimately, the physical environment, including climate and the myriad factors, such as the PDO, that control it, determines whether an organism can exist in a given location (as we\u2019ll see in Chapter 3). Extremes in the physical environment, including those that are driven by climate oscillations, play a critical role in our understanding of ecological phenomena. Second, the time scale of the climate variation associated with the PDO is long relative to the human life span. The abrupt changes in climate, and the associated ecological responses of the marine ecosystem, were therefore perceived by people as unusual events. Indeed, the phases of the PDO may be longer than the life spans of most of the organisms affected by it, limiting their ability to adapt to this climate oscillation. As a result, from the perspective of an ecological community, the PDO represents a disturbance, an event that detrimentally affects the populations of some species and disrupts the community. Although we don\u2019t yet understand what causes it, the PDO has been a part of the climate system for at least the last 400 years. A better understanding of its effects will help us place other climate phenomena, including global climate change, in perspective. The Biosphere KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 3.1 Terrestrial biomes are characterized by the growth forms of the dominant vegetation. CONCEPT 3.2 Biological zones in freshwater ecosystems are associated with the velocity, depth, temperature, clarity, and chemistry of the water. CONCEPT 3.3 Marine biological zones are determined by ocean depth, light availability, and the stability of the bottom substrate. The American Serengeti\u2014Twelve Centuries of Change in the Great Plains: A Case Study Today, the region covering the central part of North America, known as the Great Plains, bears little resemblance to the Serengeti Plain of Africa. Biological diversity is very low in many parts of the current landscape, which contains large stands of uniform crop plants (which are often even genetically identical) and a few species of domesticated herbivores (mostly cattle). In the Serengeti, on the other hand, some of the largest and most diverse herds of wild animals in the world roam a picturesque savanna (FIGURE 3.1). If not for a series of important environmental changes, however, the two ecosystems might look superficially very similar. FIGURE 3.1 The Serengeti Plain of Africa Large, diverse herds of native animals migrate across the Serengeti in search of food and water. Biological communities in the temperate and polar zones have been subjected to natural, long-term climate change, which has led to latitudinal or elevational shifts in their positions and species composition. Eighteen thousand years ago, at the last glacial maximum of the Pleistocene epoch, ice sheets covered the northern portion of North America. Over the next 12,000 years, the climate warmed and the ice receded.", "Vegetation followed the retreating ice northward and colonized the newly exposed substrate. Grasslands in the center of the continent expanded into former spruce and aspen woodlands. These grasslands contained species of grasses, sedges, and low-growing herbaceous plants similar to those found in the natural grasslands that exist today. The animal inhabitants of those earlier grasslands were, however, strikingly different from today\u2019s. A diverse collection of megafauna (animals larger than 45 kg, or 100 pounds) existed in North America, rivaling the diversity found today in the Serengeti (Martin 2005) (FIGURE 3.2). Thirteen thousand years ago\u2014a relatively short time in an evolutionary context\u2014North American herbivores included woolly mammoths and mastodons (relatives of elephants), as well as several species of horses, camels, and giant ground sloths. Predators included saber-toothed cats with 18-cm (7-inch) incisors, cheetahs, lions, and giant short-faced bears that were larger and faster than grizzly bears. FIGURE 3.2 Pleistocene Animals of the Great Plains The animals of the grasslands of central North America 13,000 years ago included woolly mammoths, horses, and giant bison. Many of these large mammals went extinct within a short time between 13,000 and 10,000 years ago. About 10,000\u201313,000 years ago, as the extensive grasslands of the Great Plains were developing, many of the large mammals of North America suddenly went extinct (Barnosky et al. 2004). The rapidity of the disappearance of approximately 28 genera (40\u201370 species) made this extinction unlike any extinction event during the previous 65 million years. Another unusual aspect of this extinction was that nearly all the animals that went extinct belonged to the same group: large mammals. The causes of this extinction are a mystery. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the disappearance of the North American megafauna. Changes in the climate during the extinction period were rapid and could have led to changes in habitat or food supply that would have negatively affected the animals. Another hypothesis, which has generated substantial controversy, suggests that the arrival of humans in North America may have hastened the demise of the animals (Martin 1984). When this hypothesis was first proposed, it was met with widespread skepticism, and the initial supporting evidence was considered weak. Although humans first appeared in the central part of North America about 14,500 years ago, it is unclear how hunters bearing stone and wooden tools could have driven so many species of large mammals to extinction. What evidence is there to support the hypothesis that humans were involved in this extinction event? Introduction Living things can be found in remarkable places. Birds such as ravens, lammergeyers (Eurasian vultures), and alpine choughs (crows) fly over the highest summits of the Himalayas, over 8,000 m (26,000 feet) above sea level. Fish such as the \u201cfangtooth\u201d (Abyssobrotula galatheae) live more than 8,000 m below the ocean surface. Bacteria and archaea can be found almost everywhere on Earth, in hot sulfur springs at the extreme chemical and temperature limits for life, under glaciers, on dust particles many kilometers above Earth\u2019s surface, and kilometers deep in ocean sediments. However, most living things occur in a range of habitats that cover a thin veneer of Earth\u2019s surface, from the tops of trees to the surface soil layers in terrestrial environments and within 200 m of the surface of the oceans. The biosphere\u2014the zone of life on Earth\u2014is sandwiched between the lithosphere, Earth\u2019s surface crust and upper mantle, and the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Biological communities can be studied at multiple scales of varying complexity, as we saw in Concept 1.2. Here, we will use the biome concept to introduce the amazing diversity of terrestrial life. The diversity of aquatic life is not as easily categorized, but we will describe several freshwater and marine biological zones, which, like terrestrial biomes, reflect the physical conditions where they are found. CONCEPT 3.1 Terrestrial biomes are characterized by the growth forms of the dominant vegetation. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 3.1.1 Explain why ecologists use plants, and plant growth forms, to categorize global terrestrial biomes. 3.1.2 Describe how global patterns of precipitation and temperature, and their variability, influence the location of terrestrial biomes. 3.1.3 Evaluate how human activities impact the actual distributions of biomes relative to the potential distributions. Terrestrial Biomes Biomes are large-scale biological communities shaped by the physical environment in which they are found. In particular, they reflect the climate variation described in Chapter 2. Biomes are categorized by the most common growth forms of plants distributed across large geographic areas.", "The categorization of biomes does not take taxonomic relationships among organisms into account; instead, it relies on similarities in the morphological responses of organisms to the physical environment. A biome includes similar biotic assemblages on distant continents, indicating similar responses to similar climate conditions in different locations. In addition to providing a useful introduction to the diversity of life on Earth, the biome concept provides a convenient biological unit for modelers simulating the effects of environmental change on biological communities, as well as for those simulating the effects of vegetation on the climate system (see Concept 2.4). The numbers and categories of biomes used vary from source to source, depending on the preferences and goals of the authors. Here, we use a system of nine biomes: tropical rainforest, tropical seasonal forest and savanna, desert, temperate grassland, temperate shrubland and woodland, temperate deciduous forest, temperate evergreen forest, boreal forest, and tundra. This system provides a teaching tool for linking biological systems to the environments that shape them. Terrestrial communities vary considerably\u2014from the warm, wet tropics to the cold, dry polar regions. Tropical forests have multiple verdant layers, high growth rates, and tremendous species diversity. Lowland tropical forests in Borneo have an estimated 10,000 species of vascular plants, and most other tropical forest communities have about 5,000 species. In contrast, polar regions have a scattered cover of tiny plants clinging to the ground, reflecting a harsh climate of high winds, low temperatures, and dry soils. High-latitude Arctic communities contain about 100 species of vascular plants. Tropical rainforest vegetation may reach over 75 m (250 feet) in height and contain over 400,000 kg (882,000 pounds) of aboveground biomass in a single hectare (about 2.5 acres). Plants of polar regions, on the other hand, rarely exceed 5 cm (2 inches) in height and contain less than 1,000 kg (2,200 pounds) of aboveground biomass per hectare. Terrestrial biomes are classified by the growth form (size and morphology) of the dominant plants (e.g., trees, shrubs, or grasses) (FIGURE 3.3). Characteristics of their leaves, such as deciduousness (seasonal shedding of leaves), thickness, and succulence (development of fleshy water storage tissues), may also be used. Why use plants rather than animals to categorize terrestrial biomes? Plants are immobile, so in order to occupy a site successfully for a long time, they must be able to cope with its environmental extremes as well as its biological pressures, such as competition for water, nutrients, and light. Plant growth forms are therefore good indicators of the physical environment, reflecting the climate zones discussed in Concept 2.2 as well as rates of disturbance (e.g., fire frequency). In addition, animals are a less visible component of most large landscapes, and their mobility allows them to avoid exposure to adverse environmental conditions. Microorganisms (archaea, bacteria, and fungi) are important components of biomes, and the composition of microbial communities reflects physical conditions as plant growth forms do. The tiny size of these organisms, however, as well as rapid temporal and spatial changes in their community composition, makes them impractical for classifying biomes. FIGURE 3.3 Plant Growth Forms The growth form of a plant is an evolutionary response to the environment, particularly climate and soil fertility. Since their emergence from the oceans about 500 million years ago, plants have taken on a multitude of different forms in response to the selection pressures of the terrestrial environment (see Figure 3.3). These selection pressures include aridity, high and subfreezing temperatures, intense solar radiation, nutrient-poor soils, grazing by animals, and crowding by neighbors. Having deciduous leaves, for example, is one solution to seasonal exposure to subfreezing temperatures or extended dry periods. Trees and shrubs invest energy in woody tissues in order to increase their height and ability to capture sunlight and to protect their tissues from damage by wind or large amounts of snow. Perennial grasses, unlike most other plants, can grow from the bases of their leaves and keep their vegetative and reproductive buds below the soil surface, which facilitates their tolerance of grazing, fire, subfreezing temperatures, and dry soils. Similar plant growth forms appear in similar climate zones on different continents, even though the plants may not be genetically related. The evolution of similar growth forms among distantly related species in response to similar selection pressures is called convergence. Terrestrial biomes reflect global patterns of precipitation and temperature Chapter 2 described Earth\u2019s climate zones and their association with the atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns that result from the differential heating of Earth\u2019s surface by the sun.", "These climate zones are major determinants of the distribution of terrestrial biomes. The tropics (between 23.5\u00b0N and S) are characterized by high rainfall and warm, invariant temperatures. In the subtropical regions that border the tropics, rainfall becomes more seasonal, with pronounced dry and wet seasons. The major deserts of the world are associated with the zones of high pressure at about 30\u00b0N and S and with the rain-shadow effects of large mountain ranges. Subfreezing temperatures during winter are an important feature of the temperate and polar zones. The amount of precipitation north and south of 40\u00b0 varies depending on proximity to the ocean and the influence of mountain ranges (see Figure 2.16). The locations of terrestrial biomes are correlated with these variations in temperature and precipitation. Temperature influences the distribution of plant growth forms directly through its effect on the physiological functioning of plants. Precipitation and temperature act in concert to influence the availability of water and its rate of loss by plants. Water availability and soil temperature are important in determining the supply of nutrients in the soil, which is also an important control on plant growth form. The association between climate variation and terrestrial biome distribution can be visualized using a graph of average annual precipitation and temperature (FIGURE 3.4). While these two factors predict biome distributions reasonably well, this approach fails to incorporate seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation. As we saw in Concept 2.1, climate extremes are sometimes more important in determining species distributions than average annual conditions. For example, grasslands and shrublands have wider global distributions than Figure 3.4 would suggest, occurring in regions with relatively high average annual precipitation but regular dry periods (e.g., Mediterranean-type shrublands; grasslands at the margins of deciduous forests). In addition, factors such as soil texture and chemistry as well as proximity to mountains and large bodies of water can influence biome distribution. FIGURE 3.4 Biomes Vary with Average Annual Precipitation and Temperature When plotted on a graph of precipitation and temperature, the nine major terrestrial biomes form a triangle. (After R. H. Whittaker. 1975. Communities and Ecosystems. Macmillan: London.) What factor(s) might result in grasslands or shrublands \u201cinvading\u201d climate space occupied by forest or savanna? The potential distributions of terrestrial biomes differ from their actual distributions due to human activities The effects of land conversion and resource extraction by humans are increasingly apparent on the land surface. These human effects are collectively described as land use change. Human modification of terrestrial ecosystems began at least 10,000 years ago with the use of fire as a tool to clear forests and enhance the size of game populations. The greatest changes have occurred over the last 150 years, since the onset of mechanized agriculture and logging and an exponential increase in the human population (see Figure 10.2) (Harrison and Pearce 2001). About 60% of Earth\u2019s land surface has been altered by human activities, primarily agriculture, forestry, and livestock grazing; a smaller amount (2%\u20133%) has been transformed by urban development and transportation corridors (Harrison and Pearce 2001; Sanderson et al. 2002). As a result of these human influences, the potential and the actual distributions of biomes are markedly different (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 3.5). Temperate biomes, particularly grasslands, have been transformed the most, although tropical and subtropical biomes are experiencing rapid change as well. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 3.5 Global Biome Distributions Are Affected by Human Activities The potential distributions of biomes differ from their actual distributions because human activities have altered much of Earth\u2019s land surface. (A) The potential global distribution of biomes. (B) Alteration of terrestrial biomes by human activities. The \u201chuman footprint\u201d is a quantitative measure (100 = maximum) of the overall human impact on the environment based on geographic data describing human population size, land development, and resource use. (B from E. W. Sanderson et al. 2002. BioScience 52: 891\u2013904.) Which biomes in North America and Eurasia appear to have been most affected by human activities? In other words, which biomes in (A) overlap most with areas of high human impact in (B)? In South America and on the Indian subcontinent, which biome has been most degraded by human activity? In the following sections, we will briefly describe nine terrestrial biomes, their biological and physical characteristics, and the human activities that influence the actual amount of natural vegetation cover that remains in each biome.", "The description of each biome begins with a map of its potential geographic distribution and a climate diagram showing the characteristic seasonal patterns of air temperature and precipitation at a representative location in that biome (see ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 3.1). In addition, sample photos illustrate some of the vegetation types that make up the biome. It is important to remember that each biome incorporates a mix of different communities. Boundaries between biomes are often gradual and may be complex due to variations in regional climate influences, soil types, topography, and disturbance patterns. Thus, the boundaries of biomes portrayed here are only approximations. TROPICAL RAINFORESTS Tropical rainforests are aptly named, as they are found in the low-latitude tropics (between 10\u00b0N and S) where precipitation usually exceeds 2,000 mm (79 inches) annually. Tropical rainforests experience warm, seasonally invariant temperatures. The abundant precipitation may be spread evenly throughout the year or occur in one or two main peaks associated with the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) (see Figure 2.21). Seasonal rhythms are generally absent from this biome, and plants grow continuously throughout the year. Tropical rainforests contain a substantial amount of living plant biomass, as mentioned earlier, and they include the most productive ecosystems on Earth. They contain an estimated 50% of Earth\u2019s species and about 37% of the terrestrial pool of carbon (C) in only about 11% of Earth\u2019s terrestrial vegetation cover (Dixon et al. 1994; Dirzo and Raven 2003). Tropical rainforests occur in Central and South America, Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia. ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 3.1 A climate diagram is a graph of the average monthly temperature and precipitation at a particular location. Climate diagrams are useful for depicting seasonal patterns of climate conditions. In particular, they provide an indication of when temperatures are below freezing for extended periods (purple-shaded areas in the figure) and when precipitation is insufficient for plant growth. When the precipitation curve falls below the temperature curve (orange-shaded area in the figure), water availability limits plant growth. Climate diagrams were developed by Heinrich Walter and Helmut Lieth (Walter and Lieth 1967), who used them to show the consistency of climate patterns within the same biomes in different locations. Walter and Lieth demonstrated that by using axes scaled with 1\u00b0C corresponding to 2 mm of precipitation, a coarse approximation of time periods when water availability limits plant growth could be made. (Water loss from terrestrial ecosystems is related to temperature, a topic we will take up in more detail in Chapter 4.) For example, the tropical seasonal forest and temperate shrubland and woodland biomes show distinct seasonal periods when water is in short supply, and some temperate grasslands also have predictable low-water seasons (see the figure). Climate diagrams also show when temperatures are conducive to plant growth. It is apparent that there is a latitudinal trend toward longer periods of subfreezing temperatures with more extreme lows (larger areas of purple shading). A Sample Climate Diagram A climate diagram contains the name of the climate station where conditions were recorded (Havre, Montana, in this example), its geographic location in latitude, and its elevation. In Havre, there are extended periods of subfreezing temperatures from November to March (purple areas). Frosts do occur outside this time frame, but these isolated events are not reflected in average monthly temperatures. A period of low water availability (orange area) typically occurs from mid-July to October. (Data from NOAA GHCN-Monthly, version 2; T. C. Peterson and R. S. Vose. 1997. Bull Am Meteorol Soc 78: 2837\u20132849.) The tropical rainforest biome is characterized by broad-leaved evergreen and deciduous trees. Light is a key environmental factor determining the vegetation structure of this biome. Climate conditions that favor plant growth also exert selection pressure either to grow tall above neighboring plants or to adjust physiologically to low light levels. As many as five layers of plants occur in tropical rainforests. Emergent trees rise above the majority of the other trees that make up the canopy of the forest. The canopy consists primarily of the leaves of evergreen trees, which form a continuous layer approximately 30 to 40 m above the ground. Below the canopy, plants that use trees for support and to elevate their leaves above the ground, including lianas (woody vines) and epiphytes (plants that grow on tree branches), are found draped over or clinging to the canopy and emergent trees. Understory plants grow in the shade of the canopy, further reducing the light that finally reaches the forest floor.", "Shrubs and forbs (broad-leaved herbaceous plants) occupy the forest floor, where they must rely on light flecks that move across the forest floor during the day for photosynthesis. Globally, tropical rainforests are disappearing rapidly because of logging and conversion of forests to pasture and croplands (FIGURE 3.6). Approximately half of the tropical rainforest biome has been altered by deforestation (Asner et al. 2009). Rainforests in Africa and Southeast Asia have been altered the most, and rates of deforestation continue to be greatest in those areas (Wright 2005). In some cases, rainforests have been replaced by disturbance-maintained pastures of forage grasses. In other cases, rainforest is regrowing, but the recovery of the previous rainforest structure is uncertain. Rainforest soils are often nutrient-poor, and recovery of nutrient supplies may take a very long time, hindering forest regrowth. FIGURE 3.6 Tropical Deforestation Large areas of tropical rainforest and seasonal forests have been cleared over the past 40 years, primarily for agricultural and pastoral development. The loss of these tropical forests has large consequences for loss of biodiversity, regional climate, and carbon uptake and storage. (Map based on data from 2005. After S. L. Pimm and C. Jenkins. 2005. Sci Am 293: 66\u201373.) CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION TROPICAL FORESTS AND GREENHOUSE GASES The loss of tropical forests to cutting and burning means more than just the loss of biodiversity. As noted above, almost 40% of the terrestrial carbon is in the tropical forest biome. The loss of the forests means both lower ability of the terrestrial biosphere to take up C from the atmosphere and greater emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from soils and decaying vegetation (Guo and Gifford 2002). Restoration projects are ongoing in some countries to help address concerns for the loss of diversity and C sequestration abilities associated with tropical forest loss, although their success has not been as effective as natural regeneration (Crouzeilles et al. 2017). How quickly can tropical forests recover and the pools of C be restored once regrowth is started? A review of more than 600 sites indicates that recovery of the plant biomass above the soil surface occurs within 85 years of regrowth, but a longer time is required for recovery of plant biomass in the soil (Martin et al. 2013). This analysis provides optimism for potential reversal of the contribution of tropical deforestation to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. However, the analysis also found that while tree diversity recovers after 50 years, more than a century is required for full plant species recovery, including lianas and epiphytes. TROPICAL SEASONAL FORESTS AND SAVANNAS As we move to the north and south of the wet tropics toward the Tropics of Cancer (23.5\u00b0N) and Capricorn (23.5\u00b0S), rainfall becomes seasonal, with pronounced wet and dry seasons associated with shifts in the ITCZ. This region is marked by a large gradient in climate primarily associated with the seasonality of rainfall. The responses of vegetation to the greater seasonal variability include shorter stature, lower tree densities, and an increasing degree of drought deciduousness, with leaves dropping from the trees during the dry season. In addition, there is a greater abundance of grasses and shrubs and fewer trees than in rainforests. The tropical seasonal biome includes several different vegetation complexes, including tropical dry forests, thorn woodlands, and tropical savannas. The frequency of fires, which increases with the length of the dry season, influences the vegetation growth forms. Recurrent fires, sometimes set by humans, promote the establishment of savannas, communities dominated by grasses with intermixed trees and shrubs. In Africa, large herds of herbivores, such as wildebeests, zebras, elephants, and antelopes, also influence the balance between trees and grasses and act as an important force promoting the establishment of savannas. On the floodplains of the Orinoco River in South America, seasonal flooding contributes to the establishment of savannas, as trees are intolerant of long periods of soil saturation. Thorn woodlands (communities dominated by widely spaced trees and shrubs) get their name from the protective thorns on the trees, which act as a deterrent to herbivores that would consume the vegetation. Thorn woodlands typically occur in regions with climates intermediate between tropical dry forests and savannas. Tropical seasonal forests and savannas once covered an area greater than tropical rainforests, but today less than half of this biome remains intact. Increasing human demand for wood and agricultural land has resulted in loss of tropical seasonal forests and savannas at rates equal to or greater than those for tropical rainforests (Bullock et al. 1995).", "Large increases in human populations in tropical dry forest regions have had a particularly large effect. Large tracts of tropical dry forest in Asia and Central and South America have been converted to cropland and pasture to meet the needs of growing human populations for food and earnings from agricultural goods exported to more developed countries. DESERTS In contrast to the tropical ecosystems, deserts contain sparse populations of plants and animals, reflecting sustained periods of high temperatures and low water availability. The subtropical positions of hot deserts correspond with the high-pressure zones of the Hadley cells (see Figure 2.8) around 30\u00b0N and S, which inhibit the formation of storms and their associated precipitation. Low precipitation levels, coupled with high temperatures and high rates of evapotranspiration, result in a limited supply of water for desert organisms. The major desert zones include the Sahara; the Arabian deserts; the Gobi Desert in Asia; the Atacama Desert of Chile and Peru; and the Chihuahuan, Sonoran, and Mojave Deserts of North America. Low water availability is an important constraint on the abundance of desert plants as well as an important influence on their form and function. One of the best examples of convergence in plant form is the occurrence of stem succulence in desert plants. Stem succulence occurs in both the cacti of the Western Hemisphere and the euphorb family of the Eastern Hemisphere (FIGURE 3.7). Plants with succulent stems can store water in their tissues to help the plants continue to function during dry periods. Other plants of the desert biome include drought-deciduous shrubs and grasses. Some short-lived annual plants are active only after sufficient precipitation has fallen. These annual plants carry out their entire life cycle, from germination through flowering and seed production, in a few short weeks. Although the abundance of organisms may be low, species diversity can be high in some deserts. The Sonoran Desert, for example, has over 4,500 plant species, 1,200 bee species, and 500 bird species (Nabhan and Holdsworth 1998). FIGURE 3.7 Convergence in the Forms of Desert Plants (A) The blue candle cactus (Myrtillocactus geometrizans) is native to the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. (B) Euphorbia polyacantha has cactus-like characteristics . Although only distantly related, both species have succulent stems, water-conserving photosynthetic pathways, upright stems that minimize midday sun exposure, and spines that protect them from herbivores. These traits evolved independently in each species. Humans have used deserts for livestock grazing and agriculture for centuries. Agricultural development in desert areas is dependent on irrigation, often using water that flows in from distant mountains or is extracted from deep underground. Unfortunately, irrigated agriculture in deserts has repeatedly failed because of salinization (see Concept 2.6). Livestock grazing in deserts is also a risky venture because of the unpredictable nature of the precipitation needed to support plant growth for herbivores. Long-term droughts in association with unsustainable grazing practices can result in loss of plant cover and soil erosion, a process known as desertification. Desertification is a concern in populated regions at the margins of deserts, such as the Sahel region in the southern portion of the Sahara in Africa. TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS Large expanses of grasslands once occurred throughout North America and Eurasia (the Great Plains and the steppes of Central Asia) at latitudes between 30\u00b0 and 50\u00b0N. Southern Hemisphere grasslands are found at similar latitudes on the east coasts of South America, New Zealand, and Africa. These vast, undulating expanses of grass-dominated landscape have often been compared to a terrestrial ocean, with wind-driven \u201cwaves\u201d of plants bending to the gusts blowing through them. Temperate climates have greater seasonal temperature variation than tropical climates, with increasing periods of subfreezing temperatures toward the poles. Within the temperate zone, grasslands are usually associated with warm, moist summers and cold, dry winters. Precipitation in some grasslands is high enough to support forests, as at the eastern edge of the Great Plains. However, frequent fires and grazing by large herbivores such as bison prevent the establishment of trees and thus maintain the dominance of grasses in these environments. The use of fire to manage grasslands near the edges of forests was probably one of the first human activities with a widespread effect on a terrestrial biome. The world\u2019s grasslands have been a major focus for agricultural and pastoral development. In order to acquire adequate supplies of water and nutrients, grasses grow more roots than stems and leaves.", "The rich organic matter that accumulates in the soils as a result enhances their fertility, so grassland soils are particularly well suited for agricultural development. Most of the fertile grasslands of central North America and Eurasia have been converted to agriculture. The diversity of the crop species grown on these lands is far less than the diversity of the grasslands they replaced. In more arid grasslands, rates of grazing by domesticated animals can exceed the capacity of the plants to produce new tissues, and grassland degradation, including desertification, may occur. As in deserts, irrigation of some grassland soils has resulted in salinization, decreasing their fertility over time. In parts of Europe, cessation of centuries-old grazing practices has resulted in increased forest invasion into grasslands. This long legacy of use for agriculture and grazing has made grasslands the most human-influenced biome on Earth. You can evaluate the possible effects of climate change in ANALYZING DATA 3.1. TEMPERATE SHRUBLANDS AND WOODLANDS The seasonality of precipitation is an important control on the distribution of temperate biomes. Woodlands (characterized by an open canopy of short trees) and shrublands occur in regions with a winter rainy season (in contrast to grasslands, with a summer rainy season). Mediterranean-type climates, which occur on the west coasts of the Americas, Africa, Australia, and Europe between 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0N and S, are an example of such a climate regime. As we saw in Concept 2.1, these Mediterranean-type climates are characterized by asynchrony between precipitation and the summer growing season (the period of time with suitable temperatures to support growth). Precipitation falls primarily in winter, and hot, dry weather occurs throughout the late spring, summer, and fall. The vegetation of Mediterranean-type climates is characterized by evergreen shrubs and trees. Evergreen leaves allow plants to be active during cooler, wetter periods and also lower their nutrient requirements, since they do not have to develop new leaves every year. Many plants of Mediterranean-type climates have sclerophyllous leaves, which are tough, leathery, and stiff. These plants are well adapted to dry soils and may continue to photosynthesize and grow at reduced rates during the hot, dry summer. Sclerophyllous leaves also help to deter consumption by herbivores and prevent wilting as water is lost. Sclerophyllous shrublands are found in each of the zones characterized by a Mediterranean-type climate, including the mallee of Australia, the fynbos of South Africa, the matorral of Chile, the maquis around the Mediterranean Sea, and the chaparral of North America. ANALYZING DATA 3.1 The climate diagrams shown for each of the terrestrial biomes (pp. 55\u201367) exemplify the climate patterns with which they are associated (see Ecological Toolkit 3.1). In particular, they show periods of potential plant stress due to low water availability and subfreezing temperatures, which are particularly important in shaping the types of plants that grow in a given location. Global climate change is altering both temperature and precipitation patterns worldwide. Eventually, therefore, the species composition of the biome at a given site will change, as happened following the end of the last Ice Age. The world\u2019s remaining grasslands are particularly threatened by climate change. Much of this biome has already been lost and fragmented by land use change for agricultural and pastoral activities. Current predictions for the tallgrass prairie of the central United States suggest that by 2050, its average annual temperature will increase by 2.3\u00b0C and total annual precipitation will not change. 1. Assuming that the changes in temperature occur evenly across the year, draw climate diagrams representing the current and year 2050 conditions for Ellsworth, Kansas, a grassland site in the southern Great Plains. Use the data in the table below for the current climate. 2. Redraw the climate diagram assuming that winter (December, January, February) precipitation increases by 20% and that summer (June, July, and August) precipitation decreases by 20%, as predicted by some climate change models. 3. Does the diagram from question 2 show changes in the periods of possible water and temperature stress? If so, how do you think these changes will influence the vegetation composition of the tallgrass prairie? Use the information in Ecological Toolkit 3.1 to assist your reasoning. 4. What factors other than climate should be considered in a prediction of the future fate of the grassland biome?", "Ellsworth, Kansas, 38\u00b043' N, 98\u00b014' W, 466 m elevation J FMAMJ JASOND Average monthly temperature (\u00b0C) \u20132.1 0.9 6.9 13.1 18.3 23.8 26.9 25.7 20.7 14.3 6.1 \u20130.2 Average monthly precipitation (mm) 15.2 19.8 56.6 61.5 104.1 102.4 81.8 84.1 79.0 56.1 27.7 19.8 Source: http://www.ellsworth.climatemps.com/ See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. Fire is a common feature in Mediterranean-type shrublands and, as it does in some grasslands, may promote their persistence. Some of the shrubs recover after fires by resprouting from woody storage organs protected from the heat below the ground surface. Other shrubs produce seeds that germinate and grow quickly after a fire. Without regular fires at 30- to 40-year intervals, some temperate shrublands may be replaced by forests of oaks, pines, junipers, or eucalypts. Regular disturbance by fire, combined with the unique climate of temperate shrublands, is thought to promote high species diversity. Shrublands and woodlands are also found in the continental interior of North America and Eurasia, where they are associated with rain-shadow effects and seasonally cold climates. The Great Basin, for example, occupies the interior of North America between the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range to the west and the Rocky Mountains to the east. Large expanses of sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), saltbush (Atriplex spp.), creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), and pin pine and juniper woodland occur throughout this area. Humans have converted some regions of temperate shrublands and woodlands to croplands and vineyards. However, their climates and nutrient-poor soils have limited the extent of agricultural and pastoral development. In the Mediterranean basin, agricultural development using irrigation was attempted but failed because of the infertile soils. Urban development has reduced the cover of shrublands in some regions (e.g., Southern California). Increases in local human populations have increased the frequency of fires, which has decreased the ability of shrubs to recover and may lead to their replacement by invasive annual grasses. TEMPERATE DECIDUOUS FORESTS Deciduous leaves are a solution to the extended periods of freezing weather in the temperate zone. Leaves are more sensitive to freezing than other plant tissues because of the high level of physiological activity associated with photosynthesis. Temperate deciduous forests occur in areas where there is enough rainfall to support tree growth (500\u20132,500 mm, or 20\u2013100 inches, per year) and where soils are fertile enough to supply the nutrients lost when leaves are shed in the fall. Temperate deciduous forests are primarily limited to the Northern Hemisphere, as the Southern Hemisphere contains less land area and lacks extensive areas with the continental climates associated with the deciduous forest biome. Deciduous forests occur at 30\u00b0 to 50\u00b0N on the eastern and western edges of Eurasia and in eastern North America, extending inland to the continental interior before diminishing because of lack of rainfall and, in some cases, increased fire frequency. Similar species occur on each of these continents, reflecting a common biogeographic history (see Chapter 18). Oak, maple, and beech trees, for example, are components of this forest biome on each continent. The vertical structure of the forest includes canopy trees as well as shorter trees, shrubs, and forbs below the canopy. Species diversity is lower than in tropical forests but can be as high as 3,000 plant species (e.g., in eastern North America). Disturbances such as fire and outbreaks of herbivorous insects do not play a major role in determining the development and persistence of temperate deciduous forest vegetation, although they can influence its boundaries, and periodic outbreaks of herbivores (e.g., the gypsy moth, a non-native insect introduced to North America) do occur. The temperate deciduous forest biome has been a focus for agricultural development for centuries. The fertile soils and climate are conducive to the growth of crops. Forest clearing for crop and wood production has historically been widespread in this biome. Very little old-growth temperate deciduous forest remains on any continent. Since the early twentieth century, however, agriculture has gradually shifted away from temperate-zone forests toward temperate grasslands and the tropics, particularly in the Americas. Abandonment of agricultural fields has resulted in reforestation in some parts of Europe and North America. However, the species composition of the second-growth forests often differs from what was present prior to agricultural development. Nutrient loss from soils due to long-term agricultural use is one reason for this difference. Another is the loss of some species due to introductions of invasive species.", "For example, the chestnut blight fungus, introduced from Asia, nearly wiped out the chestnut trees (Castanea spp.) of North America in the early twentieth century (see Figure 13.14). As a result, oak species are more widespread than they were prior to agricultural development. TEMPERATE EVERGREEN FORESTS Evergreen forests span a wide range of environmental conditions in the temperate zone, from warm coastal regions to cool continental and maritime climates. Precipitation also varies substantially among these forests, from 500 to 4,000 mm (20\u2013150 inches) per year. Some temperate evergreen forests with high levels of precipitation, which are typically located on west coasts at latitudes between 45\u00b0 and 50\u00b0N and S, are referred to as \u201ctemperate rainforests\u201d (FIGURE 3.8). Temperate evergreen forests are commonly found on nutrient-poor soils, whose condition is in part related to the acidic nature of the leaves of the evergreen trees. Some evergreen forests are subject to regular fires at intervals of 30\u2013200 years, which may promote their persistence. FIGURE 3.8 Temperate Rainforest Rainforests occur in temperate zones with high precipitation (over 5,000 mm, or 200 inches) and relatively mild winter temperatures. Here, understory tree ferns grow beneath the canopy trees at Horseshoe Falls in western Tasmania, Australia. Temperate evergreen forests are found in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres between 30\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 latitude. Their diversity is generally lower than that of deciduous and tropical forests. In the Northern Hemisphere, the tree species include needle-leaved conifers such as pines, junipers, and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). In the Southern Hemisphere, on the west coasts of Chile and Tasmania, in southeastern and southwestern Australia, and in New Zealand, there is a greater diversity of tree species, including southern beeches (Nothofagus spp.), eucalypts, the Chilean cedar (Austrocedrus), and podocarps (see Figure 18.4). Conifers provide a source of high-quality wood and pulp for paper production. The temperate evergreen forest biome has been subjected to extensive clearing, and little old-growth forest remains. Some forestry practices tend to promote sustainable use of these forests, although in some regions the planting of nonnative species (such as Monterey pine in New Zealand), the uniform age and density of the trees, and losses of formerly dominant species have created forests that are ecologically very different from their pre-logging condition. The suppression of naturally occurring fires in western North America has increased the density of some forest stands, which has resulted in more intense fires when they do occur and has increased the spread of insect pests (e.g., pine beetles) and pathogens. In industrialized countries, the effects of air pollution have damaged some temperate evergreen forests (see Figure 25.18) and made them more susceptible to other stresses. BOREAL FORESTS Above 50\u00b0N, the severity of winters increases. Minimum temperatures of \u201350\u00b0C (\u2013 58\u00b0F) are common in continental locations such as Siberia, and continuous subfreezing temperatures may last up to 6 months. The extreme weather in these subarctic regions is an important determinant of the vegetation structure. Not only must the plants cope with low air temperatures, but soils may regularly freeze, leading to the formation of permafrost, defined as a subsurface soil layer that remains frozen year-round for at least 3 years. Although precipitation is low, the permafrost impedes water drainage, so soils are moist to saturated. The biome that occupies the zone between 50\u00b0 and 65\u00b0N is the boreal (far northern) forest. This biome is also known as taiga, the Russian word for this northern forest. It is composed primarily of coniferous species, including spruces, pines, and larches (deciduous needle-leaved trees), but also includes extensive deciduous birch forests in maritime locations, particularly in Scandinavia. Conifers tend to resist damage from winter freezing better than angiosperm trees, despite maintaining green leaves year-round. Although the boreal forest is found only in the Northern Hemisphere, it is the largest biome in area and contains one-third of Earth\u2019s forested land. Boreal forest soils are cold and wet, limiting the decomposition of plant material such as leaves, wood, and roots. Thus, the rate of plant growth exceeds the rate of decomposition, and the soils contain large amounts of organic matter. During extensive summer droughts, forests are more susceptible to fires ignited by lightning. These fires may burn both the trees and the soil (FIGURE 3.9). Soil fires may continue to burn slowly for several years, even through the cold winters. In the absence of fire, forest growth enhances permafrost formation by lowering the amount of sunlight absorbed by the soil surface.", "In low-lying areas, soils become saturated, killing the trees and forming extensive peat bogs. FIGURE 3.9 Fire in the Boreal Forest Despite the cold climate of the boreal forest, fire is an important part of its environment. Boreal forests have been less affected by human activities than other forest biomes. Logging occurs in some regions, as does oil and gas development, including the mining of oil sands. These activities pose an increasing threat to the boreal forest as demands for wood and energy increase. In addition, the large store of organic matter in the soil makes boreal forests an important component of the global carbon cycle. Climate warming may result in more rapid decomposition and thus higher rates of carbon release from boreal forest soils, increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations that in turn cause additional warming (see Concept 25.2). TUNDRA Trees cease to be the dominant vegetation beyond approximately 65\u00b0 latitude. The tree line that marks the transition from boreal forest to tundra is associated with low growing-season temperatures, although the causes of this transition are complex and can also include other climate and soil conditions. The tundra biome occurs primarily in the Arctic but can also be found on the edges of the Antarctic Peninsula and on a few islands in the Southern Ocean. The poleward decrease in temperature and precipitation across the tundra biome is associated with the zones of high pressure generated by the polar atmospheric circulation cells (see Figure 2.8). The tundra biome is characterized by sedges, forbs, grasses, and low-growing shrubs such as heaths, willows, and birches. Lichens and mosses are also important components of this biome. Although the summer growing season is short, the days are long, with continuous periods of light for 1 to 2 months of the summer. The plants and lichens survive the long winter by going dormant, maintaining living tissues under the snow or soil, where they are insulated from the cold air temperatures. The tundra and the boreal forest have several similarities: temperatures are cold, precipitation is low, and permafrost is widespread. Despite the low precipitation, many tundra areas are wet, as the permafrost keeps the precipitation that does fall from percolating to deeper soil layers. Repeated freezing and thawing of surface soil layers over several decades results in sorting of soil materials according to their texture. This process forms polygons of soil at the surface with upraised rims and depressed centers (FIGURE 3.10). Where soils are coarser or permafrost does not develop, the soils may be dry, and plants must be able to cope with low water availability. These polar deserts are most common at the high latitude limit of the tundra biome. FIGURE 3.10 Soil Polygons and Pingo Pingos are small hills found in the Arctic, formed by an intrusion of water that freezes in the subsurface permafrost zone, thrusting the soil above it upward. The polygons on the periphery of the pingo result from freezing and thawing of soils, a process that pushes coarse soil materials toward the edges and finer soil to the middle of the polygons. Herds of caribou and musk oxen, as well as predators such as wolves and brown bears, inhabit the tundra. Many species of migratory birds nest in the tundra during the summer. Human inhabitants are scattered in sparse settlements. As a result, this biome contains some of the largest pristine regions on Earth. The influence of human activities on the tundra is increasing, however. Exploration and development of energy resources has accelerated. A key to limiting the effects of energy development is preventing damage to the permafrost, which can cause long-term erosion. The Arctic has experienced climate warming almost double the global average during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Increased losses of permafrost, catastrophic lake drainage, and reduced carbon storage in the soil have been linked to climate change. Now that we\u2019ve completed our tropics-to-tundra tour of terrestrial biomes, let\u2019s consider the influence of mountains on more local-scale patterning of biological communities. In some mountainous locations, elevational changes result in a smaller version of our latitudinal description of biomes. Biological communities in mountains occur in elevational bands Approximately one-fourth of Earth\u2019s land surface is mountainous. Mountains create climate gradients that change more rapidly over a given distance than those associated with changes in latitude.", "Temperatures decrease with elevation (for reasons described in Concept 2.3); for example, temperatures in temperate continental mountain ranges decrease approximately 6.4\u00b0C for every 1,000-m increase in elevation (or 3.6\u00b0F per 1,000 feet), a decrease equivalent to that over approximately a 13\u00b0 change in latitude, or a distance of 1,400 km (870 miles). As we might expect from our consideration of biomes and their close association with climate, coarse biotic assemblages similar to biomes occur in elevational bands on mountains. Finer-scale biotic distinctions are found in association with slope aspect (e.g., north-facing vs. south-facing), proximity to streams, and the orientation of slopes in relation to prevailing winds (see Concept 2.4). The biological communities that occur from the base to the summit of a temperate-zone mountain range resemble what we would find along a latitudinal gradient toward higher latitudes. An elevational transect on the eastern slope of the southern Rocky Mountains in Colorado, for example, includes grassland to alpine vegetation across a 2,200-m (7,200-foot) increase in elevation (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 3.11). The changes in climate and vegetation are similar to the transition from grassland to tundra that occurs with a 27\u00b0 increase in latitude, from Colorado to the Northwest Territories of Canada. Grasslands occur at the base of the mountains, but they give way to pine savannas on the initial slopes (the lower montane zone). Fire plays an important role in determining the vegetation structure of both montane grasslands and savannas. With increasing elevation, the pine savannas are replaced by denser stands of mixed pine\u2013aspen forests (the montane zone), which resemble temperate evergreen and deciduous forest biomes. Spruce and fir trees make up the forests of the subalpine zone, which resemble the boreal forest biome. Mountain tree lines are similar to the transition from boreal forest to tundra, although topography can play an important role through its influence on snow distribution and avalanches. The alpine zone above the tree line includes diminutive plants such as sedges, grasses, and forbs, including some of the same species that occur in the Arctic tundra. Although the alpine zone resembles the tundra, its physical environment is different, with higher wind speeds, more intense solar radiation, and lower atmospheric partial pressures of O2 and CO2.1 INTERACTIVE FIGURE 3.11 Mountain Biological Zones An elevational transect on the eastern slope of the southern Rocky Mountains passes through climate conditions and biome-like assemblages similar to those found along a latitudinal gradient between Colorado and northern Canada. (Data from J. W. Marr. 1967. Ecosystems of the East Slope of the Front Range of Colorado. University of Colorado Press: Boulder, CO.) Would you expect the same biological zonation on east- facing and west-facing slopes in a temperate mountain range near the west coast of a continent? Mountains are found on all continents and at all latitudes. As indicated in the example above, the changes in climate associated with changes in elevation alter the composition of the local vegetation. Not all of the vegetation assemblages that occur in mountains resemble major terrestrial biomes, however. Some mountain-influenced biological communities have no biome analogs. For example, daily temperature changes at high-elevation sites in the tropics (e.g., Mount Kilimanjaro and the tropical Andes) are greater than seasonal temperature changes. Subfreezing temperatures occur on most nights in the tropical alpine zone. As a result of these unique climate conditions, tropical alpine vegetation does not resemble that of the temperate alpine zone or the Arctic tundra (FIGURE 3.12). FIGURE 3.12 Tropical Alpine Plants Frailej (Espeletia spp.) grows in alpine grasslands in the Ecuadorian Andes. Its growth form, characterized by a circle of leaves (rosette), is typical of plants in the tropical alpine zones of South America and Africa. The adult leaves help protect the developing leaves and stems at the apex of the plant from nightly frosts. Such giant rosettes are found exclusively in the tropical alpine zone and do not have analogs in the Arctic or Antarctic.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 3.2.1 Summarize how the size of particles on the bottom of streams, as well as water velocity and clarity, change from source streams to large rivers and subsequently influence the organisms that inhabit different zones of moving waters.", "3.2.2 Explain how the depth and amount of light penetration in a pond or lake influence the distribution of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organisms. Freshwater Biological Zones Although they occupy a small portion of the terrestrial surface, freshwater streams, rivers, and lakes are a key component in the connection between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Rivers and lakes process inputs of chemical elements from terrestrial ecosystems and transport them to the oceans. The biota of these freshwater ecosystems reflect the physical characteristics of the water, including its velocity (flowing streams and rivers vs. lakes and ponds), its temperature (including seasonal changes), how far light can penetrate it (clarity), and its chemistry (salinity, oxygen concentrations, nutrient status, and pH). In this section, we will explore the biota and associated physical conditions found in freshwater ecosystems. In contrast to terrestrial biomes, for which only plants are used as indicators, the biological assemblages of freshwater ecosystems are characterized by both plants and animals, reflecting the greater proportional abundance of animals in aquatic ecosystems. Biological communities in streams and rivers vary with stream size and location within the stream channel Water flows downhill over the land surface in response to the force of gravity. The land surface is partly shaped by the erosional power of water, which cuts valleys as it heads toward a lake or ocean. The descending water converges into progressively larger streams and rivers, called lotic (flowing water) ecosystems. The smallest streams at the highest elevations in a landscape are called first-order streams (FIGURE 3.13). Two first-order streams may converge to form a second-order stream. Large rivers such as the Nile or Mississippi are equal to or greater than sixth-order streams. FIGURE 3.13 Stream Orders Stream order affects environmental conditions, community composition, and the energy and nutrient relationships of communities within the stream. Individual streams tend to form repeated patterns of riffles and pools along their paths. Riffles are fast-moving portions of the stream flowing over coarse particles on the stream bed, which increase oxygen input into the water. Pools are deeper portions of the stream where water flows more slowly over a bed of fine sediments. Biological communities in lotic ecosystems are associated with different physical locations within the stream and their related environments (FIGURE 3.14). Organisms that live in the flowing water of the main channel are generally swimmers, such as fish. The bottom of the stream, called the benthic zone, is home to invertebrates; some of these, such as some mayfly and fly (dipteran) larvae, consume detritus (dead organic matter), and some, such as some caddisflies and crustaceans, hunt other organisms. Some organisms, such as rotifers, copepods, and insects, are found in the substrate below and adjacent to the stream, where water, either from the stream or from groundwater moving into the stream, still flows. This area is known as the hyporheic zone. FIGURE 3.14 Spatial Zonation of a Stream Biological communities in a stream vary according to water velocity, inputs of plant material from riparian vegetation, the size of particles on the stream bed, and the depth of the stream. Where in this stream would you expect oxygen concentrations to be highest and lowest? The composition of biological communities in streams and rivers changes with stream order (see Figure 3.13) and channel size. The river continuum concept was developed to describe these changes in both the physical and biological characteristics of a stream (Vannote et al. 1980). This conceptual model holds that as a stream flows downslope and increases in size, the input of detritus from the vegetation adjacent to the stream (known as riparian vegetation) decreases relative to the volume of water, and the particle size in the stream bed decreases, from boulders and coarse rock in the higher portions to fine sand at the lower end, facilitating greater establishment of aquatic plants in the downstream direction. As a result, the importance of terrestrial vegetation as a food source for stream organisms decreases in the downstream direction. Coarse terrestrial detritus is most important near the stream source, while the importance of fine organic matter, algae, and rooted and floating aquatic vascular plants (known as macrophytes, from macro, \u201clarge\u201d; phyte, \u201cplant\u201d) increases downstream. The general feeding styles of organisms change accordingly as the river flows downstream.", "Shredders, organisms able to tear up and chew leaves (e.g., some species of caddisfly larvae), are most abundant in the higher parts of the stream, while collectors, organisms that collect fine particles from the water (e.g., some dipteran larvae), are most abundant in the lower parts of the stream. The river continuum concept applies best to temperate river systems, but not as well in boreal, Arctic, or tropical rivers or in rivers with high concentrations of dissolved organic substances (including tannic and humic acids) derived from wetlands. Nonetheless, the model provides a basis for studying biological organization in stream and river systems. Human effects on lotic ecosystems have been extensive. Most fourth- and higher-order rivers have been altered by human activities, including pollution, increases in inputs of sediments, and introductions of nonnative species. Streams and rivers have been used as conduits for the disposal of sewage and industrial wastes in most parts of the world inhabited by humans. These pollutants often reach levels that are toxic to many aquatic organisms. Excessive application of fertilizers to croplands results in runoff into rivers as well as leaching of nutrients into groundwater that eventually reaches rivers. Inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers alter the composition of aquatic communities. Deforestation increases inputs of stream sediment, which can reduce water clarity, alter benthic habitat, and inhibit gill function in many aquatic organisms. Introductions of non-native species, such as sport fishes (e.g., bass and trout), have lowered the diversity of native species in both stream and lake ecosystems. The construction of dams on streams and rivers tremendously alters their physical and biological properties, converting them into still waters\u2014the topic of the next section. Biological communities in lakes vary with depth and light penetration Lakes and other still waters, called lentic ecosystems, occur where natural depressions have filled with water or where humans have dammed rivers to form reservoirs. Lakes and ponds may be formed when glaciers gouge out depressions and leave behind natural dams of rock debris (moraines), or when large chunks of glacial ice break off, become surrounded by glacial debris, and then melt. Most temperate and polar lakes are formed by glacial processes. Lakes may also form when meandering rivers cease to flow through a former channel, leaving a section stranded, called an oxbow lake. Geologic phenomena, such as extinct volcanic calderas and sinkholes, form natural depressions that may fill with water. Lakes and ponds of biological origin, in addition to reservoirs, include beaver dams and animal wallows. Lakes vary tremendously in size, from small, ephemeral ponds to the massive Lake Baikal in Siberia, which is 1,600 m (5,200 feet) deep and covers 31,000 km2 (12,000 square miles). The size of a lake has important consequences for its nutrient and energy status and therefore for the composition of its biological communities. Deep lakes with little surface area tend to be nutrient-poor compared with shallow lakes with much surface area (see Concept 22.4). Lake biotic assemblages are associated with depth and degree of light penetration. The open water, or pelagic zone, is inhabited by plankton: small, often microscopic organisms that are suspended in the water (FIGURE 3.15). Photosynthetic plankton (called phytoplankton) are limited to the surface layer of water where there is enough light for photosynthesis, called the photic zone. Zooplankton\u2014tiny animals and non-photosynthetic protists\u2014occur throughout the pelagic zone, as do other consumers such as bacteria and fungi, feeding on detritus as it falls through the water. Fish patrol the pelagic zone, scouting for food and predators that might eat them. FIGURE 3.15 Examples of Lake Plankton In this composite image of plankton from a pond, phytoplankton (green in the key) include filamentous algae (1), Closterium sp. (2), Volvox sp. (3), and other green algae (4, 5). Zooplankton (blue in the key) include a larval copepod (A), rotifer (B), water flea (Daphnia sp., C), ciliated protist (D), adult copepod (Cyclops sp.) with egg sacs (E), mite (F), and tardigrade (G). The nearshore zone where the photic zone reaches to the lake bottom is called the littoral zone. Here, macrophytes join with floating and benthic phytoplankton to produce energy by photosynthesis. Fish and zooplankton also occur in the littoral zone. In the benthic zone, detritus derived from the littoral and pelagic zones serves as an energy source for animals, fungi, and bacteria. The benthic zone is usually the coldest part of the lake, and its oxygen concentrations are often low. Let\u2019s move from fresh waters to the biological zones of the oceans.", "You will see that some of those zones have names and characteristics similar to those in freshwater lakes but have much greater spatial cover. As in freshwater communities, physical characteristics are used to differentiate marine biological zones. Self-Assessment 3.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 3.3 Marine biological zones are determined by ocean depth, light availability, and the stability of the bottom substrate. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 3.3.1 Describe how substrate stability at the bottom of nearshore and shallow ocean zones determines which types of organisms are present, particularly emergent and non-emergent vascular plants and large algae. 3.3.2 Explain how different sources of energy and food affect the type and number of ocean organisms that exist in the water\u2019s surface and in the deepest depths. Marine Biological Zones Oceans cover 71% of Earth\u2019s surface and contain a rich diversity of life. The vast area and volume of the oceans and their environmental uniformity make them considerably different from terrestrial ecosystems in terms of biological organization. Marine organisms are more widely dispersed, and marine communities are not as easily organized into broad biological units as terrestrial biomes are. Instead, marine biological zones are coarsely categorized by their physical locations relative to shorelines and the ocean bottom (FIGURE 3.16). The distributions of the organisms that inhabit these zones reflect differences in temperature, as we saw for terrestrial biomes, as well as other important factors, including light availability, water depth, stability of the bottom substrate, and interactions with other organisms. FIGURE 3.16 Marine Biological Zones Biological zones in the ocean are categorized by water depth and by their physical locations relative to shorelines and the ocean bottom. In this section, we will take a tour of the biological zones of the oceans, from the margins of the land to the deep, dark, cold ocean bottom. We will examine the physical and biological factors that characterize the different zones and the major organisms found in them. Nearshore zones reflect the influence of tides and substrate stability Marine biological zones adjacent to the continents are influenced by local climate, by the rise and fall of ocean waters associated with tides, and by wave action and the influx of fresh water and terrestrial sediments from rivers. Tides are generated by the gravitational attraction between Earth and the moon and sun. Ocean water rises and falls in most nearshore zones twice daily. The magnitude of the tidal range varies greatly among different locations because it is related to shoreline morphology and ocean bottom structure. Tides produce unique transition zones between terrestrial and marine environments and influence salinity and nutrient availability in these nearshore habitats. ESTUARIES The junction of a river with the ocean is called an estuary (FIGURE 3.17). Estuaries are characterized by variations in salinity associated with the flow of fresh river water into the ocean and the influx of salt water flowing inland from the ocean as tides rise. Rivers bring terrestrial sediments containing nutrients and organic matter to the ocean, and the interaction of tidal and river flows acts to trap these sediments in estuaries, enhancing their productivity. The varying salinity of estuaries is an important determinant of the organisms that occur there. Many commercially valuable fish species spend their juvenile stages in estuaries, away from fish predators that are not as tolerant of the changes in salinity. Other inhabitants of estuaries include shellfish (e.g., clams and oysters), crabs, marine worms, and seagrasses. Estuaries are increasingly threatened by water pollution carried by rivers. Nutrients from upstream agricultural sources can cause local dead zones (see Concept 25.3) and losses of biological diversity. FIGURE 3.17 Estuaries Are Junctions between Rivers and Oceans The mixing of fresh and salt water gives estuaries a unique environment with varying salinity. Rivers bring in energy and nutrients from terrestrial ecosystems. SALT MARSHES Terrestrial sediments carried to shorelines by rivers form shallow marsh zones (FIGURE 3.18) that are dominated by vascular plants that rise out of the water, including grasses, rushes, and broadleaved herbs. In these salt marshes, as in the estuaries that they often border, the input of nutrients from rivers enhances productivity. Periodic flooding of the marsh at high tide results in a gradient of salinity: the highest portions of the marsh can be the most saline because infrequent flooding and evaporation of water from the soil lead to a progressive buildup of salts.", "Salt marsh plants grow in distinct zones that reflect this salinity gradient, with the most salt-tolerant species in the highest portions of the marsh. Salt marshes provide food and protection from predators for a wide variety of animals, including fish, crabs, birds, and mammals. Organic matter trapped in salt marsh sediments may serve as a nutrient and energy source for nearby marine ecosystems. FIGURE 3.18 Salt Marshes Are Characterized by Salt-Tolerant Vascular Plants Emergent vascular plants form salt marshes in shallow nearshore zones. MANGROVE FORESTS Shallow coastal estuaries and nearby mudflats in tropical and subtropical regions are inhabited by salt-tolerant evergreen trees and shrubs (FIGURE 3.19). These woody plants are collectively referred to as mangroves, but \u201cmangroves\u201d include species from 16 different plant families, not a single taxonomic group. Mangrove roots trap mud and sediments carried by the water, which build up and modify the shoreline. Like salt marshes, mangrove forests provide nutrients to other marine ecosystems and habitat for numerous animals, both marine and terrestrial. Among the unique animals associated with mangroves are manatees, crab-eating monkeys, fishing cats, and monitor lizards. Mangrove forests are threatened by human development of coastal areas\u2014particularly the development of shrimp farms\u2014as well as by water pollution, diversion of inland freshwater sources, and cutting of the forests for wood. FIGURE 3.19 Salt-Tolerant Evergreen Trees and Shrubs Form Estuarine Mangrove Forests The mangrove roots trap mud and sediments and provide habitat for other marine organisms. ROCKY INTERTIDAL ZONES Rocky shorelines provide a stable substrate to which a diverse collection of algae and animals can anchor themselves to keep from being washed away by the pounding waves (FIGURE 3.20). The physical environment of the intertidal zone\u2014the part of the shoreline affected by the rise and fall of the tides\u2014alternates between marine and terrestrial. Between the high- and low-tide marks, a host of organisms are arranged in zones associated with their tolerance for temperature changes, salinity, desiccation (drying out), wave action, and interactions with other organisms. Sessile (attached) organisms such as barnacles, mussels, and seaweeds must cope with these stresses in order to survive. Mobile organisms, such as sea stars and sea urchins, may move to tide pools in order to minimize exposure to these stresses. FIGURE 3.20 The Rocky Intertidal Zone: Stable Substrate, Changing Conditions Rocky shorelines provide a stable substrate to which organisms can anchor themselves, but those organisms must cope with the shift from terrestrial to marine conditions that occurs with each tide, as well as wave action. Sessile organisms must be resistant to temperature changes and desiccation. Mobile organisms often take refuge in tide pools to avoid exposure to the terrestrial environment. SANDY SHORES Except for a few scurrying crabs and shorebirds and the occasional bit of seaweed washed ashore, sandy beaches appear devoid of life. Unlike the rocky shore, the sandy substrate provides no stable anchoring surface, and the lack of attached seaweeds limits the supply of potential food for herbivorous animals. Tidal fluctuations and wave action further limit the potential for the development of biological communities. Beneath the sand, however, invertebrates such as clams, sea worms, and mole crabs find suitable habitat (FIGURE 3.21). Smaller organisms, such as polychaete worms, hydroids (small animals related to jellyfishes), and copepods (tiny crustaceans), live on or among the grains of sand. These organisms are protected from temperature changes and desiccation at low tide and from the turbulent water at high tide. When the sand is immersed in seawater, some of these organisms emerge to feed on detritus or other organisms, while others remain buried and filter detritus and plankton from the water. FIGURE 3.21 Burrowing Clams Clams, like most animals of sandy shorelines, live in the sandy substrate. Shallow ocean zones are diverse and productive Near the coastline, enough light may reach the ocean bottom to permit the establishment of sessile photosynthetic organisms. Like terrestrial plants, these photosynthetic organisms provide energy that supports communities of animals and microorganisms, as well as a physical structure that creates habitat for those organisms, including surfaces to which they can anchor and places where they can find refuge from predators. The diversity and complexity of the habitats provided by the photosynthesizers support considerable biological diversity in these shallow ocean environments. CORAL REEFS In warm, shallow ocean waters, corals (animals related to jellyfishes), living in a close association with algal partners (a symbiotic mutualism; see Concept 15.1), form large colonies.", "The corals obtain most of their energy from algae that live within their bodies, while the algae receive protection from grazers and some nutrients from the corals. Many corals build a skeleton-like structure by extracting calcium carbonate from seawater. Over time, these coral skeletons pile up into massive formations called reefs (FIGURE 3.22). The formation of reefs is aided by other organisms that extract other minerals from seawater, such as sponges that precipitate silica. The unique association of these reef-building organisms gives rise to a structurally complex habitat that supports a rich marine community. FIGURE 3.22 A Coral Reef Corals, like this one off of North Sulawesi, Indonesia, create habitat for a diverse assemblage of marine organisms. Coral reefs grow at rates of only a few millimeters per year, but they have shaped the face of Earth (Birkeland 1997). Over millions of years, corals have constructed thousands of kilometers of coastline and numerous islands (FIGURE 3.23). The rate of production of living biomass in coral reefs is among the highest on Earth. The accretions of coral skeletons are as much as 1,300 m (4,300 feet) thick in some places, and they currently cover a surface area of 600,000 km2 (23,000 square miles), approximately 0.2% of the ocean surface. FIGURE 3.23 Coral Reefs Can Be Seen from Outer Space Long Island, in the Bahamas, was formed by coral reefs, which can be seen on the fringes of the island in this satellite photograph. As many as a million species are found in coral reefs worldwide, including more than 4,000 fishes. Many economically important fish species rely on coral reefs for habitat, and reef fishes provide a source of food for fishes of the open ocean, such as jacks and tuna. The taxonomic and morphological diversity of animals in coral reefs is greater than in any other ecosystem on Earth (Paulay 1997). The full diversity of coral reefs has yet to be explored and described, however. The potential for development of medicines from coral reef organisms is great enough that the U.S. National Institutes of Health established a laboratory in Micronesia to explore it. Human activities threaten the health of coral reefs in a number of ways. Sediments carried by rivers can cover and kill the corals, and excess nutrients increase the growth of algae on the surfaces of the corals, increasing coral mortality. Changes in ocean temperatures associated with climate change can result in the loss of the corals\u2019 algal partners, a condition called bleaching. Increased atmospheric CO2 has increased ocean acidification (discussed in more detail in Concept 25.1), which inhibits the ability of corals to form skeletons (Orr et al. 2005). Another threat is an increased incidence of fungal infections, possibly related to increased environmental stress. SEAGRASS BEDS Although we typically associate flowering plants with terrestrial environments, some flowering plants are important components of shallow (<5 m) underwater communities. These submerged flowering plants are called seagrasses, although they are not closely related to plants in the grass family. Morphologically, they are similar to their relatives on land, with roots, stems, and leaves as well as flowers, which are pollinated under water. Seagrass beds are found on subtidal marine sediments composed of mud or fine sand. The plants reproduce primarily by vegetative growth, although they produce seeds as well. Marine algae and animals grow on the surfaces of the plants, and the larval stages of some organisms, such as mussels, are dependent on them for habitat. Inputs of nutrients from upstream agricultural activities can harm seagrass beds by increasing the density of algae in the water and on the surfaces of the seagrasses. Seagrasses are also susceptible to periodic outbreaks of fungal diseases. KELP BEDS In clear, shallow (<15 m) temperate ocean waters, large stands of seaweed, known as kelp beds or kelp forests (FIGURE 3.24), support a rich and dynamic community of marine life. Kelp are large brown algae of several different genera. They have specialized tissues resembling leaves (fronds), stems (stipes), and roots (holdfasts). Kelp are found where a solid substrate is available for anchoring. Residents of kelp beds include sea urchins, lobsters, mussels, abalones, numerous other seaweeds, and sea otters. Interactions among these organisms, both direct and indirect, influence the abundance of the kelp (see the Case Study in Chapter 9). In the absence of grazing, kelp beds can become so dense that light reaching the bottom of the canopy is not sufficient to support photosynthesis.", "FIGURE 3.24 A Kelp Bed Giant kelp are brown algae (order Laminariales) that attach themselves to the solid bottom in shallow ocean waters, providing food and habitat for many other marine organisms. Open ocean and deep benthic zones are determined by light availability and proximity to the bottom Beyond the continental shelves, the vastness and depth of the open ocean, known as the pelagic zone, make it difficult to differentiate distinct biological communities there. Light availability determines where photosynthetic organisms can occur, which in turn determines the availability of food for animals and microorganisms. Thus, the surface waters with enough light to support photosynthesis (the photic zone) contain the highest densities of organisms (see Figure 3.16). The photic zone extends about 200 m downward from the ocean surface, depending on water clarity. Below the photic zone, the supply of energy, mainly in the form of detritus falling from the photic zone, is much lower, and life is far less abundant. The diversity of life in the pelagic zone varies considerably. Its nekton (swimming organisms capable of overcoming ocean currents) include cephalopods such as squids and octopuses, fishes, sea turtles, and mammals such as whales and porpoises. Most of the photosynthesis in the pelagic zone is carried out by phytoplankton, which include green algae, diatoms, dinoflagellates, and cyanobacteria (FIGURE 3.25A). Zooplankton include protists such as ciliates, crustaceans such as copepods and krill, and jellyfishes (FIGURE 3.25B). Many species of pelagic seabirds, including albatrosses, petrels, fulmars, and boobies, spend the majority of their lives flying over open ocean waters, feeding on marine prey (fish and zooplankton) and detritus found on the ocean surface. FIGURE 3.25 Plankton of the Pelagic Zone (A) This sample of marine phytoplankton includes several species of diatoms, including Biddulphia sinensis (the rectangular cells with the concave ends) and Thalassiothrix. (B) These marine zooplankton include adult copepods and the larval stages of various organisms, including the zoea (spherical) larva of a crab. Organisms that live in the pelagic zone must overcome the effects of gravity and water currents that could force them to progressively greater depths. Photosynthetic organisms, and those directly dependent on them as a food source, must stay in the photic zone where sunlight is sufficient to maintain photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction. Swimming is an obvious solution to this problem, used by organisms such as fishes and squids. Seaweeds such as Sargassum and some fish species have gas-filled bladders that keep them buoyant. Large mats of Sargassum sometimes form \u201cfloating islands\u201d that host rich and diverse biological communities. Some plankton retard their sinking by decreasing their density relative to seawater (e.g., by altering their chemical composition) or through shapes that lower their downward velocity (e.g., having a cell wall with projections). Beneath the photic zone, the availability of energy decreases, and the physical environment becomes more demanding as temperatures drop and water pressure rises. As a result, organisms are few and far between. Crustaceans such as copepods graze on the rain of falling detritus from the photic zone. Crustaceans, cephalopods, and fishes are the predators of the deep sea. Some fishes take on frightening forms, appearing to be mostly mouth (FIGURE 3.26). The meanings of the scientific names given to some of the sea creatures at this depth, such as \u201cvampire squid from hell\u201d (Vampyroteuthis infernalis), \u201cstalked toad with many filaments\u201d (Caulophryne polynema), and \u201cPrince Axel\u2019s wonder fish\u201d (Thaumatichthys axeli), testify to the unusual forms found there. Most deep-sea fishes have weak bone structure to reduce their weight and lack the gas bladder found in most fishes, since the high pressures would collapse it. FIGURE 3.26 A Denizen of the Deep Pelagic Zone Anglerfish (Melanocetus spp.) are named for their unique strategy for capturing prey. In the lightless depths, the bioluminescent organ on the fish\u2019s forehead attracts prey to a position where they are easily engulfed by the huge, tooth-filled mouth. The ocean bottom (the benthic zone) is also very sparsely populated. Temperatures are near freezing, and pressures are great enough to crush any terrestrial organism. Conversely, if deep-sea creatures adapted to these high pressures are brought to the surface, their bodies may expand and burst. The sediments of the benthic zone, which are rich in organic matter, are inhabited by bacteria and protists as well as sea worms. Sea stars and sea cucumbers graze the ocean floor, consuming organic matter or organisms in the sediments or filtering food from the water. Benthic predators, like those of the deep pelagic zone, use bioluminescence to lure prey.", "Unique communities of organisms can be found in hydrothermal vents scattered in the benthic zone in association with volcanic activity. Seawater that is chemically altered by magma provides chemical energy that supports these relatively rich and diverse communities (see the Case Study for Chapter 20). The benthic zone has received increasing attention in the past two decades but still remains one of the least explored marine biological zones. Marine biological zones have been impacted by human activities Our discussion of marine biological zones has alluded to several services they provide to humans, including food production (e.g., fisheries in the nearshore and open ocean zones), protection of coastal areas from erosion (e.g., mangrove forests), uptake and stabilization of pollutants and nutrients (estuaries and marshes), and recreational benefits (Barbier et al. 2011). These services, along with ocean biodiversity, are increasingly threatened by human activities. Despite the vastness of the ocean, human activities have affected it to varying degrees over the majority of its area (FIGURE 3.27). These include land-based activities that release nutrients and pollutants into rivers, ocean-based activities such as commercial fishing, and emissions of greenhouse gases. The effects of these activities include changes in water temperature and ocean acidification due to increases in greenhouse gases, increases in UV radiation due to the loss of protective stratospheric ozone, inputs of pollutants, and overharvesting of sea creatures, particularly fishes and whales (Halpern et al. 2008). (See Concepts 25.2 and 25.4 for more discussion of ozone loss and the greenhouse effect.) These impacts have the potential to influence the services on which humans depend, as well as the composition and abundance of the biota that inhabit different marine biological zones. The greatest estimated impacts are in nearshore marine ecosystems (estuaries, rocky intertidal zones, and sandy shores) near terrestrial regions that are sources of pollutants and nutrients, such as the regions adjacent to northern Europe and eastern Asia. Concern is increasing about the role of discarded plastics in the marine environment, with plastic trash found in nearly all marine zones, imparting a high potential to adversely impact marine organisms (Rochman et al. 2016; Law 2017). Despite the widespread nature of human impacts, large areas of the ocean remain only moderately affected, and greater recognition of these impacts could lead to increased conservation and more sustainable use of ocean resources. FIGURE 3.27 Human Impacts on the Oceans The impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, pollutant inputs, and overfishing have varied in different regions of the oceans. The colors represent the degree of impact, which was quantified using expert judgments of 17 different environmental impact factors. The enlarged areas from the Caribbean Sea (left), North Atlantic Ocean (center), and western Pacific Ocean (right) show greater detail of more heavily impacted areas. Note the correspondence between the areas of high and very high impact with areas of significant human impact in the adjacent terrestrial regions in Interactive Figure 3.5. (From B. S. Halpern et al. 2008. Science 319: 948\u2013952.) Self-Assessment 3.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED The American Serengeti\u2014Twelve Centuries of Change in the Great Plains Humans have been implicated in several major biological changes in the grasslands of the world. One of the earliest was the disappearance of large mammals from North America during the late Pleistocene. Paul Martin, an early proponent of this hypothesis, noted the strong correspondence between extinction events on several continents and the arrival of humans on those continents, principally Europe, North and South America, and Australia (Martin 1984, 2005). Martin suggested that the rapidity of the extinctions and the greater proportion of large animals that disappeared reflected the hunting efficiency of those early humans. Larger animals have lower reproductive rates than smaller animals, so they cannot recover from increases in predation as quickly. Martin\u2019s suggestion therefore took on the unfortunate label of \u201cthe overkill hypothesis.\u201d Since it was first proposed, the overkill hypothesis has received increasing support. Archeological research has uncovered numerous butchering sites containing remains of extinct animals. Spearheads have been found among the bones, and some of the bones have scrape marks made by tools found at the sites. Other strong evidence indicates that human arrival on small, isolated oceanic islands led to large numbers of extinctions due to predation by humans and by other animals they introduced (e.g., rats and snakes).", "While most scientists now accept that hunting of megafauna by humans had a role in some of the continental extinctions in the late Pleistocene, other causes have been proposed as well. These causes include the spread of diseases carried by humans and possibly by the domesticated dogs that accompanied them (MacPhee and Marx 1997). Another hypothesis suggests that the loss of some animals on which other species depended, such as mastodons, led to more widespread extinctions (Owen-Smith 1987). No one hypothesis explains the extinctions of all the megafauna on all the continents, however. A combination of climate change and the arrival of humans probably contributed to their demise (Barnosky et al. 2004). Although the diversity of large mammals on the Great Plains was greatly diminished following the Pleistocene, large mammals were still abundant. Bison may have numbered 30 million, and numerous elk (wapiti), pronghorn, and deer roamed the plains. These animals continued to be hunted by humans, who also began to use fire on the eastern edge of the Great Plains as a tool for managing the habitat of their prey, as well as for small-scale agriculture (Delcourt et al. 1998). The writings of travelers to the Great Plains in the early 1800s indicate that the western edge of the eastern deciduous forest was farther east than it is today, probably because of the influence of human-set fires. Between 1700 and 1900, ecological changes occurred in the Great Plains that profoundly transformed both the plants and the animals. The reintroduction of horses into North America by Spanish explorers facilitated the development of a Native American culture centered on the hunting of bison. The arrival of Euro-Americans, and their subsequent conflicts with Native Americans, led to the near extinction of bison and other large Plains animals by the late 1800s (FIGURE 3.28). With the arrival of cattle and mechanized agriculture after 1850, the Great Plains became a domesticated landscape. The moister eastern tallgrass prairie was converted into monocultures of corn, wheat, soybeans, and other crops; today, only 4% of that grassland remains. A larger proportion of the mixed-grass and short-grass prairies to the west remained intact, but overgrazing and unsustainable agricultural practices led to serious degradation of some of these areas during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, when drought and massive windstorms resulted in substantial losses of fertile topsoil (see the Case Study in Chapter 25). FIGURE 3.28 Buffalo Hunting The arrival of large numbers of Euro-Americans in the Great Plains in the nineteenth century led to a mass slaughter of bison, facilitated by the construction of railroad lines and the use of high-powered rifles. CONNECTIONS in NATURE LONG-TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH Most terrestrial biomes and marine biological zones across the globe are experiencing changes due to human activities (see Figures 3.5 and 3.27 and ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 3.1). Even remote, seemingly pristine areas are subject to the effects of climate change and air pollution. Recognizing the effects of human activities on these systems, as well as our incomplete understanding of those effects, the U.S. National Science Foundation initiated the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network of study sites in 1980. Initially consisting of 5 sites, the network has grown to 28 sites representing a diversity of terrestrial biomes, from tropical to polar, as well as marine biological zones, croplands, and urban centers (FIGURE 3.29). The formation of the U.S. LTER program has spurred the formation of an international network of LTER sites, facilitating international collaborative research to better understand Earth\u2019s ecological systems. FIGURE 3.29 Long-Term Ecological Research Sites Twenty-eight research sites constitute the U.S. Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network. These sites encompass deserts, grasslands, forests, mountains, lakes, estuaries, agricultural systems, and cities. Researchers measure long-term changes in ecosystems and perform experiments at these sites to better understand ecological dynamics over decades to centuries. Long-term ecological research has advanced our understanding of ecological changes that occur at decadal and longer time scales. For example, research at LTER sites in the western United States has led to an understanding of the influence of El Ni Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (two climate cycles discussed in Concept 2.5) on the grassland biome. The legacy of climate change since the last glacial maximum, discussed in the Case Study at the opening of this chapter, is also better understood as a result of this research. Finally, research at LTER sites is providing a view of how environmental change, including climate change, may influence terrestrial biomes and marine biological zones in the future.", "In this chapter, we\u2019ve learned that grasslands are the biome most heavily impacted by human activities due to agricultural development. The Konza Prairie LTER site, located in the Flint Hills of northeastern Kansas, is a remnant tallgrass prairie\u2014a very heavily impacted grassland type with very little of its original cover remaining. Research at the Konza Prairie site has focused on conserving this endangered biome in the face of rapid climate and land use change by examining the interactive roles of fire, grazing, and climate in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. This research has included experiments varying the frequencies of fire and grazing in large landscape units to investigate their importance in maintaining the dominance of the grasses that characterize the grassland biome (FIGURE 3.30). Researchers have also examined the potential effects of changes in precipitation by varying the amount, intensity, and timing of watering. Results from this research have provided important insights into how climate change may affect the grassland biome, indicating that extremes in rainfall are important controls on its diversity and function (Knapp et al. 2002). Research at this and other LTER sites will enhance our ability to conserve native biodiversity in the face of accelerating environmental change. FIGURE 3.30 Research at the Konza Prairie LTER Site Long-term research and experiments are investigating the effects of the frequencies of (A) grazing, (B) fire, and (C) precipitation on the diversity and function of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. Coping with Environmental Variation: Temperature and Water KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 4.1 Each species has a range of environmental tolerances that determines its potential geographic distribution. CONCEPT 4.2 The temperature of an organism is determined by exchanges of energy with the external environment. CONCEPT 4.3 The water balance of an organism is determined by exchanges of water and solutes with the external environment. Frozen Frogs: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 The idea of suspended animation\u2014life being put on hold temporarily\u2014has captured the imagination and hopes of people waiting for medical science to develop ways to cure untreatable diseases or reverse the ravages of aging. Cryonics is the preservation of the bodies of deceased people at subfreezing temperatures with the goal of eventually bringing them back to life and restoring them to good health. Proponents of cryonics exist throughout the world, some more visible than others. In Nederland, Colorado, there is a yearly \u201cFrozen Dead Guy Days\u201d festival, considered to be the \u201cMardi Gras of cryonics.\u201d This festival commemorates the efforts of a former resident who had his grandfather frozen immediately after his death from heart failure, hoping that one day his grandfather could be brought back to life and given a heart transplant (as documented in the movie Grandpa\u2019s Still in the Tuff Shed). To some, cryonics seems far-fetched, a thing of science fiction and comedy (such as the TV show Futurama and the Austin Powers movies). Bringing life to a halt and then restarting it after a long period of quiescence doesn\u2019t seem plausible. Yet strange tales from nature provide examples of life apparently springing out of death. While seeking the existence of the Northwest Passage in the boreal and Arctic zones of Canada in 1769\u20131772, the English explorer Samuel Hearne found frogs under shallow layers of leaves and moss in winter \u201cfrozen as hard as ice, in which state the legs are as easily broken off as a pipe-stem\u201d (Hearne 1911) (FIGURE 4.1). Hearne wrapped the frogs in animal skins and placed them next to his campfire. Within hours, the rock-hard amphibians came to life and began hopping around. The American naturalist John Burroughs found frozen frogs under a shallow cover of dead leaves in a New York forest in winter. Return visits to the same locations over a period of months indicated that the frogs hadn\u2019t moved, yet by spring they had disappeared. Could a complex organism like a frog, with a sophisticated circulatory and nervous system, have achieved cryonic preservation as an evolutionary response to a harsh winter climate? FIGURE 4.1 A Frozen Frog Wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) spend winters in a partially frozen state, without breathing and with no circulation or heartbeat. Organisms of the temperate and polar zones face tremendous challenges imposed by a seasonal climate that includes subfreezing temperatures in winter. Amphibians are unlikely candidates to have solved this challenge by allowing their bodies to partially freeze.", "Aside from their aforementioned complex organ and tissue systems, amphibians are \u201ccold-blooded\u201d (generating little heat internally) and, as a group, first evolved in tropical and subtropical biomes. Yet two frog species, the wood frog (Rana sylvatica, also known as Lithobates sylvaticus) and the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata), live in the tundra biome (FIGURE 4.2) (Pinder et al. 1992). These frogs survive extended periods of subfreezing air temperatures in shallow burrows in a semi-frozen state, with no heartbeat, no blood circulation, and no breathing. Among the vertebrates, only a few species of amphibians (four frogs and one salamander) and one turtle species can survive a long winter in a semi-frozen state. Freezing in most organisms results in substantial damage to tissues as ice crystals perforate cell membranes and organelles. How do these vertebrates survive being frozen without turning to mush in spring when they thaw out and reinitiate their blood circulation and breathing? FIGURE 4.2 Northern Exposure Wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata) have geographic ranges that extend into the boreal forest and tundra biomes.

View the script for the video Introduction Siberian spruce trees (Picea obovata) experience the extreme range of seasonal temperatures characteristic of a continental climate. In the Siberian boreal forest, air temperatures regularly drop below \u201350\u00b0C (\u201358\u00b0F) in winter, and in summer they reach 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F). Being an immobile tree, the Siberian spruce lacks the option to move to Florida for the winter or head to the coast to cool off in summer. The spruce must tolerate these temperature extremes, surviving the 80\u00b0C (144\u00b0F) seasonal change in its body temperature. Other organisms can avoid these extremes through some behavior or physiological change. These two options for coping with environmental change, tolerance and avoidance, provide a useful framework for thinking about how organisms cope with the environmental extremes they face. The range of physical environmental conditions described in Chapter 2 establishes the variation in biomes and marine biological zones described in Chapter 3. In this chapter and the next, we will examine the interactions between organisms and the physical environment that influence their survival and persistence, and therefore their geographic ranges. The study of these interactions is known as physiological ecology. CONCEPT 4.1 Each species has a range of environmental tolerances that determines its potential geographic distribution. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 4.1.1 Explain why the physical environment is the ultimate determinant of the geographic distribution of a species. 4.1.2 Differentiate between adaptation and acclimatization by explaining how both individual organisms and populations respond differently to changes in the environment. 4.1.3 Illustrate how adaptation and acclimatization may result in trade-offs with other functions. Responses to Environmental Variation A fundamental principle in ecology is that the geographic ranges of species are related to constraints imposed by the physical and biological environments. In this section, we will discuss the general principles of organismal responses to the physical environment. Species distributions reflect environmental influences on energy acquisition and physiological tolerances The potential geographic range of a species is ultimately determined by the physical environment, which influences an organism\u2019s ecological success (its survival and reproduction) in two important ways. First, the physical environment affects an organism\u2019s ability to obtain the energy and resources required to maintain its metabolic functions, and therefore to grow and reproduce. Rates of photosynthesis and abundances of prey, for example, are controlled by environmental conditions. Therefore, the ability of a species to maintain a viable population is constrained at the limits of its potential geographic range. Second, as we saw in Concept 2.1, an organism\u2019s survival can be affected by extreme environmental conditions. If temperature, water supply, chemical concentrations, or other physical conditions exceed what an organism can tolerate, the organism will die. These two influences\u2014the availability of energy and resources and physical tolerance limits\u2014are not mutually exclusive, as energy supply influences an organism\u2019s ability to tolerate environmental extremes. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that the actual geographic distribution of a species differs from its potential distribution because of other factors, such as dispersal ability (see Concept 18.1), disturbance (e.g., fire; see Concept 17.1), and interactions with other organisms, such as competition (see Unit 4) (FIGURE 4.3).", "FIGURE 4.3 Abundance Varies across Environmental Gradients The abundance of an organism reaches a theoretical maximum at some optimal value across an environmental gradient and drops off at either end at values that constrain the potential geographic distribution of the organism. The actual abundance curve is likely to differ from the potential abundance curve because of biological interactions. As we saw in Concept 3.1, the immobility of plants makes them good indicators of the physical environment. Farmers are acutely aware of the effects of extreme events on the survival of crop plants, which are often grown outside the geographic ranges where they evolved. Frosts or extreme droughts can result in catastrophic crop losses. The aspen (Populus tremuloides) provides a good example of a native species whose geographic range is related to its climate tolerance. Aspen occurs in boreal forests and mountain zones throughout North America. Its geographic distribution can be predicted fairly accurately from the observed effects of climate on its survival and reproduction (Morin et al. 2007) (FIGURE 4.4A). The climate factors that limit its distribution include the effects of low temperatures on its reproductive success and the effects of drought and low temperatures on its survival (FIGURE 4.4B). The range of climate conditions under which a species occurs\u2014its climate envelope\u2014provides a useful tool for predicting its response to climate change (see Chapter 25). FIGURE 4.4 Climate and Aspen Distribution The geographic distribution of the aspen (Populus tremuloides; golden trees in the photo) is associated with climate. (A) Predicted distribution of aspen, based on the effects of climate factors on survival and reproduction observed in natural populations, mapped with the actual distribution. (B) Climate factors limiting the distribution of aspen, based on observations of natural populations. (After X. Morin et al. 2007. Ecology 88: 2280\u20132291.) The future climate is predicted to be warmer throughout the interior of western North America and drier in the central portions of the continent. How will these changes influence the geographic distribution of aspen? Individuals respond to environmental variation through acclimatization Any physiological process, such as growth or photosynthesis, has a set of optimal environmental conditions most conducive to its functioning. Deviations from those optimal conditions cause a decrease in the rate of the process (FIGURE 4.5). Stress is the condition in which an environmental change results in a decrease in the rate of an important physiological process, thereby lowering the potential for an organism\u2019s survival, growth, or reproduction. For example, when you travel to high elevations, typically above 2,400 m (8,000 feet), the lower partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere (see p. 70) results in the delivery of less oxygen to your tissues by your circulatory system. This condition, known as hypoxia, results when the amount of oxygen picked up by hemoglobin molecules in your blood decreases. Hypoxia causes \u201caltitude sickness,\u201d a type of physiological stress, decreasing your ability to exercise and think clearly and making you feel nauseated. FIGURE 4.5 Environmental Control of Physiological Processes The rates of physiological processes are greatest under a set of optimal environmental conditions (e.g., optimal temperature, optimal water availability). Deviations from the optimum cause a decrease in the rates of physiological processes. Many organisms have the ability to adjust their physiology, morphology, or behavior to lessen the effect of an environmental change and minimize the associated stress. This kind of adjustment, known as acclimatization,1 is usually a short-term, reversible process. Your body acclimatizes to a high elevation if you remain there for several weeks (but only below 5,500 m, or 18,000 feet). Acclimatization to high elevations involves higher breathing rates, greater production of red blood cells and associated hemoglobin, and higher pressure in the pulmonary arteries to circulate blood into areas of the lung that are not used at lower elevations (Hochochka and Somero 2002). The outcome of these physiological changes is the delivery of more oxygen to your tissues. The acclimatization process reverses when you return to lower elevations. Populations respond to environmental variation through adaptation Within the geographic range of a species, particular populations occur in unique environments (e.g., cool climates, saline soils) that may have initially been stressful to the organisms when they first occupied them. Genetic variation among the individuals within such populations in physiological, morphological, or behavioral traits that influenced their survival, functioning, and reproduction in the new environment would have led to natural selection favoring those individuals whose traits made them best able to cope with the new conditions.", "The underlying genetic basis for these traits would have resulted in a change over generations in the genetic makeup of the population as the abundance of individuals with the favored traits increased (see Concept 6.3). Such traits are known as adaptations. Over many generations, these unique, genetically based solutions to environmental stress would have become more frequent in the population. Adaptation is similar to acclimatization in that both processes involve a change that minimizes stress, and the ability to acclimatize represents a type of adaptation. However, adaptation differs from acclimatization in being a long-term, genetic response of a population to environmental stress that increases its ecological success under the stressful conditions (FIGURE 4.6). Populations with adaptations to unique environments are called ecotypes. Ecotypes may represent responses to both abiotic (e.g., temperature, water availability, soil type, salinity) and biotic (e.g., competition, predation) environmental factors. Ecotypes can eventually become separate species as the physiology and morphology of individuals in different populations diverge and the populations eventually become reproductively isolated. FIGURE 4.6 Organismal Responses to Stress Organisms respond to stress over different time scales. (After H. Lambers et al. 1998. Plant Physiological Ecology. Springer: New York.) Returning to our previous example of stress at high elevations, some human populations have lived continuously in the Andean highlands for at least 10,000 years. When Spanish explorers first settled in the Andes alongside the native people in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, their birth rates were lower than those of the natives for two to three generations, probably because of poor oxygen supply to developing fetuses (Ward et al. 1995). The same held true for the domesticated animals they brought with them. This comparison provides anecdotal evidence that the native Andean populations had become adapted to the low-oxygen conditions at high elevations. Research in the twentieth century showed that adaptations to high elevations by Andean natives include higher red blood cell production and greater lung capacity (Ward et al. 1995). Adaptations to environmental stress can vary among populations. In other words, the solution to a particular environmental problem may not be the same for each population, as demonstrated by a comparison of human populations native to the Andean and Tibetan highlands. The adaptations to high elevations in Andean populations (high red blood cell concentration and large lung capacity) are not the same as those found in Tibetan populations (Beall 2007). Tibetan populations have red blood cell concentrations similar to, and blood oxygen concentrations lower than, populations at sea level, but they have a higher breathing rate, which enhances the exchange of oxygen with the blood system, and higher blood flows, which improves delivery of oxygen to vital organs such as the brain. Thus, there are at least two different ways in which human populations have adapted to the hypoxic stress imposed by living at high elevations. Acclimatization and adaptation are not \u201cfree\u201d; they require an investment of energy and resources by the organism. They represent possible trade-offs with other functions of the organism that may also affect its survival and reproduction. Acclimatization and adaptation must therefore increase the survival and reproductive success of the organism under the specific environmental conditions in order to be favored over other patterns of energy and resource investment. Trade-offs in energy and resource allocation are discussed in Concept 7.3. In the remaining two sections, we will examine the factors that determine organisms\u2019 temperatures, water content, and water uptake, and we will consider examples of acclimatization and adaptation that allow organisms to function in the face of varying temperatures and water availability. Self-Assessment 4.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 4.2 The temperature of an organism is determined by exchanges of energy with the external environment. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 4.2.1 Describe how the body temperature of an organism influences its functioning. 4.2.2 Use information about the gains and losses of energy to determine whether an organism\u2019s temperature is rising or dropping. 4.2.3 Identify the heat exchange mechanisms used by plants and animals to regulate their body temperatures. 4.2.4 Contrast ectothermy and endothermy, and explain how each influences the geographic distributions of organisms, along with organisms\u2019 sensitivities to changes in body temperature. Variation in Temperature Environmental temperatures vary greatly throughout the biosphere, as we saw in Chapter 2. The Siberian boreal forest described earlier in this chapter represents one extreme of seasonal variation, with as much as an 80\u00b0C (144\u00b0F) swing from summer to winter.", "Tropical forests, on the other hand, experience far less seasonal variation in temperature, about 15\u00b0C (22\u00b0F). Soil environments, which are home to many species of microorganisms, plant roots, and animals, are buffered from aboveground environmental temperature extremes, although soil surface temperatures may change as much as or more than air temperatures. Aquatic environments also experience temperature changes over seasonal and daily time scales. Open ocean environments tend to have very little temporal variation in temperature, because of the ocean\u2019s massive volume and heat capacity. In contrast, tide pools experience large variations in water temperature as the tides rise and fall, with as much as a 20\u00b0C (36\u00b0F) change over a 5-hour period. The survival and functioning of organisms are strongly tied to their internal temperatures. The extreme upper limit for metabolically active multicellular plants and animals is about 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F) (FIGURE 4.7). Some archaea and bacteria that live in hot springs can function at 90\u00b0C (194\u00b0F) (Willmer et al. 2005). The extreme lower limit for organismal function is tied to the temperature at which water in cells freezes, typically between \u20132\u00b0C and \u20135\u00b0C (28\u00b0F\u201323\u00b0F). Some organisms can survive periods of extreme heat or cold by entering a state of dormancy, in which little or no metabolic activity occurs. FIGURE 4.7 Temperature Ranges for Life on Earth Living organisms are known to exist in extreme environments, ranging from hot springs to freezing seas. (After P. Willmer et al. 2005. Environmental Physiology of Animals. Blackwell Publishing: Malden, MA.) The internal temperature of an organism is determined by the balance between the energy it gains from and the energy it loses to the external environment. Thus, organisms must either tolerate changes in their internal temperature as the temperature of the external environment changes or modify their internal temperature by using some physiological, morphological, or behavioral means of adjusting these gains and losses. Environmental temperatures\u2014particularly their extremes\u2014are therefore important determinants of the distributions of organisms, as demonstrated by the relationship between biomes and global climate patterns discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. Temperature controls physiological activity Key biochemical reactions important to maintenance of life are temperature sensitive. Each reaction has an optimal temperature that is related to the activity of enzymes, protein-based molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions. Enzymes are structurally stable under a limited range of temperatures. At high temperatures, the constituent proteins lose their structural integrity, or become denatured, as their bonds break. Most enzymes become denatured at temperatures between 40\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C (104\u00b0F\u2013158\u00b0F), but enzymes in bacteria inhabiting hot springs can remain stable at temperatures up to 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F). The upper lethal temperature for most organisms is lower than the temperature at which their enzymes become denatured because metabolic coordination among biochemical pathways is lost at these temperatures. The extreme lower limit for enzyme activity is about \u20135\u00b0C (23\u00b0F) (Willmer et al. 2005). The internal temperatures of Antarctic fishes and crustaceans may reach \u20132\u00b0C (28\u00b0F) because the salt concentration of the seawater in which they live lowers its freezing point. Some soil microorganisms are active at temperatures as low as \u20135\u00b0C (23\u00b0F). Some species can produce different forms of enzymes (called isozymes) with different temperature optima as a means of acclimatization to changes in environmental temperature. For example, some fishes (e.g., trout, carp, goldfish) and trees (e.g., loblolly pine) can produce isozymes in response to seasonal changes in temperature. However, acclimatization to temperature changes using isozymes does not appear to be a common response in animals (Willmer et al. 2005). Temperature also determines the rates of physiological processes by influencing the properties of membranes, particularly at low temperatures. Cell and organelle membranes are composed of two layers of lipid molecules. At low temperatures, these layers can solidify; proteins and enzymes embedded in them can lose their function, affecting processes such as mitochondrial respiration and photosynthesis, and membranes can lose their function as filters, leaking cellular metabolites. Tropical plants may suffer loss of function associated with membrane disruption at temperatures as high as 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F), while alpine plants can function at temperatures close to freezing. The sensitivity of membrane function to low temperatures is related to the chemical composition of the membrane lipid molecules. Plants of cooler climates have a higher proportion of unsaturated membrane lipids (with greater numbers of double bonds between carbon molecules) than plants of warmer climates. Finally, temperature influences physiological processes in terrestrial organisms by affecting water availability. As we saw in Concept 2.2, the warmer the air, the more water vapor it can hold.", "As a result, the rate at which terrestrial organisms lose water from their bodies increases as temperature becomes warmer. We will return to this point later when we discuss how organisms cope with variations in water availability. Organisms influence their temperature by modifying energy balance On a hot day, jumping into a swimming pool and then sitting in the shade in a light breeze brings relief from the oppressive heat. Elephants follow a similar routine, wading into ponds and using their trunks to spray water onto their backs. This kind of behavior facilitates heat loss in several ways. First, the contact of warm skin with cool water causes heat energy to be lost from the body through the process of conduction: the direct transfer of energy from warmer, more rapidly moving molecules to cooler, more slowly moving molecules. Also, when cool water and air move across the surface of a warmer body, heat energy is carried away via convection. In addition, the change in the state of water from liquid to vapor as it evaporates on the skin\u2019s surface absorbs body heat (latent heat transfer). Finally, moving into the shade lowers the amount of energy you receive from solar radiation. The balance between energy input and energy output determines whether the temperature of any object will increase or decrease. Archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists, and algae cannot avoid changes in their temperature when the environmental temperature changes. They must tolerate variations in temperature through biochemical modifications. For example, when temperatures exceed their range of tolerance, microorganisms often survive as dormant spores. Plants and animals can also influence their body temperature, and therefore their physiological processes, by adjusting their exchange of energy with the environment. Both plants and animals are often able to avoid stressful internal temperatures through behavioral and morphological modifications of energy balance. Let\u2019s examine some examples. MODIFICATION OF ENERGY BALANCE BY PLANTS Among plants, temperature stress is experienced mainly in terrestrial environments. Marine and aquatic plants usually experience temperatures within the range that is conducive to their physiological functioning, although those in nearshore habitats can experience potentially lethal temperatures. The factors involved in the energy balance of terrestrial plants are shown in FIGURE 4.8. Energy inputs that warm the plant include sunlight and infrared radiation from surrounding objects. If the ground or air is warmer than the plant, energy inputs also include conduction and convection. Losses of energy from the plant include the emission of infrared radiation to the surrounding environment and, if the ground or air is cooler than the plant, conduction and convection. Heat loss also occurs through transpiration (evaporation of water from inside the plant) and surface evaporation, collectively referred to as evapotranspiration. FIGURE 4.8 Energy Exchange in Terrestrial Plants The temperature of a plant is determined by the balance between inputs of energy from and outputs of energy to the environment. (After P. S. Nobel. 1983. Biophysical Plant Physiology and Ecology. W. H. Freeman: New York.) We can put these inputs and outputs together to determine whether the temperature of the plant is changing: where \u0394Hplant is the heat energy change of the plant (the Greek delta usually signifies \u201cchange in\u201d), SR is solar radiation, IRin is the input of infrared radiation, IRout is the output of infrared radiation, Hconv is convective heat transfer, Hcond is conductive heat transfer, and Het is heat transfer through evapotranspiration. A negligible loss of energy occurs as the plant uses solar radiation for photosynthesis. If the plant is warmer than the surrounding air, Hconv and Hcond are negative. If the sum of the energy inputs exceeds the sum of the outputs, \u0394Hplant is positive, and the plant\u2019s temperature is increasing. Conversely, if more heat is being lost than gained, \u0394Hplant is negative, and the plant\u2019s temperature is decreasing. Plants can modify their energy balance to control their temperature by adjusting these energy inputs and outputs. Leaves are most often associated with these adjustments because they are the primary photosynthetic organs of the plant and typically are the most temperature-sensitive tissue. The most important and common adjustments include changes in the rate of transpirational water loss. In addition, changes in leaf surface reflective properties (color) or in leaf orientation toward the sun can alter the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the plant. Finally, changes in convective heat transfer can be accomplished by changing surface roughness. Transpiration is an important evaporative cooling mechanism for leaves.", "As we saw in Chapter 2, its effectiveness is especially evident in the canopies of tropical forests, which are subjected to warm air temperatures and high levels of solar radiation. Without transpirational cooling, the leaves of tropical canopy plants could reach temperatures over 45\u00b0C (>113\u00b0F), which would be lethal. The rate of transpiration is controlled by specialized guard cells surrounding pores, called stomates, leading to the interior of the leaf. Stomates are the gateway for both transpirational water loss and the uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis; we will return to the latter function in Concept 5.2. Variation in the degree of stomatal opening, as well as in the number of stomates, controls the rate of transpiration and therefore exerts an important control on leaf temperature (FIGURE 4.9). FIGURE 4.9 Stomates Control Leaf Temperature by Controlling Transpiration (A) Specialized guard cells control a stomate\u2019s degree of opening. Open stomates allow CO to diffuse in for photosynthesis, and they allow water to2 transpire out, cooling the leaves. (B) Leaf temperatures vary with the degree of stomatal opening. The plant on the right has open stomates and is transpiring freely, while the plant on the left, kept under identical conditions, has closed stomates, a lower transpiration rate, and a temperature 1\u20132\u00b0C (2\u20134\u00b0F) higher, as indicated by thermal infrared imaging. Cooling of leaves using transpiration may be particularly important in what biomes? Transpiration requires a steady supply of water. Where the amount of water in the soil is limited\u2014as it is over a substantial part of Earth\u2019s land surface\u2014transpiration is not a reliable cooling mechanism. As we saw in Concept 3.1, some plants shed their leaves during dry seasons, thereby avoiding both temperature and water stress. However, the high demand for the resources (e.g., soil nutrients) needed to replace fallen leaves may favor protecting existing leaves rather than shedding them. Plants that maintain their leaves during long dry periods require mechanisms other than transpiration to dissipate heat energy. One option is to alter the reflective properties of leaves via pubescence, the presence of light-colored or white hairs on the leaf surface, which lowers the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the leaf surface. Pubescence can also lower the effectiveness of convective heat loss, however, and thus represents a trade-off between two opposing heat exchange mechanisms. One of the best studies addressing the adaptive significance of leaf pubescence for temperature regulation has focused on shrubs of the genus Encelia (members of the daisy family, common name brittlebush). Jim Ehleringer and his colleagues described the role of pubescence in leaf temperature regulation among species of Encelia that occupy different geographic ranges. Encelia farinosa, a native of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts, maintains a high amount of leaf pubescence relative to Encelia shrubs from moister, cooler environments. Ehleringer and his colleague Craig Cook (1990) evaluated the relative roles of leaf pubescence and transpiration in the cooling of leaves of E. farinosa and two other species whose leaves lack pubescence: E. frutescens, which occurs in desert washes (which have more moisture than the rest of the desert), and E. californica, native to the cooler, moister coastal sage community of California and Baja California. To control for environmental variation that could influence the morphology and physiology of the plants, they grew plants of each species from seed together in experimental plots in the Sonoran Desert and on the California coast. Half of their experimental plants were watered while the other half were left under natural conditions. They measured the leaf temperatures, the degree of stomatal opening, and the amount of sunlight absorbed. The three Encelia species showed few differences in leaf temperature and stomatal opening when grown in the cooler, moister California coastal garden. In the desert garden, however, E. californica and E. frutescens shed their leaves during the hot summer months under natural conditions, but E. farinosa did not. Encelia frutescens did not shed its leaves when the shrubs were watered, and its leaves maintained sublethal temperatures using transpirational cooling. Encelia farinosa leaves reflected about twice as much solar radiation as those of the other two species (FIGURE 4.10A), which facilitated the shrub\u2019s ability to maintain leaf temperatures lower than the air temperature. FIGURE 4.10 Sunlight, Seasonal Changes, and Leaf Pubescence (A) Solar heating of leaves varies according to the amount of pubescence on those leaves.", "The pubescent leaves of the desert shrub Encelia farinosa absorb a lower percentage of the incoming solar radiation than the leaves of two nonpubescent species: E. californica, native to the coastal sage community of California, and E. frutescens, an inhabitant of moister desert wash communities. Encelia farinosa is therefore less dependent on transpiration for leaf cooling than the other two species. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (B) Encelia farinosa produces greater amounts of pubescence on its leaves in summer than in winter, representing acclimatization to hot summer temperatures. The photos are scanning electron micrographs of leaf cross sections. (A after J. R. Ehleringer and C. S. Cook. 1990. Oecologia 82: 484\u2013489.) Why might temperature regulation associated with greater reflection of solar radiation via pubescence be more important in deserts than in a warm, moist biome such as the tropical rainforest? Ehleringer and Cook\u2019s field experiment provides correlative evidence of the adaptive value of leaf pubescence to E. farinosa under hot desert conditions. Additional work by Darren Sandquist and Ehleringer has supported its adaptive value, indicating that natural selection has acted on variation in pubescence among ecotypes of E. farinosa. Populations in drier environments have more leaf pubescence, and reflect more solar radiation, than populations from moister environments (Sandquist and Ehleringer 2003). In addition to varying among species and populations, leaf pubescence can also vary seasonally, exemplifying acclimatization to environmental conditions. Encelia farinosa shrubs produce smaller, more pubescent leaves in summer and larger, less pubescent leaves in winter (FIGURE 4.10B). There are costs to being pubescent, associated with the construction of the hairs and the loss of solar radiation that could be used for photosynthesis. Thus, when temperatures are cooler or when reliable soil water is present, E. farinosa plants construct leaves with fewer hairs. Heat can be lost from a leaf by convection when the air temperature is lower than the temperature of the leaf. The effectiveness of convective heat loss is related to the speed of the air moving across a surface. As the moving air experiences more friction closer to the surface of an object, the flow becomes more turbulent, forming eddies (FIGURE 4.11). This zone of turbulent flow, called the boundary layer, lowers convective heat loss. The thickness of the boundary layer around a leaf is related to its size and its surface roughness. Small, smooth leaves have thin boundary layers and lose heat more effectively than large or rough leaves. This relationship between the boundary layer and convective heat loss is one reason for the rarity of large leaves in desert ecosystems. FIGURE 4.11 A Leaf Boundary Layer Air flowing close to the surface of a leaf is subject to friction, which causes the flow to become turbulent and lowers convective heat loss from the leaf to the surrounding air. Excessive heat loss by convection can be a problem for plants (and animals) in cold, windy environments such as the alpine zone in mountains. Convection is the largest source of heat loss from the land surface in temperate alpine environments, and high winds can shred leaves in exposed sites. Most alpine plants grow close to the ground surface to avoid the high wind velocities. Some alpine plants produce a layer of insulating hair on their surface to lower convective heat loss. The snow lotus of the Himalayas (Saussurea medusa) produces a series of very densely pubescent leaves that surround the flowers of the plant (FIGURE 4.12). Although they project above the ground surface and are exposed to more wind than ground-hugging plants, the flowers of S. medusa remain as much as 20\u00b0C (36\u00b0F) warmer than the air by absorbing and retaining solar radiation (Tsukaya et al. 2002). The plant not only keeps its photosynthetic tissues warm, but also provides a warm environment for potential pollinators, which are in short supply in cold, windy alpine environments. FIGURE 4.12 A Woolly Plant of the Himalayas The snow lotus (Saussurea medusa) has dense pubescence surrounding its emergent flowering stems, which provides them with thermal insulation. MODIFICATION OF ENERGY BALANCE BY ANIMALS Animals are subject to the same energy inputs and outputs described for plants in Equation 4.1, with one key difference: some animals\u2014in particular, birds and mammals\u2014have the ability to generate heat internally.", "As a result, another term is needed in the energy balance equation to represent this metabolic heat generation: (4.2) where \u0394Hanimal is the heat energy change of the animal, SR is solar radiation, IRin is the input of infrared radiation, IRout is the output of infrared radiation, Hconv is convective heat transfer, Hcond is conductive heat transfer, Hevap is heat transfer through evaporation, and Hmet is metabolic heat generation. In contrast to plants, evaporative heat loss is not widespread among animals. Notable examples of evaporative cooling in animals include sweating in humans, panting by dogs and other animals, and licking of the body by some marsupials under conditions of extreme heat. The internal generation of heat by some animals represents a major ecological advance. Animals capable of metabolic heat generation can maintain relatively constant internal temperatures near the optimum for physiological functioning under a wide range of external temperatures, and as a result, they can expand their geographic ranges. Varying degrees of reliance on internal heat generation exist throughout the animal kingdom. Animals that regulate their body temperature primarily through energy exchange with the external environment, which includes the majority of animal species, are called ectotherms. Animals that rely primarily on internal heat generation, which are called endotherms, include, but are not limited to, birds and mammals. Internal heat generation is also found in some fishes (e.g., tuna), insects (e.g., bees, which generate heat for metabolic function as well as for defense; FIGURE 4.13), and even a few plant species (e.g., skunk cabbage, Symplocarpus foetidus, which warms its flowers using metabolically generated heat during the spring). FIGURE 4.13 Internal Heat Generation as a Defense Bees can generate heat by contracting their flight muscles. Japanese honeybees (Apis cerana) use internal heat generation as a defense against Asian giant hornets (Vespa mandarinia) that attack bee colonies. (A) When a hornet enters a nest, the honeybees swarm the larger invader. (B) The defensive ball of bees surrounding an invading hornet generates enough heat that temperatures in the center exceed the upper lethal temperature for the hornet (about 47\u00b0C, 117\u00b0F), thus killing the invader. TEMPERATURE REGULATION AND TOLERANCE IN ECTOTHERMS Generally, ectotherms have a greater tolerance for variation in their body temperature than endotherms (see Figure 4.7), possibly because they are less able to adjust their body temperature than endotherms. The exchange of heat between an animal and the environment, whether for cooling or heating, depends on the amount of surface area relative to the volume of the animal. A larger surface area relative to volume allows greater heat exchange but makes it harder to maintain a constant internal temperature in the face of variable external temperatures. A smaller surface area relative to volume decreases the animal\u2019s ability to gain or lose heat. This relationship between surface area and volume imposes a constraint on the body size and shape of ectothermic animals. Generally speaking, the surface area\u2013to-volume ratio decreases as body size increases, and the animal\u2019s ability to exchange heat with the environment decreases as well. As a result, large ectothermic animals are considered improbable. Small aquatic ectotherms (e.g., most invertebrates and fishes) generally remain at the same temperature as the surrounding water. Some larger aquatic animals, however, can maintain a body temperature warmer than that of the surrounding water (FIGURE 4.14). For example, skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) use muscle activity, in conjunction with heat exchange between blood vessels, to maintain a body temperature as much as 14\u00b0C (25\u00b0F) warmer than the surrounding seawater. Other large oceanic fishes use similar circulatory heat exchange mechanisms to keep their muscles warm. Such mechanisms are particularly important for predatory species that depend on rapid acceleration to capture prey, which is aided by having warmer muscles. FIGURE 4.14 Internal Heat Generation by Tuna (A) Heat generated in the red swimming muscles of the skipjack tuna, used for cruising through the water, warms blood flowing through them, which is carried toward the body surface in veins. Those veins run parallel to arteries carrying cool oxygenated blood from the gills, warming that blood before it reaches the swimming muscles. (B) A cross section of the tuna shows that its core remains warmer than the surrounding water. The mobility of many terrestrial ectotherms allows them to adjust their body temperature by moving to places that are warmer or cooler than they are. Basking in the sun or moving into the shade allows these animals to adjust their energy gains and losses via solar radiation, conduction, and infrared radiation.", "For example, reptiles and insects emerging from hiding places after a cool night will bask in the sun to warm their bodies prior to initiating their daily activities (FIGURE 4.15). This basking behavior, however, increases their risk of being found by predators. Many of these animals rely on camouflage (also called crypsis) to escape detection while basking. In addition to moving between locations with different temperatures, reptiles may regulate their body temperatures by altering their coloration and changing their orientation to the sun. FIGURE 4.15 Mobile Animals Can Use Behavior to Adjust Body Temperature These marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) have moved into a sunny location to raise their body temperature to a range suitable for undertaking their daily activities. What components of energy exchange are affected by the behavior of these iguanas? Because they rely on the external environment for temperature regulation, the activities of ectothermic animals are limited to certain temperature ranges. When temperatures are warm, ectotherms in sunny environments (e.g., deserts) may gain enough energy from the environment to push their body temperatures to lethal levels. ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 4.1 describes how increases in temperature associated with climate change over the past two decades appear to have limited the daily foraging periods of several species of Mexican lizards, whose abundances have decreased significantly during this period (also see Concept 25.2). In temperate and polar regions, temperatures drop below freezing for extended periods. Ectotherms inhabiting these regions must either avoid or tolerate exposure to subfreezing temperatures. Avoidance may take the form of seasonal migration (e.g., moving to a lower latitude) or movement to local microhabitats where temperatures stay at or above freezing (e.g., burrowing into the soil). Tolerance of subfreezing temperatures involves minimizing the damage associated with ice formation in cells and tissues. If ice forms as crystals, it will puncture cell membranes and disrupt metabolic functioning. Some insects inhabiting cold climates contain high concentrations of glycerol, a chemical compound that minimizes the formation of ice crystals and lowers the freezing point of body fluids. These insects spend winter in a semi-frozen state, emerging in spring when temperatures are more conducive to physiological activity. Vertebrate ectotherms generally do not tolerate freezing to the degree that invertebrate ectotherms do, because of their larger size and greater physiological complexity. A very few amphibians, however, can survive being partially frozen, as described in the Case Study at the opening of this chapter. TEMPERATURE REGULATION AND TOLERANCE IN ENDOTHERMS Endotherms tolerate a narrower range of body temperatures (30\u00b0C\u201345\u00b0C, 86\u00b0F\u2013113\u00b0F) than ectotherms. However, the ability of endotherms to generate heat internally has allowed them to greatly expand their geographic ranges and the times of year they can be active. Endotherms can remain active at subfreezing environmental temperatures, something that most ectotherms cannot do. The cost of being endothermic is a high demand for food to supply energy to support metabolic heat production. The rate of metabolic activity in endotherms is associated with the external temperature and the rate of heat loss. The rate of heat loss, in turn, is related to body size because of its influence on surface area\u2013to-volume ratio. Small endotherms have higher metabolic rates, require more energy, and have higher feeding rates than large endotherms. Endothermic animals maintain a constant basal (resting) metabolic rate over a range of environmental temperatures known as the thermoneutral zone. Within the thermoneutral zone, minor behavioral or morphological adjustments are sufficient for maintaining an optimal body temperature. When the environmental temperature drops to a point at which heat loss is greater than metabolic heat production, the body temperature begins to drop, triggering an increase in metabolic heat generation. This point is called the lower critical temperature (FIGURE 4.16A). The thermoneutral zone and the lower critical temperature differ among mammal species (FIGURE 4.16B). As one would expect, mammals from the Arctic have lower critical temperatures below those of animals from tropical regions. Note also that the rate of metabolic activity (slope of the line) increases more rapidly below the lower critical temperature in tropical than in Arctic mammals. FIGURE 4.16 Metabolic Rates in Endotherms Vary with Environmental Temperatures (A) An endotherm\u2019s resting, or basal, metabolic rate stays constant throughout a range of environmental temperatures known as the thermoneutral zone. When environmental temperatures reach a lower limit, known as the lower critical temperature, the endotherm\u2019s metabolic rate increases to generate additional heat. (B) The thermoneutral zones and lower critical temperatures of endotherms vary with their habitats.", "The lower critical temperatures of Arctic endotherms are lower than those of tropical endotherms, and their metabolic rates increase more slowly below those lower critical temperatures, as shown by the shallower slopes of the curves. (B after P. F. Scholander et al. 1950. Biol Bull 99: 237\u2013258.) What causes these differences in metabolic adjustments between endotherms of different biomes? For endothermy to work efficiently, animals must be able to retain their metabolically generated heat. Thus, the evolution of endothermy in birds and mammals required insulation: feathers, fur, or fat. These insulating layers provide a barrier limiting conductive (and, in some cases, convective) heat loss. Fur and feathers insulate primarily by providing a layer of still air, similar to a boundary layer, adjacent to the skin. Differences in insulation help explain the differences among the endotherms in Figure 4.16B. Arctic mammals generally maintain thick fur. In warmer climates, however, the ability to cool off through conduction and convection is inhibited by insulation, and thick fur can be an impediment to maintaining an optimal body temperature. Some endotherms acclimatize to seasonal temperature changes by growing thicker fur in winter and shedding fur when temperatures get warmer (a fact that most pet owners know well) (ANALYZING DATA 4.1). Our human ancestors evolved in the hot tropical regions of Africa and lost much of their hairy insulating layer about 2 million years ago (Jablonski 2006). Cold climates are tough on small endotherms. Small mammals, by necessity, have thin fur, since thick fur would inhibit their mobility. The high demand for metabolic energy below the lower critical temperature, the low insulation values of their fur, and their low capacity to store energy make small mammals improbable residents of polar, alpine, and temperate habitats. However, the faunas of many of these cold climates contain many small endotherms, sometimes in high abundances. What explains this apparent discrepancy? Small endotherms, such as rodents and hummingbirds, are able to alter their lower critical temperature during cold periods by entering a state of dormancy known as torpor. The body temperatures of animals in torpor may drop as much as 20\u00b0C (36\u00b0F) below their normal temperatures. The metabolic rate of an animal in torpor is 50%\u201390% lower than its basal metabolic rate, providing substantial energy savings (Schmidt-Nielsen 1997). However, energy is still needed to arouse the animal from torpor and bring its body temperature back up to its usual set point. Thus, the length of time an animal can remain in torpor is limited by its reserves of energy. Small endotherms may undergo daily torpor to minimize the energy needed during cold nights. Torpor lasting several weeks during the winter, sometimes referred to as hibernation, is possible only for animals that have access to enough food and can store enough energy reserves, such as marmots (FIGURE 4.17). Hibernation is somewhat rare in polar climates because few animals have access to enough food to provide enough stored energy (in the form of fat) to get through winter without eating. Some large animals, such as bears, enter a long-term winter sleep (sometimes called denning) during which the body temperature decreases only slightly, rather than going into torpor. FIGURE 4.17 Long-Term Torpor in Marmots Torpor allows yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to conserve energy during winter, when food is scarce and the demand for metabolic energy to keep warm is high. Regular cycles of arousal and return to torpor occur for unknown reasons. (After K. Armitage et al. 2003. Comp Biochem Phys 134A: 101\u2013114.) ANALYZING DATA 4.1 Some endotherms exhibit seasonal changes in fur thickness, which helps to enhance heat loss during summer and retain heat generated by the body during winter. This seasonal change in fur thickness in individual animals is an example of acclimatization to changes in temperature. The graph* shows the insulation value (how well heat is retained) versus fur thickness for two animals of the boreal forest biome, a red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and a wolf (Canis lupus). Both animals are endotherms that exhibit acclimatization to seasonal temperature changes by changes in fur thickness. 1. Each animal is represented by a color (blue or red). Which color do you think belongs to which animal, and why? 2. Which season (summer or winter) is represented by the circles, and which by the triangles? Which animal experiences greater seasonal acclimatory changes in fur length? In what additional way might the animal with the smaller change in fur length cope with extreme winter cold? See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise.", "*Willmer, P. et al. 2005. Environmental Physiology of Animals, 2nd ed. Blackwell Publishing: Malden, MA. Just as organisms must balance energy input and output to maintain an optimal temperature, they must balance the movement of water into and out of their bodies to maintain optimal conditions for physiological functioning. Self-Assessment 4.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 4.3 The water balance of an organism is determined by exchanges of water and solutes with the external environment. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 4.3.1 List the three factors that influence the movement of water from a high-energy state to a low-energy state (i.e., with reference to water potential gradients) in biological systems. 4.3.2 Explain how organisms can control water gains and losses by adjusting resistance to water movement, and describe how high resistance may involve trade-offs with other functions. 4.3.3 Describe how salt and water balances can become challenges for organisms exposed to hyperosmotic and hypoosmotic environments. Variation in Water Availability Water is essential for life. Water is the medium in which all biochemical reactions necessary for physiological functioning occur. Water has unique properties that make it a universal solvent for biologically important solutes (compounds that are dissolved in water, including salts). The range of organismal water content conducive to physiological functioning is relatively narrow, between 60% and 90% of body mass. Maintaining water content within this range is a challenge primarily to organisms of freshwater and terrestrial environments. Marine organisms seldom gain or lose too much water because they exist in a medium that is conducive to maintaining water balance: the oceans in which life first evolved. In addition to maintaining a suitable water balance, organisms must also balance the uptake and loss of solutes, primarily salts. Salt balance is closely tied to water balance because the movements of water and salts influence each other. Aquatic environments may be more saline than an organism\u2019s cells or blood (hyperosmotic; hyper, \u201cgreater\u201d), of similar salinity (isoosmotic; iso, \u201csame\u201d), or less saline (hypoosmotic; hypo, \u201cless\u201d). Most marine invertebrates rarely face problems with water and solute balance because they tend to be isoosmotic. Terrestrial organisms face the problem of losing water to a dry atmosphere, while freshwater organisms may lose solutes to, and gain water from, their environment. The evolution of freshwater and terrestrial organisms is very much a story of dealing with the need to maintain water balance. In this section, we will review some basic principles related to water and solute balance and provide some examples of how freshwater and terrestrial organisms maintain a water balance that is conducive to physiological functioning. Water flows along energy gradients Water flows along energy gradients, from high-energy to low-energy conditions. What is an energy gradient in the context of water? Gravity represents one example that is intuitively obvious: liquid water flows downhill, following a gradient of potential energy. Another type of energy influencing water movement is pressure. When elephants spray water out of their trunks, the water is flowing from a condition of higher energy inside the trunk (where muscles exert pressure on it) to a condition of lower energy outside of the trunk (where muscle pressure is not present). Other, less obvious factors that influence the flow of water are important to organismal water balance. When solutes are dissolved in water, the solution loses energy. Thus, if the water in a cell contains more solutes than the water surrounding it, water will flow into the cell to equilibrate the energy difference. Alternatively, solutes may flow into the surrounding medium, but most biological membranes selectively block the flow of many solutes. In biological systems, the energy associated with dissolved solutes is called osmotic potential. The energy associated with gravity is called gravitational potential, but in a biological context it is important in water movement only in very tall trees. The energy associated with the exertion of pressure is called pressure (or turgor) potential. Finally, the energy associated with attractive forces on the surfaces of large molecules inside cells or on the surfaces of soil particles is called matric potential. The sum of these energy components within an aqueous system determines its overall water energy status, or water potential.", "The water potential of a system can be defined mathematically as (4.3) where \u03a8 is the total water potential of the system (in units of pressure; usually megapascals, MPa), \u03a8 o is the osmotic potential (a negative value because it lowers the energy status of the water), \u03a8p is the pressure potential (a positive value if pressure is exerted on the system; a negative value if the system is under tension), and \u03a8 is the matric potential (a negative value). Water will always move from a system of higher m \u03a8 to a system of lower \u03a8, following the energy gradient. This terminology is most often used in plant, microbial, and soil systems, but it works in animal systems as well. The atmosphere has a water potential that is related to humidity. From a biological perspective, air with a relative humidity of less than 98% of saturation has a very low water potential, so the gradient in water potential between most terrestrial organisms and the atmosphere is very high. Without some barrier to water movement, terrestrial organisms would lose water rapidly to the atmosphere. Any force that impedes the movement of water (or other substances, such as carbon dioxide) along an energy gradient is called resistance.2 Barriers that increase organisms\u2019 resistance to water loss include the waxy cuticle of plants and insects and the skin of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Water losses and solute gains and losses must be compensated Terrestrial plants and soil microorganisms rely on water uptake from soils to replace the water they lose to the atmosphere. Soils are important reservoirs of water that support a multitude of ecological functions. The amount of water that soils can store is related to the balance between water inputs and outputs, soil texture, and topography (FIGURE 4.18). Water inputs include precipitation that infiltrates into the soil and overland flow of water. Water losses include percolation to deeper layers below the plant rooting zone and evapotranspiration. FIGURE 4.18 What Determines the Water Content of Soil? The water content of soil is determined by the balance between water inputs (infiltration of precipitation and overland flow of water) and outputs (percolation to deeper layers, evapotranspiration) and by the capacity of the soil to hold water. Soil water storage capacity and the rate of percolation are dependent on soil texture. (After P. J. Kramer. 1983. Water Relations of Plants. Academic Press: Cambridge, MA.) The water storage capacity of most soils is dominated by their pore space and matric potential, which is related to the attractive forces on the surfaces of the soil particles. Sandy soils store less water than fine-textured soils, but fine soil particles also have a higher matric potential and thus hold on to water more tightly. Soils with mixed coarse and fine particles are generally most effective in storing water and supplying it to plants and soil organisms. When the volume of water in the soil drops below a certain point (25% of total soil mass in fine-textured soils, 5% in sandy soils), the matric forces are strong enough that most of the remaining water is unavailable to organisms. The osmotic potential of some soils also can be important, particularly where dissolved salts are found, as in soils near marine environments or where salinization (see Figure 2.25) has occurred. WATER BALANCE IN MICROORGANISMS Single-celled microorganisms, which include archaea, bacteria, algae, and protists, are active primarily in aqueous environments. Their water balance is dependent on the water potential of the surrounding environment, which is determined mainly by its osmotic potential. In most marine and freshwater ecosystems, the osmotic potential of the environment changes little over time. Some environments, however, such as estuaries, tide pools, saline lakes, and soils, experience frequent changes in osmotic potential due to evaporation or variable influxes of fresh and salt water. Microorganisms in these environments must respond to these changes by altering their cellular osmotic potential if they are to maintain a water balance suitable for physiological functioning. They accomplish this through osmotic adjustment, an acclimatization response that involves changing their solute concentration, and thus their osmotic potential. Some microorganisms synthesize organic solutes to adjust their osmotic potential, which also help to stabilize enzymes. Others use inorganic salts from the surrounding medium for osmotic adjustment. The ability to adjust osmotic potential in response to changes in external water potential varies substantially among microorganisms: some completely lack this ability, while others (such as Halobacterium spp.) can adjust to even the extremely saline conditions in landlocked saline lakes.", "As noted above, terrestrial environments are too dry for any organism that is unable to restrict cellular water loss to the atmosphere. Many microorganisms avoid exposure to dry conditions by forming dormant resistant spores, encasing themselves in a protective coating that prevents water loss to the environment. Some microorganisms with filamentous forms, such as fungi and yeasts, are very tolerant of low water potentials and can grow in dry environments. Most terrestrial microorganisms, however, are found in soils, which have a higher water content and humidity than the air above them. WATER BALANCE IN PLANTS One of the distinguishing characteristics of plants is a rigid cell wall composed of cellulose. Bacteria and fungi also have cell walls, composed of materials such as chitin (in fungi) or peptidoglycans and lipopolysaccharides (in bacteria). Cell walls are important to water balance because they facilitate the development of positive turgor pressure. When water follows a gradient of water potential into a plant cell, it causes the cell to expand and press against the cell wall, which resists the pressure because of its rigidity (FIGURE 4.19). Turgor pressure is an important structural component of plants, and it is also an important force for growth, promoting cell division. When nonwoody plants lose turgor pressure due to dehydration, they wilt. Wilting is generally a sign that a plant is experiencing water stress. FIGURE 4.19 Turgor Pressure in Plant Cells When a plant cell is surrounded by water with a solute concentration lower than its own, water moves into the cell, while solutes in the cell are prevented from moving out by the cell membrane. The increasing amount of water in the cell causes the cell to expand, pressing against the cell wall. Plants take up water from sources with a water potential higher than their own. For aquatic plants, the source is the surrounding aqueous medium. In freshwater environments, the presence of solutes in the plant\u2019s cells creates a water potential gradient from the surrounding water to the plant. In marine environments, plants must lower their water potential below that of seawater to take up water. Marine plants, as well as terrestrial plants of salt marshes and saline soils, adjust their osmotic potential in a manner similar to that of microorganisms by synthesizing solutes and taking up inorganic salts from their environment. Inorganic salts +\u2013 must be taken up selectively, however, because some (e.g., Na , Cl ) can be toxic at high concentrations. The cell membranes of plants act as a solute filter, determining the amounts and types of solutes that move into and out of the plant. Terrestrial plants acquire water from the soil through their roots, as well as through associations with mutualistic fungi that grow into their roots from the soil, called mycorrhizae (see Concept 15.1). The earliest land plants, which had not yet evolved roots, used mycorrhizal fungi to take up water and nutrients from the soil. The majority of modern terrestrial plant species use a combination of roots and mycorrhizae to take up water. Only the finest roots can take up water from the soil, because older, thicker roots develop a water-resistant waxy coating that limits their ability to absorb water as well as to lose water to the soil. Mycorrhizae provide a greater surface area for absorption of water and nutrients for the plant and allow greater exploration of the soil for these resources. In turn, the mycorrhizal fungi obtain energy from the plant. Plants lose water by transpiration when their stomates open to allow CO2 from the atmosphere to diffuse into their leaves. Water moves out through the stomates, following the water potential gradient from the inside of the leaf (100% relative humidity) to the air. As we saw in the previous section, transpiration is an important cooling mechanism for leaves. The plant must replace the water lost by transpiration, however, if it is to avoid water stress. As a leaf loses water, the water potential of its cells decreases, creating a water potential gradient between the leaf and the xylem in the stem to which it is attached, so water moves through the xylem into the leaf. In this way, when the plant is transpiring, it creates a gradient of decreasing water potential from the soil through the roots and stems to the leaves (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 4.20). Water therefore flows from the soil, which has the highest water potential, into the roots, the xylem, and eventually the leaves, from which it is lost to the atmosphere via transpiration.", "Because there is greater resistance to the movement of water into the roots and through the xylem than out through the stomates, the water supply from the soil cannot keep up with water loss by transpiration. As a result, the water content of the plant decreases during the day. At night the stomates close, and the water supply from the soil rehydrates the plant until it reaches near equilibrium with the soil water potential. This daily cycle of daytime dehydration and nighttime rehydration can go on indefinitely if the supply of water in the soil is adequate. The availability of water decreases when precipitation is not sufficient to replace the water lost from the soil through transpiration and evaporation. The water content of a plant will then decrease, and its turgor pressure will decrease as its cells become dehydrated (FIGURE 4.21). To avoid reaching a detrimentally or even lethally low water content, the plant must restrict its transpirational water loss. If leaf cells become so dehydrated that turgor is lost, the stomates close. This level of water stress can harm the plant, causing impairment of physiological functions such as photosynthesis. Extremely dry conditions can cause loss of xylem function (see WEB EXTENSION 4.1). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 4.20 The Daily Cycle of Dehydration and Rehydration During the day, when the stomates are open, transpiration results in a gradient of water potential from leaf to stem, stem to roots, and roots to soil. At night, when the stomates are closed, water potential equilibrates as the plant rehydrates. FIGURE 4.21 How Plants Cope with Depletion of Soil Water If soil water is not recharged, transpiration will deplete it, leading to progressive drying of the soil and a decrease in soil water potential. (Top, after A. H. Fitter and R. K. Hay. 1987. Environmental Physiology of Plants. Academic Press: London; bottom, after R. D. Slatyer. 1967. Plant-Water Relationships. Academic Press: Cambridge, MA.) As the soil dries, stomates may close at midday and reopen later in the afternoon, as seen on day 4 in the graph. Assuming the air temperature is cooler later in the day, what influence would this have on plant water loss? Some plants of seasonally dry environments shed their leaves during long dry periods to eliminate transpirational water loss. Others have a signaling system that helps prevent the onset of water stress. As the soil dries out, the roots send a hormonal signal (abscisic acid) to the guard cells, which close the stomates, lowering the rate of water loss. Plants of dry environments, such as deserts, grasslands, and Mediterranean-type ecosystems, generally have better control of stomatal opening than plants of wetter climates. Plants of dry environments also have a thick waxy coating (cuticle) on their leaves to prevent water loss through the nonporous regions of the leaves. Additionally, plants of dry environments maintain a higher ratio of root biomass to biomass of stems and leaves than plants of moister environments, enhancing the rate of water supply to transpiring tissues (Mokany et al. 2006) (FIGURE 4.22). Some plants are capable of acclimatization by altering the growth of their roots to match the availability of soil moisture and nutrients. FIGURE 4.22 Allocation of Growth to Roots versus Shoots Is Associated with Precipitation Levels The ratio of root biomass to leaf and stem (shoot) biomass increases with decreasing precipitation in shrubland and grassland biomes. Allocation of more biomass to roots in dry soils provides more water uptake capacity to support leaf function. (After K. Mokany et al. 2006. Global Change Biol 12: 84\u201396.) Can plants have too much water? Technically, no, but saturation inhibits the diffusion of oxygen and can cause hypoxia in plant roots. Thus, waterlogged soils inhibit aerobic respiration in roots. Wet soils also enhance the growth of harmful fungal species that can damage roots. Ironically, the combination of these factors can lead to root death, which cuts off the supply of water to plants, and eventually to wilting. Adaptations to low oxygen concentrations in wet soils include root tissue containing air channels (called aerenchyma) as well as specialized roots that extend vertically above the water or waterlogged soil (as in mangroves; see Figure 3.19). WATER BALANCE IN ANIMALS Multicellular animals face the same challenges plants and microorganisms do in maintaining water balance. Water losses and gains in animals, however, are governed by a more diverse set of exchanges than in plants and microorganisms (FIGURE 4.23).", "Many animals have the added complexity of specialized organs for gas exchange, ingestion and digestion, excretion, and circulation, all of which create areas of localized water and solute exchange as well as gradients of water and solutes within the animal\u2019s body. Most animals are mobile and can seek out environments conducive to maintaining a favorable water and solute balance, an option not available to plants or to most microorganisms. FIGURE 4.23 Gains and Losses of Water and Solutes in Aquatic and Terrestrial Animals Exemplified by Different Life Stages of a Dragonfly (After P. Willmer et al. 2005. Environmental Physiology of Animals, 2nd ed. Blackwell Publishing: Malden, MA; E. B. Edney. 1980. In Insect Biology in the Future, M. Locke [Ed.], pp. 39\u201358. Academic Press: Cambridge, MA.) Many animals must be able to maintain favorable water and solute balances under conditions of varying salinity. A marine animal that lacks this ability will die if transferred to brackish or fresh water. Although most marine invertebrates are isoosmotic to seawater, the specific types of solutes in their bodies can vary. Many invertebrates that are capable of adjusting to changes in the solute concentration of their environment do so by exchanging solutes with the surrounding seawater. Like plants, these animals must selectively control this exchange of specific solutes because some external solutes are toxic at the concentrations at which they are found in seawater, and because some internal solutes are needed for biochemical reactions. +\u2013 Jellyfishes, squids, and crabs, for example, have sodium (Na ) and chloride (Cl ) concentrations similar to those of seawater, but their sulfate (SO 2\u2013) concentrations may be one-half to one-fourth of those found in 4 seawater. Marine vertebrates include animals that are isoosmotic and hypoosmotic to seawater. The cartilaginous fishes, including the sharks and rays, have blood solute concentrations similar to those of seawater, although, as in invertebrates, their concentrations of specific solutes differ from those in seawater. In contrast, marine teleost (bony) fishes and mammals evolved in fresh water and later moved into marine environments. Their blood is hypoosmotic to seawater. Fish exchange water and salts with their environment through drinking and eating, and across the gills, which are also the organs of O2 and CO2 exchange (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 4.24A). Salts that diffuse into or are ingested by marine teleost fishes must be continuously excreted in urine and through the gills against an osmotic gradient, which requires an expenditure of energy. Water lost across the gills must be replaced by drinking. Marine mammals, such as whales and porpoises, produce urine that is hyperosmotic to seawater and avoid drinking seawater to minimize salt uptake. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 4.24 Water and Salt Balance in Marine and Freshwater Teleost Fishes Marine and freshwater teleost fishes face opposite challenges in maintaining water and solute balance. (A) Marine teleosts are hypoosmotic to their environment: they tend to lose water and gain solutes. (B) Freshwater teleosts are hyperosmotic to their environment: they tend to gain water and lose solutes. (After K. Schmidt-Nielsen. 1979. Animal Physiology: Adaptation and Environment. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.) Freshwater animals are hyperosmotic to their environment; therefore, they tend to gain water and lose salts. Most salt exchange occurs at the gas exchange surfaces, including the skin of some invertebrates (e.g., freshwater worms) and the gills of many vertebrates and invertebrates. These animals must compensate for salt losses by taking up solutes in their food, and some groups, such as teleost fishes, must take up solutes actively through the gills against an osmotic gradient (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 4.24B). Excess water is excreted as dilute urine, from which the excretory system actively removes solutes to minimize their loss. Terrestrial animals face the challenge of exchanging gases (O2 and CO2) in a dry environment with a very low water potential. These animals lower their evaporative water loss and exposure to water stress by having skin with a high resistance to water loss or by living in environments where they can compensate for high water losses with high water intake. Both approaches involve risks and trade-offs, however. A high resistance to water loss may compromise the animal\u2019s ability to exchange gases with the atmosphere. Reliance on a steady water supply puts the animal at risk if the source of water fails (e.g., during a severe drought). Tolerance for water loss varies substantially among groups of terrestrial animals. Generally, invertebrates have a higher tolerance for water loss than vertebrates.", "Within the vertebrates, amphibians have a higher tolerance for, but lower resistance to, water loss than mammals and birds (TABLE 4.1). TABLE 4.1 Ranges of Tolerances for Water Loss in Selected Animal Groups Group Invertebrates Weight loss (%) Mollusks 35\u201380 Crabs 15\u201318 Insects 25\u201375 Vertebrates Frogs 28\u201348 Small birds 4\u20138 Rodents 12\u201315 Human 10\u201312 Camel 30 Source: P. Willmer et al. 2005. Environmental Physiology of Animals, 2nd ed. Blackwell Publishing: Malden, MA. Note: Values are maximum percentages of body weight lost as water that can be tolerated, based on observations of a range of exemplary species in each group. Amphibians, including frogs, toads, and salamanders, rely primarily on stable water supplies to maintain their water balance. They can be found in a wide variety of biomes, from tropical rainforests to deserts, as long as there is a reliable source of water, such as regular rains or ponds. Amphibians depend on gas exchange through the skin to a greater degree than other terrestrial vertebrates. Therefore, amphibian skin is often thin, with a low resistance to water loss (FIGURE 4.25). However, some adult amphibian species have adapted to dry environments by developing specialized skin with higher resistance to water loss. For example, the southern foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina), which occurs throughout Africa, has skin that resists water loss in a manner similar to that of lizards. To compensate for reduced gas exchange through the skin, it has a higher breathing rate (Stinner and Shoemaker 1987). As a group, tree frogs have higher skin resistance to water loss than ground frogs, reflecting their drier habitat. Some ground frogs of seasonally dry environments, such as the northern snapping frog (Cyclorana australis) of Australia, lower their rates of water loss by forming a \u201ccocoon\u201d of mucous secretions consisting of proteins and fats that increases resistance to water loss. FIGURE 4.25 Resistance to Water Loss Varies among Frogs and Toads Amphibians were kept under uniform dry environmental conditions (25\u00b0C, 20%\u201330% relative humidity) to examine their rates of water loss, measured as loss of body weight. A lizard (Chamaeleo) was also tested for comparative purposes. (After K. Schmidt-Nielsen. 1979. Animal Physiology: Adaptation and Environment. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge; based on J. P. Loveridge. 1970. Arnoldia [Rhodesia] 5: 1\u20136. National Museum of Southern Rhodesia.) How could you estimate the resistances of these species to water loss quantitatively using this graph? Reptiles have been extremely successful at inhabiting dry environments. The thick skin of desert snakes and lizards provides protection for the internal organs as well as an effective barrier to water loss. The outer skin, made up of multiple layers of dead cells with a fatty coating, is overlain by plates or scales. These layers give reptilian skin a very high resistance to water loss. Mammals and birds have skin anatomy similar to that of reptiles but have hair or feathers covering the skin rather than scales. The presence of sweat glands in mammals represents a trade-off between resistance to water loss and evaporative cooling. The highest resistances to water loss among terrestrial animals are found in the arthropods (e.g., insects and spiders), which are characterized by an outer exoskeleton made of hard chitin and coated with waxy hydrocarbons that prevents water movement (TABLE 4.2).

Willmer et al. 2005. Environmental Physiology of Animals, 2nd ed. Blackwell Publishing: Malden, MA. An instructive example of how animals use a variety of integrated adaptations to cope with arid environments involves kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.), found throughout the deserts of North America. A combination of efficient water use and low rates of water loss greatly diminishes these rodents\u2019 water requirements (Schmidt-Nielsen and Schmidt-Nielsen 1951) (FIGURE 4.26). Kangaroo rats rarely drink water. A large proportion of their water requirement is met by eating dry seeds and by oxidative metabolism \u2014that is, by metabolically converting carbohydrates and fats into water and carbon dioxide (Schmidt-Nielsen 1964). The animals also consume water-rich foods, such as insects or succulent vegetation, if they are available. FIGURE 4.26 Water Balance in the Kangaroo Rat Under dry laboratory conditions (25\u00b0C, 25% relative humidity), kangaroo rats, native to deserts of western North America, do not require liquid water to survive. (After K. Schmidt-Nelson. 1997. Desert Animals. Clarendon Press: Oxford.) Kangaroo rats minimize water loss through several physiological and behavioral adaptations.", "During the hottest periods of the year, they are active only at night, when air temperatures are lowest and humidities highest. During the day, they stay in their underground burrows, which are cooler and more humid than the desert surface. In some parts of their range, however, temperatures even in their burrows can rise high enough to expose kangaroo rats to significant evaporative water loss (Tracy and Walsberg 2002). To increase their resistance to this loss, kangaroo rats have thicker, oilier skin, with fewer sweat glands, than related rodents of moister environments. They minimize water losses in their urine and feces through effective removal of water by their kidneys and intestines. Kangaroo rats produce some of the most concentrated urine of any animal. The combination of these characteristics allows kangaroo rats to inhabit very arid environments without exposure to water stress, even without access to drinking water. Self-Assessment 4.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Frozen Frogs The existence of amphibians above the Arctic Circle seems improbable, given their reliance on a steady supply of liquid water to maintain their water balance and the high potential for damage associated with freezing. Several problems must be overcome in order for complex organisms to survive freezing. First, when water freezes, it forms needle-like crystals that can penetrate and damage or destroy cell membranes and organelles. Second, the supply of oxygen to tissues is severely restricted by the lack of circulation and breathing. Finally, as ice forms, pure water is pulled from cells, resulting in shrinkage and an increase in solute concentration. Any one of these factors, or all of them working in combination, will kill tissues and organisms in subfreezing temperatures. Yet the frogs described in the Case Study, as well as many species of invertebrates, can tolerate the freezing of a substantial amount of their body water. Wood frogs and other freeze-tolerant amphibians spend winter in shallow depressions under leaves, moss, or logs, which do not protect them from subfreezing temperatures. Several adaptations facilitate the survival of these amphibians through the winter and allow them to emerge from their frozen state in spring unharmed. Freezing of water in these animals is limited to the spaces outside the cells. A substantial proportion of their body water, from 35% to 65% in \u201cfully frozen\u201d frogs, freezes (Pinder et al. 1992). If more than 65% of their body water is frozen, most individuals will die because of excessive cell shrinkage. The formation of ice outside the cells is enhanced by the existence of ice-nucleating proteins that serve as the site of slow, controlled ice formation (Storey 1990). Solute concentrations in the unfrozen cells increase as the cells lose water to extracellular ice formation. In addition, freeze-tolerant amphibians synthesize additional solutes, including glucose and glycerol derived from the breakdown of liver glycogen. The resulting increase in solute concentrations lowers the freezing point inside the cells, allowing the intracellular solution to remain liquid at subfreezing temperatures. The concentrated solutes also stabilize the cell volume and the structures of organelles, proteins, and enzymes. As freezing proceeds, the frog\u2019s heart stops, and its lungs cease to pump air. Once it reaches this semi-stable state of partial freezing, the frog can remain frozen for several weeks, as long as the temperature does not drop below about \u20135\u00b0C (23\u00b0F). Although their winter \u201cquarters\u201d are not far below the surface of the ground, the insulating cover of leaves and snow keeps the frogs above that temperature. The freezing process is initiated in wood frogs within minutes of ice formation within the animal, although the full process occurs over several days to weeks (Layne and Lee 1995). Thawing, on the other hand, may be rapid, with normal body functioning returning within 10 hours. This amazing amphibian feat of spending winter in a semi-frozen state and emerging unharmed in spring has provided information to medical science that has facilitated the preservation of human tissues and organs at low temperatures (Costanzo et al. 1995), as well as optimism to proponents of whole-body cryonics, who hope that someday Grandpa can finally leave the Tuff Shed. CONNECTIONS in NATURE DESICCATION TOLERANCE, BODY SIZE, AND RARITY As we saw in Chapter 3, there is a close association between organisms\u2019 adaptations to climate conditions and their distribution among terrestrial biomes.", "While subfreezing temperatures are an important constraint on the distribution and functioning of organisms in high-latitude and high-elevation biomes, low water availability is a more widespread challenge. Arid conditions can occur in most terrestrial biomes (see the climate diagrams in Concept 3.1), and they regularly occur over more than 60% of the land surface. As we have seen, the majority of terrestrial organisms, particularly animals, avoid exposure to dry conditions and rely on minimizing water losses to the environment. Some organisms, however, can tolerate arid conditions in much the same way that frozen frogs tolerate subfreezing winter conditions: by entering a dormant state while allowing themselves to dry out. This adaptive approach is common in microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and protists, but is also found in some multicellular animals and some plants, including mosses, liverworts, and a few flowering plants (Alpert 2006). Desiccation-tolerant organisms can survive extreme dehydration, losing 80%\u201390% of their water as they equilibrate with the humidity of the air, then regain metabolic function shortly after they are rehydrated (FIGURE 4.27). As its cells dry out, the organism synthesizes sugars, which are the key to protecting its cell and organelle structures (Alpert 2006). Once dehydration proceeds beyond a certain threshold, metabolism ceases, and the sugars and the small amount of remaining water form a glassy coating over the cellular constituents. As with recovery from freezing, recovery from dehydration is rapid, occurring in hours to days. FIGURE 4.27 Desiccation-Tolerant Organisms (A) The leaves of the club moss Selaginella lepidophylla reach a very low moisture content during prolonged periods without rain (left); within 6 hours of receiving water, the leaves are functional and carrying out photosynthesis (right). (B) Water bears (tardigrades) are small invertebrates (less than 1 mm in length) found in aqueous environments, including oceans, lakes and ponds, soil water, and the water films on vegetation. Water bears contract and cease metabolism when they and their environment dry up (left) but rehydrate when moisture returns (right). The prevalence of dry conditions in terrestrial environments suggests that desiccation tolerance should be more common than it is. Why hasn\u2019t such tolerance evolved in more plants and animals? A clue to this puzzle may be the small size of the organisms that are desiccation tolerant (Alpert 2006). Small organisms (less than 5 mm in animals) do not require structural reinforcements, such as a skeletal system, that would restrict the necessary shrinking of the organism as it dehydrates. In addition, water loss during dehydration must be slow enough to allow sugar synthesis to occur, but not so slow that the organism spends a long time with a low water content while metabolism is still occurring, which can cause physiological stress. Small organisms have surface area\u2013to-volume ratios and thicknesses favorable for the water loss rates required. These arguments explain why desiccation tolerance is more common in small organisms, but not why they are rare (see Chapter 23). The two characteristics\u2014small size and rarity\u2014are intimately linked. As we will see in Chapter 14, small size is often associated with slow growth rates and poor competitive ability under conditions of low resource availability. Thus, natural selection for desiccation tolerance may involve trade-offs with other ecological characteristics, such as competitive ability, that might prevent these organisms from being successful in competitive environments. Coping with Environmental Variation: Energy KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 5.1 Organisms obtain energy from sunlight, from inorganic chemical compounds, or through the consumption of organic compounds. CONCEPT 5.2 Radiant and chemical energy captured by autotrophs is converted into stored energy in carbon\u2013 carbon bonds. CONCEPT 5.3 Environmental constraints have resulted in the evolution of biochemical pathways that improve the efficiency of photosynthesis. CONCEPT 5.4 Heterotrophs have adaptations for acquiring and assimilating energy efficiently from a variety of organic sources. Toolmaking Crows: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 Humans employ a multitude of tools to enhance our ability to gather food to meet our energy needs. We use a highly mechanized system of planting, fertilizing, and harvesting crops to feed ourselves or the livestock that we consume. For thousands of years, we have used specialized tools to increase our efficiency of hunting prey, including spears, bows and arrows, and rifles. We view our toolmaking capacity as something that differentiates us from other animals. However, we humans are not alone in using tools to enhance our food acquisition ability.", "In the 1920s, Wolfgang Kler, a psychologist studying the behavior of chimpanzees, observed that chimps in captivity made tools to retrieve bananas stashed in areas that were difficult to reach (Kler 1927). Jane Goodall, a prominent primatologist, reported observing chimpanzees in the wild using grass blades and plant stems to \u201cfish\u201d for termites in holes in the ground and in decaying wood (FIGURE 5.1). Although these reports challenged the commonly held belief that modern humans were the only makers of tools to enhance food acquisition, it was perhaps comforting to those clinging to this notion that the observations were associated with one of our closest extant relatives. No one would ever have suspected similar behavior in birds, touted as one of the least intelligent vertebrates, as evidenced by the dubious insult \u201cbirdbrain\u201d exchanged between humans. FIGURE 5.1 Nonhuman Tool Use This chimpanzee uses a plant stem as a tool to forage for termites. Chimpanzees were the first nonhuman animals documented using tools to forage for food. The corvids, a family of birds that includes crows, ravens, magpies, jays, and jackdaws, enter our cultural heritage with a reputation for being clever. Even so, the discovery that crows use food-collecting tools manufactured from plants was unexpected. Gavin Hunt reported in 1996 that the crows (Corvus moneduloides) of New Caledonia, an island in the South Pacific, used tools to snag insect larvae, spiders, and other arthropods and pull them from the wood of living and decomposing trees (Hunt 1996) (FIGURE 5.2A). Hunt found that individual birds used one of two types of tools, either (1) a hooked twig fashioned from a shoot stripped of its leaves and bark (FIGURE 5.2B) or (2) a serrated leaf clipped from a Pandanus tree (FIGURE 5.2C). Both tools were therefore manufactured, rather than just collected from materials lying on the ground. FIGURE 5.2 Tools Manufactured by New Caledonian Crows (A) Crows use the tools they make to probe for food in the cavities and crevices of trees. (B) Hooked twig tools, made from shoots of trees. The birds use their bills to form the hook while holding the stick with their feet. (C) The crows also can create tools from the serrated leaves of Pandanus plants. (B after G. R. Hunt. 1996. Nature 379: 249\u2013251.) Hunt described a unique foraging style used by the New Caledonian crows. The birds probed tree cavities or areas of dense foliage using their tools as extensions of their bills. The birds used the tools repeatedly, carrying them from tree to tree. The presence of hooks on both types of tools suggested an innovative element that might increase the birds\u2019 efficiency in extracting prey from their refuges in the trees. The tools also appeared to be uniform in their construction; Hunt examined 55 tools manufactured by different birds and found that they differed little. When New Caledonian crows were captured and brought into the laboratory, they made hooked tools from wire, and experiments showed that the tools increased their food retrieval efficiency (Weir et al. 2002). Toolmaking at a skill level equivalent to that shown by the crows appeared in humans only in the late Stone Age, approximately 450,000 years ago (Mellars 1989). How have these birds achieved a similar level of sophistication in their tool construction? The high numbers of New Caledonian crows using tools, and the consistency in the construction of the tools, indicate a cultural phenomenon\u2014a skill learned socially within a population of animals\u2014that had never before been observed in birds. How much of an energetic benefit do the crows gain by using tools rather than just their bills? View the script for the video Introduction Energy is one of the most basic requirements for all organisms. Physiological maintenance, growth, and reproduction all depend on energy acquisition. Organisms are complex systems, and if energy input stops, so does biological functioning. Enzyme systems fail if replacement proteins are not made. Cell membranes degrade and organelles cease to operate without energy to maintain and repair them. In this chapter, we will review the different ways in which organisms acquire energy to meet the demands of cellular maintenance, growth, reproduction, and survival. We\u2019ll focus on the major mechanisms that allow organisms to obtain energy from their environment, including the capture of sunlight and chemical energy and the acquisition and use of organic compounds synthesized by other organisms. CONCEPT 5.1 Organisms obtain energy from sunlight, from inorganic chemical compounds, or through the consumption of organic compounds.", "LEARNING OBJECTIVE 5.1.1 Differentiate autotrophy from heterotrophy in the context of building energy compounds using external sources of energy versus consuming them from organic matter. Sources of Energy We sense energy in our environment in a variety of forms. Light from the sun, a form of radiant energy, illuminates our world and warms our bodies. Objects that are cold or warm to our touch have different amounts of kinetic energy, which is associated with the motion of the molecules that make up the objects. A grasshopper eating a leaf and a coyote eating a meadow vole both represent the transfer of chemical energy, which is stored in the food that is being consumed. Radiant energy and chemical energy are the forms organisms use to meet the demands of growth and maintenance, while kinetic energy, through its influence on the rate of chemical reactions and temperature, is important for controlling the rate of activity and metabolic energy demand of organisms. A cold endotherm needs to warm its body to the optimal temperature for physiological functioning. It does this by \u201cburning\u201d chemical energy from its food during cellular respiration. Ultimately, this food was derived from the radiant energy of sunlight, converted into chemical energy by plants. Most of the energy used to support industrial development, fuel our cars, and heat our homes originated ultimately with photosynthesis, which produced the organisms that became the fossil fuels we pump out of the ground. Autotrophs are organisms that assimilate energy from sunlight (photosynthetic organisms) or from inorganic chemical compounds in their environment (chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria).1 Autotrophs convert the energy of sunlight or inorganic compounds into chemical energy stored in the carbon\u2013carbon bonds of organic compounds, typically carbohydrates. Heterotrophs are organisms that obtain their energy by consuming energy-rich organic compounds made by other organisms\u2014all of which ultimately originated with organic compounds synthesized by autotrophs. Heterotrophs include organisms that consume nonliving organic matter (detritivores); they include earthworms and fungi in soil that feed on detritus derived mainly from dead plants, as well as bacteria in lakes that consume dissolved organic compounds. Heterotrophs also include organisms that consume living organisms but do not necessarily kill them (parasites and herbivores), as well as consumers (predators) that capture and kill their food source (prey). On the surface, the distinction between autotrophs and heterotrophs would seem to be clear-cut: all plants are autotrophs, all animals and fungi are heterotrophs, and archaea and bacteria include both autotrophs and heterotrophs. Things are not always so simple, however. Some plants have lost their photosynthetic function and obtain their energy by parasitism. Such plants, known as holoparasites (holo, \u201centire, whole\u201d), have no photosynthetic pigments and are heterotrophs. Dodder (genus Cuscuta, with approximately 150 different species), for example, is a common plant parasite found throughout the world (FIGURE 5.3A,B) and is considered a major pest of agricultural species. Dodder attaches to its host plant by growing in spirals around the stem and penetrates the phloem of the host, using modified roots called haustoria, to take up carbohydrates. Other plants, known as hemiparasites, are photosynthetic but obtain some of their energy, as well as nutrients and water, from host plants (FIGURE 5.3C). FIGURE 5.3 Plant Parasites (A) Dodder (Cuscuta sp.), a holoparasite that lacks chlorophyll, is shown here wrapped around the stem of a jewelweed plant. (B) Increasing amounts of European dodder (Cuscuta europaea) biomass result in decreasing growth of its host plant, stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). (C) Mistletoe, like the green mistletoe (Ileostylus micranthus) seen here, is a hemiparasite: despite having photosynthetic tissues of its own, mistletoe draws water, nutrients, and some of its energy from its host tree. (B after T. Koskela et al. 2002. Evolution 56: 899\u2013908.) Conversely, animals can act as autotrophs, although this phenomenon is relatively rare. Their photosynthetic capacity is acquired by consuming photosynthetic organisms or by living with them in a close relationship known as a symbiosis (see Concept 15.1). Some sea slugs, for example, have fully functional chloroplasts that supply them with carbohydrates through photosynthesis. These animals, in the order Ascoglossa, take intact chloroplasts from the algae they feed on into their digestive cells (FIGURE 5.4). The chloroplasts are maintained intact for up to several months, providing energy as well as camouflage to the sea slug. FIGURE 5.4 Green Sea Slug The green color of this lettuce sea slug (Elysia crispata) is associated with the chloroplasts it has taken into its digestive system.", "The chloroplasts can supply enough energy to the sea slug to maintain it for several months without food. In the next two sections, we\u2019ll take a more detailed look at the mechanisms autotrophs use to capture energy and at some of the adaptations that make that process more efficient. We\u2019ll do the same more generally for heterotrophs in the final section of this chapter. Chapters 12 and 13 will provide more detailed considerations of energy capture by heterotrophs, and Chapter 16 will look at the energetic relationships among the species in a community.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 5.2.1 Summarize chemosynthesis, which results in the synthesis of energy-rich carbon\u2013carbon bonds. 5.2.2 Outline the steps in the light-driven reactions and carbon reactions of photosynthesis, describing their outcomes and how they produce energy-rich compounds in photoautotrophs. 5.2.3 Illustrate how photosynthetic organisms acclimatize and adapt to variations in the intensity of light. 5.2.4 Evaluate the trade-offs that result when a plant controls water loss. 5.2.5 Describe how temperature influences photosynthetic rates through its effect on enzymes and chloroplast membranes. Autotrophy The vast majority of the autotrophic production of chemical energy on Earth occurs through photosynthesis, a process that uses sunlight to provide the energy needed to take up carbon dioxide and synthesize organic compounds, principally carbohydrates. Although its contribution to the global energy picture is smaller, chemosynthesis (also known as chemolithotrophy), a process that uses energy from inorganic compounds to produce carbohydrates, is important to some key bacteria involved in nutrient cycling (see Concept 22.2) and in some unique ecosystems, such as hydrothermal vent communities (see the Case Study in Chapter 20). Because the energy derived from photosynthesis and chemosynthesis is stored in the carbon\u2013carbon bonds of the organic compounds produced by these processes, ecologists often use carbon as a measure of energy. Chemosynthesis harvests energy from inorganic compounds The earliest autotrophs on Earth were probably chemosynthetic bacteria or archaea that evolved when the composition of the atmosphere was markedly different than it is today: low in oxygen, but rich in hydrogen, with significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO ) and methane (CH ). A diverse group of archaea and 24 bacteria still use energy from inorganic compounds to take up CO2 and synthesize carbohydrates. Chemosynthetic bacteria are often named according to the inorganic substrate they use for energy (TABLE 5.1). TABLE 5.1 Inorganic Substrates Used by Chemosynthetic Bacteria as Electron Donors for Carbon Fixation Substrate (chemical formula) Type of bacteria + Ammonium (NH ) Nitrifying bacteria 4 \u2013 Nitrite (NO ) Nitrifying bacteria 2 \u2013 Hydrogen sulfide (H S/HS ) Sulfur bacteria (purple and green) 2 Sulfur (S) Sulfur bacteria (purple and green) Ferrous iron (Fe2+) Iron bacteria Hydrogen (H ) Hydrogen bacteria 2 Phosphite (HPO 2\u2013) Phosphite bacteria 3 Source: M. T. Madigan and J. M. Martinko. 2005. Brock Biology of Microorganisms. Prentice Hall: Upper Saddle River, NJ. During chemosynthesis, organisms obtain electrons from the inorganic compound\u2014in other words, they oxidize2 the inorganic substrate. They use the electrons to synthesize two high-energy compounds: adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). They then use energy from ATP and NADPH to take up carbon from gaseous CO2 (a process known as fixation of CO2). The fixed carbon is used to synthesize carbohydrates or other organic molecules, which are stored to meet later demands for energy or biosynthesis (manufacture of chemical compounds, membranes, organelles, and tissues). Alternatively, some bacteria can use electrons from the inorganic substrate directly to fix carbon. The biochemical pathway most commonly used to fix carbon is the Calvin cycle, named for Melvin Calvin, the biochemist who first described it. The Calvin cycle is catalyzed by several enzymes, and it occurs in both chemosynthetic and photosynthetic organisms. One of the most widespread and ecologically important groups of chemosynthetic organisms is the nitrifying bacteria (e.g., Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter), which are found in both aquatic and terrestrial +\u2013 ecosystems. In a two-step process, these bacteria convert ammonium (NH4 ) into nitrite (NO2 ), then \u2013 oxidize it to nitrate (NO3 ). These chemical conversions of nitrogen compounds are an important component of nitrogen cycling and plant nutrition, and we will discuss them in more detail in Concept 22.2. Another important chemosynthetic group is the sulfur bacteria, associated with volcanic deposits, sulfur hot springs, \u2013 and acidic mine wastes.", "Sulfur bacteria initially use the higher-energy forms of sulfur, H2S and HS (hydrogen sulfide), producing elemental sulfur (S), which is insoluble and highly visible in the environment \u2013 (FIGURE 5.5). Once the H2S and HS are exhausted, these bacteria use elemental S as an electron donor, producing SO42\u2013 (sulfate). FIGURE 5.5 Sulfur Deposits from Chemosynthetic Bacteria Sulfur bacteria thrive in sulfur hot springs with water temperatures as high as 110\u00b0C (230\u00b0F). Photosynthesis is the powerhouse for life on Earth Prior to 1650, most people believed that plants obtained the raw material needed for their growth from the soil. Jan Baptist van Helmont (1579\u20131644), a Flemish scientist, tested this theory experimentally. He carefully measured the mass of dry soil in a pot (200 pounds or 91 kg) and then planted a willow sapling weighing 5 pounds (2.3 kg). Van Helmont watered the sapling using only rainwater for 5 years as it grew into a small tree. At the end of that time, the tree had gained 164 pounds (74 kg), and the soil had lost only 2 ounces (0.06 kg). Although he incorrectly concluded that the tree had gained its mass from the water, van Helmont\u2019s experiment established the basis for the later discovery that photosynthetic uptake of CO2 from the air\u2014not material from the soil\u2014was the source of the tree\u2019s weight gain. The vast majority of biologically available energy on Earth is derived from the conversion of sunlight into energy-rich carbon compounds by photosynthesis. Photosynthetic organisms include some archaea, bacteria, and protists and most algae and plants. Leaves are the principal photosynthetic tissue in plants, but photosynthesis may also occur in stem and reproductive tissues. Like chemosynthesis, photosynthesis involves the conversion of CO2 into carbohydrates that are used for energy storage and biosynthesis. Photosynthesis is also responsible for the largest movements of CO2 between Earth and the atmosphere, and it is therefore critically important to the global climate system (as we\u2019ll see in Concept 25.1). Here, we will briefly review the major steps of plant photosynthesis and consider some ecologically relevant constraints on photosynthetic rates. In Concept 5.3, we will examine some variations in plant photosynthetic pathways. LIGHT-DRIVEN AND CARBON REACTIONS Photosynthesis has two major steps. The first is the harvesting of energy from sunlight, which is used to split water to provide electrons for generating ATP and NADPH. This step is often referred to as the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis. The second step is the fixation of carbon and the synthesis of sugars and subsequently carbohydrates. This step is often referred to as the carbon reactions of photosynthesis. Sunlight harvesting is accomplished by several pigments, principally chlorophyll. Chlorophyll gives photosynthetic organisms their green appearance because it absorbs red and blue light and reflects green wavelengths (FIGURE 5.6). Plants and photosynthetic bacteria have similar chlorophyll pigments, but they absorb light at slightly different wavelengths. Additional pigments associated with photosynthesis, called accessory pigments, include the carotenoids, which are characteristically red, yellow, or orange in appearance. All of these photosynthetic pigments are embedded in a membrane, along with other molecules involved in the light-driven reactions. In plants, this membrane lies within specialized organelles called chloroplasts, while in photosynthetic bacteria the pigments are embedded in the cell membrane. The pigment molecules are arrayed like antennae, with each array containing 50\u2013300 molecules. The pigments absorb energy from discrete units of light, called photons. That energy is used to split water and provide electrons. The electrons are passed on to molecular complexes on the membranes, where they are used to synthesize ATP and NADPH. FIGURE 5.6 Absorption Spectra of Plant Photosynthetic Pigments Plants typically contain several light absorbing pigments, which absorb light of different wavelengths. (After C. J. Avers. 1985. Molecular Cell Biology. Addison-Wesley: Boston, MA.) The splitting of water (H O) to provide electrons for the light-driven reactions generates oxygen (O ). 22 The evolution of photosynthesis, and the accompanying release of O2 into the atmosphere, was a critical step in the development of the chemistry of the modern atmosphere and lithosphere as well as the evolution of life on Earth. Atmospheric oxygen led to the creation of a layer of ozone (O ) high in the atmosphere that 3 shields organisms from high-energy ultraviolet radiation (described in Concept 25.4). The evolution of aerobic respiration, in which O2 is used as an electron acceptor, facilitated great evolutionary changes for life on Earth. In the carbon reactions of photosynthesis, energy from ATP and NADPH is used in the Calvin cycle to fix carbon.", "Carbon dioxide is taken up from the atmosphere through the stomates of vascular plants, or it diffuses across the cell membranes in nonvascular plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria and archaea. A key enzyme associated with the Calvin cycle is ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, thankfully usually referred to by its abbreviation, rubisco. Rubisco, the most abundant enzyme on Earth, catalyzes the uptake of CO2 and the synthesis of a three-carbon compound: phosphoglyceraldehyde, or PGA. PGA is eventually converted into a six-carbon sugar [glucose (C6H12O6) in most plants]. The net reaction of photosynthesis is therefore (5.1) ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS AND SOLUTIONS The rate of photosynthesis determines the supply of energy and substrates for biosynthesis available in the environment. Because this rate influences the growth and reproduction of photosynthetic organisms\u2014often equated with their ecological success (their abundance and geographic range)\u2014environmental controls on the rate of photosynthesis are a key topic in physiological ecology. It should be noted, however, that net energy (carbon) gain is also influenced by CO2 losses associated with cellular respiration. Light is clearly an important influence on rates of photosynthesis in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. The relationship between the light level and a plant\u2019s photosynthetic rate can be portrayed by a light response curve (FIGURE 5.7A). When there is enough light that the plant\u2019s photosynthetic CO2 uptake is balanced by its CO2 loss by respiration, the plant is said to have reached the light compensation point. As the light level increases above the light compensation point, the photosynthetic rate also increases; in other words, photosynthesis is limited by the availability of light. The photosynthetic rate levels off at a light saturation point, which is typically reached at a level below full sunlight. FIGURE 5.7 Plant Responses to Variations in Light Levels (A) Photosynthetic light response curve. (B) Spearscale (Atriplex triangularis) plants grown at different light levels in growth chambers acclimatized to those light levels. Their light response curves indicate that adjustments in the light saturation point occurred. Small, but ecologically significant, changes in the light compensation point occur in many other species, facilitating CO uptake at low light levels. 2 (B after O. Bjkman. 1981. In Physiological Plant Ecology I: Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology, O. L. Lange et al. [Eds.], pp. 57\u2013101. Springer: New York.) Why might the light saturation point of a plant be below the maximum light level the plant is likely to be exposed to? How do plants cope with light variation? How would an understory forest plant, for example, respond to shading by canopy trees? Could that plant acclimatize to more light if the canopy tree fell, allowing full sunlight to reach the ground? In a series of classic studies using controlled growth conditions, Olle Bjorkman demonstrated that acclimatization to different light levels involves a shift in the light saturation point (Bjorkman 1981) (FIGURE 5.8). Photosynthetic organisms may also alter the density of their light-harvesting pigments\u2014a strategy analogous to changing the size of the antenna on a radio\u2014and the amounts of photosynthetic enzymes available for the carbon reactions. Typically, the average light level a plant experiences, integrated over the course of the day, is near the transition point between light limitation and light saturation (see ANALYZING DATA 5.1). FIGURE 5.8 Effects of Light Level on Leaf Structure Golden banner (Thermopsis montana) leaves adjust morphologically to changes in light levels. Leaves grown at high light levels (A) are thicker, have more photosynthetic cells (palisade and spongy mesophyll), and have greater numbers of chloroplasts than leaves grown at low light levels (B). Some specialized bacteria are especially well adapted to photosynthesis at low light levels, which allows them to thrive in dimly lit environments such as relatively deep ocean water (down to about 20 m). A previously undescribed form of chlorophyll, called chlorophyll f, was recently found in samples of the marine cyanobacteria that form sediments in the shallow waters of Shark Bay, Australia (Chen et al. 2010), and has subsequently been found in cyanobacteria of other low-light habitats, including hot springs, rice paddies, and caves. Chlorophyll f absorbs light in the near-infrared region, just beyond the red wavelengths used by other forms of chlorophyll (see Figure 5.6). Chlorophyll f is an adaptation that allows cyanobacteria possessing it to grow underneath other photosynthetic organisms that use light in the blue and red wavelengths, as it lets them harvest energy at wavelengths that pass through those other photosynthetic organisms (Nnberg et al. 2018).", "The discovery of a pigment that can harvest near-infrared energy has implications for increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic panels used to generate electricity, which may help lower emissions of CO2 (see ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 5.1). Water availability is an important control on the supply of CO2 for photosynthesis in terrestrial plants. As we saw in Concept 4.3, low water availability results in closure of the stomates, restricting the entry of CO2 into leaves. Stomatal control represents an important trade-off for the plant: water conservation versus energy gain through photosynthesis as well as cooling of the leaf through transpiration. Keeping stomates open while tissues lose water can permanently impair physiological processes in the leaf. Closing stomates, however, not only limits photosynthetic CO2 uptake, but also increases the chances of light damage to the leaf. When the Calvin cycle is not operating, energy continues to accumulate in the light-harvesting arrays, and if enough energy builds up, it can damage the photosynthetic membranes. Plants have evolved a number of ways of dissipating this energy safely, including the use of carotenoids to release it as heat, as described in WEB EXTENSION 5.1. ANALYZING DATA 5.1 Many plants can adjust their morphology and biochemistry to match the light conditions under which they are grown. The curves depicted in the figure are from Olle Bjkman\u2019s* classic studies and show the net photosynthetic CO uptake for 2 2 spearscale plants (Atriplex triangularis) grown under high-light (920 \u00b5mol/m /s of photosynthetically active radiation) 2 and low-light (92 \u00b5mol/m /s) conditions. 1. Assuming no further physiological changes occur, calculate the daily carbon balance for leaves of the high-light and low-light plants grown under the following conditions: 2 a. Plants are kept at a light level (irradiance) of 200 \u00b5mol/m /s for 2 hours, then switched to an irradiance of 1,50022 \u00b5mol/m /s for 10 hours, then switched back to 200 \u00b5mol/m /s for 2 hours. The lights are then turned off for 10 hours. (This light regime approximates sunny conditions in an open subtropical savanna.) 22 b. Plants are kept at an irradiance of 50 \u00b5mol/m /s for 2 hours, then switched to an irradiance of 200 \u00b5mol/m /s for2 10 hours, then switched back to 50 \u00b5mol/m /s for 2 hours. The lights are then turned off for 10 hours. (This light regime is similar to that expected in a tropical rainforest understory.) 2. High-light and low-light plants exhibit differences in maximum net photosynthesis rates, light compensation points, and nighttime respiration. Which of these three differences contributes the most to the distinction in carbon balance under high-light conditions (calculated in part a of question 1) and low-light conditions (calculated in part b)? 3. What do you think might contribute to the differences in nighttime respiration rates? See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. *Bjkman, O. 1981. Responses to different quantum flux densities. In Physiological Plant Ecology I: Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology, O. L. Lange et al. (Eds.), pp. 57\u2013101. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. Temperature influences photosynthesis in two main ways: through its effects on the rates of chemical reactions and by influencing the structural integrity of membranes and enzymes. Autotrophs acclimatize and adapt to temperature variation by changing properties of the Calvin cycle enzymes and/or the photosynthetic membranes. Different photosynthetic organisms have different forms of the same photosynthetic enzymes that operate best under the environmental temperatures where the organisms occur. These differences result in markedly different temperature ranges for photosynthesis in organisms from different climates (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 5.9A). Lichens and plants of Arctic and alpine environments can photosynthesize at temperatures close to freezing, while desert plants may have their highest photosynthetic rates at temperatures that are hot enough to denature most other plants\u2019 enzymes (40\u00b0C\u201350\u00b0C or 104\u00b0F\u2013 122\u00b0F). Plants that acclimatize to changes in temperature synthesize different forms of photosynthetic enzymes with different temperature optima (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 5.9B). Temperature also influences the fluidity of the cell and organelle membranes (see Concept 4.2). Cold sensitivity in plants of tropical and subtropical biomes is associated with loss of membrane fluidity, which inhibits the functioning of the light-harvesting molecules embedded in the chloroplast membranes. And as we have seen, high temperatures, particularly in combination with intense sunlight, can damage photosynthetic membranes. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 5.9 Photosynthetic Responses to Temperature (A) The temperatures at which plants and lichens reach their maximum photosynthetic rates correspond to the range of environmental temperatures in the native habitat of the species.", "(B) Acclimatization to different growth temperature regimes by plants from different populations of Atriplex lentiformis, a shrub that occurs in the hot Mojave Desert and in cool coastal zones of California. The two growth temperature regimes are representative of the two habitats the species occupies. (A after H. A. Mooney. 1986. In Plant Ecology, M. J. Crawley [Ed.]. Blackwell Science Ltd: Oxford. Based on O. L. Lange and L. Kappen. 1972. Antarctic Research Series 20: 80\u201395. American Geophysical Union; H. A. Mooney et al. 1983. Oecologia 57: 38\u201342; H. A. Mooney et al. 1976. Carnegie Institution Year Book 75: 410\u2013413. B after R. W. Pearcy. 1977. Plant Physiol 59: 795\u2013799.) Nutrient concentrations in leaves reflect their photosynthetic potential because most of the nitrogen in plants is associated with rubisco and other photosynthetic enzymes. Thus, higher amounts of nitrogen in leaves are correlated with higher photosynthetic rates. Why, then, don\u2019t all plants allocate more nitrogen to their leaves to increase their photosynthetic capacity? There are two main reasons. First, the supply of nitrogen is low relative to the demand, and nitrogen is needed for growth and other metabolic functions in addition to photosynthesis (see Chapter 22). Second, increasing the nitrogen concentration of a leaf increases the risk that herbivores will consume the leaf, as plant-eating animals are often nitrogen starved (see Concept 22.1). Plants must balance the competing demands of photosynthesis, growth, and protection from herbivores. Over evolutionary time, some plants have dealt with environmental constraints on photosynthesis with adaptations in their photosynthetic pathways, as we will see next. Self-Assessment 5.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 5.3 Environmental constraints have resulted in the evolution of biochemical pathways that improve the efficiency of photosynthesis. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 5.3.1 Explain the difference between photosynthesis and photorespiration and evaluate conditions where photorespiration is detrimental to plant growth. 5.3.2 Summarize how biochemical and anatomical adaptations associated with the C photos4 ynthetic pathway minimize photorespiration, thereby enhancing photosynthesis rates. 5.3.3 Describe how crassulacean acid metabolism reduces water loss relative to the C3 or C4 photosynthetic pathways. Photosynthetic Pathways Anything that influences energy gain by photosynthesis has the potential to affect the survival, growth, and reproduction of the organism. As we have just seen, rates of photosynthesis are influenced by environmental conditions, particularly temperature and water availability. In addition, an apparent biochemical inefficiency in the initial step of the Calvin cycle limits energy gain by photosynthetic organisms. In this section, we will examine some evolutionary responses to these environmental constraints on photosynthesis. We will describe two specialized photosynthetic pathways, the C4 pathway and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), that make photosynthesis more efficient under particular potentially stressful environmental conditions. Plants that lack these specialized pathways use the C3 photosynthetic pathway. The C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways take their names from the number of carbon atoms in their first stable chemical products. First, we\u2019ll examine photorespiration, a process that operates in opposition to the Calvin cycle and lowers its efficiency. Photorespiration lowers the efficiency of photosynthesis Earlier, we described a key enzyme in the Calvin cycle, rubisco, and noted that the \u201co\u201d in the abbreviation stands for \u201coxygenase.\u201d Rubisco can catalyze two competing reactions. One is a carboxylase reaction, in which CO2 is taken up, leading to the synthesis of sugars and the release of O2 (i.e., photosynthesis; see Equation 5.1). The other is an oxygenase reaction, in which O2 is taken up, leading to the breakdown of carbon compounds and the release of CO2. This oxygenase reaction is part of a process called photorespiration, which results in a net loss of energy and is thus potentially detrimental for plants. The balance between photosynthesis and photorespiration is related to two main factors: (1) the ratio of O2 to CO2 in the atmosphere and (2) temperature. As the atmospheric concentration of CO2 decreases relative to that of O2, the rate of photorespiration increases relative to the rate of photosynthesis (FIGURE 5.10). Since the evolution of C3 photosynthesis over 3 billion years ago, atmospheric CO2 concentrations have changed repeatedly over periods of hundreds of thousands of years in response to major global geologic and climate events (see Concepts 25.1 and 25.2). These shifts in atmospheric CO2 concentrations would have influenced the balance between photosynthesis and photorespiration.", "Furthermore, as temperatures increase, the rate of O2 uptake catalyzed by rubisco increases relative to the rate of CO2 uptake, and the solubility of CO2 in the cytoplasm decreases more than that of O2. As a result of these two processes, photorespiration increases more rapidly at high temperatures than photosynthesis does. Thus, energy loss due to photorespiration is particularly acute at high temperatures and low atmospheric CO2 concentrations. FIGURE 5.10 Influence of Oxygen Concentration on Photosynthesis As the atmospheric oxygen concentration increases, net photosynthetic uptake of CO decreases because of greater photorespiration, as shown here for soybean leaves 2 in light levels equal to about 20% of full sun. (After M. L. Forrester et al. 1966. Plant Physiol 41: 428\u2013431.) Why does the net rate of CO uptake drop below zero at high oxygen levels for leaves exposed to 73 ppm CO ? 22 If photorespiration is detrimental to the functioning of photosynthetic organisms, why hasn\u2019t a new form of rubisco evolved that minimizes uptake of O2? Is it possible that photorespiration provides some benefit to the plant? A possible clue comes from experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis plants with a genetic mutation that knocks out photorespiration die under normal light and CO2 conditions (Ogren 1984). One hypothesis for a potential benefit of photorespiration is that it protects the plant from damage to the photosynthetic machinery at high light levels. This hypothesis is supported by the results of a study by Akiko Kozaki and Go Takeba, who used tobacco plants (Nicotiana sp.) that they genetically altered to elevate or lower the plants\u2019 rates of photorespiration (Kozaki and Takeba 1996). They subjected these experimental plants to high-intensity light and recorded the damage to their photosynthetic machinery. Plants with higher rates of photorespiration showed less damage than control plants with normal rates of photorespiration (FIGURE 5.11) or plants with depressed rates of photorespiration. FIGURE 5.11 Does Photorespiration Protect Plants from Damage by Intense Light? The ability of plants to process light energy for photosynthesis (electron transport capacity) under conditions that promote damage to photosynthetic membranes (high light levels, low CO concentrations) is greater in genetically altered plants with high rates of 2 photorespiration than in control plants or in genetically altered plants with low rates of photorespiration. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (After A. Kozaki and G. Takeba. 1996. Nature 384: 557\u2013580.) Despite this possibility that photorespiration plays a role in protecting plants from damage at high light levels, there are conditions in which the decrease in photosynthetic CO2 uptake it causes could be a serious problem for the plant. If atmospheric CO2 concentrations are low and temperatures high, photosynthetic energy gain might not keep pace with photorespiratory energy loss. Such conditions existed 7 million years ago, at about the time when plants with a unique biochemical pathway, C4 photosynthesis, became far more abundant (Cerling et al. 1997). C photosynthesis lowers photorespiratory energy loss 4 The C4 photosynthetic pathway reduces photorespiration. C4 photosynthesis evolved independently several times in different plant species. It is found in 18 plant families (FIGURE 5.12) but is most closely associated with the grass family. Well-known examples of crop plants with the C4 pathway include corn, sugarcane, and sorghum. FIGURE 5.12 Plants with the C4 Photosynthetic Pathway The C4 photosynthetic pathway has evolved multiple times. It is found in plants of 18 different families encompassing a variety of growth forms, from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) (A) to eudicots such as Cleome gynandra, commonly found in Africa (B). C4 photosynthesis involves both biochemical and morphological specialization. The biochemical specialization can be thought of as a pump that provides high concentrations of CO2 to the Calvin cycle. This greater supply of CO2 lowers the rate of O2 uptake by rubisco, substantially reducing photorespiration. The morphological specialization involves spatial separation of the regions in the leaf where CO2 is taken up (mesophyll) and where the Calvin cycle operates (bundle sheath), which increases the concentration of CO2 where rubisco is found. In C4 plants, CO2 is initially taken up by an enzyme called phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, or PEPcase, that has a greater capacity to take up CO2 than rubisco and lacks oxygenase activity. PEPcase fixes CO2 in the mesophyll tissue of the plant. Once the CO2 is taken up, a four-carbon compound is synthesized and transported to a group of cells surrounding the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem), known as the bundle sheath, where the Calvin cycle occurs.", "The four-carbon compound is broken down in the bundle sheath cells, releasing CO2 to the Calvin cycle, and a three-carbon compound is transported back to the mesophyll to continue the C4 cycle. The bundle sheath is surrounded by a waxy coating that keeps CO2 from diffusing out (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 5.13). As a result, CO2 concentrations inside the bundle sheath may reach a high of 5,000 parts per million (ppm), even though external CO2 concentrations are only 408 ppm. Additional energy in the form of ATP must be expended to operate the C4 photosynthetic pathway, but the increased efficiency of carbon fixation compensates for the higher energy requirement. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 5.13 Morphological Specialization in the Leaves of C4 Plants The spatial separation of CO uptake (in the mesophyll cells) and the Calvin cycle (in the bundle sheath cells) 2 minimizes photorespiration and maximizes photosynthetic rates under high temperatures. As is apparent from the discussion above, plants with the C4 photosynthetic pathway can photosynthesize at higher rates than C3 plants under environmental conditions that elevate rates of photorespiration, such as high temperatures. In addition, most C4 plants have lower rates of transpiration at a given photosynthetic rate, known as water use efficiency, than C3 plants. This difference is due to the ability of PEPcase to take up CO2 under the lower CO2 concentrations that exist when stomates are not fully open. If we assumed that photosynthetic rates determine ecological success, we could use climate patterns to predict where C4 plants should predominate over C3 plants. Such an analysis would be overly simplistic, however, because multiple factors other than temperature influence the biogeography of C3 and C4 plants, including abiotic factors such as light levels and biotic factors such as competitive ability and the pool of species available to colonize an area. However, analyses of similar communities across latitudinal and elevational gradients provide support for the benefit of C4 photosynthesis at high temperatures and for the role this benefit plays in C4 plant distribution (Ehleringer et al. 1997). In particular, studies of grass- and sedge-dominated communities in Australia suggest a close correlation between growing-season temperature and the proportion of C3 and C4 species in the community (FIGURE 5.14). As atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to increase because of burning of fossil fuels, however, photorespiration rates are likely to decrease, and the advantages of C4 over C3 photosynthesis may be diminished in some regions, leading to changes in the proportions of C3 and C4 plants. FIGURE 5.14 C4 Plant Abundance and Growing-Season Temperatures The proportions of C4 plants in Australian grass- and sedge-dominated communities correlate with the average minimum growing-season temperatures in the different locations. (After P. W. Hattersley. 1983. Oecologia 57: 113\u2013128.) Using the data in this graph and the seasonal temperature trends from the climate diagrams in Concept 3.1 (assume that the monthly minimum temperature is 5\u00b0C cooler than the monthly average), what biome(s) should lack C species? 4 CAM photosynthesis enhances water conservation When plants first colonized the terrestrial environment, they evolved adaptations to restrict water losses to a dry atmosphere. Among these adaptations is a unique photosynthetic pathway called crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), which occurs in over 10,000 plant species belonging to 33 families. While C4 photosynthesis separates CO2 uptake and the Calvin cycle spatially, CAM separates these two steps temporally (FIGURE 5.15). CAM plants open their stomates at night, when C3 and C4 plants have their stomates closed. Because air temperatures at night are cooler, humidity is higher. Higher humidity results in a lower water potential gradient between the leaf and the air (see Concept 4.3), so the plant loses less water by transpiration than it would during the day. CAM plants close their stomates during the day, when the potential for water loss is highest. FIGURE 5.15 C , C , and CAM Photosynthesis Compared All three photosynthetic pathways fix carbon and34 produce sugars, but C photosynthesis separates these steps spatially, while CAM separates them temporally. 4 During the night, when the stomates are open, CAM plants take up CO2 using PEPcase and incorporate it into a four-carbon organic acid, which is stored in vacuoles (FIGURE 5.16). The resulting increase in acidity in the plants\u2019 tissues during the night is characteristic of CAM plants and can be used to estimate their photosynthetic rates. During the day, when the stomates are closed, the organic acid is broken down, releasing CO2 to the Calvin cycle.", "CO2 concentrations in the photosynthetic tissues of CAM plants are thus higher than those in the atmosphere during the day. These high CO2 concentrations increase the efficiency of photosynthesis as they suppress photorespiration. Photosynthetic rates in CAM plants are usually related to the capacity of the plant to store the four-carbon organic acid, so many CAM plants are succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves or stems, which enhances their nighttime acid storage capacity. FIGURE 5.16 Crassulacean Acid Metabolism Plants using CAM open their stomates and take up CO2 at night, then run the Calvin cycle during the day. CAM plants are typically associated with arid and saline environments, such as deserts and Mediterranean-type ecosystems (FIGURE 5.17). Some CAM plants, however, are found in the humid tropics. Tropical CAM plants are typically epiphytes growing on the branches of trees, without access to the abundant water stored in the soil. These epiphytes rely on rainfall for their water supply and may be subject to long periods without access to water. FIGURE 5.17 Examples of Plants with the CAM Photosynthetic Pathway Most CAM plants are found in arid and saline regions or in other habitats where water availability is periodically low. The CAM pathway is also found in some aquatic plants, such as quillworts (Isoetes), which are closely related to the club mosses. This observation suggests that water conservation was probably not the only driving force for the evolution of CAM, which evolved independently in at least 35 different families. The rate of CO2 diffusion into water is low, and CAM has been hypothesized to facilitate the uptake of CO2 at the low concentrations found in the aquatic environment. A unique property of some CAM plant species is the ability to switch between C3 and CAM photosynthesis, known as facultative CAM. When conditions are favorable for daytime gas exchange (i.e., abundant water is available), these plants utilize the C3 photosynthetic pathway, which allows greater carbon gain than CAM. As conditions become more arid or more saline, the plants switch over to CAM. The reversibility of the transition from C3 to CAM varies among species. For example, the common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum), which has been intensively studied as a facultative CAM model system, undergoes an irreversible transition from C3 to CAM photosynthesis when salinity increases or the soil dries out (Osmond et al. 1982). In contrast, some species in the genus Clusia can switch relatively rapidly between C3 and CAM (Borland et al. 1992). These plants start out as epiphytes in canopy trees but grow toward the base of their host tree, eventually strangling it and taking on a tree growth form. The capacity to switch between C3 and CAM facilitates the change from epiphyte to tree form, and it supports continued photosynthesis during the transition from wet season to dry season characteristic of some tropical locations. How can we tell what photosynthetic pathway a plant is using? The morphology of the plant gives us a clue: succulent plants suggest CAM photosynthesis, and plants with a well-developed bundle sheath suggest C4 photosynthesis. These clues provide a starting point, but they are far from foolproof. We can measure the presence and activity of specific enzymes, but this approach requires substantial sample preparation and 13 12 laboratory time. A simpler approach is to measure the ratio of stable carbon isotopes ( C/ C) in plant tissues. Although the isotopic technique uses sophisticated equipment, sample preparation is simple, and there are numerous laboratories that can routinely analyze plant tissue samples (see ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 5.1). Now that we have reviewed the ways in which autotrophs acquire energy, let\u2019s turn our attention to how that energy is acquired by heterotrophs. ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 5.1 Many biologically important elements, including carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, have an abundant \u201clight\u201d isotopic form and one or more \u201cheavy\u201d nonradioactive isotopic forms, which contain additional neutrons. Because isotopes of these elements do not decay over time as radioactive isotopes do, they are referred to as stable isotopes. An 13 12 example of a stable isotope is carbon-13 ( C), which is heavier than the more abundant form, carbon-12 ( C), because it has one more neutron. Groups of stable isotopes include hydrogen (H) and deuterium (D or 2H); nitrogen-14 and nitrogen14 15 1617 18 15 ( N and N); and oxygen-16, oxygen-17, and oxygen-18 ( O, O, and O). The lighter isotopes of these elements12 13 are much more abundant than the heavier forms.", "For example, C constitutes 98.9%, and C only 1.1%, of the C on14 15 Earth. Similarly, N constitutes 99.6%, and N 0.4%, of the N on Earth. The isotopic composition of a material is usually expressed as delta (\u03b4), the difference between the ratio of the isotopic forms in a sample (R ) and that in a standard material (R ), divided by the ratio in the standard, multiplied by sample standard 1,000 [to give parts per thousand (\u2030) difference]: Examples of the standard materials chosen for stable isotopes include a limestone rock from South Carolina for C, atmospheric N for N, and ocean water for O and H. 2 Naturally occurring stable isotopes have become an important tool in ecological research (Fry 2007). Stable isotopes have been used to determine photosynthetic pathways in plants, identify food sources for animals, and track the movements of elements and rates of nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Because of differences in mass, the isotopes are affected differently by biological and physical processes. Generally, the heavier isotope is discriminated against and the12 13 lighter isotope enriched. For example, when rubisco catalyzes the uptake of CO , it favors CO over CO . As a result, 2 22 12 13 13 plants are enriched in C, and depleted in C, relative to the C in atmospheric CO : atmospheric CO has a \u03b4 C value 22 of \u20137 parts per thousand (in other words, it is 7 parts per thousand more depleted in 13C than the standard), and C plants 3 13 12 13 have a \u03b4 C value of about \u201327 parts per thousand. C and CAM plants, however, have less C and more C than C 43 plants. That is because initial CO uptake in these plants is catalyzed by PEPcase, which discriminates against 13CO less 22 than rubisco does, and rubisco in C and CAM plants takes up CO in a semi-closed system (in the bundle sheath or with 42 stomates closed), which inhibits enzymatic discrimination. As a result, measurement of the C isotope ratio in plant tissues can be used to determine the photosynthetic pathway used by a plant species, as shown in the figure. Stable isotopes have also been used to determine food sources for animals. The isotopic ratios of C, N, and S in various potential food sources may differ significantly, and measurement of one or more of these isotopes in potential food sources and in consumer tissues can determine what is being eaten. For example, in this chapter\u2019s Case Study Revisited, we will see how isotopic ratios were used to determine the diet of New Caledonian crows. In Concept 20.4, we will describe how N and C isotopes were used to study the diets of both modern North American grizzly bears and extinct cave bears. Stable isotopes can also be added to the environment to help trace the movements of elements. This approach is often used to trace the fate of nutrients in ecosystems. Isotopic analysis of biological samples is relatively straightforward. For C and N, the samples are dried, ground, and burned in a closed furnace. The gases liberated by the combustion are then analyzed for isotopic composition using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Many commercial laboratories specialize in the isotopic analysis of biological materials, owing in part to the demand for such analyses from ecologists and other environmental scientists. Carbon Isotopic Composition of Plants with Different Photosynthetic Pathways Plants with the C 3 13 13 photosynthetic pathway show the greatest discrimination against C (and thus the most negative \u03b4 C, expressed in parts13 13 per thousand), while C and CAM plants are more enriched in C (have a less negative \u03b4 C). (After M. A. Maslin and 4 E. Thomas. 2003. Quat Sci Rev 22: 1729\u20131736.) Why is the range of \u03b4 13C values for CAM plants larger, bridging the values for C and C plants? 34 Self-Assessment 5.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 5.4 Heterotrophs have adaptations for acquiring and assimilating energy efficiently from a variety of organic sources. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 5.4.1 Illustrate how the chemical makeup of a food item determines the benefit it provides to the consumer eating it. 5.4.2 Explain how morphological and behavioral adaptations enable heterotrophs to obtain food more efficiently. 5.4.3 Describe how increasing complexity in the digestive systems of heterotrophs makes the assimilation of energy and nutrients more efficient.", "Heterotrophy Heterotrophy is all about eating and being eaten, which are major themes in ecology. The first organisms on Earth were probably heterotrophs that consumed amino acids and sugars, which formed spontaneously in the early atmosphere and rained down on the surface or formed in the oceans near hydrothermal vents. Since that time, the diversity of strategies for obtaining energy by heterotrophs has expanded tremendously. Three general steps are associated with heterotrophic energy acquisition: finding and obtaining food, consuming food, and absorbing its energy and nutrients. The organic matter that provides energy for heterotrophs includes living and freshly killed organisms as well as detritus\u2014organic material derived from dead organisms in various stages of decomposition (see Concept 20.4). In this section, we will examine food sources, the ways in which heterotrophs obtain energy, and factors that influence absorption of food. There is a wide range of variation in the complexity of heterotrophic energy acquisition and assimilation processes that is associated with heterotroph body size and physiology. In Chapters 8, 12, and 13, we will take a more in-depth look at the various types of consumers (predators, herbivores, and parasites), how they forage, and how the food they consume affects their growth and reproduction as well as the distributions and abundances of both the consumers themselves and their food resources (prey and hosts). Food sources differ in their chemistry and availability Heterotrophs consume energy-rich organic compounds (food) from their environment and convert them into usable chemical energy\u2014primarily ATP\u2014by processes such as glycolysis, which breaks down carbohydrates. The heterotroph\u2019s energy gain from food depends on the chemistry of the food, which determines its digestibility and its energy content. The effort invested in finding and obtaining the food also influences how much benefit the heterotroph gets from consuming it. For example, microorganisms that consume detritus in the soil invest little energy in obtaining food. However, the energy content of this decomposing plant matter is low compared with the energy content of live organisms. Living prey are rarer than detritus, and they may have defensive mechanisms that their predators must expend energy to overcome. Thus, a cheetah hunting a gazelle invests substantial energy in finding, chasing, capturing, and killing its prey, but it obtains a substantial, energy-rich meal if the hunt is successful. The benefit of a food source to a heterotroph is partly related to the chemical compounds that the food contains. The chemical constituents of food can be placed into several categories based on their energy content and ease of assimilation (FIGURE 5.18). While water can be an important part of an animal\u2019s food, as we saw in Concept 4.3, it does not provide energy. The energy in food is found in the \u201cdry matter\u201d fraction (i.e., what is left when all the water is removed). Fiber includes compounds such as cellulose (the primary constituent of plant cell walls) and other structural components of organisms. It is generally a poor energy source because of its chemical structure and the inability of many heterotrophs to break it down chemically. Most of the energy in food is found in carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Fats are richer in energy than carbohydrates per unit of mass, and carbohydrates provide more energy than the amino acids that make up proteins do. However, amino acids also provide nitrogen, a nutrient that is often in high demand. The ratio of carbon to specific nutrients (usually nitrogen) often provides a good indication of the nutritional quality of the food: a higher amount of nutrients relative to the carbon indicates better-quality food. Secondary compounds (chemicals not used in growth or development) are generally not a good energy source for animals, and some secondary compounds may actually decrease energy intake by binding to digestive enzymes or by being directly toxic to the heterotrophs consuming them. FIGURE 5.18 Categorical Breakdown of Food Chemistry Food chemistry can be complex, but these simple categories help ecologists understand how groups of chemicals influence the benefits of food for heterotrophs. (After W. H. Karasov and C. Martinez del Rio. 2007. Physiological Ecology: How Animals Process Energy, Nutrients, and Toxins. Princeton University Press: Princeton, NJ.) The differing concentrations of the compounds described in Figure 5.18 among food types are associated with the tissues, cell types, and organisms from which the food is derived. Animal tissues are generally more energy-rich than plant, fungal, or bacterial cells, which tend to have higher concentrations of fiber.", "As a result, herbivores (animals that eat plants) generally have to eat more food to get the same benefit that carnivores (animals that eat other animals) do. However, carnivores may expend substantially more energy finding food than herbivores do, as we will see in later chapters. Heterotrophs obtain food using diverse strategies Heterotrophs vary in size from archaea and bacteria (as small as 0.5 \u03bcm) to blue whales (up to 25 m long). The ratio of body size to food ingested varies widely, but it generally increases as body size increases. Bacteria may be bathed in their food, while food for larger heterotrophs is usually more diffuse and smaller relative to the consumer. Feeding methods and the complexity of food absorption are accordingly very diverse among heterotrophs. Prokaryotic heterotrophs typically absorb food directly through their cell membranes. Archaea, bacteria, and fungi excrete enzymes into the environment to break down organic matter, acting in effect to digest their food outside their cells. Heterotrophic bacteria have adapted to a wide variety of organic energy sources and produce a large number of enzymes capable of breaking down organic compounds. This capacity of microorganisms as a group to use diverse energy sources has been exploited in environmental waste management as an approach to cleaning up toxic chemical wastes, a process known as bioremediation. Spills of fuels, pesticides, sewage, and other toxins have been effectively contained by using microorganisms to break down these harmful compounds. Consumption of oil by marine bacteria is thought to have been an important contributor to cleaning up the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that resulted when the Deepwater 3 Horizon oil drilling rig exploded in 2010, releasing about 4.9 million barrels (780 \u00d7 10 liters) of oil. Much of the oil was released directly to the deeper layers of the ocean from the wellhead, which flowed for 87 days unabated until it was finally capped (FIGURE 5.19). The oil spill posed a substantial hazard to marine life, and it was feared that its impact would be long-term, as the impacts of other oil spills had been. Some reports suggest that up to half the oil released in the Deepwater Horizon spill was consumed and respired by marine microorganisms (Du and Kessler 2012), although others suggest that the blooms of microorganisms observed after the spill resulted from consumption of natural gas that leaked from the well rather than the oil itself (Valentine et al. 2010). While the magnitude of consumption is still debated, it is clear that the environmental impact of the oil spill was lessened by the action of marine microorganisms that used the spilled oil as an energy source. FIGURE 5.19 An Environmental Disaster Oil pours from the fractured wellhead of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig at the seafloor 1,700 m (5,700 feet) below the surface. About 57,000 barrels (9.1 million liters) were released each day for more than 3 months. The impact of this disaster may have been somewhat lessened by the activities of marine microorganisms that were able to use the oil as an energy source. Multicellular heterotrophs usually must seek out food, or move it toward themselves in the case of some sessile marine animals. The evolution of mobility was probably associated with the need to seek out food sources, as well as with the need to avoid being eaten by other consumers. Continued morphological and behavioral adaptations for efficiently finding and capturing food in different environments led to additional diversification of form and function. Animals display tremendous diversity in their specialized feeding adaptations, which reflect the diversity of the foods they consume. Here we present several examples that serve to demonstrate the morphological diversification of heterotrophs; we will take a closer look at behavioral adaptations for feeding in Concept 8.2. MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF INSECT MOUTHPARTS Insects display tremendous diversity in facial appearance, which reflects the diversity of their food sources, which include detritus, plants, and other animals. They may eat animal prey whole or suck out their body fluids. All insects have the same basic set of mouthparts, consisting of several paired appendages that are used to seize, handle, and consume their food. Morphological variation in these mouthparts reflects the feeding specializations that have evolved within different insect groups (FIGURE 5.20). Common houseflies have \u201csponging\u201d mouthparts that release saliva onto their food, then soak up and ingest the partially digested solution.", "Female mosquitoes and aphids have piercing and sucking mouthparts for extracting fluids from their food sources\u2014blood from animals and sap from plants. Biting flies have razor-sharp appendages that cut through skin to draw blood for drinking, similar to the cutting mouthparts of insects that consume leaves. FIGURE 5.20 Variations on a Theme: Insect Mouthparts Differences in the morphology of insect mouthparts reflect different strategies for effectively acquiring and consuming the food types the insects prefer. MORPHOLOGICAL ADAPTATION IN BIRD BILLS Like those of insects, the mouthparts of birds\u2014that is, their bills\u2014display morphological adaptations that reflect the multitude of ways they capture, manipulate, and consume their food (FIGURE 5.21). The morphology of a bird\u2019s bill is closely associated with the taxonomic group to which the bird belongs. In other words, the flat bills of ducks and the hooked bills of raptors vary little within those groups. However, subtle differences in bill morphology among closely related species reflect slight differences in food acquisition and handling. This variation reflects adaptations that help to optimize food acquisition and minimize competition among species (see Concept 14.2). FIGURE 5.21 Variations on a Theme: Bird Bills Bird bill morphology is associated with the feeding behavior of a species and enhances the acquisition of its preferred food resources. Craig Benkman studied the relationship between differences in bill morphology among crossbills as they relate to differences in the conifer seeds they use as food (Benkman 1993, 2003). As their name indicates, crossbills have unique asymmetrical bills with crossing tips (FIGURE 5.22A). Crossbills are adept at using their bills to open the cones of coniferous trees and pull out seeds for consumption. Across their geographic range, crossbills have multiple conifer species available as potential food sources; however, the species that are most abundant vary across this range. Benkman wondered if there were differences in the bill morphologies of crossbills that were associated with the morphologies of the cones of their preferred conifer species. FIGURE 5.22 Crossbill Morphology, Food Preference, and Survival Rates (A) Red crossbill (Loxia curvirostra). (B) A three-dimensional plot of Craig Benkman\u2019s data shows the relationship between bill morphology (groove width and bill depth) and annual survival rates in five incipient crossbill species. Each incipient species shows an \u201cadaptive peak\u201d in association with the conifer species it preferentially feeds on; that is, each incipient species has higher survival rates when feeding on the conifer species its bill morphology is best suited to exploit. The cones shown are drawn to relative scale. (B after C. W. Benkman. 2003. Evolution 57: 1176\u20131181.) Benkman tested this hypothesis experimentally using captive and wild birds from five incipient species (subspecies that are in the process of becoming species) of the red crossbill species complex (Loxia curvirostra). He showed in a series of studies that a bird\u2019s speed of seed extraction from a given conifer\u2019s cone was associated with its bill depth. In addition, Benkman demonstrated that the speed of seed husking (removing the outer cover) was associated with the width of the groove in the bill where the seed is held (Benkman 1993, 2003). Each incipient crossbill species extracted and husked the seeds of one conifer species more efficiently than the seeds of other conifers. The study showed an association between the bill depth of an incipient species and the depth at which the seeds are held in the cones of its preferred conifer species. Furthermore, Benkman found that the annual survival rate for each incipient crossbill species was related to its feeding efficiency, which varied according to the conifer species it was feeding on. When he put these results together, Benkman found a series of five \u201cadaptive peaks,\u201d showing that bill morphology of each incipient species was associated with the conifer species on which it fed most efficiently and survived best (FIGURE 5.22B). Benkman (2003) concluded that red crossbills are currently undergoing evolutionary divergence (speciation; see Concept 6.4) as a result of selection associated with differences in available food resources across their range and the effects of those differences on bill morphology. Heterotrophs vary in the complexity of their digestion and assimilation As we have seen, food consumed by heterotrophs consists of a mix of complex compounds that must be chemically transformed into simpler compounds before they can be used as energy sources. Digestion breaks down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into their component amino acids, simple sugars, and fatty acids.", "The evolution of digestion and assimilation is related to improving the efficiency of energy and nutrient extraction and to meeting the specific needs of physiological functions. Insect flight, for example, has a high energy demand, and some insects must maintain fat storage bodies to supply the energy required for initiation of flight. Humans require carbohydrates to fuel brain activity, which explains why a low blood sugar level can lead to poor cognitive ability. Thus, digestion and absorption of food are important steps in the energy acquisition and functioning of heterotrophs. The evolution of feeding in heterotrophic protists and animals has led to increasing complexity in the ingestion, digestion, and absorption of food. Small protozoans such as amoebas and ciliates ingest food particles into their cells, where the food is digested in special organelles. With the advent of multicellular animals, specialized tissues for absorption, digestion, transport, and excretion evolved, and the efficiency of energy assimilation increased. Digestive systems evolved from simple chambers with a single input and output port, such as those in hydroid animals, to a tube with an input port (mouth) and an output port (anus). Further advancements included chambers specializing in specific digestive steps (e.g., stomachs) and absorption (e.g., intestines). Mechanisms evolved for breaking food down into smaller bits to increase the surface area exposed to digestion, including gizzards (which contain small rocks for grinding food) in earthworms and birds and molar teeth in mammals. As you might guess from the discussion of food chemistry above, the diet of an animal can influence its digestive adaptations. For example, herbivores consume a food source\u2014plants\u2014that contains a large amount of fiber and small amounts of carbohydrates and proteins. To cope with this poor-quality diet, most herbivores have digestive tracts that are longer than those of carnivores, which increases food processing time and increases the surface area for absorbing energy (FIGURE 5.23). In order to further increase the exposure of food to the digestive tract, some herbivores, including many small vertebrate herbivores such as rabbits, reingest their feces (a strategy called coprophagy). Young animals may also ingest the feces of older animals. While this feeding strategy might seem disgusting to humans, it enhances the efficiency of digestion and absorption of poor-quality food, and it also helps to maintain a healthy colony of beneficial microorganisms in the animal\u2019s gut. Coprophagy generally does not seem to enhance the digestion of fiber in food, but instead is more important for capturing vitamins and nutrients (Karasov and Martinez del Rio 2007). FIGURE 5.23 Herbivores Have Long Digestive Systems Compared with omnivorous humans, herbivorous primates such as the orangutan have longer digestive systems. The greater volume and absorptive area of herbivore digestive tracts serve to enhance energy absorption from poor-quality food. (After O. M. Wrong et al. 1981. The Large Intestine: Its Role in Mammalian Nutrition and Homeostasis. Halsted: New York.) Some herbivores have bacterial symbionts that greatly enhance the efficiency of digestion. Most animal digestive tracts are inhabited by archaea, bacteria, fungi, and even some protists, although the roles of many of these organisms in helping or hurting their hosts are unknown. For some animals, this relationship between the herbivore and its gut biota is clear: both benefit from the relationship. Ruminants, which include cattle and giraffes, have a specialized stomach compartment (the rumen) in which large populations of bacteria facilitate the chemical breakdown of cellulose into simple sugars. The rumen acts like a fermentation chamber, providing environmental conditions that favor the growth of these beneficial bacteria. Material from the rumen is eventually passed into another stomach chamber, which absorbs not only the compounds released from digested plant matter, but also the compounds released from the bacteria that accompany the mass of digested food. Ruminants also exhibit rumination, or cud chewing, which is the regurgitation of material from a forestomach for additional chewing. Rumination allows these animals to \u201ceat on the run,\u201d consuming large amounts of plant material in a short time and thereby minimizing their exposure to predators that might consume them. They can then more thoroughly chew and digest their food at a later time when the threat of being eaten is lower. We\u2019ve seen several examples of digestive adaptations to different food types. Can organisms acclimatize to eating different foods? The answer for some animals is yes. Organisms that consume a diverse diet of both plants and animals (omnivores) can adjust their digestive morphologies and produce different enzymes as needed to enhance digestion of their food.", "For example, warblers in the genus Setophaga make seasonal migrations that are associated with changes in their diet. The birds spend their breeding season (May\u2013 September) in forests of North America, eating mostly insects, and the rest of the year in Central America, consuming fruit and nectar. An experiment with captive warblers, including the pine warbler (Setophaga pinus), showed that their diets influenced the efficiency of fat assimilation. Compared with birds raised on diets of insects and fruit (which have a moderate and a low fat content, respectively), birds raised on seeds (which have a high fat content) showed the greatest ability to take up fats from their food due to longer food retention times in the gut and production of higher amounts of fat-degrading enzymes (FIGURE 5.24) (Karasov and Martinez del Rio 2007). This ability to acclimatize to different food sources allows omnivores such as warblers to select the best food source available at any given time. We\u2019ll discuss other aspects of diet flexibility and specialization in Concept 12.1. FIGURE 5.24 Adjustment of Digestion Efficiency with a Changing Diet Migrating warblers consume different diets in different parts of their ranges. To investigate the influence of fat content in the diet on their efficiency of fat absorption, researchers fed captive birds diets that were high (seed), medium (insect), or low (fruit) in fat, then measured the efficiency of fat absorption (the proportion of the fat in the diet taken up by the birds). The increase in the efficiency of fat absorption that accompanied a high-fat diet (A) was associated with longer food retention times (B) and greater production of a fat-degrading enzyme (lipase) by the pancreas (C).

Self-Assessment 5.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Toolmaking Crows We\u2019ve seen that foraging animals often display behavioral as well as morphological and biochemical specializations that increase their efficiency in harvesting and digesting food. The specialized bill of crossbills is a morphological adaptation that improves their feeding efficiency. Warblers are able to adjust their digestive efficiencies to match their food source. Does tool use by crows enhance their ability to gain energy by allowing them to obtain food more efficiently or obtain food of higher quality? New Caledonian crows are omnivores with a wide variety of food sources to select from, including vertebrate and invertebrate prey, plants, and dead animals (carrion). As we discussed earlier, the benefit a foraging animal gets from its food is determined by the effort it invests in finding and obtaining the food, the chemistry of the food, and the ability of the animal to digest and absorb it. There is a cost to tool use: collecting materials and fashioning the tools can be time-consuming, and young crows may not initially be adept at using them. Evaluating the benefit of tool use to the crows requires knowledge of their energy requirements, the energetic benefits of their potential food sources, and the crows\u2019 actual diet. The crows\u2019 shy nature and their tropical forest habitat make observational studies difficult. To evaluate the energetic benefit of toolmaking and tool use, Christian Rutz and colleagues (2010) used stable isotope measurements (see Ecological Toolkit 5.1) to evaluate what the birds were eating and then used measurements of the lipid content of their potential food sources to estimate the energetic benefits of each. They also estimated the energy demands of the crows. Initial observations suggested that the birds relied on two high-quality food items, both of which had a lipid content of about 40%: nuts from candlenut trees, which the crows crack open by dropping them onto rocks; and beetle larvae, which these birds obtain by using tools. Stable isotope measurements of N and C in the crows\u2019 blood and feathers and in their potential food sources indicated that they used a variety of food resources (FIGURE 5.25A) but that over 80% of their lipid intake was coming from the nuts and larvae (FIGURE 5.25B). This result indicates that a large proportion of the crows\u2019 energetic demand is met using two behaviors: tool use and nut cracking. FIGURE 5.25 Diet Selection and Energy Gain by New Caledonian Crows (A)", "Each of the different food items available to the crows has a unique combination of C and N stable isotopes. Knowing the isotopic composition of the potential food sources provides a tool to estimate what proportion of an individual crow\u2019s diet comes from each item. (B) Estimated contributions of the food items to dietary lipid intake based on the isotopic composition of crow blood and feathers. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After C. Rutz et al. 2010. Science 329: 1523\u20131526.) To address whether tool-aided beetle larva extraction alone could meet the energetic demand of the crows, Rutz and his colleagues determined the minimum number of beetle larvae needed on a daily basis to sustain a crow of average weight. They found that only three larvae per day were needed, because of their high lipid content. Observations indicated that most adult crows can easily obtain three larvae per day; one competent adult crow was able to extract 15 larvae in 80 minutes. Tool use clearly provides a substantial benefit to the New Caledonian crows, giving them access to a high-quality food item that would otherwise not be available to them, or would at least require a very high investment of energy to obtain. CONNECTIONS in NATURE TOOL USE: ADAPTATION OR LEARNED BEHAVIOR? How widespread is tool use among birds and other nonprimate animals? Many anecdotes of toolmaking and other innovative foraging techniques have been reported, but few have been examined thoroughly. The orange-winged sittella (Daphoenositta chrysoptera) of Australia uses sticks to forage for insect larvae, much like the New Caledonian crows. Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) crack open ostrich eggs using rocks. There are additional reports of tool use by insects, mammals, and other bird species (Beck 1980). The multitude of reports involving a wide range of animal species thoroughly dispels the notion of human monopoly on tool use. But how do these tool-using skills develop? Are these behaviors learned from other animals, or are they innate (i.e., determined genetically)? Several studies indicate that both learning and genetic inheritance can influence the development of tool use in animals. As we learned above, tool use has a clear energetic benefit for New Caledonian crows, but does that benefit exert strong enough selection pressure to have resulted in a behavioral adaptation\u2014are the birds inheriting the ability to use tools? To address this question, Ben Kenward and colleagues reared New Caledonian crows in captivity, without exposure to adult birds. Some of the birds received \u201ctutoring\u201d in toolmaking and tool use by human foster parents, while a control group did not (Kenward et al. 2005). To evaluate the birds\u2019 toolmaking abilities, the researchers placed supplemental food in tight crevices in the birds\u2019 aviaries, where it was not accessible to the birds without the assistance of tools. Twigs and leaves were also left in their aviaries. The captive crows developed the ability to make and use tools to retrieve the food in the crevices, whether they had been tutored or not (FIGURE 5.26). Kenward and colleagues concluded that the ability of New Caledonian crows to manufacture tools is at least partly inherited, rather than an acquired skill learned from adult birds in the wild. Very similar results were reported for experiments with captive woodpecker finches, birds endemic to the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago that use twigs and cactus spines to forage for arthropods (Tebbich et al. 2001). Additional evidence that toolmaking is part of the genetic makeup of New Caledonian crows comes from an evaluation of their bill morphology, which has unique structural features consistent with tool manufacture and use as a selective force in its design (Matsui et al. 2016). FIGURE 5.26 Untutored Tool Use in Captive Crows A captive New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides) uses a stick tool to retrieve food from artificial crevices in a laboratory setting, despite never having been exposed to tool use, either by humans or by other birds. An additional twist to the crow toolmaking story is the apparent variation in tool styles among different crow populations on New Caledonia. In other words, there appears to be the potential for technological evolution in the styles of tools manufactured by crows. Gavin Hunt and Russell Gray conducted a survey of 21 sites on New Caledonia and examined 5,550 different cutting tools constructed by crows from Pandanus leaves (see Figure 5.2C) (Hunt and Gray 2003). They found three distinct widths of tools: wide, narrow, and stepped.", "Most of the tools found at a given site were very similar, and the geographic ranges of the tool types showed little overlap. There were no apparent correlations between where a tool type was found and local ecological factors such as forest structure or climate. Hunt and Gray suggested that the three tool designs were derived from a single original tool (of the wide type) subjected to additional modifications, including additional stripping of leaf material. Their study suggests ongoing innovation in toolmaking by the New Caledonian crows. This crow engineering challenges our traditional view of technological advancement in nonhuman animals. Learned behavior is also important for toolmaking in some species. A notable example comes from studies of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia. Researchers observed that some dolphins swim with sponges plucked from the ocean floor on their noses (technically, their rostra) (FIGURE 5.27). The sponges appear to protect the sensitive rostra from sharp objects and stinging animals such as stonefish as the dolphins probe the seafloor for fish. The group of dolphins displaying this innovation is part of a larger group under study. The researchers\u2019 knowledge of the genetics and family structure of these dolphins allowed them to address the question of whether this unique behavior is learned or inherited. Michael Krzen and colleagues found that the majority of \u201csponging\u201d dolphins were female. They reasoned that a single sex-linked gene (the kind of genetic basis one might expect for a trait occurring in only one sex) was a highly unlikely cause for a complex trait such as sponging. A comparison of the genetic fingerprints of individuals that sponged with those of nonsponging dolphins indicated that most of the sponging occurred within a single family line (Krzen et al. 2005). The combination of these results led Krzen and colleagues to conclude that sponging was a learned behavior passed from mother to daughter. This finding supports the idea of a cultural phenomenon in animals that influences the efficiency of their feeding behavior and challenges the notion that cultural learning is unique to humans. FIGURE 5.27 Dolphin Nose Gear in Shark Bay, Australia A bottlenose dolphin wears a sponge to protect its rostrum while foraging on the seafloor.

Trophy Hunting and Inadvertent Evolution: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are magnificent animals, beautifully suited for life in the rugged mountains in which they are found. Despite their substantial size (males can weigh up to 127 kg, or 280 pounds), these sheep can balance on narrow ledges and can leap 6 m (20 feet) from one ledge to another. Bighorn sheep are also noted for the male\u2019s large curl of horns, which are used in combat over females (FIGURE 6.1). Rams run at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour and crash their heads into each other, battling over the right to mate with a female. FIGURE 6.1 Fighting over the Right to Mate Two bighorn rams butt heads to establish dominance and mating rights. Large horns are beneficial to a ram's success with this dominance ritual. Ram horns have been collected as trophies for many centuries without drastically affecting sheep populations. Over the last 200 years, however, human actions such as habitat encroachment, hunting, and the introduction of domesticated cattle have reduced populations of bighorn sheep by 90%. As a result, the hunting of bighorn sheep has been restricted throughout North America. These restrictions make a world-class trophy ram (one with a large, full curl of horns) extremely valuable: permits to shoot one of these rams, which are sold at auction, can cost over $100,000. Although funds raised by the auction of hunting permits are used to preserve bighorn sheep habitat, scientists have expressed concern that trophy hunting is having negative effects on today\u2019s small populations of bighorn sheep.", "Trophy hunting removes the largest and strongest males: in a population from which about 10% of the males were removed by hunting each year, both the average size of males and the average size of their horns decreased over a 30-year period (FIGURE 6.2). Large and strong males are preferred by females and tend to sire more offspring than other males, so killing the largest and strongest males can make it harder for small populations to recover in abundance. FIGURE 6.2 Trophy Hunting Decreases Ram Body and Horn Size Coltman and colleagues tracked the body weights (A) and horn lengths (B) of rams in a bighorn sheep population on Ram Mountain (Alberta, Canada) that was subjected to trophy hunting over a 30-year period. The changes in horn length occurred across multiple generations of sheep and thus indicate a change in the average characteristics of the sheep born from one generation to the next. (After D. W. Coltman et al. 2003. Nature 426: 656\u2013658.) Hunting, fishing, and other forms of harvest have affected a wide range of other species, including fishes, invertebrates, and plants (Darimont et al. 2009). For example, by targeting older and larger fish, commercial fishing for cod has led to a reduction in the age and size at which these fish become sexually mature. To see why this happens, first note that cod that mature at a younger age and smaller size are more likely to reproduce before they are caught than are fish that mature when they are older and larger. As a result, the genes of fish that mature at a younger age and smaller size are more likely to be passed on to the next generation than are the genes of other fish\u2014hence, we would predict that over time, more and more fish will have genes that encode sexual maturity at a younger age and smaller size. Indeed, in experimental populations of guppies in which small or large individuals were selectively removed for harvest, van Wijk et al. (2013) documented such genetic changes in genes known to affect body size. Similarly, poaching for ivory appears to have resulted in genetic changes that have caused the proportion of female African elephants in a South African park that lack tusks to increase from 62% to 90% over a 20-year period. The unintended effects of human harvesting on bighorn sheep, cod, and elephants illustrate how populations can change, or evolve, over time. What biological mechanisms cause these evolutionary changes? Do human actions other than harvesting produce evolutionary change? View the script for the video Introduction As news reports often emphasize, humans have a large effect on the environment. We change the global climate, pollute the water and air, convert large tracts of natural habitat into farmland and urban areas, drain wetlands, and reduce the population sizes of species we hunt for food (e.g., fishes) or use as resources (e.g., trees). Although we have taken steps to limit some of the damage we cause to biological communities, human actions have consequences that we have barely begun to recognize, much less address: we cause evolutionary change. In this chapter, we\u2019ll examine what evolution is, and we\u2019ll see how it affects ecological interactions and is affected by them. At the close of the chapter, we\u2019ll focus specifically on how humans cause evolutionary change. Our goal in this chapter is not to provide a comprehensive survey of evolutionary biology\u2014for that, see the textbooks on evolution listed in the Suggested Readings on the book\u2019s website. Instead, our aim is to show that ecology and evolution are interconnected, a theme to which we will return in later chapters of this book. We\u2019ll begin by considering two ways in which evolution can be defined. CONCEPT 6.1 Evolution can be viewed as genetic change over time or as a process of descent with modification. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 6.1.1 Summarize the genetic basis for the evolution of traits in organisms. 6.1.2 Explain how evolution can be considered the accumulation of trait differences between populations. What Is Evolution? In the most general sense, biological evolution is change in organisms over time. Evolution includes the relatively small fluctuations that occur continually within populations, as when the genetic makeup of a population changes from one year to the next. But evolution can also refer to the larger changes that occur as species gradually become increasingly different from their ancestors.", "Let\u2019s explore these two ways of looking at evolution in more detail, focusing first on genetic changes (allele frequency change) and then on how organisms accumulate differences from their ancestors (descent with modification). Evolution is allele frequency change Figure 6.2B shows that the average horn size of male bighorn sheep has decreased over time, but it does not reveal the cause of that decline. A clue to the cause comes from an additional observation (Coltman et al. 2003): horn size is an inherited trait. This means that rams with large horns tend to have offspring that have large horns and that rams with small horns tend to have offspring that have small horns. Because trophy hunting selectively eliminates rams with large horns, it favors rams whose genetic characteristics lead to the production of small horns. Hence, it seems likely that trophy hunting is causing the genetic characteristics of the bighorn sheep population to change, or evolve, over time\u2014a conclusion supported in a recent analysis of data from a bighorn sheep population subjected to intense hunting for 23 years (Pigeon et al. 2016). As suggested by the trophy-hunting example, biologists often define evolution in terms of genetic change. To make such a definition more precise (and to introduce terms that will be used throughout this chapter), let\u2019s review some principles from introductory biology: Genes are composed of DNA, and they specify how to build (encode) proteins. A given gene can have two or more forms (known as alleles) that result in the production of different versions of the protein that the gene encodes. We can designate the genotype (genetic makeup) of an individual with letters that represent the individual\u2019s two copies of each gene (one inherited from its mother, the other from its father). For example, if a gene has two alleles, designated A and a, the individual could be of genotype AA, Aa, or aa. With these principles as background, we can define evolution as change over time in the frequencies (proportions) of different alleles in a population. To illustrate how this definition is applied, consider a population of 1,000 individuals and a gene with two alleles (A and a). Suppose there are 360 individuals of genotype AA, 480 of genotype Aa, and 160 of genotype aa. The frequency of the a allele in this population is 0.4, or 40%;1 hence, since there are only two alleles in the population (A and a), the frequency of the A allele must be 1 \u2013 0.4 = 0.6, or 60%. If the frequency of the a allele were to change over time, say, from 40% to 71%, then the population would have evolved at that gene. (In scientific studies, researchers often use an approach based on the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equation to test whether a population is evolving at one or more genes; we describe this approach in WEB EXTENSION 6.1.) Evolution is descent with modification In many parts of this book, when we refer to evolution, we will be referring to allele frequency change over time. But evolution can also be defined more broadly as descent with modification. At the heart of this definition is the observation that populations accumulate differences over time, and hence, when a new species forms, it differs from its ancestors. However, although a new species differs from its ancestors in some ways, it also resembles its ancestors and continues to share many characteristics with them. Hence, when evolution occurs, both descent (shared ancestry, resulting in shared characteristics) and modification (the accumulation of differences) can be observed, as seen in the fossil fish in FIGURE 6.3. FIGURE 6.3 Descent with Modification Michael Bell and colleagues have analyzed thousands of 10-million-year old fossils of the stickleback fish Gasterosteus doryssus. Their specimens are unique in that the lake bed in which they were found is so finely layered that the ages of the fossils can be determined to the nearest 250-year interval. (A) Representative G. doryssus fossils, showing how the pelvic bone became reduced over time; the scale bar for each fossil is 1 cm. (B) The average pelvic score at different times. Fossil pelvic bones were scored by size according to a scale that ranged from 3 (complete bone) to 0 (no bone). (B after M. A. Bell et al. 2006. Paleobiology 32: 562\u2013577.) Charles Darwin (1859) used the phrase \u201cdescent with modification\u201d to summarize the evolutionary process in his book The Origin of Species.", "Darwin proposed that populations accumulate differences over time primarily by natural selection, the process by which individuals with certain genetically determined characteristics survive and reproduce more successfully than other individuals because of those characteristics. We\u2019ve already seen several examples of selection at work in this chapter\u2019s Case Study. In bighorn sheep populations, trophy hunting has selected for rams with small horns, while in the cod fishery, harvesting practices have selected for individuals that mature at a younger age and a smaller size. How can natural selection explain the accumulation of differences between populations? Darwin argued that if two populations experience different environmental conditions, individuals with one set of characteristics may be favored by natural selection in one population, while individuals with a different set of characteristics may be favored in the other population (FIGURE 6.4). By favoring individuals with different heritable characteristics in different populations, natural selection can cause populations to diverge genetically from one another over time; that is, each population will accumulate more and more genetic differences. Thus, natural selection can be responsible for the modification part of \u201cdescent with modification.\u201d FIGURE 6.4 Natural Selection Can Result in Differences between Populations Populations of rock pocket mice (Chaetodipus intermedius) that live on dark lava formations in Arizona and New Mexico have dark coats, while nearby populations that live on light-colored rocks have light coats. In each population, natural selection has favored individuals whose coat colors match their surroundings, making them less visible to predators. Populations evolve, individuals do not Natural selection acts as a sorting process, favoring individuals with some heritable traits (e.g., bighorns with small horns) over others (e.g., bighorns with large horns). Individuals with the favored traits tend to leave more offspring than do individuals with other traits. As a result, from one generation to the next, a greater proportion of the individuals in the population will have the traits favored by natural selection. When these traits have a genetic basis, this process can cause the allele frequencies of the population to change over time, thereby causing the population to evolve. But the individuals in the population do not evolve\u2014either they have the traits favored by selection or they don\u2019t. Self-Assessment 6.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 6.2 Natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow can cause allele frequencies in a population to change over time. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 6.2.1 Summarize how mutations contribute to the process of evolution. 6.2.2 Compare the effects of stabilizing selection and disruptive selection on the temporal changes in the genetic structure of a population. 6.2.3 Evaluate how random events can affect populations through time via genetic drift. 6.2.4 Describe the role of gene flow among populations in terms of homogenizing genetic structure as well as enhancing evolutionary change. Mechanisms of Evolution Although natural selection is often the cause of evolutionary change, it is not the only one. In this section, we\u2019ll examine four key processes that influence evolution: mutation, natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. In general, mutation is the source of the new alleles on which all of evolution depends, while natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow are the main mechanisms that cause allele frequencies to change over time. Mutation generates the raw material for evolution Individuals in populations may differ from one another in their phenotype, the observable characteristics of an organism, such as size or color (FIGURE 6.5). Many aspects of an organism\u2019s phenotype, including its physical features, metabolism, growth rate, susceptibility to disease, and behavior, are influenced by its genes. As a result, individuals differ from one another, in part because they have different alleles of genes that influence their phenotype. These different alleles arise by mutation, a change in the DNA of a gene. Mutations result from events such as copying errors during cell division, mechanical damage when molecules and cell structures collide with DNA, exposure to certain chemicals (called mutagens), and exposure to high-energy forms of radiation such as ultraviolet light and X rays. As we\u2019ll see in Concept 7.1, the environment can also affect an organism\u2019s phenotype. For example, a plant growing in nutrient-rich soil may grow larger than another individual of the same species growing in nutrient-poor soil, even if both have the same alleles of genes that influence size. In this chapter, however, we will focus on phenotypic differences that result from genetic, not environmental, factors.", "FIGURE 6.5 Individuals in Populations Differ in Their Phenotypes Poison dart frogs (Dendrobates tinctorius) show great variation in color and pattern. Native to northern South America, these frogs live in isolated patches of forest. Their bright colors are thought to serve as a warning to predators of a poison excreted from their skin. Individual frogs likely also differ in other morphological traits as well as in biochemical, behavioral, and physiological traits. The formation of new alleles by mutation is critical to evolution. In a hypothetical species in which there was no mutation, each gene would have only one allele, and all members of a population would be genetically identical. If this were the case, evolution could not occur: allele frequencies cannot possibly change over time unless the individuals in a population differ genetically. You may recall from your introductory biology class that the individuals in a population can differ genetically not only because of mutation, but also because of recombination, the production of offspring that have combinations of alleles that differ from those in either of their parents. We can think of mutation as providing the raw material (new alleles) on which evolution is based, and recombination as rearranging that raw material into unique new combinations. Together, these processes provide the genetic variation among individuals that is required for evolution to occur. Despite its importance to evolution, mutation usually occurs too rarely in most cases to be the direct cause of significant allele frequency change over short periods of time. Mutations typically occur at rates of \u20134 \u20136 10 to 10 new mutations per gene per generation (Hartl and Clark 2007). In other words, in each generation, we can expect one mutation to occur in every 10,000 to 1,000,000 copies of a gene. At these rates, in one generation, mutation acting alone causes virtually no change in the allele frequencies of a population. Eventually, mutation can cause appreciable allele frequency change, but typically it takes thousands of generations for it to do so. Overall, in terms of its direct effects, the background mutation rate is a weak agent of allele frequency change. But because it provides new alleles on which natural selection and other mechanisms of evolution can act, mutation is central to the evolutionary process. It should be noted, however, that some environmental factors, such as exposure to high-energy radiation (e.g., radioactivity or X rays) and some mutagenic chemicals, can greatly increase mutation rates. The evolution of antibiotic resistance is an example where mutation rates are frequent enough to influence allele frequencies in a population. There are around 40 trillion (4 \u00d7 1013) bacterial cells in a human body, consisting of around 500 distinct species. Given the mutation rate described above, we could expect an appreciable number of alleles to appear in a population in each generation. The majority of these mutations are deleterious\u2014that is, they lower growth and reproduction of the bacteria. However, some alleles confer greater resistance to antibiotics applied to kill them. As a result, the efficacy of antibiotics is potentially compromised, particularly with regular application, which enhances the potential for natural selection to favor the allele conferring resistance. Natural selection increases the frequencies of advantageous alleles and decreases the frequencies of deleterious alleles Natural selection occurs when individuals with particular heritable traits consistently leave more offspring than do individuals with other heritable traits. But some traits may give organisms an advantage only under certain environmental conditions. Indeed, as we\u2019ll see later in this chapter, traits that are advantageous in one environment can be disadvantageous in another. Depending on what traits are favored, we can categorize natural selection into three types (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 6.6). Directional selection occurs when individuals with one extreme of a heritable phenotypic trait (e.g., large size) are favored over other individuals (small and medium-sized individuals). In stabilizing selection, individuals with an intermediate phenotype (e.g., medium-sized individuals) are favored, while in disruptive selection, individuals with a phenotype at either extreme are favored (e.g., small and large individuals have an advantage over medium-sized individuals). However, in all three types of natural selection, the fundamental process is the same: some individuals have heritable phenotypes that give them an advantage in survival or reproduction, causing them to leave more offspring than other individuals. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 6.6 Three Types of Natural Selection (A) Directional selection favors individuals at one phenotypic extreme. A prolonged drought in the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago resulted in directional selection on the beak size of the seed-eating medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis).", "As a result of the drought, most of the available seeds were large and hard to crack, so birds with large beaks, which could more easily crack those seeds, had an advantage over birds with smaller beaks. (B) Stabilizing selection favors individuals with an intermediate phenotype. Eurosta flies parasitize goldenrod plants, causing the plant to produce a gall in which the fly larva matures as it feeds on the plant. The preferences of Eurosta\u2019s own predators and parasites result in stabilizing selection on gall size. Field observations showed that wasps that parasitize and kill the fly larvae prefer small galls, while birds that eat the fly larvae prefer large galls. As a result, larvae in galls of intermediate size have an advantage. (C) Disruptive selection favors individuals at both extremes. African seedcrackers (Pyrenestes ostrinus) depend on two major food plants in their environment. Birds with smaller mandible sizes can feed on one plant\u2019s soft seeds most efficiently, while birds with larger mandibles can feed on the other plant\u2019s hard seeds most efficiently. Thus, individuals with mandible sizes that are either relatively small or relatively large have an advantage. (A after B. R. Grant and P. R. Grant. 2003. BioScience 53: 965\u2013975; B after A. E. Weis and W. G. Abrahamson. 1986. Am Nat 127: 681\u2013695; C after T. B. Smith. 1993. Nature 363: 618\u2013620.) In (B), do birds or wasps appear to provide stronger selection pressure on gall size? Explain. When selection favors a particular phenotype, individuals with alleles that encode that phenotype are likely to leave more offspring than are individuals with other alleles. As a result, alleles that encode a favored phenotype can increase in frequency from one generation to the next. In some cases, the end result of this process is that most or all of the individuals in a population have an allele that encodes a trait favored by selection. A well-studied example is the Andean goose (Chloephaga melanoptera), which lives at high elevations. These birds have evolved a version of the oxygen transport protein hemoglobin that has an unusually high affinity for oxygen and hence provides an advantage in their low-oxygen, high-altitude environment (Weber 2007; McCracken et al. 2009). The allele that encodes this version of hemoglobin occurs at a frequency of 100% in Andean goose populations. An allele such as this that occurs in a population at a frequency of 100% is said to have reached fixation. To recap, natural selection can cause the frequency of an allele that confers an advantage to increase over time, as has occurred in populations of the Andean goose. We\u2019ll consider the consequences of such increases in the frequencies of advantageous alleles later in this chapter. But first, we\u2019ll look at two other mechanisms that can cause allele frequencies to change: genetic drift and gene flow. Genetic drift results from random events Allele frequencies in populations can be influenced by random events. Imagine a population of ten plants in which three individuals have genotype AA, four have genotype Aa, and three have genotype aa. Thus, the initial frequency of the A allele is 50%, as is the frequency of the a allele. Assume that the A and a alleles encode two different versions of a protein that function equally well. Although neither allele is more advantageous than the other (and hence natural selection does not affect this gene), random events could alter their frequencies. For example, suppose that a moose walking through the woods happened to step on four of the wildflowers (two of genotype AA and two of genotype Aa), killing them, but not harming any of the three plants of genotype aa. As a result, the frequency of the a allele in the population would increase from 50% to 67% due to a random event. When random events affect which alleles are passed from one generation to the next, genetic drift is said to occur. Although random events occur in populations of all sizes, the effects of genetic drift on allele frequency changes is greater in small populations than in large ones. To see why, imagine that our plant population had 10,000 individuals, 3,000 of genotype AA, 4,000 of genotype Aa, and 3,000 of genotype aa. If (as before) a moose stepped on a random sample of 40% of the individuals in this larger population, there is virtually no possibility that all of the 3,000 individuals of genotype aa would be spared.", "Instead, it is likely that many individuals of each genotype would be killed and, hence, that the frequencies of the A and a alleles would change little, if at all. Genetic drift has four related effects on evolution, the strength of which is larger in small populations: 1. Because it acts by chance alone, genetic drift can cause allele frequencies to fluctuate randomly over time in small populations (FIGURE 6.7). When this occurs, eventually some alleles disappear from small populations experiencing genetic drift, while others reach fixation. FIGURE 6.7 Genetic Drift Causes Allele Frequencies to Fluctuate at Random Results of a computer simulation of genetic drift in 20 populations for a gene with two alleles, A and a. Each population has nine diploid individuals (18 alleles) each generation. In small populations such as these, genetic drift has rapid effects. (After D. Hartl and A. Clark. 1989. Principles of Population Genetics, 2nd ed. Oxford University Press/Sinauer: Sunderland, MA.) At the start of the simulation, how many A alleles and how many a alleles did each population have? At generation 20, how many populations still had both alleles? Predict what would eventually happen to the frequency of the A allele in those populations. 2. By causing alleles to be lost from a population, genetic drift reduces the genetic variation of the population, making the individuals within the population more similar genetically to one another. 3. Genetic drift can increase the frequency of a harmful allele. This may seem counterintuitive because in general, genetic drift acts on alleles that neither harm nor benefit the organism, and we would expect natural selection to reduce the frequency of a harmful allele. However, if the population size is very small and the allele has only slightly deleterious effects, genetic drift can \u201coverrule\u201d the effects of natural selection, causing the harmful allele to increase or decrease in frequency randomly. 4. Genetic drift can increase genetic differences between populations because random events may cause an allele to reach fixation in one population yet be lost from another population (see Figure 6.7). The second and third of these effects can have dire consequences for small populations. A loss of genetic variation can reduce the capacity of a population to evolve in response to changing environmental conditions, potentially placing it at risk of extinction. Likewise, an increase in the frequency of harmful alleles in a population can hinder the ability of its members to survive or reproduce, again increasing the risk of extinction. This effect presents an ongoing problem for small populations. Although mutation is unlikely to produce harmful alleles of any particular gene from one generation to the next (because mutations are rare), it is highly likely to produce new deleterious alleles in some of an organism\u2019s many genes\u2014and genetic drift can cause those alleles to increase in frequency. Such negative effects of genetic drift are thought to have contributed to the near extinction of the Illinois populations of the greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido). In the early 1800s, there were millions of these birds in Illinois. Over time, their numbers plummeted as more than 99% of the prairie habitat on which they depend was converted to farmland and other uses. By 1993, fewer than 50 greater prairie chickens remained in Illinois. By comparing the DNA of birds in the 1993 Illinois population with that of birds that lived in Illinois in the 1930s (obtained from museum specimens), Juan Bouzat and colleagues (1998) showed that the drop in population size had reduced the genetic variation of the population (FIGURE 6.8). In addition, more than 50% of the eggs laid by birds in the 1993 Illinois population failed to hatch, suggesting that genetic drift had led to the fixation of harmful alleles. This interpretation was strengthened by the results of experiments begun in 1992: when greater prairie chickens from other populations were brought to Illinois, new alleles entered the Illinois population, and egg-hatching rates increased from less than 50% to more than 90% in just 5 years (Westemeier et al. 1998). Unfortunately, genetic diversity in the populations of prairie chickens has declined. The genetic diversity of the population has declined back to the pre-introduction levels and is a cause of concern for the conservation of those species that fall within the former range (Mussmann et al. 2017). (Concept 11.3 covers the increased risk of extinction borne by small populations in greater detail.)", "FIGURE 6.8 Harmful Effects of Genetic Drift (A) As a result of habitat loss, the Illinois population of greater prairie chickens dropped from millions of birds in the 1800s to 25,000 in 1933 and, finally, to fewer than 50 birds in 1993. (B) As the Illinois population shrank in size, genetic drift led to a loss of alleles and to a rise in the frequencies of harmful alleles, thereby reducing egg-hatching rates. The table compares the 1993 Illinois populations with historical populations in Illinois and with populations in Kansas, Nebraska, and Minnesota, none of which experienced as severe a drop in population size. (After J. L. Bouzat et al. 1998. Am Nat 152: 1\u20136; R. C. Anderson. 1970. Trans Illinois State Acad Sci 63: 214. CC BYNC-SA 4.0.) Gene flow is the transfer of alleles between populations Gene flow occurs when alleles are transferred from one population to another via the movement of individuals or gametes (e.g., plant pollen). Gene flow has two important effects. First, by transferring alleles between populations, it tends to make populations more similar to one another genetically. This homogenizing effect of gene flow is one reason why individuals in different populations of the same species resemble one another: alleles are exchanged often enough that relatively few differences accumulate between the populations. Second, gene flow can introduce new alleles into a population. When this occurs, gene flow acts in a manner similar to mutation (although mutation remains the original source of new alleles). This effect of gene flow can have considerable consequences for human health. For example, before the 1960s, the mosquito Culex pipiens was not resistant to organophosphate insecticides. This mosquito transmits West Nile virus and other diseases, so insecticides were often used to destroy its populations. In the late 1960s, however, new alleles that provided resistance to organophosphate insecticides were produced by mutation in a few C. pipiens populations, probably in Africa or Asia (Raymond et al. 1998). Mosquitos carrying these alleles were blown by storms or transported accidentally by humans to new locations, where they bred with mosquitos from the local populations. In populations of mosquitos exposed to insecticides, the frequency of these introduced alleles then increased rapidly because insecticide resistance was favored by natural selection (FIGURE 6.9). The global spread of these alleles by gene flow has allowed billions of mosquitos to survive the application of insecticides that otherwise would have killed them. FIGURE 6.9 Gene Flow: Introducing Alleles for Insecticide Resistance In this idealized scenario, an allele that causes resistance to organophosphate insecticides arises by mutation in one population of mosquitos and then spreads by gene flow to two other populations. If mosquitos in those two other populations are exposed to the insecticide, natural selection causes the frequency of the resistance allele to increase rapidly. Evolutionary change that results in a closer match between the traits of organisms and the conditions of their environment, such as the increase in the frequency of insecticide resistance in a mosquito population exposed to insecticides, is an example of adaptive evolution, the topic we\u2019ll consider next. Self-Assessment 6.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 6.3 Natural selection is the mechanism for adaptive evolution. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 6.3.1 Explain how natural selection can lead to adaptations in populations. 6.3.2 Evaluate the conditions in which gene flow can promote or deter adaptations. 6.3.3 Describe factors that limit the development of adaptations in populations. Adaptive Evolution The natural world is filled with striking examples of organisms that are well suited for life in their environments. This match between organisms and their environments highlights their adaptations, which are features that evolve by natural selection and improve an organism\u2019s ability to survive and reproduce in its environment (see Concept 4.1). Examples of adaptations include remarkable features like those shown in FIGURE 6.10 but also include less visually striking characteristics\u2014such as an enzyme in a desert plant that can function at high temperatures that would denature most enzymes, enabling the plant to thrive in its environment. There are literally millions of other examples of adaptations. How do these adaptations arise? FIGURE 6.10 Some Striking Adaptations (A) The extensive skin extending from the neck to the limbs and to the toes and fingers of the Sundra flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) allows this animal to glide from tree to tree in the rainforest canopies of Southeast Asia. (B)", "The thorny devil (Moloch horridus) has adapted to withstand the dry scrubland and desert of central Australia. The animal\u2019s scales are ridged so that it can absorb water by simply touching it. (C) This archerfish (Toxotes chatareus) catches a spider by shooting a jet of water into the air. Field observations show that these fish will squirt repeatedly at potential prey and that they can reliably hit targets at heights of up to eight times their body length. Adaptations are the result of natural selection Unlike genetic drift, natural selection is not a random process. Instead, when natural selection operates, individuals with certain alleles predictably have higher survival and produce more offspring than do individuals with other alleles. By consistently favoring individuals with some alleles over individuals with other alleles, natural selection causes adaptive evolution, a process of change in which traits that confer survival or reproductive advantages tend to increase in frequency over time. Although gene flow and genetic drift can improve the effectiveness of an adaptation (by increasing the frequency of an advantageous allele), they can also do the reverse (by increasing the frequency of a disadvantageous allele). Thus, natural selection is the only evolutionary mechanism that consistently results in adaptive evolution. An example of adaptive evolution is provided by changes in populations of the soapberry bug (Jadera haematoloma) (Carroll and Boyd 1992; Carroll et al. 1997). This insect uses its needle-like beak to feed on seeds located within the fruits of several different plant species. Soapberry bug populations in southern Florida feed on the seeds of the insect\u2019s native host, the balloon vine (Cardiospermum corindum). Balloon vines, however, are rare in central Florida. Thus, in that region, soapberry bugs do not feed on balloon vines, but instead feed on the seeds of a species introduced from eastern Asia, the goldenrain tree (Koelreuteria elegans). A few specimens of the goldenrain tree were brought to Florida in 1926, but it was not commonly planted until the 1950s. The oldest goldenrain trees in the central Florida populations studied by Carroll and colleagues were 35 years old, suggesting that the soapberry bugs there have fed on this species for 35 years or less. Soapberry bugs feed most efficiently when the length of a bug\u2019s beak matches the depth to which it must pierce a fruit to reach the seeds. Since goldenrain tree fruits are smaller than balloon vine fruits, the introduction of the goldenrain tree 35 years ago can be viewed as a natural experiment on the effect of selection on the insect\u2019s beak length. Carroll and Boyd predicted that as a result of natural selection, beak lengths would evolve to be shorter in soapberry bug populations that fed on goldenrain tree fruits than in populations that fed on the native host, balloon vines. Carroll and Boyd also studied soapberry bugs in Oklahoma and Louisiana, where the insect had begun to feed on several other new host plants that had been introduced within the past 100 years. However, in Oklahoma and Louisiana, the fruits of the introduced hosts were larger than those of the native hosts, leading to the prediction that in those two states, the beaks of insects that ate the introduced species would be longer than those of insects that ate the native species. In all three locations, Carroll and Boyd found that soapberry bug beak lengths evolved in the direction predicted by fruit size, decreasing in central Florida (FIGURE 6.11) and increasing in both Oklahoma and Louisiana. The changes in beak length were substantial: compared with historical values, average beak lengths dropped by 26% in central Florida and increased by 8% (on one introduced host species) and 17% (on another introduced host species) in Oklahoma and Louisiana. In addition, Carroll et al. (1997) showed that beak length is a heritable characteristic, so the observed changes in beak length must have been due at least in part to changes in the frequencies of alleles that affect beak length. Thus, we can conclude that in a relatively short time (35\u2013100 years, or approximately 35\u2013200 generations), natural selection in soapberry bug populations caused adaptive evolution in which a characteristic of the organism (beak length) evolved to match an aspect of its environment (fruit size) more closely. FIGURE 6.11 Adaptive Evolution in Soapberry Bugs Soapberry bug populations in southern Florida feed on the seeds of their native host, the balloon vine (A), while soapberry bug populations in central Florida feed on the seeds of an introduced plant, the goldenrain tree (B).", "The beak lengths of insects feeding on the goldenrain tree decreased by 26% in 35 years, providing a better match to the smaller fruits of this introduced plant. Red arrows indicate beak length historical averages (obtained from museum specimens collected before the introduction of goldenrain trees). (After S. P. Carroll and C. Boyd. 1992. Evolution 46: 1052\u20131069.) Adaptive evolution can occur rapidly Soapberry bugs are not unique: studies on populations of a wide range of other organisms show that natural selection can lead to rapid increases in the frequency of advantageous traits. Examples include the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance in bacteria (in days to months); increased insecticide resistance in insects (in months to years); drabber coloration in guppies, which makes them harder for visually hunting predators to find (several years); and increased beak size in medium ground finches (several years; see Interactive Figure 6.6A). A study of anole lizards in the Turks and Caicos archipelago found that hurricanes can induce strong selection pressure for morphological traits that enhance the ability of the lizards to cling to trees (FIGURE 6.12; Donihue et al. 2018). These and many other examples of apparently rapid evolution are described by Endler (1986), Thompson (1998), and Kinnison and Hendry (2001); collectively, these studies suggest that what we think of as \u201crapid\u201d evolution may in fact be the norm, not the exception. FIGURE 6.12 Rapid Adaptive Evolution in Anole Lizards Hurricanes can be a very strong selective force for anole lizards found on small islands in the Caribbean Sea. Following two hurricanes in a two-week period, researchers found that, compared to the lizards analyzed prior to the hurricane, the surviving lizards had wider footpads and shorter legs (A), which are two genetically based traits. These traits were experimentally shown to enhance the ability of the lizards to cling to dowels resembling branches under high winds (B). CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE Rapid, apparently adaptive evolution also has been documented in response to climate change. Several such studies have focused on clines, patterns of change in a characteristic of an organism over a geographic region. For example, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene exhibits a cline in which the AdhS allele decreases in frequency as latitude increases (FIGURE 6.13A). This pattern has been found in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Previous studies indicated that this cline results from natural selection on the AdhS allele, which codes for a form of the enzyme that is more effective in warmer temperatures at lower latitudes and hence is more common there. FIGURE 6.13 Rapid Adaptive Evolution on a Continental Scale The Adh gene encodes a metabolically important enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, used to detoxify alcohol. Previous field and laboratory studies indicate that the AdhS allele of this gene is selected against in cooler environments, such as those found at high latitudes. (A) Frequencies of the AdhS allele in coastal Australian Drosophila melanogaster populations in 1979\u20131982 and in 2002\u2013 2004. (B) Regression lines calculated from the data in part A show that between 1979\u20131982 and 2002\u20132004, the cline of the AdhS allele shifted 4\u00b0 toward the South Pole as the region\u2019s average temperatures increased by 0.5\u00b0C. (After P. A. Umina et al. 2005. Science 308: 691\u2013693.) Over a 20-year period in coastal Australia, the Adh cline shifted about 4\u00b0 in latitude toward the South Pole (Umina et al. 2005), a movement of roughly 400 km (FIGURE 6.13B). During the same period, mean temperatures in the region increased by 0.5\u00b0C. Since the AdhS allele is favored at higher temperatures, the 4\u00b0 shift in latitude appears to have been a rapid, adaptive increase in the frequency of this allele in response to climate change. As we describe in WEB EXTENSION 6.2, rapid evolutionary changes that are correlated with global warming have also been observed in worldwide populations of another fruit fly species, Drosophila subobscura (Balany\u00e1 et al. 2006). Evolutionary responses to climate change over short periods have also been documented in pitcher-plant mosquitos (Bradshaw and Holzapfel 2001), red squirrels (R\u00e9ale et al. 2003), tawny owls (Karell et al. 2011), tufted knotweed (Sultan et al. 2013), and the mustard plant Brassica rapa (Franks et al. 2007). Finally, hundreds of species have altered the timing of key events in their lives in ways that may be a response to global warming, such as delaying the onset of winter dormancy or reproducing earlier in the spring (Parmesan 2006).", "In most of these cases, it is not yet known whether the observed changes are due to phenotypic plasticity (in which the same genotype can produce different phenotypes in different environments; see Concept 7.1), an evolutionary response (in which the genetic constitution of the population changes over time), or both. Recent research has begun to address this issue. For example, Jill Anderson and colleagues (2012) examined the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and evolution to changes in the flowering time of Boechera stricta, a mustard plant native to the U.S. Rocky Mountains. Data from a 38-year field survey of B. stricta populations show that the date at which flowers first came into bloom was about 13 days earlier in 2011 than it was in 1973. Both adaptive evolution (flowers opened earlier in populations that experienced warming) and phenotypic plasticity contributed to the earlier flowering times observed for this species. (See ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 6.1 for further discussion of evolutionary responses to climate change.) Gene flow can promote as well as limit local adaptation Although many populations are strikingly well matched to their environments, others are not. Gene flow is one of the factors that can both promote and limit the extent to which a population is adapted to its local environment. For example, some plant species have tolerant genotypes that can grow on soils at former mine sites containing high concentrations of heavy metals; such soils are toxic to intolerant genotypes. On normal soils, the tolerant genotypes grow poorly compared with the intolerant genotypes. Thus, we would expect the frequencies of tolerant genotypes to approach 100% on mine soils (where they are advantageous) and 0% on normal soils (where they are disadvantageous). Researchers found that a population of the bentgrass Agrostis tenuis growing on mine soils was dominated by tolerant genotypes, as expected. However, a population growing on normal soils downwind from the mine site contained more tolerant genotypes than expected (McNeilly 1968). Bentgrass is wind-pollinated, and each year, pollen from the plants growing on mine soils carried alleles for heavy metal tolerance into the population growing on normal soils, preventing that population from becoming fully adapted to its local conditions. The population growing on mine soils also received pollen from plants growing on normal soils. In this population, however, gene flow had relatively little effect on allele frequencies, because selection against intolerant genotypes was so strong (they survived poorly on mine soils). In general, whenever alleles are transferred between populations that live in different environments, the extent to which adaptive evolution occurs in each population depends on whether natural selection is strong enough to overcome the effects of ongoing gene flow. Adaptations are not perfect As we have just seen, gene flow can limit the extent to which a population adapts to its local environment. But even when gene flow does not have this effect, natural selection does not result in a perfect match between organisms and their environments. In part, this occurs because an organism\u2019s environment is not static\u2014it is a moving target because the abiotic and biotic components of the environment change continually. In addition, organisms face a number of constraints on adaptive evolution: Lack of genetic variation. If none of the individuals in a population has a beneficial allele of a particular gene that influences survival and reproduction, adaptive evolution cannot occur at that gene. For example, the mosquito Culex pipiens initially lacked alleles that provided resistance to organophosphate insecticides (see Figure 6.9). For decades, this lack of genetic variation prevented adaptive evolution in response to insecticides, allowing humans to destroy mosquito populations at will\u2014at least up until the time when insecticide resistance alleles arose by mutation and spread by gene flow. Note that in this and in all other cases, advantageous alleles arise randomly; they are not produced as needed or \u201con demand.\u201d Evolutionary history. Natural selection does not craft the adaptations of an organism from scratch. Instead, if the necessary genetic variation is present, it works by modifying the traits already present in an organism. Organisms have certain traits and lack others because of their ancestry. It would be advantageous, for example, for an aquatic mammal such as a dolphin to be able to obtain oxygen using gills. Dolphins lack this capacity, however, in part because of constraints imposed by their evolutionary history: they evolved from terrestrial vertebrates that had lungs and breathed air.", "Natural selection can bring about great changes, as seen in the mode of life and streamlined body form of the dolphin, but it does so by modifying traits that are already present in the organism, not by creating advantageous traits de novo. Ecological trade-offs. To survive and reproduce, organisms must perform many essential functions, such as acquiring food, escaping predators, warding off disease, and finding mates. Energy and resources are required for each of these essential functions. Hence, organisms face trade-offs in which the ability to perform one function reduces the ability to perform another (FIGURE 6.14). Trade-offs occur in all organisms, and they ensure that adaptations will never be perfect. Instead, adaptations represent compromises in the abilities of organisms to perform many different and sometimes conflicting functions. FIGURE 6.14 A Trade-Off between Reproduction and Survival Female red deer that reproduced had a lower probability of surviving to the next year than did females that did not reproduce, as the energy and resources invested into rearing young made reproducing red deer more susceptible to disease and environmental stress. (After T. H. Clutton-Brock et al. 1983. J Anim Ecol 52: 367\u2013383.) Is the additional risk of mortality that results from reproduction the same for females of all ages? Explain. Despite these constraints, adaptive evolution is a key component of the evolutionary process. What does the importance of adaptive evolution tell us about the link between ecology and evolution? As we saw in the case of soapberry bug populations (see Figure 6.11), natural selection, and the adaptive evolution that results, is driven by the interactions of organisms with one another and with their environment. Any such interaction is an ecological interaction, and hence ecology serves as a basis for understanding natural selection. Next, we\u2019ll consider how ecological interactions influence broader evolutionary changes, such as the formation of new species and the great changes that have occurred during the history of life on Earth. Self-Assessment 6.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 6.4 Long-term patterns of evolution are shaped by large-scale processes such as speciation, mass extinction, and adaptive radiation. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 6.4.1 Describe the process by which isolation of populations can lead to speciation. 6.4.2 Evaluate the roles of speciation and extinction in determining the diversity of species. 6.4.3 Explain how mass extinctions and rapid adaptations have influenced long-term patterns in diversity. The Evolutionary History of Life Earth is home to roughly 1.5 million species2 that have been named by taxonomists and to millions more that have yet to be discovered or named. This tremendous diversity serves as a foundation for all of ecology, which, as we saw in Concept 1.2, is the study of how species interact with one another and with their environment. But the causation runs both ways: while it is true that ecological interactions are affected by the diversity of species, it is also true that the diversity of species is shaped by ecological interactions. To see why, let\u2019s examine the origin of species and some of the other processes that have affected the history of life on Earth. The genetic divergence of populations over time can lead to speciation Each of the millions of species alive today originated by speciation, the process by which one species splits into two or more species. Speciation most commonly occurs when a barrier prevents gene flow between two or more populations of a species. The barrier may be geographic, as when a new population becomes established far from the parental population, or when isolation is introduced by continental drift (see Concept 18.2). Barriers may be ecological, as when some members of an insect population begin to feed on a different host plant. When a barrier to gene flow is established between populations, they diverge genetically over time (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 6.15). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 6.15 Speciation by Genetic Divergence Once genetic divergence begins, the time required for speciation varies tremendously, from a single generation (perhaps a single year), to a few thousand years, to millions of years in most cases. New species can also form in several other ways, such as when members of two different species produce fertile hybrid offspring (see Figure 6.21 for an example in sunflowers). Whether it is produced by genetic divergence, hybridization, or other means, the key step in the formation of a new species is the evolution of barriers that prevent its members from breeding freely with members of the parental species.", "Such reproductive barriers arise when a population accumulates so many genetic differences from the parental species that its members rarely produce viable, fertile offspring if they mate with members of the parental species. The accumulation of genetic differences that lead to the formation of a new species can be an incidental by-product of selection. For example, an experiment with fruit flies demonstrated the beginnings of reproductive barriers between populations selected for growth on different sources of food, but no such barriers were observed between control populations that had not been subjected to selection (FIGURE 6.16). Natural selection has produced similar changes in plant populations growing on soils with differing concentrations of heavy metals (Macnair and Christie 1983), in frog populations living in environments with different temperatures (Moore 1957), and in fish populations exposed to low or high levels of predation (Langerhans et al. 2007). In each of these cases, reproductive barriers arose as a by-product of selection in response to a feature of the environment, such as food source, heavy metal concentration, temperature, or presence of predators. FIGURE 6.16 Reproductive Barriers Can Be a By-Product of Selection After 1 year (about 40 generations) in which experimental populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura fruit flies were selected for growth on different sources of food, most matings occurred between flies selected to feed on the same food source. No such mating preference was observed in control populations that were not subjected to selection, regardless of whether the control populations were reared on starch (shown here) or maltose (not shown). To reduce the chance that the food eaten by the larvae would produce a body odor in adults that influenced the results, all flies used in the mating preference tests were reared for one generation on a standard cornmeal medium. (After D. M. B. Dodd. 1989. Evolution 43: 1308\u20131311.) Genetic drift can also promote the accumulation of genetic differences between populations (see Figures 6.7 and 6.8). As a result, like natural selection, genetic drift can ultimately lead to the evolution of reproductive barriers and hence to the formation of new species. Gene flow, on the other hand, typically acts to slow down or prevent speciation, because populations that exchange many alleles tend to remain genetically similar to one another, making it less likely that reproductive barriers will evolve. The diversity of life reflects both speciation and extinction rates Speciation may increase the number of species through time, but this increase may be offset by species extinction. The balance between the rates of these two processes determines the diversity of species within a group. We can visualize the outcome of this balance with an evolutionary tree, a branching diagram that represents the evolutionary history of a group of organisms. FIGURE 6.17A shows an evolutionary tree for the pinnipeds, a group of aquatic mammals consisting of seals, sea lions, and the walrus. The pinniped common ancestor lived about 20 million years ago, and its descendants include the 34 species of living pinnipeds along with a diversity of extinct species. The walrus group, for example, contains only a single species today\u2014the walrus\u2014but it once contained Gomphotoria pugnax and as many as 18 other species, all of which are now extinct. FIGURE 6.17 An Evolutionary Tree of the Pinnipeds (A) This branching tree is a representation of the evolutionary history of modern seals and their close relatives that is based on recent fossil finds. This research indicates that the marine mammals known as pinnipeds probably share a common ancestor with modern weasels and their relatives. (B) Reconstructions of Puijila darwini based on fossils show that extinct close relatives of pinnipeds were similar morphologically to some living mustelids, such as otters. P. darwini appears to have foraged both on land (above) and in the water (below). (After N. Rybczynski et al. 2009. Nature 458: 1021\u20131024.) Extinction can also help us to understand the large morphological differences that occur between some closely related groups of organisms. Seals and other pinnipeds, for example, differ greatly from their closest living relatives, members of the weasel family (the mustelids). However, recently discovered fossils of Puijila darwini (Rybczynski et al. 2009), an extinct close relative of the pinnipeds, show that extinct relatives of pinnipeds were similar morphologically to some living mustelids, such as otters (FIGURE 6.17B). Over time, repeated speciation events led to the origin of fully aquatic pinnipeds\u2014but because P. darwini and other such species have become extinct, there are no living species that \u201cfill the gap\u201d between living pinnipeds and living mustelids.", "Speciation and extinction events also have affected the rise and fall of different groups of organisms over long periods, as we\u2019ll see in the next section. Mass extinctions and adaptive radiations have shaped long-term patterns of evolution Thus far in this chapter, much of our focus has been on the process of evolution\u2014the mechanisms by which evolutionary change occurs. But evolution can also be defined as an observed pattern of change. Evolutionary patterns are revealed by observations of the natural world, such as data on the changing allele frequencies of a population over time. Patterns of evolutionary change are also documented in the fossil record, which shows that life on Earth has changed greatly over long periods (FIGURE 6.18). FIGURE 6.18 Life Has Changed Greatly over Time The earliest known fossils are those of 3.5-billion-year-old bacteria, while the most ancient fossils of complex multicellular organisms are of red algae that lived 1.2 billion years ago. Animals first appear in the fossil record about 600 million years ago, and complex animals with bilateral symmetry (in which the body has two equal but opposite halves, as in most living animals) arose roughly 25 million years later (Fedonkin et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2009). These and many other great changes in the history of life resulted from descent with modification as new species arose that differed from their ancestors. Over millions of years, these differences gradually accumulated, leading eventually to the formation of major new groups of organisms, such as terrestrial plants, amphibians, and reptiles. For example, a rich variety of fossils have been discovered that illustrate steps in the origin of tetrapods (vertebrates with four limbs, a group whose living members include amphibians, reptiles, and mammals) from fishes; the fossil of one such species is shown in Figure 6.18E. Similarly, the fossil record contains dozens of fossil species that show how mammals arose over a 120-million-year period (300\u2013180 million years ago) from an earlier group of tetrapods, the synapsids (Allin and Hopson 1992; Sidor 2003). The fossil record also documents cases in which the rise to prominence of one group of organisms was associated with the decline of another group. For example, 265 million years ago, reptiles and dinosaurs replaced amphibians as the ecologically dominant group of tetrapods, and then, 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs were replaced in turn by the mammals. The rise and fall of different groups of organisms over time has been heavily influenced by mass extinctions and adaptive radiations. The fossil record documents five mass extinction events in which large proportions of Earth\u2019s species were driven to extinction worldwide in a relatively short time\u2014a few million years or less, sometimes much less (FIGURE 6.19). The most recent mass extinction occurred 66 million years ago and may have been caused by a large asteroid that struck Earth, setting in motion cataclysmic environmental changes that led to the demise of dinosaurs and many other groups of organisms. FIGURE 6.19 The \u201cBig Five\u201d Mass Extinctions Five peaks in extinction rates are revealed by a graph of extinction rates over time in families of marine invertebrates. Each of the five mass extinctions was followed by great increases in the diversity of some of the surviving groups of organisms; for example, mammal diversity increased greatly after the extinction of dinosaurs. Mass extinctions can promote such increases in diversity by removing competitor or predator groups, thus allowing the survivors to give rise to new species that expand into new habitats or new ways of life. Great increases in diversity can also occur when a group of organisms evolves major new adaptations, such as the stems, waxy cuticles, and stomates on leaves that provided early land plants with support against gravity and protection from desiccation (see Concept 4.3). Whether stimulated by a mass extinction, new adaptations, or other factors (such as migration to an island that lacks competitors), an event in which a group of organisms gives rise to many new species that expand into new habitats or new ecological roles in a relatively short time is referred to as an adaptive radiation. Fossil evidence also suggests that many of the great changes in the history of life were caused by ecological interactions. For example, the fossil record shows that for over 60 million years, early animals were small or soft-bodied, or both, and that all of the larger species were herbivores, filter feeders, or scavengers.", "However, beginning 535 million years ago, this safe, soft-bodied world disappeared forever with the appearance of large, well-armed, mobile predators and large, well-defended prey. This major step in the history of life appears to have resulted from an \u201carms race\u201d between predators and prey. Early predators equipped with claws and other adaptations for capturing large prey provided powerful selection pressure that favored heavily armored prey species. That armor, in turn, promoted further increases in the effectiveness of the predators, and so on. Such reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species, known as coevolution, is discussed in more detail in Concept 13.3. Ecological interactions have shaped the history of life in many other ways. For example, the origin of new species in one group of organisms can lead to increases in the diversity of other groups, especially those that can escape from, eat, or compete effectively with the new species (Farrell 1998; Benton and Emerson 2007). An example of this process can be seen in parasitic wasps that feed on the apple maggot fly (Rhagoletis pomonella), a species that eats fruits (FIGURE 6.20). Following the introduction of apple trees to North America 200 years ago, some Rhagoletis populations began to eat apples. As these populations adapted to their new food plant, they diverged from the parent species genetically and now appear to be well on the way to forming a new fly species (Feder 1998). In addition, populations of the wasp have emerged that specialize on the incipient fly species (Forbes et al. 2009). These wasps have become reproductively isolated from the parent wasp species, thereby providing evidence of a sequence of speciation events that is in progress today and appears to be driven by ecological interactions. FIGURE 6.20 A Chain of Speciation Events Driven by Ecological Interactions? In the last 200 years, populations of the fly Rhagoletis pomonella that feed on apples have diverged genetically from their parent species, forming an incipient fly species. This change also appears to be leading to the formation of a new wasp species, Diachasma alloeum, that parasitizes members of apple-feeding Rhagoletis populations. We turn next to a more detailed look at an idea that we have already encountered in this chapter: while ecological interactions influence evolution, evolution also influences ecological interactions. Self-Assessment 6.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 6.5 Ecological interactions and evolution exert a profound influence on one another. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 6.5.1 Evaluate how ecological processes can result in evolutionary changes in populations. 6.5.2 Describe how an evolutionary change in a population has the potential to impact ecological processes. Joint Effects of Ecology and Evolution Ecological and evolutionary processes can influence each other greatly. Consider the sunflower species Helianthus anomalus. This species originated from a speciation event in which two other sunflowers, H. annuus and H. petiolaris, produced hybrid offspring. As Loren Rieseberg and colleagues have shown in a series of experiments and genetic analyses (Rieseberg et al. 2003), the new gene combinations generated by hybridization appear to have facilitated a major ecological shift in H. anomalus. This hybrid species grows in a much drier environment than does either of its two parental species (FIGURE 6.21)\u2014an ecological shift that illustrates how evolution influences ecology. Simultaneously, however, life under different ecological conditions provided the selection pressures that molded the hybrid offspring of H. annuus and H. petiolaris into a new species, H. anomalus, showing how ecology influences evolution. Such joint ecological and evolutionary effects are common\u2014as we should expect, given that both evolution and ecology depend on how organisms interact with one another and with their physical environment. FIGURE 6.21 A Hybrid That Lives in a New Environment The two sunflower species Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris gave rise to a new hybrid species, H. anomalus. This species grows in a drier environment than either of the two parental species. Ecological interactions can cause evolutionary change Many of the interactions in the natural world result from the efforts of organisms to do three things: to eat, to avoid being eaten, and to reproduce. These interactions can drive evolutionary change. We\u2019ve already seen (in Concept 6.4) how predator\u2013prey interactions caused long-term, large-scale, reciprocal evolution in which predators became more efficient at capturing prey and prey became more adept at escaping their predators. Predator\u2013prey interactions are still causing evolutionary change today, as are a broad range of other ecological interactions, including herbivory, parasitism, competition, and mutualism (see Unit 4).", "Studies of speciation have led to a similar conclusion: it may be common for speciation to be caused by ecological factors (Schluter 1998; Funk et al. 2006). The effect of ecology on evolution is also clear from studies of relatively small evolutionary changes in populations. Examples discussed earlier in this chapter include directional selection on soapberry bugs caused by interactions with their food plants (see Figure 6.11) and genetic drift in greater prairie chickens caused by habitat loss (see Figure 6.8). Evolution can alter ecological interactions Whenever a group of organisms evolves a new, highly effective adaptation, the outcome of ecological interactions may change, and that change may have a ripple effect that alters the entire community. For example, if a predator evolves a new way of capturing prey, some prey species may be driven to extinction, while others may decrease in abundance, migrate to other areas, or evolve new ways to cope with the more efficient predator. Similar changes can occur among species that compete for resources; we will discuss one such example in WEB EXTENSION 14.2, in which evolutionary changes in experimental populations of one fly species reversed the outcome of its competitive interactions with another fly species. Evolutionary changes that occur over long time scales also affect ecological interactions. For example, the origin and subsequent evolutionary diversification of plants altered the composition and stability of soils, the sources of food available to other organisms, and the cycling of nutrients\u2014each of which had major effects on ecological interactions. By affecting soils, for example, early plants literally helped to build the habitats in which later communities of microorganisms, plants, and animals would eventually live and interact with one another. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks can occur over short periods of time As we discussed earlier in this chapter, evolution often occurs over short periods of time (e.g., months to decades). Because evolution occurs as organisms interact with each other and their physical environment, this suggests that reciprocal feedback effects between ecological and evolutionary factors also can occur over short periods of time. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the causes of these rapid feedback effects. Feedback effects between ecological and evolutionary factors can occur when an ecological change, such as the addition or removal of a predator, alters the selective pressures that organisms face, thereby leading to evolutionary changes (FIGURE 6.22). Such evolutionary changes, in turn, can modify key aspects of populations, communities, or ecosystems. For example, in a 3-year field experiment (Agrawal et al. 2013), evolutionary changes in life span and flowering time in populations of the evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) led to consistent changes in the abundance of the moth Mompha brevivittella, which ate the seeds of this plant (FIGURE 6.23)\u2014a demonstration that rapid evolution can cause rapid ecological change in a natural setting. Likewise, in the mountain streams of Trinidad, predator removal (an ecological change) leads to the evolution of larger body size in guppies over short periods of time, an evolutionary change that may increase the rate at which guppy populations add nitrogen to this freshwater ecosystem (El-Sabaawi et al. 2015). Overall, although the feedback effects shown in Figure 6.22 may be widespread, few studies have documented a full \u201creciprocity cycle\u201d in nature in which an ecological change causes an evolutionary change that causes further ecological change (or vice versa). FIGURE 6.22 Rapid Feedback Effects Can Occur between Ecological and Evolutionary Factors Ecological change in a population, community, or ecosystem can drive evolutionary change over short periods of time (green arrows). Similarly, evolutionary change can alter events at the population, community, or ecosystem level (blue arrows). A change at one level of ecological organization can cause additional changes at other levels (red arrows), as when an increase in the population size of one species alters nutrient cycling in ecosystems. FIGURE 6.23 Feedback of Food Plant Evolution on Insect Abundance Caterpillars of the moth Mompha brevivittella eat the seeds of the evening primrose (Oenothera biennis). Some plant genotypes are more resistant to moth attack than others, indicating that moth abundance could change depending on plant genotype frequencies. In a 3-year field experiment, evolutionary changes in O. biennis genotype frequencies were correlated to moth abundance, indicating a feedback from evolution to ecology. (After A. A. Agrawal et al. 2013. Am Nat 181: S35\u2013S45.) Suppose that eco-evolutionary feedbacks between changes in plant genotype frequency and moth abundance did not occur. Redraw this figure assuming that was the case. Self-Assessment 6.5", "[Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Trophy Hunting and Inadvertent Evolution Trophy hunters of bighorn sheep prefer to kill large males that carry a full curl of horns. The majority of these males are killed when they are between 4 and 6 years old, often before they have sired many offspring. As a result, hunting decreases the chance that alleles carried by males with a full curl of horns will be passed on to the next generation. Instead, it is males with relatively small horns who father most of the offspring, transmitting their alleles to the next generation. This change has caused the frequency of alleles encoding small horns to increase, thus leading to the observed 30-year decrease in average horn size (see Figure 6.2). Overall, trophy hunting has inadvertently caused directional selection in bighorn sheep, favoring small males with small horns and changing allele frequencies in the population over time. Humans have caused unintended evolutionary changes in a wide variety of other populations. An early example was provided by the decline in the frequency of red foxes (Vulpes fulva) with coats that have a silver tint, a color preferred by hunters (FIGURE 6.24). In a medical example, shortly after antibiotics were first discovered (ca. 1940), their use was highly effective against bacteria that cause diseases and lethal infections. But the use of antibiotics provided a strong source of directional selection, leading to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations (see Interactive Figure 1.10). Today, as a result of this directional selection, antibiotic treatments sometimes fail, even when very high doses are administered. Antibiotic resistance also has enormous financial costs; in the United States alone, efforts to cure patients infected with antibiotic-resistant strains costs an estimated $2 billion in medical expenses each year (Thorpe et al. 2018). FIGURE 6.24 Hunting Resulted in the Decline of Silver Foxes Individual red foxes (Vulpes fulva) of genotype AA have red fur, and individuals of genotype Aa have reddish-black fur. Individuals of genotype aa are known as \u201csilver foxes\u201d because the tips of their hairs have a silver tint (photo). Hunters preferentially killed silver foxes because their furs yielded 2.5\u20134 times the price of other red fox furs. (After C. S. Elton. 1942. Voles, Mice and Lemmings: Problems in Population Dynamics. Oxford University Press: Oxford.) Based on the graph, estimate the initial (ca. 1832) and final (ca. 1923) frequencies of genotypes AA, Aa, and aa. Next, use the genotype frequencies that you estimated to compute the initial and final frequencies of the a allele. Hint: See footnote in Concept 6.1. We have seen throughout this chapter that human actions such as trophy hunting and antibiotic use act as selection pressures and hence may cause evolutionary change. But does our influence on evolution extend beyond cases in which we selectively kill other organisms? CONNECTIONS in NATURE THE HUMAN IMPACT ON EVOLUTION Many human actions alter the environment and hence have the potential to alter the course of evolution. As we\u2019ve seen, actions such as trophy hunting, antibiotic use, and commercial fishing are themselves powerful sources of selection. Other human actions, such as emissions of pollutants or introductions of invasive species, change aspects of the abiotic or biotic environment. By changing features of the environment, these and many other human actions can cause evolutionary change. In ANALYZING DATA 6.1, you\u2019ll analyze data related to a classic example of this process, in which the emission (and subsequent control) of pollutants caused evolution by natural selection in populations of the peppered moth (Biston betularia). Still other human actions, such as habitat fragmentation (in which portions of a species\u2019 habitat are destroyed, leaving spatially isolated fragments of the original habitat), can also cause large evolutionary changes (FIGURE 6.25). In general, human actions that affect the environment can alter each of the three main mechanisms of evolution: natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. Because we know with certainty that our actions are causing great changes to environments worldwide, we can infer that they are also causing evolutionary changes in populations worldwide. FIGURE 6.25 Evolutionary Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on a Hypothetical Species (A) Prior to habitat fragmentation, there are many individuals in each population of the species, and the distances between populations are short.", "(B) When human activities remove large portions of the habitat, the population sizes shrink, and the distances between populations increase, causing evolutionary changes that decrease the potential for adaptive evolution of the species and increase its risk of extinction. As another example of human-caused evolution, consider the effects of adding nutrients such as nitrogen from sewage and fertilizers to lakes. Such nutrient inputs can cause the clarity and oxygen concentration of the water to drop (see Concept 22.4), leading to unintended evolutionary effects. For example, nutrient inputs to European lakes have reduced the effectiveness of reproductive barriers that once isolated species of whitefish (Vonlanthen et al. 2012). Murky (low-clarity) waters can hinder the ability of females to recognize males of their own species, thus making it more likely that a female will select a male from another whitefish species as her mate. When interspecific mating is common, a \u201cspeciation reversal\u201d can occur in which two previously isolated species fuse into a single, hybrid species. Vonlanthen et al. concluded that nutrient inputs have caused such speciation reversals, leading to the extinction of eight whitefish species. As we\u2019ll see in later chapters of this book, such reductions in the diversity of species can have wide-ranging ecological effects. Human actions also have the potential to alter patterns of evolution over long time scales. For example, the extinction rate of species today is 100 to 1,000 times higher than the usual, or background, extinction rate seen in the fossil record for times when no mass extinction was taking place. Human actions such as habitat destruction, overharvesting, and introductions of invasive species are among the main reasons for this rise in the extinction rate (see Concepts 23.3 and 24.2). Extinction is forever, so when human actions drive a species to extinction, the future course of evolution is altered in a way that cannot be reversed. If human activities cause a sixth mass extinction in the next few centuries or millennia, our actions will greatly and irreversibly change the evolutionary history of life on Earth. ANALYZING DATA 6.1 The peppered moth (Biston betularia) has a light-colored and a dark-colored form. The first dark-colored moth was observed in 1848 near Manchester, England; 50 years later, most moths in the area were dark in color. Researchers hypothesized that dark-colored moths increased in frequency because when the moths rested on trees whose bark had been darkened by pollution, it was harder for predators to find dark moths than light moths. In particular, field studies by Kettlewell (1955, 1956) indicated that natural selection by birds favored dark-colored moths in regions where tree bark was blackened by pollution, whereas light-colored moths were favored elsewhere. After clean air legislation was enacted in England in 1956, tree surfaces lightened over time because of the reduction in soot and the growth of lichens on the trees\u2019 bark (lichens are light in color, and they grow poorly in polluted air). During this period, the dark-colored moths decreased in frequency, as shown for the region around Manchester in WEB EXTENSION 6.3. Although the rise and fall in the frequency of dark-colored moths were consistent with typical results from natural selection by bird predation, criticisms have been leveled against aspects of this hypothesis. For example, abnormally high densities of moths were released in some experiments, potentially increasing the impact of predation, because some predators preferentially attack abundant prey. Over the course of a 6-year experiment designed to address such criticisms, Michael Majerus released thousands of moths in an area where tree surfaces had been lightened. He determined the number of light- and dark-colored moths that were eaten. His results are reported in the table.

Do the results support the hypothesis that evolution by natural selection caused the frequency of dark-colored moths to change over time? Explain. See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. Life History KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 7.1 Life history patterns vary within and among species. CONCEPT 7.2 There are trade-offs between life history traits. CONCEPT 7.3 Organisms face different selection pressures at different life cycle stages. CONCEPT 7.4 Life history patterns can be classified along several continua. Nemo Grows Up: A Case Study Birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it\u2014they all produce offspring that perpetuate their species. But beyond that basic fact of life, the offspring produced by different organisms vary tremendously. A grass plant produces seeds a few millimeters long that can wait, buried in the soil, for years until conditions are right for germination. A sea star spews hundreds of thousands of microscopic eggs that develop adrift in the ocean. A rhinoceros produces one calf that develops in her womb for 16\u201318 months and can walk well several days after birth, but requires more than a year of care before it becomes fully independent (FIGURE 7.1). FIGURE 7.1 Offspring Vary Greatly in Size and Number Organisms produce a large range of offspring numbers and sizes. A rhinoceros produces a single calf that weighs 40\u201365 kg (90\u2013140 pounds). On the other end of the spectrum, many plants produce hundreds to thousands of seeds that are less than a millimeter long and weigh as little as 0.8 \u03bcg (roughly one fifty-billionth the weight of a rhinoceros calf). Even this broad range of possibilities barely begins to describe the different ways in which organisms reproduce. In popular media, we humans often depict other animals as having family lives similar to ours. For example, in the animated film Finding Nemo, clownfish live in families with a mother, a father, and several young offspring. When Nemo the clownfish loses his mother to a predator, his father takes over the duties of raising him. But in a more realistic version of this story, after losing his mate, Nemo\u2019s father would have done something less predictable: he would have changed sex and become a female. Actually, the correspondence between the movie and biology breaks down long before Nemo loses his mother. Clownfish spend their entire adult lives within a single sea anemone (FIGURE 7.2). Anemones are related to jellyfish, with a central mouth ringed by stinging tentacles. In what appears to be a mutually beneficial relationship, the anemone protects the clownfish by stinging their predators, but the clownfish themselves are not stung. The clownfish, in turn, may help the anemone by eating its parasites or driving away its predators. FIGURE 7.2 Life in a Sea Anemone Clownfish (Amphiprion percula) form hierarchical groups of unrelated individuals that live and reproduce among the tentacles of their anemone host (Heteractis magnifica). Predict the sex of each of these clownfish (assuming that they live together as a group of four fish in an anemone host). Explain your answer. Two to six clownfish typically inhabit a single anemone, but they are far from a traditional human family \u2014in fact, they are usually not related to one another. The clownfish that live in an anemone interact according to a strict pecking order that is based on size. The largest fish in the anemone is a female. The next fish in the hierarchy, the second largest, is the breeding male. The remaining fish are sexually immature nonbreeders. If the female dies, as in Nemo\u2019s story, the breeding male undergoes a growth spurt and changes sex to become a female, and the largest nonbreeder increases in size and becomes the new breeding male. The breeding male clownfish mates with the female and cares for the fertilized eggs until they hatch. The hatchling fish leave the anemone to live in the open ocean, away from the predator-infested reef. The young fish eventually return to the reef and develop into juveniles. Then they must find an anemone to inhabit. When a juvenile fish enters an anemone, the resident fish allow it to stay there only if there is room. If there is no room, the young fish is expelled and returns to the dangers of an exposed existence on the reef.", "This life cycle, with its expulsions, hierarchies, and sex changes, is certainly as colorful as the fish that live it. But why do clownfish engage in these complicated machinations just to produce more clownfish? Organisms have arrived at a vast array of solutions to the basic problem of reproduction. As we will see, these solutions are often well suited for meeting the challenges and constraints of the environment where a species lives. Introduction Human history is a record of past events. Your personal history might consist of a series of details about the course of your life: your birth weight, when you started walking and talking, your adult height, and other relevant information about your development. Similarly, an individual organism\u2019s life history consists of major events related to its growth, development, reproduction, and survival. In this chapter, we\u2019ll discuss traits that characterize the life history of an organism, including age and size at sexual maturity, amount and timing of reproduction, and survival and mortality rates. As we\u2019ll see, the timing and nature of life history traits, and therefore the life history itself, are products of adaptation to the environment in which the organism lives. Life history traits, such as reproductive capacity, are an important influence on the growth rate of populations (see Unit 3). We\u2019ll also consider how biologists analyze life history patterns in order to understand the trade-offs, constraints, and selection pressures imposed on different stages of an organism\u2019s life cycle. CONCEPT 7.1 Life history patterns vary within and among species. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 7.1.1 Summarize the key stages that make up the life history of an organism. 7.1.2 Explain how genetics and the environment act as controls on life history traits. 7.1.3 Compare the benefits and costs associated with sexual versus asexual reproduction. 7.1.4 Describe how additional complexity in a life cycle, such as larval and adult forms, may benefit a species. Life History Diversity Studying variation in life history traits and analyzing the causes of that variation helps us to understand how life history traits interact with the environment and influence the potential growth rate of populations. In order to understand such analyses, it is helpful first to examine some of the broad life history patterns found within and among species. Individuals within species differ in their life histories Individual differences in life history traits are ubiquitous. Think about your own life experiences and those of your family and friends. Some members of your social group reached developmental milestones such as puberty earlier or later than others. Different women may have different numbers of children with different age gaps between them. Despite this variation, it is possible to make some generalizations about life histories in Homo sapiens: for example, women typically have one baby at a time, reproduction usually occurs between the ages of 15 and 45, and so on. Similar generalizations can be made for other species. The life history strategy of a species is the overall pattern in the timing and nature of life history events averaged across all the individuals in the species (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 7.3). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 7.3 Life History Strategy The timing and nature of life history events shapes the overall life cycle of an organism. Although life history options are presented here as questions, the life history strategy is determined by effects of natural selection, not the choices of the individual organism. The life history strategy is shaped by the way the organism divides its energy and resources between growth, reproduction, and survival. Within a species, individuals often differ in how they divide their energy and resources among these activities. Such differences may result from genetic variation, from differences in environmental conditions, or from a combination of both. GENETIC DIFFERENCES Some life history variation within species is determined genetically. Genetically influenced traits can often be recognized as those that are more similar within families than between them. Again, these kinds of traits are familiar in humans: for example, siblings are often similar in appearance and reach similar adult heights and weights. The same is true in other organisms. For example, in annual bluegrass (Poa annua), life history traits such as age at first reproduction, growth rate, and number of flowers produced are similar among sibling plants (Law et al. 1977). As with any other trait, heritable variation in life history traits is the raw material on which natural selection acts.", "Selection favors individuals whose life history traits result in their having a better chance of surviving and reproducing than do individuals with other life history traits. Much of life history analysis is concerned with explaining how and why life history patterns have evolved to their present states. Life histories are believed to be adapted to maximize fitness (the genetic contribution of an organism\u2019s descendants to future generations, determined both by the reproductive rate of the parent and the survival rates of both parent and offspring). However, no organism has a perfect life history\u2014that is, one that results in the unlimited production of descendants. Instead, all organisms face constraints that prevent the evolution of a perfect life history. As we\u2019ll see in Concept 7.3, these constraints often involve ecological trade-offs in which an increase in the performance of one function (such as reproduction) can reduce the performance of another (such as growth or survival). Thus, although life histories often serve organisms well in the environments in which they have evolved, they are optimal only in the sense of maximizing fitness subject to constraints. ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENCES A single genotype may produce different phenotypes under different environmental conditions, a phenomenon known as phenotypic plasticity (see the Climate Change Connection in Chapter 6). Almost every trait shows some degree of plasticity, and life history traits are no exception. For example, most plants and animals grow at different rates depending on temperature. They do so because development typically speeds up as the temperature rises, then slows down again due to heat stress as the temperature approaches the organism\u2019s upper lethal temperature. Changes in life history traits often translate into changes in adult morphology. Slower growth under cooler conditions, for example, may lead to a smaller adult size or to differences in adult shape. Callaway and colleagues (1994) showed that ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees grown in cool, moist climates allocate more biomass to leaf growth relative to sapwood production than do those in warmer desert climates (\u201csapwood\u201d refers to newly formed layers of wood that function in water transport). Allocation describes the relative amounts of energy or resources that an organism devotes to different functions. The result of allocation differences in ponderosa pines is that trees grown in different environments differ in adult shape and size. Desert trees are shorter and squatter, with fewer branches and leaves (FIGURE 7.4). As a result of having fewer leaves, they also lose less water and have lower photosynthetic rates per unit of ground area. FIGURE 7.4 Plasticity of Growth Form in Ponderosa Pines (A) Ponderosa pine trees (Pinus ponderosa) in cool, moist climates allocate more resources to leaf production than do trees in desert climates. (B) Desert trees are shorter than those grown in cooler climates, but for a given height, they have thicker trunks. (After R. M. Callaway et al. 1994. Ecology 75: 1474\u20131481.) Use the solid (regression) lines in (B) to estimate the trunk diameter of a tree that is 5 m tall and grows in a cool, moist climate versus the trunk diameter of a tree of the same height that grows in a desert climate. Phenotypic plasticity that responds to temperature variation often produces a continuous range of sizes. In other types of phenotypic plasticity, a single genotype produces discrete types, or morphs, with few or no intermediate forms. For example, populations of spadefoot toad (Spea multiplicata) tadpoles in Arizona ponds contain two morphs: omnivore morphs, which feed on detritus and algae, and larger carnivore morphs, which feed on fairy shrimp and on other tadpoles (FIGURE 7.5). The differing body shapes of omnivores and carnivores result from differences in the relative growth rates of different body parts: carnivores have bigger mouths and stronger jaw muscles because of accelerated growth in those areas. Pfennig (1992) showed that omnivore tadpoles can turn into carnivores when fed on shrimp and tadpoles, and field studies show that the proportion of omnivore and carnivore morphs is affected by food supply. Carnivore tadpoles grow faster and are more likely to metamorphose before the ponds where they live dry up; thus, the rapidly growing carnivores are favored in ephemeral ponds. The more slowly growing omnivores are favored in ponds that persist longer, because they metamorphose in better condition and thus have better chances of survival as juvenile toads. FIGURE 7.5 Phenotypic Plasticity in Spadefoot Toad Tadpoles Spadefoot toad (Spea multiplicata) tadpoles can develop into small-headed omnivores (A) or large-headed carnivores (B), depending on the food they consume early in development.", "Later in development, omnivores and carnivores feed on different food sources that are located in different portions of their habitat. When thinking about examples such as the omnivore and carnivore morphs of the spadefoot toad, it is tempting to assume that phenotypic plasticity is adaptive\u2014that the ability to produce different phenotypes in response to changing environmental conditions increases the fitness of individuals. While that is often the case, adaptation must be demonstrated rather than assumed. For example, it may be adaptive for ponderosa pines to be stockier and have fewer leaves in hot, dry climates because these features can help reduce water loss. However, adaptation would have to be documented by measuring and comparing the survival and reproductive rates of stockier and taller trees in the desert environment. In some instances, phenotypic plasticity may be a simple physiological response, not an adaptive response shaped by natural selection. For example, as mentioned above, growth rate typically increases with temperature up to a point. This may occur because chemical reactions are slower at lower temperatures, and thus metabolism and growth are necessarily slower. CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE TIMING OF SEASONAL ACTIVITIES The timing of seasonal life history activities can be of critical importance. For example, a bird that migrates north too early in the spring may starve if no food is available, while a plant that flowers when its pollinators are not present may fail to reproduce. As described in Concept 4.2, the timing of such seasonal events is affected by changing day length (photoperiod) and sometimes by other environmental cues such as temperature that also vary over the course of a year. As the climate has changed in recent decades, have species adjusted the times when they perform key seasonal activities? Long-term data sets show that many species are initiating spring activities earlier than they once did, apparently in response to climate change. For example, as the climate warms, leaf production in plants, egg laying in birds, emergence from dormancy in insects, and arrival of migratory animals often occur earlier today than they did in the 1960s and 1970s. In some cases, however, shifts in the timing of seasonal activities have not kept pace with climate change. Consider the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). As winter approaches, the coat color of snowshoe hares changes from brown to white, providing camouflage against snow; the reverse coat-color change occurs in spring. As the climate has warmed, the length of time that the ground is covered by snow has decreased because snowfall now begins later in autumn and snowmelt occurs earlier in spring. If the timing of the fall coat-color change in snowshoe hares had kept pace with the delay in when snowfall begins, we would expect that snowshoe hares would molt to white later in the fall than they once did. Instead, however, the date and rate of the fall molt has not changed (Mills et al. 2013). As a result, the number of days in which a \u201ccamouflage mismatch\u201d occurs has increased, making the hares easier for visually hunting predators to spot (FIGURE 7.6) and leading to increased mortality rates (Zimova et al. 2016). Mismatches in the timing of seasonal activities have also been found in caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and snow geese (Chen caerulescens): although the plants their young require for food are producing leaves earlier in the spring, neither species has adjusted the timing of reproduction. This has caused a decline in the reproductive success of both species because their young are not getting enough to eat. FIGURE 7.6 Camouflage Mismatch in Snowshoe Hares (A) Historically, snowshoe hares changed their color from brown to white at a time of year that matched the onset of snowfall, causing them to be well-camouflaged all winter. (B) With climate warming, snowfall now begins later in the year. However, the date of the fall coat-color change has remained the same, causing an increase in the number of days that snowshoe hares experience a camouflage mismatch. Mode of reproduction is a basic life history trait At the most basic level, evolutionary success is determined by successful reproduction. Despite this universal reality, organisms have evolved vastly different mechanisms for reproducing\u2014from simple asexual splitting to complex mating rituals and intricate pollination systems. ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION The first organisms to evolve on Earth reproduced asexually by binary fission (parental cell divides to produce two cells). The sexual reproductive processes of meiosis, recombination, and fertilization arose later. Today, all prokaryotes and many protists reproduce asexually.", "While sexual reproduction is the norm in multicellular organisms, many can also reproduce asexually. For example, after they are initiated by a (sexually produced) founding polyp, coral colonies grow by asexual reproduction (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 7.7). Each individual polyp in a colony is produced when a multicellular bud splits off from a parent polyp to form a new polyp; as a result, each polyp is a genetically identical copy, or clone, of the founding polyp. Once the colony has grown to a certain size and conditions are right, the polyps reproduce sexually, producing offspring that develop into polyps that start their own new colonies of clones. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 7.7 Life Cycle of a Coral Reef-forming coral colonies grow by asexual reproduction before producing eggs and sperm. The sexually produced offspring establish new colonies. Would the larva shown in the diagram be genetically identical to the polyp to its left? Would two different larvae be genetically identical to each other? Explain. SEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND ANISOGAMY Most plants and animals reproduce sexually, as do many fungi and protists. Some protists, such as the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (FIGURE 7.8A), have two different mating types, analogous to males and females except that their gametes are the same size. The production of equal-sized gametes is called isogamy. In most multicellular organisms, however, the two types of gametes are different sizes, a condition called anisogamy. Typically, the eggs are much larger than the sperm and contain more cellular and nutritional provisions for the developing embryo. The sperm are small and may be motile (FIGURE 7.8B). As we\u2019ll see in Concept 8.3, differences between the sexes in gamete size can influence other reproductive characteristics, such as differences between the sexes in their mating behavior. FIGURE 7.8 Isogamy and Anisogamy (A) An isogamous species: two gametes of the single-celled alga Chlamydomonas fusing. (B) An anisogamous species: fertilization of a human egg, showing the difference in size between egg and sperm. Although sexual reproduction is widespread, it has some disadvantages. Because meiosis produces haploid gametes that contain half the genetic content of the parent, a sexually reproducing organism can transmit only half of its genetic material to each offspring, whereas asexual reproduction allows transmission of the entire genome. Another disadvantage of sex is that recombination and the independent distribution of chromosomes into gametes (during meiosis) can disrupt favorable gene combinations, potentially reducing offspring fitness. Finally, the growth rate of sexually reproducing populations is only half that of asexually reproducing ones, all else being equal (FIGURE 7.9). FIGURE 7.9 The Cost of Sex One cost of sex is referred to as the \u201ccost of males.\u201d Imagine a population in which there are both sexual and asexual individuals. Assume that each sexual or asexual female can produce four offspring per generation, but half of the offspring produced by the sexual females are male and must pair with females to produce offspring. Under these conditions, the asexual individuals (A) will increase in number more rapidly and (B) in less than 10 generations will constitute nearly 100% of the population. In generation 2 there are four sexual and four asexual individuals. How many sexual and asexual individuals are there in generation 3? How many of each will there be in generation 4? Explain your results in terms of the cost of males. Given such disadvantages, why is sex so common? Sex has some clear benefits, including recombination, which promotes genetic variation and hence may increase the capacity of populations to evolve in response to environmental challenges such as drought or disease. In a test of this idea, Morran et al. (2011) examined the benefits of sex in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Populations of C. elegans consist of males and hermaphrodites. The hermaphrodites can reproduce by self-fertilization (selfing) or by mating with males (outcrossing). In wild-type populations, outcrossing rates typically range from 1% to 30%. However, C. elegans can be manipulated genetically to form strains that always self-fertilize (\u201cobligate selfers\u201d) or never self-fertilize (\u201cobligate outcrossers\u201d). The offspring of obligate selfers are very similar genetically to their parents, whereas the offspring of obligate outcrossers are more variable genetically; thus, these strains are well suited for testing the idea that sex is beneficial because it promotes increased levels of genetic variation. Morran et al. exposed some C. elegans populations to a lethal bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens.", "In wild-type populations exposed to this pathogen, the rate of outcrossing increased dramatically, rising from an initial 20% to more than 80% over the course of 30 generations (FIGURE 7.10A). Moreover, C. elegans populations containing only obligate selfers were always driven to extinction by the pathogen, whereas wild-type and obligate-outcrossing populations always persisted (FIGURE 7.10B). Overall, these results support the hypothesis that the genetic variation generated by sex is beneficial in a challenging environment. McDonald et al. (2016) obtained similar results in yeast; moreover, they showed that sex provided benefits by increasing the fixation of advantageous mutations while decreasing the fixation of deleterious mutations. FIGURE 7.10 Benefits of Sex in a Challenging Environment (A) Outcrossing rates were measured over time in wild-type populations of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Some C. elegans populations were exposed to the bacterial pathogen Serratia marcescens, while others were not. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (B) Percentage of replicate wild-type and obligate-selfing C. elegans populations surviving under different treatments. (After L. T. Morran et al. 2011. Science 333: 216\u2013218.) In (A), which curve shows results for the control populations? Explain your choice and interpret the results shown by the two curves. Life cycles are often complex The small, early stages of many animal life cycles look and behave completely differently from adult stages. They frequently eat different foods and prefer different habitats. For example, coral reef fishes such as the damselfish Chromis atripectoralis start life as hatchlings only a few millimeters long. The hatchlings live and grow in the open ocean, feeding on planktonic algae. When they have grown to about a centimeter in length, they return to the reef and begin to eat larger food items. This life cycle may have evolved in response to high levels of predation on young fish that stay on the reef; young fish that spend more time growing in the open ocean may have better chances of survival. Complex life cycles can also lower competition between individuals of the same species, since species at different ages use of different resources. As corals (see Interactive Figure 7.7) and coral reef fishes both demonstrate, life cycles can involve stages that have different body forms or live in different habitats. A complex life cycle is one in which there are at least two distinct stages that differ in their habitat, physiology, or morphology. In many cases, the transitions between stages in complex life cycles are abrupt. For example, many organisms undergo metamorphosis, an abrupt transition in form from the larval to the juvenile stage that is sometimes accompanied by a change in habitat (exemplified by the frogs in Interactive Figure 7.3). As we will see in Concept 7.4, complex life cycles and metamorphosis often result when offspring and parents are subjected to very different selection pressures. Because most vertebrates have simple life cycles that lack an abrupt transition between habitats or forms, we humans tend to think of metamorphosis as an exotic and strange process. However, complex life cycles and metamorphosis can be found even among vertebrates, including some fishes and most amphibians. Most marine invertebrates produce microscopic larvae that swim in the open ocean before settling to the bottom at metamorphosis. Many insects also undergo metamorphosis\u2014from caterpillars to moths, grubs to beetles, maggots to flies, and aquatic larvae to dragonflies and mayflies. In fact, Werner (1988) calculated that of the 33 phyla of animals recognized at that time, 25 contained at least some subgroups that have complex life cycles. He also noted that about 80% of all animal species undergo metamorphosis at some time in their life cycle (FIGURE 7.11). FIGURE 7.11 The Pervasiveness of Complex Life Cycles Most groups of animals include members that undergo metamorphosis. (A) Familiar examples are insects such as the antlion, which develops from a larva that lives in soil. (B) Most marine invertebrates have free-swimming larval stages, including echinoderms such as sea urchins. Many parasites have evolved intricate and complex life cycles with one or more specialized stages for each host that they inhabit. For example, the parasite flatworm Ribeiroia has three specialized stages (see Interactive Figure 1.3). In Ribeiroia and other parasites, these stages are specialized to perform essential functions such as asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction, and colonization of new hosts. Complex life cycles also occur in many types of algae and plants, reaching some of their most elaborate forms in these groups.", "Some algae and all plants have complex life cycles in which a multicellular diploid sporophyte alternates with a multicellular haploid gametophyte. The sporophyte produces haploid spores that disperse and grow into gametophytes, and the gametophyte produces haploid gametes that combine in fertilization to form zygotes that grow into sporophytes. This type of life cycle, called alternation of generations, has been elaborated on in different plant and algal groups. In mosses and a few other plant groups, the gametophyte is larger, but in most plants and some algae, the sporophyte is the dominant stage of the life cycle. Over the course of evolution, complex life cycles have been lost in some species that are members of groups in which such cycles are considered the ancestral condition. The resulting simple life cycles are sometimes referred to as direct development because development from fertilized egg to juvenile occurs within the egg prior to hatching and no free-living larval stage occurs. For example, most species in one group of salamanders, the plethodontids, lack the gilled aquatic larval stage that is typical of salamanders. Instead, they lay their eggs on land, where they hatch directly into small terrestrial juveniles. As we\u2019ve seen, organisms vary greatly in key aspects of their life history strategies, such as when they reproduce, how many offspring they produce, and how much care is allotted to each offspring. How can we organize these diverse patterns into a coherent scheme? Self-Assessment 7.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 7.2 There are trade-offs between life history traits. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 7.2.1 Illustrate how the number of offspring may affect the size of those offspring. 7.2.2 Explain how providing care to offspring may compromise other functions in adults. 7.2.3 Understand that allocating energy and resources to reproduction may affect parental growth, survival, and future reproduction. Trade-Offs Organisms have limited amounts of energy and resources that can be invested in growth, reproduction, and defense. As discussed in Concept 6.3, trade-offs occur when organisms allocate their limited energy or other resources to one structure or function at the expense of another. As we\u2019ll see, trade-offs among life history traits are common. There is a trade-off between number and size of offspring Many organisms show a trade-off between their investment in each individual offspring and the number of offspring they produce. Investment in offspring includes energy, resources, time, and the loss of chances to engage in alternative activities such as foraging. In many cases, organisms that make a large investment in each offspring produce small numbers of large offspring, while organisms that make a small investment in each offspring produce large numbers of small offspring. As we\u2019ll see, parental investment can also affect offspring \u201cquality,\u201d as when reduced investment per offspring increases the risk of offspring mortality. LACK CLUTCH SIZE A classic example demonstrating the trade-off between how much investment goes into each offspring versus the number of offspring was first described by David Lack in 1947. Lack asserted that the number of eggs per reproductive bout (known as the clutch size) is limited by the maximum number of young that the parents can raise at one time, which in turn is related to the resource availability (prey and other factors needed to raise the young). If the parents rear fewer than this maximum number, they will reduce their genetic representation in future generations (fitness). If they attempt to rear more than this maximum number, their offspring may be more likely to die from starvation, predation, or other factors, again reducing the parents\u2019 fitness. Lack made careful observations of the breeding biology of bird species, from the poles to the tropics. What struck him was that clutch size varied with latitude: at higher latitudes, birds could rear greater numbers of offspring. He hypothesized that the reason for larger clutches at higher latitudes was that such latitudes had longer periods of daylight during the breeding season. These longer days allowed parents more time for foraging, and they could therefore feed greater numbers of offspring. The term \u201cLack clutch size\u201d refers to the maximum number of offspring that a parent can successfully raise to maturity. Lack hypothesized that as a result of natural selection from the trade-off between numbers versus resource provisioning of young birds, the most productive clutch size would be found in natural populations.", "This hypothesis can be tested by the addition and removal of eggs in nests in order to examine whether there are costs to unusually large clutch sizes. For example, Nager and colleagues (2000) artificially increased the number of eggs in clutches laid by the lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus). They did this by removing eggs from nests, which stimulated the females to lay more eggs. Nager et al. found that the increased clutch size resulted in a drop in the nutritional quality of later-produced eggs (specifically, these eggs had a lower lipid content). They also found that eggs from larger clutches had reduced survivorship to fledging (the point at which wing feathers are developed enough for flight) (FIGURE 7.12). Thus, in lesser black-backed gulls, production of larger clutches reduced both egg quality and survivorship to fledging. FIGURE 7.12 Clutch Size and Survival Lesser black-backed gulls typically lay three eggs in a clutch. However, when they are manipulated experimentally to produce larger clutches of eggs, their offspring have reduced chances of survival to fledging. (After R. G. Nager et al. 2000. Ecology 81: 1339\u20131350.) TRADE-OFFS IN ORGANISMS WITHOUT PARENTAL CARE Parental care like that provided by birds and some other vertebrates is relatively rare. In organisms that do not provide parental care, resources invested in propagules (such as eggs, spores, or seeds) are the main measure of reproductive investment. In this case, the size of the propagule is the primary measure of parental investment, and propagule size is traded off against the number of propagules produced in a reproductive bout. In plants, for example, the size of the seeds that a species produces is negatively correlated with the number of seeds it produces (FIGURE 7.13). FIGURE 7.13 Seed Size\u2013Seed Number Trade-Offs in Plants (After O. A. Stevens. 1932. Am J Bot 19: 784\u2013794.) In some cases, the size\u2013number trade-off also applies to variation within species. The western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), which is common throughout the coastal mountains of the western United States, does not provide parental care. Barry Sinervo (1990) found that lizard populations farther to the north laid more eggs per clutch (Washington: 12 eggs/clutch vs. California: 7 eggs/clutch) but laid smaller eggs (Washington: 0.40 g vs. California: 0.65 g) (FIGURE 7.14). FIGURE 7.14 Egg Size\u2013Egg Number Trade-Off in Fence Lizards Western fence lizards in northern populations produced (A) larger clutches and (B) smaller eggs than those in southern populations. The arrow points to the average for each population. (After B. Sinervo. 1990. Evolution 44: 279\u2013294.) In order to determine the consequences of egg size for offspring performance, Sinervo raised fence lizard eggs in the laboratory. He artificially reduced the size of some of the eggs by using a syringe to remove some yolk from them. To control for any possible effects of this method on egg development, he inserted a syringe into some other eggs but did not remove any yolk. These eggs that had been poked, but not reduced, developed at the same rate as unmanipulated eggs, indicating that insertion of the syringe was not the cause of differences between unmanipulated and reduced eggs. Sinervo found that the reduced eggs developed faster than the unmanipulated eggs but produced smaller hatchlings. These small hatchlings grew faster than their larger siblings, but they were not able to sprint as fast to escape from predators. Many of the differences between the lizards hatched from the reduced eggs and from the unmanipulated eggs echoed observed differences between populations with naturally differing egg sizes. Sinervo speculated that the differences between populations in egg and hatchling size may be the result of selection favoring faster sprint speeds in the south, where there may be more predators, or of selection favoring earlier hatching and faster growth in the north, where the growing season is shorter. There are trade-offs between current reproduction and other life history traits As we\u2019ve seen, when parents produce more offspring, their investment per offspring may decline. Such a decline can have various effects on the offspring, including reduced survival (as in lesser black-backed gulls) and reduced size (as in western fence lizards). The allocation of resources to reproduction can also affect the parent. Indeed, allocating resources to reproduction can decrease an individual\u2019s growth rate, its survival rate, or its potential for future reproduction. For example, a trade-off between current reproduction and survival has been documented in studies that examine how life history traits differ among species.", "In one such study, Ricklefs (1977) observed a trade-off between annual fecundity (as measured by the number of offspring raised to maturity) and annual survivorship in birds (FIGURE 7.15A). Trade-offs between reproduction and survival have also been observed within a species. For example, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, males spend more time and energy courting unmated females than they spend courting recently mated females. Partridge and Farquhar (1981) tested whether such differences in courtship activity affected the longevity of male fruit flies. Males were kept with eight virgin females per day or with eight previously inseminated females per day. In the absence of sexual activity, a male\u2019s life span is correlated positively with his size, so Partridge and Farquhar also recorded the size of each male. Among males of any particular size, males kept with virgin females had a shorter life span than did males kept with inseminated females (FIGURE 7.15B), showing a cost (reduced life span) of sexual activity among males of this species. FIGURE 7.15 Trade-Offs between Reproduction and Survival (A) In a comparison of 14 different bird species, the annual survival rate declines as annual fecundity increases. (B) Life span versus size (thorax length in millimeters) for male Drosophila kept with eight virgin females or eight previously mated females. Regression lines represent average male life spans. (A after R. E. Ricklefs. 1977. Am Nat 111: 453\u2013478; B after L. Partridge and M. Farquhar. 1981. Nature 294: 580\u2013582.) In (B), what is the average life span of male flies with a 0.8-mm thorax kept with virgin females? How does this compare with that of males of the same size kept with previously mated females? Similarly, evidence for a trade-off between current reproduction and growth has been found in mollusks, insects, mammals (including humans), fishes, amphibians, and reptiles (see citations in Barringer et al. 2013). A trade-off between reproduction and growth has also been observed in many plants, including Douglas fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii) (FIGURE 7.16). Note that by allocating resources to reproduction instead of growth, an individual will reproduce at a smaller size than it would if it had continued to grow and reproduced at a later time (when it was larger). Small individuals often produce fewer offspring than do large individuals, so this observation suggests that allocating resources to current reproduction might decrease an individual\u2019s potential for future reproduction. This trade-off has also received empirical support, as you can explore in ANALYZING DATA 7.1. FIGURE 7.16 A Reproduction versus Growth Trade-Off The thickness of annual growth rings (a measure of growth rate) declines in Douglas fir trees that produce many cones. (After S. Eis et al. 1965. Can J Bot 43: 1553\u20131559.) ANALYZING DATA 7.1 Lars Gustafsson and Tomas P\u00e4rt (1990)* studied a population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) on the Swedish island of Gotland. Gustafsson and P\u00e4rt monitored the survival and reproduction of each bird throughout its entire life. They noted that some females reproduced for the first time when they were 1 year old (\u201cearly breeders\u201d), while others reproduced for the first time when they were 2 years old (\u201clate breeders\u201d). The average number of eggs laid by early breeders and late breeders are reported in the table.

These results were based on field observations. What are the limitations of such data? Propose an experiment to test whether there is a cost of reproduction in females that reduces their potential for future reproduction.

Self-Assessment 7.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 7.3 Organisms face different selection pressures at different life cycle stages. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 7.3.1 Contrast the benefits and costs associated with small size in early life cycle stages.", "7.3.2 Explain how adaptations at specific stages in a complex life cycle may benefit the species. Life Cycle Evolution In Concept 7.1, we saw that an organism\u2019s size and form may vary greatly over the course of its life cycle. Each life cycle stage may have different habitat preferences, food preferences, and vulnerability to predation. These differences suggest that different morphologies and behaviors are adaptive at different life cycle stages. Differences in selection pressures over the course of the life cycle are responsible for some of the most distinctive patterns in the life histories of organisms. Small size has benefits and drawbacks Small, early life cycle stages can be particularly vulnerable to predation because there are many predators that are big enough to consume them (although for some predators, small prey may be more difficult to detect). These small stages may also be poor competitors for food and thus more susceptible to environmental perturbations that diminish food supply, because they have little storage capacity for energy and nutrients to help them withstand starvation. These vulnerabilities are typically counterbalanced by behavioral, morphological, and physiological adaptations. Furthermore, in some organisms, small, mobile early stages can perform essential functions that are not possible for large adult stages. Here, we examine how organisms protect small-sized life history stages and the important functions those stages can provide. PARENTAL INVESTMENT In many organisms, the parents\u2019 main investment in their offspring is the provisioning of the eggs or embryos. Animals add yolk to their eggs, which helps their offspring survive and grow through the small, vulnerable stages of life. Female kiwis, for example, produce one very yolky egg at a time; the egg is so large that it makes up 15%\u201320% of the bird\u2019s body size (FIGURE 7.17A). During the month that it takes her to make the egg, the female kiwi eats about three times as much as when she is not producing an egg. In many invertebrate groups, species with yolkier eggs develop more rapidly, and require less food during development, than those with less yolky eggs. Another pattern common among invertebrates is investment in energetically expensive egg coverings that protect the offspring during development. Plants provision the fertilized embryos in their seeds with endosperm, nutrient-rich material that sustains the developing embryo and often the young seedling. The starchy white part of corn kernels and the milk and meat of coconuts are examples of endosperm. FIGURE 7.17 Parental Investment (A) This X-ray photograph shows the size of a kiwi egg in proportion to the female\u2019s body size. (B) A male horned land frog (Sphenophryne cornuta) carries its young on its back, from tadpole stage to small offspring, as shown here. Another mechanism for protecting small, vulnerable offspring is parental care. Birds and mammals are the most familiar examples of parental care because they invest large amounts of time and energy in protecting and feeding their relatively helpless offspring. Some fishes, reptiles, amphibians (FIGURE 7.17B), and invertebrates also guard or brood their embryos and hatchlings, protecting them until they are big enough to be less vulnerable. DISPERSAL AND DORMANCY Although small offspring are vulnerable to many hazards, they are also well suited for several important functions, including dispersal and dormancy. Dispersal\u2014the movement of organisms or propagules from their birthplace\u2014is a key feature in the life history of all organisms. Even in organisms such as plants, fungi, and many marine invertebrates that are sessile or move very little as adults, the life cycle typically includes a stage in which dispersal occurs. The small pollen, seeds, spores, or larvae of these organisms can be carried long distances by water or wind or, in the case of pollen and seeds, by animals. In general, smaller propagules disperse more readily and can travel farther in a given amount of time. Dispersal provides a number of potential advantages: for example, it can reduce competition among close relatives, and it can allow organisms to reach new areas where they can grow and reproduce. In some circumstances, dispersal can increase the chance of escaping regions of high mortality, as when pathogens and other natural enemies are abundant at the location from which organisms disperse. The ability of an organism to disperse can also have important evolutionary consequences. For example, Hansen (1978) compared the fossil records of extinct marine snails with typical swimming larvae with those of species that had lost their swimming larval stages and developed directly into crawling juveniles.", "He found that the species without swimming larvae tended to have smaller geographic distributions and were more prone to extinction (FIGURE 7.18). Hansen attributed these differences to differences in dispersal ability. Species with swimming larvae would have been able to move greater distances and hence would have had more broadly distributed populations that were less vulnerable to random events that could lead to extinction. FIGURE 7.18 Developmental Mode and Species Longevity Species of marine snails that undergo direct development without a swimming larval stage (nonplanktonic) have become extinct more rapidly than those with swimming larvae (planktonic). (After T. A. Hansen. 1978. Science 199: 885\u2013887.) Small size also makes eggs and embryos well suited to dormancy, a state of suspended growth and development in which an organism can survive unfavorable conditions. Many seeds are capable of long periods of dormancy before germination, which in extreme cases can last up to thousands of years. Many bacteria, protists, and animals can also undergo various forms of dormancy. The brine shrimp eggs that children purchase as \u201csea monkeys,\u201d for example, are in a dormant state that allows them to survive out of water, often for years. In general, small seeds, eggs, and embryos are better suited to dormancy than large multicellular organisms because they do not have to expend as much metabolic energy to stay alive. However, some animals do enter dormancy in mature stages in response to stressful environmental conditions (as described in Concept 4.2). Complex cycles may result from stage-specific selection pressures Organisms with complex life cycles have multiple life stages, each adapted to its habitat and habits. This flexibility may be one of the reasons that complex life cycles are so common in so many groups of organisms. Because separate life history stages can evolve independently in response to size- and habitat-specific selection pressures, complex life cycles can minimize the drawbacks of small, vulnerable early stages. LARVAL FUNCTION AND ADAPTATION Functional specialization of particular life stages is a common feature of complex life cycles. Having multiple stages with largely independent morphological features can result in a pairing of particular functions with particular stages. Such a pairing can reduce some of the trade-offs that result from simultaneously optimizing multiple functions. An example of this type of specialization occurs in many insects with complex life cycles. Such insects spend their entire larval stage in a very small area\u2014sometimes on a single plant. Insect larvae such as caterpillars and grubs are specialized eating and growing machines. They spend almost all of their time taking in food and turning it into body mass, without forming many complex morphological structures other than mandibles (chewing mouthparts or \u201cjaws\u201d). Once they have accumulated sufficient mass, these larvae metamorphose into adult butterflies, moths, and beetles, whose main function is often to disperse, find a mate, and reproduce. In extreme cases, such as mayflies, the adults are incapable of feeding and live only the few hours or days it takes them to reproduce. Marine invertebrate larvae are also specialized for feeding, although they perform this function while dispersing on ocean currents. For example, the larvae of many mollusks (such as snails and clams) and echinoderms (such as sea urchins and sea stars) have intricate feeding structures that cover most of the larval body. These structures, called ciliated bands, are ridges covered in cilia that beat in coordinated patterns to catch tiny food particles and move them, like a conveyer belt, toward the mouth. The ciliated bands wind and fold their way around the larval bodies, many of which have extra lobes or arms that support and elongate the ciliated bands. In sea urchins, the longer the larval arms, and the longer the ciliated band, the more efficiently the larvae are able to feed (Hart and Strathmann 1994). Other specialized larval structures can help to protect small life cycle stages from being eaten by other organisms. Examples include the toxin-bearing spines of some caterpillars, the head spines of crab larvae (FIGURE 7.19), and the setae or bristles of polychaete worm larvae, which deter some predators by making the larva a large and uncomfortable mouthful. FIGURE 7.19 Specialized Defensive Structures in Marine Invertebrate Larvae The planktonic (floating) larvae of the sand crab Corystes cassivelaunus have defensive head spines that can make them difficult for fish to eat. TIMING OF LIFE CYCLE SHIFTS Most organisms with complex life cycles use different habitats and food resources at different life stages.", "Such shifts can occur abruptly, as in organisms that undergo metamorphosis, but they can also occur more gradually. Regardless of the speed with which changes in habitat and food preferences occur, different-sized and different-aged individuals of the same species may have very different ecological roles. We\u2019ll use the term niche shift to refer to such size-or age-specific changes in an organism\u2019s ecological function or habitat. (As we\u2019ll see in Concept 9.5, an organism\u2019s ecological niche consists of the physical and biological conditions that the organism needs to grow, survive, and reproduce.) In species in which an abrupt metamorphosis occurs at the transition between life cycle stages, the organism spends relatively little time in vulnerable stages that are intermediate between larva and adult. In theory, there should be an optimal time to undergo metamorphosis, or any niche shift, that maximizes survival over the course of the life cycle. Thus, we might expect a niche shift to occur when the organism reaches a size at which conditions are more favorable for its survival or growth in the adult habitat than in the larval habitat. Dahlgren and Eggleston (2000) tested this idea for the Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), an endangered coral reef fish that spends its juvenile stages in and around large clumps of algae. Smaller juveniles spend their time hiding within the algae, whereas larger ones spend their time in rocky habitats near algal clumps. By tethering and enclosing juvenile fish of different sizes in the two habitats, Dahlgren and Eggleston were able to measure mortality and growth rates in each habitat. They found that the smaller juveniles were very vulnerable to predation in the rocky habitats, while the larger juveniles were less vulnerable and were able to grow faster in the rocky habitats. Thus, the niche shift in this species appears to be timed to maximize growth and survival, as predicted. In some cases, the larval habitat may be so favorable for growth and survival that metamorphosis is delayed\u2014or even eliminated altogether. For example, most salamanders have aquatic larvae that metamorphose into terrestrial adults, but some salamanders, such as the mole salamander Ambystoma talpoideum, can become sexually mature while retaining gills and remaining in the aquatic habitat (FIGURE 7.20). These aquatic, gilled adults are referred to as paedomorphic, which means that they result from a delay of some developmental events (loss of gills, development of lungs) relative to sexual maturation. In A. talpoideum, both aquatic paedomorphic adults and terrestrial metamorphic adults can exist in the same population. The frequency of paedomorphosis in these mixed populations seems to depend on factors such as predation, food availability, and competition\u2014all of which influence survival and growth in the aquatic habitat. FIGURE 7.20 Paedomorphosis in Salamanders The mole salamander Ambystoma talpoideum can produce both (A) paedomorphic aquatic adults and (B) terrestrial metamorphic adults.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 7.4.1 Compare the benefits of semelparity and iteroparity in the context of total lifetime reproduction of an organism. 7.4.2 Evaluate the environmental conditions that would favor the persistence of r-selected and K-selected species. 7.4.3 Describe the trade-offs in plant allocation described in Grime\u2019s competitive/stress/ruderal model. 7.4.4 Show how differences in species size or age can be accounted for in describing the allocation of energy and resources to reproduction and other life history stages. Life History Continua Ecologists have proposed several classification schemes for organizing patterns of life history traits in relation to the environment. Most of these schemes make broad generalizations about life history patterns and attempt to place them along continua between two extremes. In this section, we examine the most prominent of these schemes and discuss how they relate to one another. Some organisms reproduce only once, while others reproduce multiple times One way of classifying the reproductive diversity of organisms is by the number of reproductive events in an individual\u2019s lifetime. Semelparous species (also known as monocarpic in plants) reproduce only once in a lifetime, whereas iteroparous species (also known as polycarpic in plants) have the capacity for multiple bouts of reproduction. Many plant species complete their life cycle in a single year or less. Known as annual plants, such species are semelparous: after one season of growth, they reproduce once and die.", "A more complex example of a semelparous plant is the century plant (a common name applied to several species in the genus Agave) of North American deserts. These plants grow vegetatively for up to 30 years before undergoing a single intensive bout of sexual reproduction. When it is ready to reproduce, a century plant produces a single stalk of flowers that is up to 6 m (20 feet) tall and towers over the rest of the plant. The plant produces a large quantity of seeds from this single reproductive event. The portion of the plant that produces the tall stalk of flowers dies after reproduction; hence, it is semelparous. At the genetic level, however, a century plant individual may not die when it flowers if it also reproduces asexually, producing genetically identical clones that surround the original plant (FIGURE 7.21). In this sense, some century plants are not semelparous after all\u2014the clones survive after the flowering event and will eventually flower themselves. FIGURE 7.21 Agave: A Semelparous Plant? The Agave individual that produced the tall flowering stalk will die shortly after it flowers and so can be viewed as semelparous. But the individual that flowered also produced genetically identical clonal offspring. Thus, the genetic individual will live on after flowering, and in that sense it is not semelparous after all. A striking example of a semelparous animal is the giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini), which in its 3- to 5-year life span (relatively short for an octopus species) can reach about 8 m (25 feet) in length and weigh nearly 180 kg (400 pounds). The female of this marine invertebrate species lays a single clutch containing tens of thousands of fertilized eggs. She then broods the eggs for up to 6 months. During this time, the female does not feed at all; she is a constant presence over her eggs, cleaning and ventilating them. The female dies shortly after the eggs hatch, having exhausted herself in this intense period of parental investment. Other animals that exhibit semelparity include salmon, many spiders, and some insects such as butterflies. Why would an organism that lives multiple years only reproduce once in its lifetime? Theoretically, semelparous organisms gain an advantage in total lifetime reproductive output due to the conditions affecting the trade-off between reproduction and survival. Larger organisms have higher reproductive output, and reserving reproductive maturity to the end of the life cycle results in the highest reproductive output under certain conditions. If the probability of adult mortality is above a certain threshold, and the costs of reproduction are high even at low levels of reproductive output, then semelparity will result in higher lifetime reproductive output than iteroparity. Another reason that has been proposed for the evolution of semelparity is the benefit of producing massive amounts of offspring under high predation rates. Producing more offspring than can be consumed by predators allows some to escape and maintain the population. Most organisms do not invest so heavily in single reproductive events. Iteroparous organisms engage in multiple bouts of reproduction over the course of a lifetime. Examples of iteroparous plants are long-lived trees such as pines and spruces. Among animals, most large mammals are iteroparous. Of course, iteroparity can take a variety of forms, from plants that flower twice in a season and then die to trees that reproduce every year for centuries. Live fast and die young, or slow and steady wins the race? One of the best-known schemes for classifying life history diversity was also one of the first proposed. In 1967, Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson coined the terms r-selection and K-selection to describe two ends of a continuum of life history patterns. The \u201cr\u201d in r-selection refers to the intrinsic rate of increase of a population, a measure of how rapidly a population can grow. The term r-selection refers to selection for high population growth rates. This type of selection can occur in environments where population density is low\u2014 for example, in recently disturbed habitats that are being recolonized. In this type of habitat, genotypes that can grow and reproduce rapidly will be favored over those that cannot. In contrast, K-selection refers to selection for slower rates of increase, which occurs in populations that are at or approaching K, the carrying capacity or stable population size for the environment in which they live (see Concepts 10.3 and 10.5 for in-depth discussions of r and K).", "K-selection occurs under crowded conditions, in which genotypes that can efficiently convert food into offspring are favored. By definition, K-selected populations do not have high population growth rates, because they are already near the carrying capacity for their environment and competition for resources can be intense. One way to think of the r\u2013K continuum is as a spectrum of population growth rates, from fast to slow. Organisms at the r-selected end of the continuum are often small and have short life spans, rapid development, early maturation, low parental investment, and high rates of reproduction. Examples of this \u201clive fast, die young\u201d end of the continuum include most insects, small short-lived vertebrates such as mice, and weedy plant species. In contrast, K-selected species tend to be long-lived, develop slowly, delay maturation, invest heavily in each offspring, and have low rates of reproduction. Examples of this \u201cslow and steady\u201d end of the continuum include large mammals such as elephants and whales, reptiles such as tortoises and crocodiles, and long-lived plant species such as oak and maple trees. Like most classification schemes, the r\u2013K continuum tends to emphasize the extremes. Most life histories are intermediate between these extremes, however, and hence the r\u2013K approach is not informative in some situations. The distinction between r-selection and K-selection is perhaps most useful in comparing life histories in closely related species or species living in similar environments. For example, Braby (2002) compared three species of Australian butterflies in the genus Mycalesis. The species that occurs in the driest, least predictable habitats shows the most r-selected characteristics, including rapid development, early reproduction, production of many small eggs, and rapid population growth. In contrast, the two species found in more predictable, wet forest habitats have more K-selected characteristics. Plant life histories can be classified based on habitat characteristics In the late 1970s, Philip Grime (1977) developed a classification system specifically for plant life histories. The success of a plant species in a given habitat, he argued, is limited by two factors: stress and disturbance. Grime defined stress broadly as any external abiotic factor that limits vegetative growth. Under this definition, examples of stress include extreme temperatures, shading, low nutrient levels, and water shortages. He defined disturbance broadly as any process that destroys plant biomass; under Grime\u2019s definition, disturbance can result from biotic sources such as outbreaks of herbivorous insects or abiotic sources such as fire. If we consider that in a given habitat, stress and disturbance may each be either high or low, then there are four possible habitat types: high stress\u2013high disturbance, low stress\u2013high disturbance, low stress\u2013low disturbance, and high stress\u2013low disturbance. If we further consider that most habitats with high stress and high disturbance will not be suitable for plants, then there are three main habitat types to which plants may adapt. Grime developed a model for understanding the three plant life history patterns that correspond to these three habitat types: competitive (low stress\u2013low disturbance), ruderal (low stress\u2013high disturbance), and stress-tolerant (high stress\u2013low disturbance) (FIGURE 7.22). FIGURE 7.22 Grime\u2019s CSR Model Grime categorized plant life histories within a triangle whose axes indicate the degree of competition, disturbance, and stress in the habitat type to which plants are adapted. Intermediate life history strategies are shown in the center of the triangle. (After J. P. Grime. 1977. Am Nat 111: 1169\u20131194.) Grime defined competition between plants in a very specific manner as \u201cthe tendency of neighboring plants to utilize the same quantum of light, ion of a mineral nutrient, molecule of water, or volume of space.\u201d Under conditions of low stress and low disturbance, competitive plants that are superior in their ability to acquire light, minerals, water, and space should have a selective advantage. Grime classified plants that are adapted to habitats with high levels of disturbance and low levels of stress as ruderals. The ruderal strategy generally includes short life spans, rapid growth rates, heavy investment in seed production, and seeds that can survive in the ground for long periods until conditions are right for rapid germination and growth. Ruderal species are often called \u201cweedy\u201d species and are adapted for brief periods of intense exploitation of favorable habitats after disturbance has removed competitors. Finally, under conditions in which stress (in any form) is high and disturbance is low, stress-tolerant plants are favored.", "Although stressful conditions may vary widely across habitats, Grime identified several features of stress-tolerant plants, including but not limited to slow growth rates, evergreen foliage, slow rates of water and nutrient use, low palatability to herbivores, and an ability to respond effectively to temporarily favorable conditions. Habitats favoring stress-tolerant plants might include places where water or nutrients are scarce or temperature conditions are extreme. Grime\u2019s conceptual model posits that natural selection has resulted in three distinct yet very broad categories of life history strategies in plants. Although Grime focused on describing these three extreme strategies, he also recognized that intermediate strategies are commonly found. Indeed, various combinations of the three extreme strategies yield many possible intermediate strategies, such as competitive ruderals and stress-tolerant competitors, among others. However, the model also explicitly recognizes that there are trade-offs to the life history traits, and thus individual species can\u2019t be well adapted to all three of the evolutionary forces in the model. Life histories can be classified independent of size and time Unlike the classification schemes discussed above, an approach described by Charnov (1993) organizes life histories in a manner that removes the influence of size and time. As we saw in our discussion of the r\u2013K continuum, size and time play a critical role in traditional classifications of life histories. For example, r-selected species are characterized as smaller and more short-lived than K-selected species. But if we could control for the effects of body size and life span, then we could ask whether closely related organisms experience similar selection pressures independent of those factors. To illustrate this approach, we\u2019ll begin with the observation that the age of sexual maturity is positively correlated with life span in many species (Charnov and Berrigan 1990). Such a correlation is not surprising: species with short life spans must mature in short periods, but the same is not true of species with long life spans; hence, a positive correlation can arise automatically. One way to remove this effect of life span is to divide the average age of maturity of a species by its average life span. This division yields a dimensionless ratio\u2014that is, a ratio in which the units in the numerator (e.g., age of maturity in years) are identical to and hence cancel the units in the denominator (e.g., life span, also in years). By removing the effects of variables such as size or (in our case) time, a dimensionless ratio allows ecologists to compare the life histories of very different organisms. Charnov and Berrigan compiled data for a wide range of bird, mammal, lizard, and fish species. To remove the effects of life span, they focused their analyses on the age of maturity: life span dimensionless ratio, which they denoted c (FIGURE 7.23). Their analysis revealed that c differed between ectothermic (fishes, lizards, and snakes) and endothermic (mammals and birds) organisms. For example, if we compare organisms with a given life span, the values of c indicate that it takes fishes three to six times longer to mature than mammals and birds, while it takes lizards and snakes two to four times longer. Such results can highlight major differences in the life histories of different groups of organisms, thus helping to make sense of life history variation. FIGURE 7.23 A Dimensionless Life History Analysis The average age at which females reach sexual maturity is plotted against the average female life span for different groups of organisms. The slope of each line yields the dimensionless ratio c: the average age of maturity divided by the average life span. (After E. L. Charnov and D. Berrigan. 1990. Evol Ecol 4: 273\u2013275.) In groups of organisms for which c > 1, do most individuals live long enough to reproduce? Explain. While this dimensionless approach has some advantages over classification schemes that incorporate time and size, it also has potential disadvantages. Indeed, an emphasis on constant or \u201cinvariant\u201d dimensionless life history parameters has been questioned by Nee et al. (2005), who argue that life history parameters can appear to be invariant simply as an artifact of the mathematical methods used to estimate them. Overall, there are many ways to organize the vast diversity of life history strategies. The classification scheme that is most useful in any given case will depend on the organisms and questions of interest.", "For example, the r\u2013K continuum has a long history of use in relating life history characteristics to population growth characteristics, whereas Grime\u2019s scheme may be most appropriate for life history comparisons between groups of plants. Alternatively, dimensionless analyses may be most helpful when comparing life histories across broad ranges of taxonomy or size. Self-Assessment 7.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Nemo Grows Up Why does a male clownfish that has lost his mate become a female rather than simply finding a new partner? As we have seen, large individuals often produce more offspring than do smaller individuals. In clownfish, the number of eggs an individual can produce is proportional to its body size. Thus, larger individuals can produce more eggs and presumably have a better chance of having some of their offspring survive. Smaller individuals are more easily able to make sperm cells, which are smaller and take fewer resources to produce. For these reasons, in clownfish and in many other animals, females are larger than males. Changes in sex during the course of the life cycle, called sequential hermaphroditism, are found in 18 fish families and in many invertebrate groups (FIGURE 7.24). Researchers have hypothesized that these sex changes should be timed to take advantage of the maximum reproductive potentials of the different sexes at different sizes, and in some cases they appear to do so. This hypothesis helps to explain sex changes in clownfish and the timing of those changes relative to size, but it leaves unanswered the question of how a hierarchy of clownfish is maintained within each anemone. FIGURE 7.24 Sequential Hermaphroditism The moon wrasse (Thalassoma lunare) exhibits sequential hermaphroditism. Wrasses live among coral reefs in tropical and temperate seas. In some species, a change in sex, from female to male, may be accompanied by a change in color. As a graduate student at Cornell University, Peter Buston set out to answer this question. He conducted experiments on a clownfish species, Amphiprion percula, that lives on reefs in Papua New Guinea. He found that each clownfish maintains the strict size hierarchy by remaining smaller than the fish ahead of it in line and bigger than the one behind it (FIGURE 7.25). If a fish grows to be too close in size to one of its anemone-mates, a fight results, which usually ends in the smaller fish being killed or expelled from the anemone. Buston suggested that the clownfish regulate their own growth to prevent such conflicts. FIGURE 7.25 Clownfish Size Hierarchies Clownfish within an anemone regulate their growth to maintain a hierarchy in which each fish belongs to a distinct size class. Anemones may be home to between one and six fish, and the size of each fish is determined by that fish\u2019s rank and the size of the group in which it lives. (After P. M. Buston. 2003a. Nature 424: 145\u2013146.) Buston also manipulated clownfish groups by removing the breeding males from anemones and measuring the growth of the remaining individuals. He found that the largest nonbreeder grew only enough to take the place of the breeding male; it avoided growing too big and threatening the female\u2019s dominance. Similarly, the next largest nonbreeder grew only enough to take the place of the fish that had become the breeding male, and so on. Thus, clownfish avoid conflict within their social groups by exerting remarkable control over their growth rates and reproductive status. CONNECTIONS in NATURE TERRITORIALITY, COMPETITION, AND LIFE HISTORY The physiology of clownfish growth regulation is not understood, but a more pressing ecological and evolutionary question is why the size hierarchy is maintained. What makes small clownfish bide their time as nonbreeders under the dominance of a single breeding female and male? The answer may lie in the clownfish\u2019s dependence on the protection of anemones for survival. Clownfish are brightly colored, and they are poor swimmers. Outside the anemone\u2019s stinging tentacles, they are easy prey for larger fishes on the reef. Thus, expulsion from the anemone is often a death sentence. So the stakes are very high in conflicts between fish within an anemone: the loser will probably die without reproducing. This situation exerts strong selection pressure on the fish to avoid conflicts by regulating their growth.", "In evolutionary terms, growth regulation mechanisms have evolved because individuals that avoid growing to a size that leads to conflict with other fish have higher survival and reproductive rates (we described this process of adaptive evolution in Concept 6.2). Buston (2003b, 2004) demonstrated that remaining in an anemone as a nonbreeder is more advantageous than trying to leave the anemone and find a new one. Anemones are a limited resource for the clownfish, and those that bide their time once they find an anemone experience the highest lifetime fitness. The scarcity of anemones also results in competition among clownfish at a key stage in their life history. As we have seen, hatchling clownfish disperse from their anemone and spend their early life stages in the open ocean. When they return to the reef, their survival depends on their choice of an anemone. The number of fish in an anemone is generally correlated with the anemone\u2019s size. However, Buston found that at any given time some anemones are undersaturated, meaning that they have room for more fish. If a juvenile fish is lucky enough to enter such an anemone, it is allowed to stay, and it enters the line of succession toward becoming a breeder. If the juvenile enters a saturated anemone, however, it is expelled, and it often dies before it can find another anemone. Similar settlement lotteries play out in many organisms that live in crowded habitats and compete for space. For example, in environments such as tropical rainforests, where many long-lived tree species compete for limited space and sunlight, the success of any one seed or seedling can depend on chance events, such as the death of a nearby large tree that creates a gap in the canopy (Denslow 1987). As we\u2019ll see in Concept 19.3, such settlement lotteries can play an important role in maintaining the diversity of species found in highly competitive environments. Behavioral Ecology KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 8.1 Evolution is the basis for adaptive behavior. CONCEPT 8.2 Animals make behavioral choices that enhance their energy gain and reduce their risk of becoming prey. CONCEPT 8.3 Mating behaviors reflect the costs and benefits of parental investment and mate defense. CONCEPT 8.4 There are advantages and disadvantages to living in groups. Baby Killers: A Case Study Lions are unique among cats in that they live in social groups called prides. A typical lion pride contains anywhere from 2 to 18 adult females and their cubs, along with a few adult males. The adult females form the core of the pride, and they are closely related: they are mothers, daughters, aunts, and cousins. The adult males in a pride may be closely related as well (e.g., brothers or cousins), or they may be a coalition of unrelated individuals that help one another. The lions in a pride hunt cooperatively, and the females often feed, care for, and protect one another\u2019s cubs. But life in a pride has a dark side as well. The male in FIGURE 8.1 is killing one of the cubs in his pride, a behavior that seems both horrific and puzzling. Why do adult male lions do this? To shed light on this murderous behavior, let\u2019s consider some aspects of the life history of lions in more detail. FIGURE 8.1 Killing the Cub The male African lion shown here is attempting to kill the juvenile offspring of another male; such attempts often succeed. Why might this behavior be evolutionarily adaptive for the murdering male? As young adults, male lions are driven from the pride into which they were born. A group of young males expelled from a pride may stay together to form a \u201cbachelor pride.\u201d Bachelor prides may also consist of males from different prides that meet and begin to hunt together. By the time they are 4 or 5 years old, the young males in a bachelor pride are large and strong enough to challenge the adult males of an established pride. If their challenge is successful, the new males drive off the \u201cdethroned\u201d males, and they typically try to kill any young cubs that were recently fathered by those males. Although the females fight back, the new males often succeed in killing cubs. If a female\u2019s cubs are killed, she becomes sexually receptive soon thereafter. In contrast, it can take up to 2 years for a female with cubs to resume sexual cycling. This delay in sexual receptivity can help us to understand the behavior of the incoming males.", "On average, incoming males remain with a pride for just 2 years before they are defeated and displaced by a new group of younger males. By killing cubs when he enters a pride, a new male increases the chance that he will reproduce before he is displaced by a younger male. As a result, incoming males that commit infanticide should leave more offspring than do males that do not commit infanticide. This logic suggests that infanticidal behavior by males is favored by natural selection, leading us to expect that it would be common in lion populations (which it is). Infanticide is just one of the seemingly odd behaviors we see in animals. Fruit flies, for example, sometimes lay their eggs in food sources that contain high concentrations of ethyl alcohol, a toxic substance. Why do they do this? And why is it that the females of many species are more \u201cchoosy\u201d than the males in selecting a mate\u2014and yet in some species, such as the birds in FIGURE 8.2, the males are choosy and the females try to mate with as many males as possible? For answers, we turn to the strange and wonderful world of animal behavior. FIGURE 8.2 Females That Fight to Mate with Choosy Males Red phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius) females (the two birds on the left) are larger and more colorful than the males of their species (on the right). In this species, the females fight over the right to mate with the males\u2014and the males choose which females they will mate with. Introduction In nature, many of an animal\u2019s activities are centered on obtaining food, finding mates, or avoiding predators, all critical to the ecological success of a species. The behavioral decisions an animal makes often play key roles in its ability to meet these three critical needs. Consider the dilemma facing a young male lion deciding whether to challenge the adult males of a lion pride. An incorrect decision by the young male could lead to serious injury or death (if he is defeated in combat), or it could lead to a missed opportunity to join a pride and reproduce (if he delays combat unnecessarily). Likewise, a young trout that remains close to a hiding place while feeding may increase its chance of escaping predators, but in so doing, it may forgo the opportunity to forage in areas that are rich with food but lacking in protective cover. As these examples suggest, the behavioral decisions made by individuals have very real costs and benefits that affect their ability to survive and reproduce. These examples also highlight the fact that animal behaviors take place in an ecological setting: the behavioral decisions of the lion and the trout are made in the presence of competitors and predators. These behaviors affect survival and reproduction, and are central themes in the field of behavioral ecology, the study of the ecological and evolutionary basis of animal behavior. Behavioral ecology is a dynamic field, broad in scope. In this chapter we emphasize three aspects of behavior: foraging behavior, mating behavior, and living in groups (visit the companion website for Suggested Readings on behavioral ecology). Let\u2019s begin by taking a closer look at the types of questions that behavioral ecologists address in their research. CONCEPT 8.1 Evolution is the basis for adaptive behavior. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 8.1.1 Explain how natural selection can lead to the evolution of adaptive behaviors. 8.1.2 Illustrate how the environment can interact with genetics to influence behavior. An Evolutionary Approach to Behavior Researchers studying animal behavior can seek to answer questions at several different levels of explanation. You might ask, for example, why a robin hopping around your yard periodically tilts its head to the side. It turns out that robins do this because their sensory and nervous systems can detect the faint sounds of worms moving through the soil. (You can hear those sounds in WEB EXTENSION 8.1.) Thus, one explanation for the robin\u2019s behavior might focus on how the required sensory equipment works. Furthermore, hunting by listening might enable a robin to detect otherwise hard-to-find prey. Hence, a second explanation of the robin\u2019s head-tilting behavior might focus on whether listening for worms increases the efficiency of foraging, thus enhancing the bird\u2019s survival and reproductive success. If so, then this behavior may have become common over time because it was favored by natural selection.", "Notice that the first explanation we mentioned addresses a \u201chow\u201d question about behavior: it looks within an individual bird to explain how the head-tilting behavior functions. By focusing on events that take place during an animal\u2019s lifetime, this approach seeks to explain behaviors in terms of their immediate or proximate causes. In contrast, the second explanation addresses a \u201cwhy\u201d question about behavior: it examines the evolutionary and historical reasons for a particular behavior. By addressing previous events that influenced the features of an animal as we know it today, this approach seeks to explain behaviors in terms of their evolutionary or ultimate causes. Although behavioral ecologists examine both proximate and ultimate causes in their research, they are primarily concerned with ultimate explanations of animal behaviors. We will follow their lead in this chapter, focusing on selected ultimate explanations for why animals behave as they do. We\u2019ll begin by examining how natural selection affects behavior. Natural selection shapes animal behaviors over time As we\u2019ve seen in earlier chapters of this book, an individual\u2019s ability to survive and reproduce depends in part on its behavior. Therefore, natural selection should favor individuals whose behaviors make them efficient at activities such as foraging, obtaining mates, and avoiding predators. To explore this idea further, recall from Concept 6.1 that natural selection is not a random process. Instead, when natural selection operates, individuals with particular traits consistently leave more offspring than do other individuals because of those traits. If the traits that confer advantage are determined in part by genes, then individuals that have those traits will pass them to their offspring. In such cases, natural selection can cause adaptive evolution, a process in which traits that confer survival or reproductive advantages tend to increase in frequency over time. Applying these ideas to heritable behaviors, we would predict that as an outcome of natural selection, individuals should exhibit behaviors that improve their chances of surviving and reproducing. As illustrated by the practice of infanticide by male lions\u2014a behavior that increases a male\u2019s chance of reproducing before he is displaced by a younger male\u2014animal behaviors are often consistent with this prediction. Further support comes from studies that have documented adaptive behavioral change as it took place. For example, Silverman and Bieman (1993) reported an adaptive behavioral change in populations of the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) (FIGURE 8.3). In the 1980s, efforts to control this cockroach often used baits that combined an insecticide with a feeding stimulant, such as glucose. Initially, these baits were highly effective, killing the vast majority of the cockroaches that encountered them. Over time, however, a novel behavioral adaptation, glucose aversion, emerged in some cockroach populations. Cockroaches from these populations avoided feeding on glucose, causing the baits to become ineffective. This change in the feeding behavior of German cockroaches is heritable and is controlled by a single gene (Silverman and Bieman 1993). In particular, glucose aversion appears to result from mutations that affect taste receptor neurons. In individuals that exhibit glucose aversion, the presence of glucose activates taste receptor neurons that in other individuals are activated only by bitter substances (Wada-Katsumata et al. 2013). FIGURE 8.3 An Adaptive Behavioral Response Feeding behavior in two populations of the German cockroach (Blattella germanica), one of which (wild type) had no prior exposure to insecticides, while the other had been exposed to insecticides. Cockroaches could choose to eat plain (unsweetened) agar, agar that contained one of three sources of sugar\u2014 fructose, glucose, or corn syrup (which contains both fructose and glucose)\u2014or both. The diets the cockroaches selected were characterized by a feeding index ranging from 1.0 (indicating that 100% of their diet consisted of agar containing glucose) to \u20131.0 (indicating that 100% of their diet consisted of plain agar). Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After J. Silverman and D. N. Bieman. 1993. J Insect Physiol 39: 925\u2013933.) Give both a proximate and an ultimate explanation for glucose aversion in B. germanica. The increase in the frequency of glucose aversion in populations of cockroaches exposed to baits containing glucose shows how natural selection under different environmental conditions can shape behaviors over time. But for selection to have this effect\u2014and for ultimate explanations of behavior to be convincing\u2014a behavior must be determined at least in part by genes. Because later sections of this chapter emphasize ultimate explanations of behavior, we turn now to a closer examination of this key underlying assumption: that animal behaviors are determined by genes.", "Behaviors are determined by genes and by environmental conditions Many characteristics of an animal, including aspects of its behavior, are influenced both by genes and by environmental conditions (see Concepts 6.2 and 7.1). Later in this chapter, we\u2019ll discuss how certain features of the environment, such as the presence of predators, can alter an animal\u2019s behavior. Here we\u2019ll focus primarily on genes, but it is essential to bear in mind that environmental conditions also affect most behaviors, even those that are strongly influenced by genes. The glucose aversion behavior of cockroaches that we have just discussed is heritable and appears to be controlled by a single gene. However, this behavior is a relatively simple one\u2014a cockroach either avoids glucose or it does not. We might expect that such a specific and relatively simple behavioral choice could be controlled by one or a few genes. But what about more complex behaviors? Weber et al. (2013) examined the genetics of one such behavior, burrow construction in mice. They studied two closely related species, oldfield mice (Peromyscus polionotus) and deer mice (P. maniculatus). In the wild, oldfield mice build complex burrows with a long entrance tunnel and an escape tunnel, while deer mice build much simpler burrows (FIGURE 8.4). Most other Peromyscus species construct simple burrows, or no burrows at all. The complex burrows built by oldfield mice are unique, and they may be an adaptation to living in open habitats that provide little protective cover: although snakes and other predators might spot oldfield mice easily in such habitats, the length of the burrow entrance tunnel and the presence of an escape tunnel might help a mouse evade a pursuing predator. FIGURE 8.4 Distinctive Mouse Burrows (A) The oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) constructs a complex burrow with a long entrance tunnel and an escape tunnel. (B) The deer mouse (P. maniculatus) constructs a simpler burrow, with a short entrance tunnel and no escape tunnel. (After E. Callaway. 2013. Nature 493: 284.) Weber and colleagues wanted to evaluate the contribution of genes to the unique burrowing behavior of oldfield mice. To do this, they took advantage of the facts that oldfield mice and deer mice can interbreed to form viable and fertile hybrid offspring (as can some other closely related species, such as wolves and coyotes) and that both species exhibit their usual burrowing behaviors in a laboratory enclosure. They examined the burrowing behaviors of oldfield mice, deer mice, and two different types of hybrid offspring: first-generation (F ) hybrids (offspring of matings between oldfield mice and deer mice) and later-generation 1 backcross hybrids (offspring of matings between F1 individuals and deer mice). The results indicated that the complex burrowing behavior of oldfield mice is affected by several different DNA regions. As expected, all of the oldfield mice and none of the deer mice built escape tunnels. In addition, 100% of the F1 hybrid mice built escape tunnels, and roughly 50% of the backcross mice built escape tunnels (FIGURE 8.5). These results and additional genetic mapping by Weber et al. indicate that a single chromosomal location, or genetic locus, controls whether the mice build escape tunnels, and that the genes for tunnel building behavior are dominant. The complex burrow-building behavior of oldfield mice appears to have evolved as a combination of two simpler behaviors (construction of long entrance tunnels and escape tunnel construction). FIGURE 8.5 The Genetics of Escape Tunnel Construction The graph shows the proportions of deer mice, oldfield mice, F1 hybrids, and backcross mice (i.e., offspring of a hybrid mouse and a deer mouse) that constructed burrows with escape tunnels. (After J. N. Weber et al. 2013. Nature 493: 402\u2013405.) Do the colors shown in the pie charts match what you would expect based on the types of mice used in this study? Explain. The study by Weber et al. is unusual in its use of both behavioral observations and genetic mapping to examine how genes affect a complex behavior of ecological importance. Although relatively few studies have identified genes that affect other such behaviors, a wide range of behaviors are known to be heritable, and typically those behaviors are influenced by multiple genes (van Oers and Sinn 2013). Overall, it is clear that genes affect many behaviors, but it is important to keep a few caveats in mind. In particular, it is usually a mistake to assume that behaviors are under the control of one or a few genes.", "It is also wrong to assume that an individual that has an allele associated with a certain behavior will always perform that behavior\u2014like an inflexible robot under the strict control of its genes. Instead, two individuals with identical alleles may behave differently. Moreover, as we\u2019ll discuss below, individuals often change their behavior when in different environments (see ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 8.1 for examples of behavioral change in response to a warming climate). Nevertheless, by assuming that genes affect behaviors and that natural selection has molded behaviors over time, we can make specific predictions about how animals will behave in particular situations. Even when these predictions turn out to be wrong, an evolutionary view of behavior provides a productive approach to the study of animal behavior that can help us understand how animals interact in nature.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 8.2.1 Explain the theory of optimal foraging by outlining the factors that influence the net benefit of foraging. 8.2.2 Summarize what determines optimal foraging in an area with different food densities with reference to the marginal value theorem. 8.2.3 Describe how the presence of predators can impact foraging behavior. Foraging Behavior As we\u2019ve seen, there are costs and benefits to the behavioral choices that animals make, which suggests that their behaviors have been shaped by natural selection over time. In this section, we\u2019ll consider this line of reasoning in more detail, focusing on one of the central activities of all animals: obtaining food. Optimal foraging theory addresses behavioral choices that enhance the rate of energy gain The availability of food varies greatly over space and time. For example, some areas of a landscape may have a higher density of prey or host individuals than others due to differences in water or nutrient availability associated with differences in local conditions. In addition, some food items may be easier to obtain than others because of factors other than abundance, including how easy they are to detect, capture, or subdue. If energy is in short supply, then animals moving through a heterogeneous landscape should invest the majority of their time in acquiring the highest-quality food resources possible in places where they are most abundant and that are the shortest distance away. Such behavior should maximize the amount of energy obtained per unit of feeding time and minimize the risks involved, such as that of becoming food for another animal. These ideas are the essence of the theory of optimal foraging, which proposes that animals will maximize the amount of energy acquired per unit of feeding time. Optimal foraging theory relies on the assumption that natural selection acts on the foraging behavior of animals to maximize their rate of energy gain. According to one formulation of optimal foraging theory, the profitability of a food item to a foraging animal depends on the net amount of energy it gets from the food relative to the amount of time it spends obtaining and processing the food, or, in mathematical terms, where Enet is the net energy obtained from a food source, Egross is the total energy from a food source, h is the time spent handling the food source, and s is the time spent searching for the food. The net energy value is determined by the energy value of the food item as well as the energy expended in handling and searching for it. Food that requires substantial handling (e.g., a tough nut to crack or a fighting prey) will yield lower net energy than food that requires less handling. Likewise, food that is sparsely distributed will require greater searching time than food that is more abundant. Another way to consider foraging decisions is to represent the energetic consequences of foraging behavior with a simple conceptual model that describes the net amount of energy that an animal gets from its food (FIGURE 8.6). At first, the total amount of energy that an animal obtains from its food (blue curve) increases rapidly with the effort it invests\u2014that is, with the time and energy it spends searching for, capturing, subduing, and consuming food. At some point, however, a further increase in foraging effort provides relatively little additional energy, and the net energy gain begins to decrease.", "Several factors may cause this decrease, including a limitation on how much food the animal can carry or ingest. FIGURE 8.6 Conceptual Model of Optimal Foraging The net energy gained from foraging (gold curve) equals the total energy obtained from the food acquired (blue curve) minus the cumulative energy invested in acquiring that food (red curve). This simple model can be used to test whether animals forage in a manner that results in the maximum benefit, based on estimates for the total energy obtained and the cumulative energy invested. (After G. Parker and J. Smith. 1990. Nature 348: 27\u201333.) Suppose you could estimate the net energy gained at different levels of foraging effort expended by lizards eating ants in the desert. How could you use that information to test whether the lizards foraged optimally? While the models discussed here are simple, they provide a basis for making quantitative predictions about animal foraging behavior. More sophisticated models have been used to derive hypotheses that can be tested under field or laboratory conditions. An important component of these models is the currency (such as net energy gain) that is used to determine the benefit. Such models might incorporate, for example, net energy gained, time spent feeding, and risk of predation (Schoener 1971). If foraging behavior is an adaptation to limited food supplies, then we must be able to relate the benefit of that behavior to the survival and reproduction of the animal. TESTS OF OPTIMAL FORAGING THEORY Research addressing optimal foraging has focused on diet selection, selection of patches to feed in, time spent in food patches, and prey movements (Pyke et al. 1977). John Krebs and colleagues (1977) devised a unique way to evaluate whether great tits (Parus major), a common bird found throughout much of Eurasia and northern Africa, selected prey types of greatest profitability. They placed captive birds next to a moving conveyer belt carrying prey that differed in size (large and small mealworms) and in the time required to obtain them (each of the small mealworms was taped to the surface of the conveyer belt). By changing the proportions of the prey types and the distances between adjacent prey on the conveyer belt (search time), the researchers varied the profitability of the large and small mealworms. Using a model of optimal foraging and measurements of the times it took individual birds to subdue and consume the prey (handling time), they predicted how frequently the birds should select the large mealworms as encounter rates with the two prey types were varied. The birds consumed an increasing percentage of large mealworms as the relative profitability of those larger prey increased (FIGURE 8.7), just as the model predicted. FIGURE 8.7 Effect of Profitability on Food Selection Krebs and colleagues used an optimal diet selection model, along with measurements of prey handling time for individual birds, to predict the rate at which great tits (Parus major) would select large over small mealworms as their encounter rates with the two prey types were varied (expressed as the calculated ratio of profitabilities of the prey types). Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (After J. B. Krebs et al. 1977. Anim Behav 25: 30\u201338.) A field study by Meire and Ervynck (1986) focused on the diet selection of the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), a shorebird that eats bivalves (e.g., clams and mussels). Oystercatchers must find a bivalve buried in the sand, lift it out, and open it before they can eat it. For bivalves below a certain size, the net energy gain from this effort is small, setting a lower limit on the bivalve size selected by the oystercatchers. Bivalves above a certain size have thicker shells and require more effort to open, setting an upper limit on the bivalve size selected by the birds. Meire and Ervynck demonstrated that oystercatchers select prey of sizes that fall between these limits, which provide the most energy gain for the effort, despite the relatively low abundance of prey of these sizes. THE MARGINAL VALUE THEOREM Another aspect of optimal foraging theory considers the habitat in which an animal forages as a heterogeneous landscape made up of patches containing different amounts of food. To optimize its energy gain, an animal should forage in the most profitable patches\u2014those in which it can achieve the highest energy gain per unit of time. We can also consider the benefit obtained by a foraging animal from the perspective of time spent in a patch.", "Once the forager finds a profitable patch, its rate of energy gain is initially high, but that rate decreases and eventually becomes marginal as the forager depletes the food supply (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 8.8). A foraging animal should stay in a patch until the time when the rate of energy gain in that patch has declined to the average rate for the habitat (known as the giving up time), then depart for another patch. The giving up time should also be influenced by the distance to other patches. Effort must be invested in traveling to another patch, so the animal may accept a lower rate of energy gain if the distance between patches is greater. This conceptual model, called the marginal value theorem, was initially developed by Eric Charnov (1976). It can be used to evaluate the influences of distance between patches, the quality of the food in a patch, and the animal\u2019s energy extraction efficiency on the giving up time. The model has also been extended to other \u201cgiving up\u201d problems in behavioral ecology, including how long to copulate and when to cease guarding a nest and seek other mates. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 8.8 The Marginal Value Theorem The marginal value theorem assumes that a foraging animal will encounter patches containing varying amounts of food. The animal\u2019s rate of energy gain in a patch (energy gained per unit of time spent foraging) is initially high but decreases as the animal depletes the food supply in the patch. The time the animal spends in a patch should optimize its rate of energy gain. (After R. J. Cowie. 1977. Nature 268: 137\u2013139.) If prey density or prey quality is low, and the cumulative energy gain therefore levels off at a lower level, how will this influence the giving up time? One of the predictions of the marginal value theorem is that the longer the travel time between food patches, the longer an animal should spend in a patch (see Interactive Figure 8.8). This prediction was tested by Richard Cowie (1977) using a laboratory setup with great tits in a \u201cforest\u201d composed of wooden dowels. The food \u201cpatches\u201d consisted of sawdust-filled plastic cups containing mealworms. The \u201ctravel time\u201d among patches was manipulated by placing cardboard covers on top of the food cups and adjusting the ease with which they could be removed by the birds. Cowie used the marginal value theorem to predict the amount of time the birds should spend in the patches, based on the travel time between them. His results matched the model predictions fairly well (Cowie 1977) (FIGURE 8.9). Similar results have been obtained from other laboratory experiments as well as from studies in natural settings, such as James Munger\u2019s 1984 study on the behavior of horned lizards (Phrynosoma spp.) foraging for ants in the Chihuahuan Desert. FIGURE 8.9 Effect of Travel Time between Patches In a laboratory experiment, Cowie used the marginal value theorem to predict how the travel time between patches would affect the average amount of time great tits (Parus major) spent in a patch. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (After R. J. Cowie. 1977. Nature 268: 137\u2013139.) While evidence supports some aspects of optimal foraging theory, significant criticisms have been expressed. Optimal foraging theory best describes the foraging behavior of animals that feed on immobile prey and applies less well to animals feeding on mobile prey (Sih and Christensen 2001). In addition, the assumptions that energy is always in short supply and that a shortage of energy dictates foraging behavior may not always be correct. Carnivores, in particular, may not lack for food resources to the degree assumed in optimal foraging models (Jeschke 2007). Furthermore, resources other than energy may be involved in the selection of food items, particularly nutrients such as nitrogen and sodium. And as we\u2019ll see next, additional considerations for foragers include the risk of predation and the defenses of prey. Individuals often alter their foraging decisions when predators are present While the intake of food is important to an animal, what really matters from an evolutionary perspective is its production of offspring. An individual that is well fed but does not survive long enough to reproduce will not pass its genes to future generations. As this observation suggests, a forager may face trade-offs in which achieving one objective (such as eating) comes at the expense of another (survival).", "Trade-offs that affect foraging decisions may be related to predators (an herbivore may avoid an area with ample food if predators are present), environmental conditions (in the desert, a foraging animal may retreat to a burrow or shade when temperatures become too hot), or physiological conditions (a hungry animal may tolerate greater risks when foraging than will a well-fed animal). Our focus here will be on how predators affect foraging decisions. Creel and colleagues (2005) studied how the presence of wolves affected the foraging behavior of elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The researchers used GPS radio collars to track the daily movements of elk. On days when wolves were known to be present in the area, elk moved into wooded regions, which offered more protective cover but less food than the grasslands where the elk preferred to forage, but where they were more vulnerable to wolf predation. Results from a statistical analysis of elk movements provided additional evidence that elk moved into forests when wolves arrived and returned to grasslands when wolves departed (FIGURE 8.10). FIGURE 8.10 Movement Responses of Male and Female Elk Results from a statistical analysis of daily movement patterns of male (A) and female (B) elk show that the probability of finding elk in grasslands drops when wolves arrive, then rises when wolves depart. (After S. Creel et al. 2005. Ecology 86: 3387\u20133397.) Compare and contrast how male and female elk respond to the presence of wolves. Similar results have been found in aquatic environments. For example, Werner et al. (1983) examined how predators affect the foraging decisions of the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Identical sets of sunfish in three size classes (small, medium, and large) were introduced on both sides of a divided pond; a predatory fish, the largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), was also introduced on one side of the pond. The sizes of sunfish and bass were selected such that sunfish in the smallest size class would be very vulnerable to the bass predators, while sunfish in the largest size class were too large for the bass to eat. Sunfish in the larger two size classes foraged in similar ways on both sides of the pond, with their habitat choice and diet matching predictions based on optimal foraging theory; the same was true for the small sunfish on the half of the pond lacking predators. In the presence of predators, however, the small individuals increased the time they spent foraging in vegetation, a habitat that provided greater cover from largemouth bass but only one-third the rate of food intake available in more open habitats. Researchers have also tested whether a perceived risk of predation can alter foraging patterns, even in the absence of actual predation. In one such study, Zanette et al. (2011) exposed the nests of some song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to recordings of calls and sounds from their predators (such as raccoons, ravens, or hawks), while other nests were exposed to recordings of calls and sounds from nonpredators (such as seals or geese). The researchers had protected all the nests from actual predators with electric fencing and netting (the netting and other aspects of this experiment are described in more detail in WEB EXTENSION 8.2). Song sparrows exposed to recordings of predators fed their young fewer times per hour than did sparrows that heard recordings of nonpredators (FIGURE 8.11). Song sparrows that heard predators also built their nests in denser, thornier vegetation and spent less time incubating their eggs than did sparrows exposed to recordings of nonpredators. We\u2019ll explore the consequences of such behavioral changes in Connections in Nature at the end of this chapter. FIGURE 8.11 Young Receive Less Food When Parents Fear Predators The number of times per hour that song sparrow parents feed their offspring drops when the parents are exposed to recordings of sounds made by predators. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After L. Y. Zanette et al. 2011. Science 334: 1398\u20131401.) The song sparrow, elk, and sunfish examples are representative of hundreds of other studies showing that prey alter their foraging behavior in the presence of predators (Lima 1998; Verdolin 2006). As we\u2019ll see next, when predators are present, prey make other behavioral changes that can reduce their chance of being eaten. Prey exhibit behaviors that can prevent detection or deter predators Predators can exert strong selection on prey populations. As a result of such selection pressures, prey species have evolved a broad range of defenses against their predators.", "We\u2019ll focus here on antipredator behaviors; in Concept 13.2, we\u2019ll discuss other forms of defense, including physical defenses, toxins, and morphological forms of camouflage. Antipredator behaviors include those that can help prey avoid being seen, detect predators, prevent attack, or escape once attacked (FIGURE 8.12). Behaviors that can help prey avoid being seen include hiding, remaining still when predators are nearby, and performing risky activities (such as foraging) during times of day when predators are not active. Other animals make themselves difficult to see by covering their bodies with material that blends into their environment, such as portions of flower petals (in some caterpillars) or feces. With respect to detecting predators, prey often remain highly vigilant for predators, and some birds, lizards, and mammals can remain alert even while sleeping (see Figure 8.12B). There is also a wide variety of ways that prey seek to prevent attack once they are seen. For example, juvenile decorator crabs (Libinia dubia) attach to their bodies bits of an alga that local fishes find unpalatable, an action that was found to increase their rate of survival (Stachowicz and Hay 1999); older crabs, which are too large for the fish to eat, do not engage in this behavior. When threatened, some prey make sudden movements or display markings that confuse the predator, as illustrated by the display of eye spots shown in Figure 8.12C. Some prey send predators a signal, in effect conveying, \u201cI see you, I\u2019m faster than you, so don\u2019t bother to attack me.\u201d The stotting behavior of antelopes (see Figure 8.12D) is thought to be one such signal. Other examples of prey signaling to prevent attack include lizards that perform \u201cpush-ups\u201d (indicating their overall physical condition) and ground squirrels that deliberately approach rattlesnakes, often within striking distance, while waving their tails from side to side (tail-flagging). Tail-flagging was found to be effective in deterring rattlesnakes from striking, and it increased the chance that a snake would abandon its ambush site (Barbour and Clark 2012). ) FIGURE 8.12 Examples of Antipredator Behaviors (A) Slug caterpillars (Family Limacodidae are covered in protective, stinging hairs, making them unpalatable to predators. (B) Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) can literally sleep with one eye open, with half their brain in a state of sleep while the other half remains alert for danger. (C) When threatened, the peacock butterfly (Aglais io) displays eyespots, a transformation that can startle predators. (D) A springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) displays a stiff-legged jumping behavior known as stotting or pronking, which is thought to discourage predators from pursuing the small gazelle. (E) When captured, hognose snakes such as this eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos) play dead and emit an odor that smells like decaying meat; this behavior can deter predators that will not eat carrion. If a predator attacks and captures (or is about to capture) its prey, the potential victim may resort to extreme behaviors. A hognose snake, for example, may play dead when captured, extruding its tongue and emitting a foul odor that resembles the smell of decaying meat, all the while keeping a close eye on its attacker (see Figure 8.12E). This behavior may work because many predators will not eat carrion. As a last resort, many prey defecate, urinate, or extrude other unpleasant substances, such as the large amounts of mucus secreted by a hagfish under attack (this mucus sometimes suffocates the predator). Other species detach parts of the body when threatened or grabbed. A gecko, for example, can drop its tail, which wriggles on the ground, distracting the predator. Some sea cucumbers take such evasive maneuvers to a unique level: when captured, they turn themselves partially inside out, startling the attacker and covering it with a tangled mass of internal organs. The sea cucumber then detaches those organs and swims away; later, it regrows the missing organs in a remarkable example of self-regeneration. Having examined the foraging and antipredator behaviors of animals from an evolutionary perspective, we turn now to another key animal activity: sex. Self-Assessment 8.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 8.3 Mating behaviors reflect the costs and benefits of parental investment and mate defense. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 8.3.1 Describe examples of the behaviors utilized by animals to increase their access to mates. 8.3.2 Evaluate the benefits of being choosy with mate selection and the conditions that favor selectivity by females versus males. 8.3.3 Describe conditions under which different mating systems would be favored.", "Mating Behavior Males and females differ in their sexual organs and in other ways that are directly related to reproduction. But there are other, more puzzling differences between them. Males are often larger or more brightly colored than females, they may possess unusual weapons (such as large horns), or they may have gaudy ornaments, such as the extravagant plumage of a male Argus pheasant (Argusianus argus) or a male peacock (FIGURE 8.13). In addition, males and females often differ in their mating behavior. In many species, the males may fight, sing loudly, or perform strange antics to gain access to females (FIGURE 8.14). Furthermore, males may be willing to mate with any female who will have them. Females, on the other hand, rarely attempt to court males and typically are more choosy about who they will mate with. What causes such differences between the sexes? FIGURE 8.13 A Male Shows Off The Argus pheasant (Argusianus argus) is native to the understory of the dense tropical forests of Southeast Asia. The males display their remarkable tail feathers as they attempt to attract and mate. FIGURE 8.14 A Male Courtship Dance The male Victoria\u2019s riflebird (Ptiloris victoriae) of Australia accentuates the bright colors of his plumage in this courtship display. Part of this courtship display includes the \u201csky-pointing\u201d behavior seen here. Differences between males and females can result from sexual selection Charles Darwin (1859, 1871) concluded that the often extravagant features of males did not provide a general advantage to members of a species, reasoning that if they did, both sexes would have them. He proposed instead that such features resulted from sexual selection, a process in which individuals with certain characteristics gain an advantage over others of the same sex solely with respect to mating success. We\u2019ll focus initially on sexual selection among males. EVIDENCE FOR SEXUAL SELECTION Darwin pointed out that when individuals compete against others of their gender for mates, they typically use either force or charm. A male lion, for example, tries to repel his rivals by force, while a male pheasant or peacock tries to attract females to him (and away from other males) by displaying his beautiful tail feathers. In species in which males fight over the right to mate with females, Darwin (1871) argued, the large size, strength, or special weapons of such males could have evolved by sexual selection. To make his case, Darwin began by pointing out that males often fought ferociously over females. He then described how males with the largest size, strength, and weaponry typically won such battles and therefore sired more offspring than other males. The large size, strength, or weaponry of the victors would then be passed on to their male descendants\u2014causing these traits to become increasingly common over time. Modern studies corroborate Darwin\u2019s argument. For example, in bighorn sheep, large rams with a long horn length typically defeat other males in battles over the right to mate with females and therefore sire more offspring than other rams (see the Case Study in Chapter 6). Since body size and horn length are heritable traits (Coltman et al. 2003; body size and horn length are also related to the age of the animal), the male offspring of the victors also tend to be large and strong. Over time, this process causes the body and horn growth rates of males to increase. Darwin also thought that extravagant traits used by males to charm females (and not used in fighting) could have arisen by sexual selection. For example, he wrote of his \u201cconviction that the male Argus pheasant acquired his beauty gradually, through the preference of the females during many generations for the more highly ornamented males.\u201d But Darwin\u2019s hypothesis that female mating preferences could lead to the evolution of more highly ornamented or brightly colored males was tested by few researchers prior to Malte Andersson\u2019s classic 1982 study on the long-tailed widowbird (Euplectes progne). Male long-tailed widowbirds are mostly black and have extremely long tail feathers, the longest of which reach 50 cm. In contrast, females are mottled brown and have short tails (ca. 7 cm). Like many other animals, male widowbirds establish territories, areas that they defend against intruders. In the grasslands of Kenya, where Andersson studied these birds, male widowbirds establish and defend territories in which females can feed and build their nests.", "To test whether female mating preferences could have driven the evolution of the long tails found in males, Andersson captured birds and subjected them to four treatments: (1) a control treatment in which the tails of the birds were not altered; (2) a second control treatment, in which the birds\u2019 tails were first cut at the midpoint and then glued back on; (3) a treatment in which the birds\u2019 tail lengths were shortened (cut to approximately 14 cm); and (4) a treatment in which the birds\u2019 tail lengths were increased (feathers cut from birds in treatment 3 were glued to the tails of these birds). Andersson found that males with lengthened tails had higher mating success than control males or males with shortened tails (FIGURE 8.15). There were no differences among treatments in the courtship behavior of the males or the vigor with which they defended their territories. Overall, Andersson\u2019s results support the hypothesis that female mating preferences affect male mating success and hence may have selected for the extremely long tails of male widowbirds. Many other studies since have found similar results. FIGURE 8.15 Males with Long Tails Get the Most Mates The mating success of male long-tailed widowbirds (Euplectes progne) depends on the length of their tails, as Malte Andersson discovered by experimentally altering the tails of wild birds. (After M. Andersson. 1982. Nature 299: 818\u2013820.) Explain why Malte Andersson used the two types of controls described in the text. BENEFITS TO CHOOSY FEMALES In some species, a male that attempts to charm a choosy female into mating with him may provide direct benefits to the female, such as gifts of food, help in rearing the young, or access to a territory that has good nesting sites, abundant food, or few predators. But in other species, once a male has wooed a choosy female, he provides his sperm and little else. In cases in which few or no direct benefits are provided, why do females prefer to mate with males that have certain features (such as an elaborate ornament or a loud mating call)? Current hypotheses propose that the female receives indirect genetic benefits when she chooses such males. For example, according to the handicap hypothesis, a male that can support a costly and unwieldy ornament, such as an extremely long tail, is likely to be a vigorous individual whose overall genetic quality is high. The idea here is that the male\u2019s ornament signals to females, \u201cLook at me, I\u2019m dragging this unwieldy tail around but I\u2019m still alive, so you know I must have great genes! Come and mate with me.\u201d A female that mates with such a male benefits (indirectly) because both her sons and her daughters will inherit good genes from the male. As a result, her offspring will tend to survive or reproduce better than they would have had she selected another male as her mate. Alternatively, genetic benefits may come from the same genes that made the male attractive in the first place. According to this idea, sometimes called the sexy son hypothesis, the female receives indirect genetic benefits through her sons, who will themselves be attractive to females and produce many grandchildren. Wilkinson and Reillo (1994) tested these hypotheses with a study of the stalk-eyed fly (Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni). The eyes of this fly are positioned at the ends of long, thin stalks; the males in particular have extremely long eyestalks (FIGURE 8.16). What maintains these bizarre-looking appendages? Eyestalk length is heritable, and field studies show that females prefer to mate with males that have the longest eyestalks. The researchers established three laboratory populations of these flies, which they studied for 13 generations. In each generation, they allowed only some of the flies to mate and produce offspring. In the control population, in each generation, 10 males and 25 females were selected at random as breeders. In the \u201clong-selected\u201d population, the breeders were the 10 males with the longest eyestalks (of 50 males selected at random) and 25 females selected at random. Finally, in the \u201cshort-selected\u201d population, the breeders were the 10 males with the shortest eyestalks (of 50 males selected at random) and 25 females selected at random. FIGURE 8.16 The Bizarre Eyes of a Stalk-Eyed Fly The eye span of a male stalk-eyed fly (Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni) can exceed the length of its body. After 13 generations, flies in the short-selected population had substantially shorter eyestalks than did flies in the other two populations.", "In addition, the mating preferences of females differed among the populations: when given a choice in a separate experiment, females from the short-selected population preferred males with short eyestalks, while females from the control and long-selected populations preferred males with long eyestalks (FIGURE 8.17). This result indicates that selection on one trait (eyestalk length in males) also caused the evolution of a different trait (female mating preference). Such evolutionary changes have the potential to be self-reinforcing. For example, when females selected males with long eyestalks as their mates, their male offspring would have longer eyestalks than their fathers and their female offspring would show stronger preference for long eyestalks than their mothers. FIGURE 8.17 Mating Preferences of Female Stalk-Eyed Flies In mate choice experiments, females from control, long-selected, or short-selected populations could choose between a long- or a short-stalked male. The results show that females from control and long-selected populations prefer to mate with long-stalked males, whereas females from short-selected populations prefer short-stalked males. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After G. S. Wilkinson and P. R. Reillo. 1994. Proc R Soc London 255B: 1\u20136.) The results we\u2019ve described so far show that (1) females may benefit from selecting males with long eyestalks because their male offspring will be attractive to the next generation of females and (2) eyestalk length in males are encoded by the same genes (or a correlated set of genes) as female mating preference. These findings are consistent with the sexy son hypothesis. Other studies support the handicap hypothesis, which posits that good genes are passed to both the sons and daughters of choosy females. For example, David et al. (1998) found that eyestalk length in male stalk-eyed flies was correlated with overall health and vigor. This result suggests that the sons and daughters fathered by males with long eyestalks are likely to be healthier and more vigorous than the offspring of other males. What is true for stalk-eyed flies is also true for many other species: females receive a variety of direct and indirect benefits when they select their mates. Next, we\u2019ll examine a question raised in the opening pages of this chapter: Why are females usually more choosy than males about who they will mate with? Gamete size, parental care, and ecological factors affect mating behavior In addition to the differences we have discussed, females and males often differ in how much energy and resources they invest in their offspring. Such investments begin with the production of gametes and may continue in species in which the parents care for their offspring as they develop into young adults. As we\u2019ll see, parental investments in offspring, along with ecological factors, can help us to understand the wide range of mating behaviors found in animal populations. WHY ARE FEMALES USUALLY CHOOSIER THAN MALES? One clue to explaining female choosiness comes from anisogamy: the difference in size between the egg cells of a female and the sperm cells of a male (see Figure 7.8B). Because female gametes are so much larger than male gametes, a female typically invests more resources in producing a single gamete than does a male, and hence she has more at stake in each one. Consider a chicken egg. A hen\u2019s (unfertilized) egg cell is composed mostly of yolk, and it is as large as the yolk of an egg from the grocery store; in contrast, you would need a microscope to see a rooster\u2019s sperm cell. (Some birds invest even more in their eggs than do chickens\u2014see the X-ray photograph of a kiwi carrying an egg in Figure 7.17.) After fertilization, the hen adds other substances to the developing egg, beginning with albumen (the egg white, which is high in protein) and ending with high-calcium secretions (which harden to form the shell). Overall, a hen invests far more in the early stages of reproduction than does a rooster (who contributes sperm and nothing more). In many species, females continue to invest large amounts of resources as their offspring develop. This is true in chickens: under natural conditions, a hen incubates her eggs to keep them warm, and then cares for her chicks for several weeks after they hatch. The rooster does nothing. What is true for chickens is true for many other species as well: females spend more of their time and energy caring for their offspring than males do. How do differences in gamete size and parental care relate to mating behavior?", "As Robert Trivers (1972) pointed out, reproduction is costly, and in species in which females invest more in their offspring than males do, we would expect females to be choosy and males to compete for the right to mate with females. Moreover, since males usually invest relatively little per offspring produced, we would expect that males could produce more offspring during their lifetime than females could. This expectation often holds (TABLE 8.1). When the reproductive potential of males is higher than that of females, selection should favor different mating behaviors in males and females: it should be advantageous for a male to mate with as many females as possible, whereas a female should \u201cprotect\u201d her investment by choosing to mate only with males that provide ample resources or that appear to be of high genetic quality. TABLE 8.1 Examples of the Reproductive Potential of Males and Females Maximum number of offspring produced during lifetime Species Male Female Elephant seal 100 8 Red deer 24 14 Human 888 69 Source: N. B. Davies et al. 2012. An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology, 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell: Oxford. Data from B. J. Le Boeuf and J. Reiter. 1988. In Reproductive Success, T. H. Clutton-Brock (Ed.), pp. 344\u2013362. Chicago University Press: Chicago, IL; T. H. Clutton-Brock et al. 1982. Red Deer: The Behaviour and Ecology of Two Sexes. Chicago University Press: Chicago, IL. As we\u2019ve seen, events in nature are often consistent with these predictions. But what about the exceptions, species in which females compete with one another to mate with males? Assuming that the mating behavior of such species has been shaped by natural selection, in such cases we would expect that males would provide more parental care than females would, leading to competition among females for the right to mate with choosy males. Field observations generally support this prediction. For example, in the red phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius; see Figure 8.2), once a female lays her eggs, she abandons the nest in search of another mate, leaving the male to incubate the eggs. Or consider the pipefish Syngnathus typhle, in which it is the male who becomes pregnant. Males have a special pouch in which they protect, aerate, and nourish the fertilized eggs (Berglund and Rosenqvist 1993). A male does not mate while he is pregnant, but during that time a female can produce additional eggs and mate with several other males. Thus, females have higher reproductive potential than males do, and (as predicted) they compete for the right to mate with males. Males select as their mates the largest, most highly ornamented females; such females produce more eggs than other females do. ECOLOGICAL FACTORS AND MATING BEHAVIOR As we saw in Concept 8.2, the foraging decisions of individuals are affected by ecological factors, such as the presence of predators. Not surprisingly, ecological factors can also affect decisions about mating. Female guppies, for example, mate less often and become less particular in their choice of mates (settling for less brightly colored males) when predators are present (Godin and Briggs 1996). Similar results have been found for many other species. Overall, the evidence shows that in fishes, birds, mammals, and other animals, an individual\u2019s decision to mate and its \u201cchoosiness\u201d can be altered by such ecological factors as the number and spatial locations of potential mates, the quality of those mates, the availability of food, and the presence of predators or competitors. Ecological factors can also influence the mating system, a term that refers to the number of mating partners that males or females have and the pattern of parental care. A rich variety of mating systems occur in nature (TABLE 8.2), and mating systems can vary not only among closely related species, but even among individuals within a population of a single species. How can we make sense of this variation? In a groundbreaking paper, Emlen and Oring (1977) argued that the diverse mating systems seen in nature result from the behaviors of individuals striving to maximize their reproductive success, or fitness. TABLE 8.2 Mating Systems Mating system Description Monogamy A male mates with only one female, and she with him. This pairing may last for one or more breeding seasons. In many cases, both parents care for the young. Polygyny One male mates with multiple females in a breeding season. The male may control access to these females directly (by fighting with other males) or indirectly (by controlling access to resources that females seek, such as food or good nesting sites).", "The female usually provides most or all of the parental care. Polyandry One female mates with multiple males in a breeding season. The female may defend these males directly (by fighting with other females) or indirectly (by controlling access to food or other resources). The male usually provides most or all of the parental care. Promiscuity Both males and females mate with multiple partners in a breeding season. Let\u2019s consider the logic of Emlen and Oring\u2019s approach from a male perspective. As mentioned earlier, males typically have greater reproductive potential than females; hence, the reproductive success of males will often be limited by access to potential female mates. Under certain conditions, this imbalance can lead to polygyny, a mating system in which one male mates with multiple females in a breeding season. As Emlen and Oring (1977) wrote, \u201cPolygyny occurs if environmental or behavioral conditions bring about the clumping of females, and males have the capacity to monopolize them.\u201d For example, the availability of food or nest sites may affect where females are found. Whether females settle close to or far away from one another may determine whether a male can acquire and defend more than one mate (FIGURE 8.18). FIGURE 8.18 Ecological Factors Can Affect the Potential for Polygyny In this diagram, dots represent the locations of females, and circles show the size of a territory that a male can defend. Experimental studies in birds, fishes, and mammals have illustrated particular cases in which females clump together in high-resource areas\u2014and the males then follow the females to those same areas. Moreover, in some cases, field observations indicate that the availability of resources is correlated with both the locations of females and the mating system. For example, Martin and Martin (2007) found that the brushtail possum (Trichosurus cunninghami) was monogamous in a habitat where food and nest sites (and hence females) were widely separated, but polygynous in a habitat where food and nest sites (and hence females) were located closer to one another. Similarly, Lukas and Clutton-Brock (2013) found that monogamy usually occurs in mammalian species where it is difficult for males to defend access to more than one breeding female\u2014 as hypothesized by Emlen and Oring\u2019s original paper. Self-Assessment 8.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 8.4 There are advantages and disadvantages to living in groups. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 8.4.1 Describe the potential benefits and costs of species living in groups. 8.4.2 Explain how the balance between benefits and costs of living in groups determines the net impact to individual organisms and populations. Living in Groups Individuals of the same species often cluster together, forming groups. Familiar examples of such groups include herds of horses, prides of lions, schools of fish, and flocks of birds. How might the individuals in a group benefit from belonging to the group? And are there disadvantages to communal life that might limit the size of a group or prevent its formation altogether? Benefits of group living include access to mates, protection from predators, and improved foraging success Members of a group can enjoy higher reproductive success than solitary individuals. This is clear for males that hold high-quality territories, and it may also be true for females in such territories because they may gain access to good breeding sites or abundant supplies of food. Like the females of a lion pride, group members may also share the responsibilities of feeding and protecting the young, which can benefit the parents (who may have more time to obtain food for themselves) as well as the offspring (who may be both better fed and better protected). Living in a group can provide other advantages as well, such as a reduced risk of predation. In some cases, the individuals in the group can band together to discourage attack (FIGURE 8.19). Moreover, predators are often detected sooner when they approach a group than when they approach a single individual. As a result, they are less likely to surprise their prey, which causes the predators\u2019 attack success rate to drop. For example, goshawks were successful in killing wood pigeons about 80% of the time when they attacked a single pigeon, but when they attacked pigeons in a large flock, they were detected sooner, and their success rate plunged (FIGURE 8.20). FIGURE 8.19 A Formidable Defense A group of musk oxen that circles is a very difficult target for predators. FIGURE 8.20 Safety in Numbers", "The success rate of a goshawk attacking wood pigeon prey plummets when it attacks a large flock. (After R. E. Kenward. 1978. J Anim Ecol 47: 449\u2013460.) In other cases, group members do not cooperate against predators, yet individuals in a group still have a lower risk of predation than they would on their own. One reason for this is that as the number of individuals in a group increases, the chance of being the one attacked decreases, a phenomenon known as the dilution effect. In ANALYZING DATA 8.1, you can see whether the dilution effect applies to a marine insect attacked by fish predators. Furthermore, if group members respond to a predator by scattering in different directions, they may make it difficult for the predator to select a target, thus causing the predator\u2019s attack success rate to drop. ANALYZING DATA 8.1 Individuals in a group may gain protection from predators because of the dilution effect: when a predator attacks, the larger the number of prey individuals in the group, the smaller the chance that any particular member of the group will be the victim. Foster and Treherne* tested whether the dilution effect occurred when a predatory fish (Sardinops sagax) attacked groups of a marine insect, the ocean skater (Halobates robustus). A subset of their data is presented in the table, which shows the number of predator attacks (per 5 minutes) on ocean skater groups differing in size. 1. Calculate the average number of attacks (per 5 minutes) for each group size. Do the fish predators show a clear preference for attacking small groups over large groups (or vice versa)? Explain. No. attacks (per 5 minutes per No. insects in group No. groups observed group) 1 3 15; 6; 10 4 2 16; 8 6 3 9; 12; 7 15 2 7; 10 50 2 15; 11 70 2 14; 7 2. For each group size, convert the average that you calculated for question 1 into the average number of attacks per individual (per 5 minutes). Is there a consistent relationship between the average number of attacks per individual (per 5 minutes) and group size? Explain. 3. Are these results consistent with the dilution effect? See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. *Foster, W. A., and J. E. Treherne. 1981. Evidence for the dilution effect in the selfish herd from fish predation on a marine insect. Nature 293: 466\u2013467. Group members may also experience improved foraging success. Two or more lions, for example, can bring down much larger prey than a single lion could tackle on its own. Furthermore, lions, killer whales, wolves, and many other predators may coordinate their attacks, such that the actions of one predator drive prey into the waiting jaws of another. Herbivores may also forage more effectively when in groups than when on their own by increasing the probability of finding high-quality patches of food resources. Costs of group living include greater energy expenditures, more competition for food, and higher risks of disease In one study of group living, a European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) in a flock of six birds consumed (on average) 20% more seeds per unit of time than did a bird feeding on its own, because goldfinches in a flock spent more time eating and less time scanning for predators than did European goldfinches feeding on their own (Glk 1987). But the increase in the number of seeds eaten per unit of time by a goldfinch in a flock has a downside: as the group size increases, group members deplete the available food more rapidly, which means the birds must spend more of their time flying between feeding sites (FIGURE 8.21). Traveling in search of food takes time and energy, and it can increase the risk of being spotted by predators. FIGURE 8.21 Traveling in a Group A study of European goldfinches (Carduelis carduelis) in groups of seven different sizes showed that the amount of time the birds spent flying between feeding sites increased with the size of the flock. (After E. Glk. 1987. Ethology 74: 65\u201379.) A goldfinch feeding in a flock eats more seeds per hour than does a goldfinch feeding alone. Can that benefit be compared directly with the cost shown in this figure? If not, what other information would you need to make this comparison? Competition for food can also become more intense as the size of a group increases.", "As a result, a member of a large group may spend more time and energy fighting for food than would a member of a smaller group (or a solitary individual). In particular, in groups with a dominance hierarchy, subordinate group members can spend much of their time and energy on interacting with group members. For example, in a study on the cichlid fish (Neolamprologus pulcher), subordinates spent more of their energy on submissive behaviors (appeasing dominant group members) than they did on any other activity. Finally, members of a large group may live closer together or come into contact with one another more often than do members of a small group. As a result, parasites and diseases often spread more easily in large groups than in small groups; we\u2019ll return to this topic in Concept 13.5. Group size may reflect a balance between the costs and benefits of group living If we apply the cost/benefit principles discussed in this chapter to group size, we might predict that groups should be of a size at which the benefits of belonging to a group exceed the costs. For example, using an approach similar to that introduced in Concept 8.2, we could predict that groups will have an \u201coptimal\u201d size \u2014the size at which the net benefits received by its members are maximized. However, as shown in FIGURE 8.22, unless group members can prevent other individuals from joining the group once an optimal size is reached, the observed group size may be larger than the optimal size. In addition, it can be very difficult to measure all the benefits and costs of group living; it is particularly challenging to quantify both costs and benefits with a single \u201ccurrency,\u201d such as energy use or offspring production. FIGURE 8.22 Should a New Arrival Join the Group? In this hypothetical example, the net benefit to an individual group member is maximized at the optimal group size of four. However, a new arrival would have a greater net benefit if it joined a group of size four than if it remained alone. Unless existing group members can prevent new arrivals from joining the group, new arrivals should continue to join until the group has reached a size of seven\u2014at that point, the individual would do better on its own than in the group. In general, an argument like that in Figure 8.22 suggests that it may be advantageous for individuals to belong to groups that are larger than the optimal size, but not so large that a new arrival would do better on its own. Such an intermediate-sized group might be large enough to reduce the risk of predation, but small enough to avoid running out of food. Using an overall measure of individual condition (level of stress as measured by fecal concentrations of the hormone cortisol), Pride (2005) found that ring-tailed lemurs in groups of intermediate sizes were less stressed than lemurs that belonged to smaller or larger groups. Similarly, Creel and Creel (1995) found that the per capita intake of food for Tanzanian wild dogs chasing prey was greatest for packs of intermediate sizes. Self-Assessment 8.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Baby Killers Can an evolutionary perspective on behavior help us to understand infanticide? It turns out that the males of many species kill the young of their potential mates. For example, male langur monkeys (Semnopithecus entellus) kill the infants of females in their social group. This behavior appears to increase the reproductive success of the murderous males: DNA paternity analyses showed that infanticidal male langurs were not related to the infants they killed but were related to the females\u2019 subsequent offspring (Borries et al. 1999). Infanticide by males has been documented in dozens of other species, including horses, chimpanzees, bears, and marmots. Infanticide by males appears to be adaptive in many cases: it reduces the time that females spend between pregnancies, thus enabling the males to sire more offspring than they otherwise could. But in some species, females commit infanticide. For example, female giant water bugs (Lethocerus deyrollei) and female wattled jacanas (a type of shorebird, Jacana jacana) slaughter the eggs or young of their own species. While gruesome, this behavior also makes evolutionary sense: in these species, the males provide most or all of the parental care, and the females have higher reproductive potential than the males.", "Thus, as is true for male lions and langurs, the infanticidal behavior of female water bugs and jacanas appears to be adaptive: by killing the young, a female bug or bird shortens the time before the male is willing to mate again, thus potentially increasing her own reproductive success. What about other puzzling behaviors mentioned in this chapter\u2019s Case Study? Recall that female fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) sometimes lay their eggs in foods that are high in ethyl alcohol. But this behavior is not as strange as it first appears: evidence suggests that it provides a behavioral defense against the wasp Leptopilina heterotoma. Females of this wasp lay their eggs on fruit fly larvae; when an egg hatches, the young wasp burrows through the body of the fly larva, consuming and killing it. A fruit fly larva infected by this wasp will preferentially choose to eat foods that are high in alcohol content, such as rotting fruit. Consuming foods containing high concentrations of alcohol harms the fruit fly larvae, but the benefits of this action outweigh its costs: wasps are more susceptible to the effects of the alcohol than the fruit flies, thereby increasing the overall chances that the larvae will survive. In addition, Kacsoh et al. (2013) showed that adult female fruit flies altered their egg-laying behavior in response to the presence of wasps. In the absence of wasps, the fruit flies laid about 40% of their eggs in high-alcohol foods, but when female wasps were present, the fruit flies laid over 90% of their eggs in high-alcohol foods. This behavior increased the survival of fruit fly larvae exposed to wasps (FIGURE 8.23), suggesting that the behavior can be viewed as a type of preventative medicine. FIGURE 8.23 Fruit Flies Medicate Their Offspring Female fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) laid most of their eggs in foods containing alcohol when females of the wasp Leptopilina heterotoma were present. This behavior increased the percentage of fruit fly larvae that survived to adulthood. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After B. Z. Kacsoh et al. 2013. Science 339: 947\u2013950.) In the absence of wasps, what is the cost (in terms of reduced larval survival) of laying eggs on food containing 6% alcohol? When wasps are present, what is the benefit? CONNECTIONS in NATURE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES TO PREDATORS HAVE BROAD ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS As you\u2019ve seen, individuals often change their behavior in response to predators. For example, in Concept 8.2, we saw that when exposed to recordings of sounds made by predators, song sparrows fed their young less often, built their nests in less desirable areas, and spent less time incubating their eggs (Zanette et al. 2011). What were the consequences of these behavioral changes? Zanette and colleagues found that when song sparrow parents altered their behavior in response to a perceived high risk of predation, their offspring lost body heat more rapidly (FIGURE 8.24A) and weighed less than did the offspring of sparrows exposed to recordings of nonpredators. These effects on individual offspring appear to have caused the number of offspring produced per year to decline (FIGURE 8.24B). Overall, the results of this study suggest that fear of predation alters the behavior of song sparrows in ways that decrease their reproductive success and may cause their population sizes to drop. FIGURE 8.24 Costs of Fear (A) The rate at which young song sparrows lost body heat was higher for offspring of birds exposed to playbacks of predators than it was for offspring of parents exposed to playbacks of nonpredators. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (B) Fewer offspring were produced in nests exposed to playbacks of predators than in nests exposed to playbacks of nonpredators. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (After L. Y. Zanette et al. 2011. Science 334: 1398\u20131401.) Estimate the cost of fear on the number of offspring that survived to young adulthood. Behavioral responses to predators can also affect ecosystem processes, such as the decomposition of leaves and other plant litter in soil. As Hawlena and colleagues (2012) described, this effect occurs indirectly: the presence of spider predators initiated a series of events in their grasshopper prey that ultimately slowed the decomposition of plant litter. How did this happen? When the researchers raised grasshoppers in the presence of predators, the grasshoppers became physiologically stressed, one consequence of which was that they required more energy to maintain their basic body functions.", "This demand for additional energy appears to have altered their foraging behavior, leading the grasshoppers to increase their consumption of foods that are high in carbohydrates (and thus in energy) but low in nitrogen. Thus, grasshoppers stressed by predators had a higher carbon:nitrogen ratio in their bodies than did grasshoppers raised in the absence of predators. Although this change in nutrient content did not affect the decomposition of the grasshoppers\u2019 own bodies, it did decrease the decay of plant materials in the soil. This probably happened because the altered carbon:nitrogen ratio in the decomposing bodies of grasshoppers affected the carbon:nitrogen ratio in the soil, which in turn affected the community of soil microorganisms that decompose leaves and other plant matter. Unit 3 Population Distribution and Abundance KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 9.1 Populations are groups of individuals of the same species that vary in size over space and time. CONCEPT 9.2 Species vary in their distribution and abundance across their geographic range. CONCEPT 9.3 Species are limited in their distribution and abundance by habitat suitability, historical factors, and dispersal. CONCEPT 9.4 In metapopulations, sets of spatially isolated populations are linked by dispersal. From Kelp Forest to Urchin Barren: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 Stretching over 1,600 km of the Pacific Ocean to the west of Alaska, the mountainous Aleutian Islands are often shrouded in fog and battered by violent storms. The islands have few large trees, and except for the eastern islands that once were connected to the mainland, they lack the terrestrial mammals that are found on the mainland, such as brown bears, caribou, and lemmings. There is abundant marine wildlife in the surrounding waters, however, including seabirds, sea otters, whales, and a variety of fishes and invertebrates. Although there are few trees on land, the nearshore waters of some Aleutian islands harbor fascinating marine communities known as kelp forests, made up of brown algae such as Laminaria and Nereocystis. Dense clusters of kelp rise from their holdfasts on the sea bottom toward the surface, producing what feels like an underwater forest (FIGURE 9.1). Other nearby islands do not have kelp forests. Instead, the bottoms of their nearshore waters are carpeted with sea urchins and support few kelp or other large algae. Areas with large numbers of urchins are called \u201curchin barrens\u201d because they lack kelp forests. Why are some islands surrounded by kelp forests and others by urchin barrens? FIGURE 9.1 Key Players in the Forests of the Deep The bull kelp Nereocystis luetkeana is one of several species that make up the kelp forests found off the coasts of some Aleutian islands. Research shows that the presence or absence of kelp forests near these islands is influenced by both sea urchins and sea otters. One possibility is that islands with kelp forests differ from islands without kelp forests in terms of climate, ocean currents, tidal patterns, or physical features such as underwater rock surfaces. But no such differences have been found, leaving us to look for other reasons why some islands have kelp forests while others do not. Because urchins feed on algae and can eat vast quantities of it, investigators suspected that grazing by urchins might prevent the formation of kelp forests. This hypothesis was tested in two ways. First, studies in the Aleutian Islands and elsewhere along the Alaskan coast consistently showed that kelp forests were not found in regions where there were many large urchins. Although such correlations did not prove that urchins suppress kelp forests, the fact that a number of studies found the same result suggested that urchins might determine where kelp forests are located. Second, the effect of urchins was tested in an experiment that measured change in kelp densities in several 50-m2 plots containing urchins and in similar, nearby 50-m2 plots from which urchins were removed (Duggins 1980). There were no kelp in any of the plots at the start of the experiment, and kelp densities remained at zero in the plots where urchins remained. In the plots from which urchins had been removed, however, the density of Laminaria rose to 21 individuals per square meter in the first year and reached 105 individuals in the second year (FIGURE 9.2). Laminaria is a dominant member of kelp forest communities, so these results suggested that kelp forests would grow in the absence of urchins. FIGURE 9.2 Do Sea Urchins Limit the Distribution of Kelp Forests?", "Mean densities of the kelp Laminaria in 50-m2 plots increased dramatically after urchins were removed. (After D. O. Duggins. 1980. Ecology 61: 447\u2013453.) These and other results indicated that the presence or absence of urchins is an answer to the question of why some Aleutian islands have kelp forests and others do not. But this answer just shifts the question from what determines the locations of kelp forests to what determines the locations of urchins. As we\u2019ll see, a more complete answer to our question about why kelp forests are found in some areas but not others turns out to depend on the voracious feeding habits of sea otters, which themselves may have become a meal of last resort for killer whales. View the script for the video Introduction In this chapter\u2019s Case Study, we focused on a fundamental ecological question: What determines the distribution and abundance of a species, in this case kelp? The distribution of a species is simply the geographic area where individuals of the species are present, while its abundance refers to the number of individuals of a species or population. These two measures are highly related because the distribution of a species can be viewed as a map of all areas where the abundance of the species is greater than zero. Determining the distributions and abundances of species, and the factors important to these patterns, can be challenging given that groups of individuals (or populations) often vary dramatically over space and time. Our ability to document this variability and predict these changes can serve as a \u201cmeasuring stick\u201d for how well we understand events in nature. In this chapter, we will focus on how and why the distribution and abundance of individuals within species and populations vary over the landscape and ways in which to measure that variation. In Chapters 10 and 11, we\u2019ll expand our view of populations by considering how they vary over time using both examples and population growth models. But first, we\u2019ll begin by describing aspects of populations and individuals, including estimations of abundance, in more detail. CONCEPT 9.1 Populations are groups of individuals of the same species that vary in size over space and time. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 9.1.1 Define the terms population, population size, and population density. 9.1.2 Compare the different ways in which individuals are defined, including the terms clones, genets, and ramets. 9.1.3 Compare the different methods used to measure the abundance of individuals within populations or species. Populations and Individuals A population is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area at the same time and interact with one another. To explore this definition further, what exactly do we mean by \u201cinteract\u201d? In species that reproduce sexually, a population might be defined as the group of individuals that interact by interbreeding. In species that reproduce asexually, however, such as dandelions or the fish Poecilia formosa, a population must be defined by other kinds of interactions, such as competition for common sources of food. Our definition of a population also incorporates the area over which members of a species interact. If that area is known, as in a population of lizards that live on and move throughout a small island, we can report population abundance either as population size (the number of individuals in the population) or as population density (the number of individuals per unit of area). For example, if there were 2,500 lizards on an island of 20 hectares (ha), or roughly 50 acres, the population size would be 2,500 lizards, and the population density would be 125 lizards per hectare. In some cases, the total area occupied by a population is not known. For example, when little is known about how far a sexually reproducing species or its gametes (e.g., plant pollen) can travel, it is difficult to estimate the area over which individuals interbreed frequently and hence represent a single population. For asexual species, similar problems are encountered when we try to estimate the area over which interactions other than interbreeding occur. When the area occupied by a population is not fully known, ecologists use the best available information about the biology of the species to delimit an area within which the size and density of the population can be estimated. What are individuals? As we\u2019ve seen, it can be a challenge to determine the size or density of a population, because it is necessary to know how many individuals are present within the population.", "For some species, there is an added challenge\u2014determining what constitutes an individual. How can there be confusion over what an individual is? Consider the quaking aspen trees (Populus tremuloides) in FIGURE 9.3. Like many plant species, an individual aspen can produce genetically identical copies of itself, or clones. Aspens produce clones by forming new plants from root buds, while species such as clover and strawberries do so by forming new plants from buds located on horizontal stems, or \u201crunners\u201d (FIGURE 9.4). Among animals, many corals, sea anemones, and hydroids can form clones of genetically identical individuals, as can some frogs, fishes, lizards, and many insects. Some plant clones can grow to enormous sizes (e.g., covering 81 ha, or 200 acres, in aspen clones) or live for extremely long periods (e.g., 43,000 years in the case of Lomatia tasmanica, a rare shrub found in Tasmania, Australia). FIGURE 9.3 Aspen Groves: One Tree or Many? These quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) growing in western Colorado could represent over 20 different genetic individuals, each established from a seed. However, it is also possible that each of these aspens is actually part of one \u201ctree,\u201d having been produced asexually from the root buds of a single genetic individual. To cope with the complications that result from the formation of clones, biologists who study such organisms define individuals in several different ways. For example, an individual can be defined as the product of a single fertilization event. Under this definition, a grove of genetically identical aspen trees is a single genetic individual, or genet. However, members of a genet are often physiologically independent of one another, and they may in fact compete for resources. Such actually or potentially independent members of a genet are called ramets. In strawberries, for example, a rooted plant is considered a ramet because it can persist even if it is not connected to the rest of its genet (see Figure 9.4). Whether we view a patch of strawberries or a grove of aspen trees as one individual or many depends on what we are interested in. If we are interested in evolutionary change over time, the genet level may be more appropriate. In contrast, if we are interested in how independent physiological units compete, the ramet level may be more appropriate. FIGURE 9.4 Plants and Animals That Form Clones Many plants and animals reproduce asexually, thereby forming clones of genetically identical individuals. Examples of asexual reproduction include budding (in which clonal offspring detach from the parent), apomixis (in which clonal offspring are produced from unfertilized eggs; also known as parthenogenesis), and horizontal spread (in which clonal offspring are produced as the organism grows). How might groups of genetically identical individuals be identified in clones that form by budding? By apomixis? By horizontal spread? The most direct way to determine how many individuals live in a population is to count all of them. This sounds simple enough, and it is possible in some cases, as for the lizards on one island, and other organisms that are confined to small areas, are easy to see, or do not move. But complete counts of organisms are often difficult or impossible. Consider the chinch bug (Blissus leucopterus), an insect that attacks crops such as corn and wheat. This insect can cover large areas and reach densities that exceed 5,000 individuals per square meter, making it impractical to count all the individuals in a population. In such cases, a variety of methods can be used to estimate abundance. Let\u2019s discuss some of those methods next. Ecologists estimate abundance with area-based counts, distance methods, and mark\u2013 recapture studies As just mentioned, many ecological studies require an estimate of a population\u2019s actual abundance, or absolute population size. For example, as we saw in the Case Study, to quantify the extent to which the number of sea otters affects the number of their sea urchin prey, we must estimate the absolute population sizes of both species. In other cases, it may be sufficient to estimate the relative population size, the number of individuals in one time interval or place relative to the number in another. Estimates of relative population size are based on data that are presumed to be correlated with absolute population size but do not assess the actual number of individuals in the population.", "Examples of such data include the number of cougar tracks found in an area, the number of fish caught per unit of effort (e.g., per number of hooks trolled each day), or the number of birds observed while the observer walks a standard distance (or remains in one place for a standard time interval). Relative population size estimates are usually easier and less expensive to obtain than are absolute estimates. While useful, estimates of relative population size must be interpreted carefully. The number of cougar tracks observed, for example, depends not only on cougar population density, but also on animal activity. Thus, if twice as many tracks were found in area A as in area B, we could not be confident that area A had twice as many cougars\u2014there could be more or fewer than that, depending on whether cougars moved more frequently in one area than in another. With the distinction between absolute and relative population size as background, we turn now to how ecologists estimate abundance. In ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 9.1, we describe three common approaches: area-based counts, distance methods, and mark\u2013recapture studies. AREA-BASED COUNT As described in Ecological Toolkit 9.1A, area-based counts are often used to estimate the population sizes of immobile organisms. In this approach, organisms are counted in a series of sample plots, or quadrats, and the resulting numbers are used to estimate the total population size. Suppose, for example, that a team of entomologists wants to estimate the population of chinch bugs in a 400-ha (ca. 1,000-acre) field of corn. If they counted chinch bugs in five 10 \u00d7 10-cm quadrats (i.e., five 0.01-m2 quadrats), and their counts were 40, 10, 70, 80, and 50 chinch bugs, they would estimate that there were, on average, (9.1) chinch bugs per square meter. Thus, there would be an estimated 20 billion chinch bugs in the population 22 (5,000 bugs/m \u00d7 10,000 m /ha \u00d7 400 ha = 20,000,000,000). Area-based methods work well if individuals can be counted accurately within the quadrats, and if the quadrats provide a good representation of the entire area covered by the population. To help ensure that the latter condition is met, ecologists use as many quadrats as is feasible, and they often place those quadrats at locations selected at random from the entire area covered by the population. Quadrats can also be placed in a variety of other ways, such as at evenly spaced locations along a transect line or rectangular grid. DISTANCE METHODS Estimates of abundance can also be based on line transects or point transects. In this method, the data collected are the distances of individuals seen from a randomly placed point or line; these distances are then converted into estimates of the number of individuals per unit of area. For example, in the line transect approach, an observer travels along a transect line: Each individual that the observer can see from the line is counted, and its perpendicular distance from the line is recorded (d1 and d2 in the above example). As described in Ecological Toolkit 9.1B, a detection function must be used to convert such distance measurements into an estimate of the absolute population size. The detection function allows an estimation of the number of individuals there are in the area of interest, based on the number of individuals actually observed. ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 9.1 Methods for estimating abundance fall into three general categories: area-based counts, distance methods, and mark\u2013 recapture studies. Many variations on these approaches have been developed, and a wide range of statistical techniques are available for analyzing abundance estimates obtained using each of them (Krebs 1999; Williams et al. 2002). A. AREA-BASED COUNTS In an area-based count, as its name suggests, the individuals in a given area or volume are counted. This method may make use of a quadrat (FIGURE A), which is a sampling area (or volume) of any size or shape, such as a 0.25 \u00d7 0.25-m2 square plot used to count small plants, a 0.1-ha plot used to count trees, or a soil core of a certain diameter and depth used to count soil organisms. The counts from several quadrats are then summed and averaged to estimate the number of individuals per unit of area (or volume). Figure A An Underwater Quadrat A marine biologist uses a square quadrat to count the numbers of individuals of different coral species found on a reef off the Caroline Islands, Micronesia.", "Area-based counts are often used to estimate absolute population sizes of organisms that are sessile (e.g., plants) or can move only short distances during the time it takes to count the individuals in a quadrat (e.g., sea urchins). Area-based counts can also be used to estimate the abundances of more mobile organisms, as when large mammals are observed in aerial surveys. Area-based counts of highly mobile organisms can provide estimates of relative population sizes; further information (such as the probability that an organism will be present but not seen when surveyed by air) may be required before such counts can be used to estimate absolute population sizes. B. DISTANCE METHODS In distance methods, an observer measures the distances of individuals seen from a line or a point; these distances are then converted into estimates of the number of individuals per unit of area. For example, distance methods often use line transects, straight lines from which the distance to each individual is measured (FIGURE B). For organisms that move quickly or are hard to detect, the number of individuals observed along a line transect provides an estimate of relative population size. Figure B Counting Trees from a Line Transect The density of these camelthorn trees (Acacia erioloba) in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, South Africa, could be estimated using a line transect, as shown here. For both mobile and sessile organisms, distances recorded along a transect can also be used to estimate the absolute abundance; this conversion can be made if it is possible to determine a detection function, which accounts for how the chance of seeing an individual decreases with its distance from the transect. Other distance methods include point sampling techniques, in which the distance to the nearest (visible) individual is measured from a series of locations or \u201cpoints\u201d; as with line transect data, a detection function is used to convert these distances into estimates of the absolute population size (see Krebs 1999; Schwarz and Seber 1999). C. MARK\u2013RECAPTURE STUDIES In mark\u2013recapture studies, a subset of the individuals in a population is captured, marked (as with a tag or dot of paint) so that they can be recognized at a later time, and released (FIGURE C). After the marked individuals have been given enough time to recover and move throughout the population, individuals are captured a second time, and the proportion of marked individuals found in the second capture is used to estimate the total population size. Figure C Release of Marked Salmon To obtain mark\u2013recapture estimates of salmon abundance, ecologists tag and then release marked salmon (note the two tags near the dorsal fin). Mark\u2013recapture methods are used to estimate the absolute population size of mobile organisms; they are also used to obtain data on the survival or movement of individuals. The simplest mark\u2013recapture method is summarized by Equation 9.3; use of this equation assumes that (1) the population size does not change during the sampling period (no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration), (2) each individual has an equal chance of being caught, (3) marking does not harm individuals or alter their behavior (such as by making them harder to recapture), and (4) marks are not lost over time. A wide range of other mark\u2013recapture methods have been developed to address cases in which one or more of these assumptions are violated (Krebs 1999; Schwarz and Seber 1999; Williams et al. 2002). MARK\u2013RECAPTURE STUDIES The mark\u2013recapture approach relies on releasing marked individuals and then recapturing them at a later time to see what fraction of the population is marked (see Ecological Toolkit 9.1C). Imagine, for example, that we capture 23 butterflies from a meadow, which we then mark and release. A day later, we sample the meadow again, this time catching 15 butterflies, of which 4 are marked. In our first sample, we caught and marked M1 = 23 butterflies from a total population of unknown size (N); thus, we initially caught a proportion M1/N of the butterflies in the field. The second time butterflies were sampled, we caught M2 = 15 butterflies, of which 4 were marked and hence were recaptured (R = 4).", "Assuming that no butterfly births, deaths, or movements into or out of the meadow have occurred since our first sample, the proportion of marked individuals captured in our second sample (R/M2) should equal the original proportion we caught, M1/N. Thus, we have the equation (9.2) We can rearrange Equation 9.2 to estimate the total number of butterflies in the meadow as (9.3) which in this case would equal (23 \u00d7 15)/4 = 86. Now that we\u2019ve defined populations and individuals in more detail, and considered some methods of their quantification, let\u2019s next turn to how and why populations and species differ in their distribution and abundance. Self-Assessment 9.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 9.2 Species vary in their distribution and abundance across their geographic range. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 9.2.1 Describe the relationship between populations, metapopulations, and geographic ranges for species. 9.2.2 Compare the different dispersion patterns of populations. 9.2.3 Describe how the size and patchiness of geographic ranges vary among species and can be predicted using models. Distribution and Abundance Patterns The distribution and abundance patterns of species and populations vary in their spatial extent across the landscape. An example of this variability is the distribution map for the herbaceous perennial Clematis fremontii (FIGURE 9.5A). Clematis has a patchy distribution across Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska, where its populations are restricted to dry, rocky, treeless meadows or glades formed on particular limestone outcrops within the region. Populations, such as those of Clematis, rarely occur in isolation from one another and are usually connected through dispersal. Dispersal is simply the movement of individuals into (immigration) or out of (emigration) an existing population. A group of geographically isolated populations linked together by dispersal is known as a metapopulation. For example, a cluster of meadows might be considered a metapopulation if Clematis seeds from one meadow had the potential to disperse to another meadow. In Concept 9.4, we will discuss metapopulations in more detail. At larger spatial scales, the entire geographic range, or distribution, of a species might consist of one or multiple metapopulations, depending on the extent of the area occupied by a species. FIGURE 9.5 Many Populations Have a Patchy Distribution The distribution and abundance of the herbaceous perennial Clematis fremontii are patchy over different spatial scales. (A) Populations occur within limestone meadows. A group of populations makes up a metapopulation, and multiple metapopulations make up the geographic range (in this case, Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska). (B) Individuals within a population show one of three different dispersion patterns. (A after R. O. Erickson. 1945. Ann Mo Bot Gard 32: 413\u2013460.) The aggregates of C. fremontii individuals found in the meadow populations provide an example of the dispersion, or spatial arrangement, of individuals within a population (FIGURE 9.5B). We can recognize three basic patterns in how the individuals of a population are positioned with respect to one another (see Figure 9.5A). In some cases, the members of a population have a regular dispersion, in which individuals are relatively evenly spaced throughout their habitat. In other cases, individuals show a random dispersion, similar to what would occur if individuals were positioned at locations selected at random. Finally, as in C. fremontii, individuals may be grouped together to form a clumped dispersion. In natural populations, clumped dispersions are more common than either regular or random dispersions. It is important to note that identifying dispersion patterns can depend on the spatial scale of the measured area. For example, clumped dispersion patterns might not be revealed except at large spatial scales. The geographic ranges of species vary in size As we discussed, the geographic range of a species is the entire geographic region over which that species is found. Although there are no species that are found everywhere, there is considerable variation in the sizes of their geographic ranges. Examples of species with small geographic ranges include the Devil\u2019s Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis), which lives in a single desert pool (7 \u00d7 3 m across and 15 m deep). Many tropical plants also have small geographic ranges. This latter point was illustrated dramatically in 1978, when 90 new plant species were discovered on a single mountain ridge in Ecuador, each with a geographic range that was restricted to that ridge. We call such species endemic because they occur in one particular location and nowhere else on Earth.", "Other species, such as coyotes, live over most of one continent (North America), while still others, such as gray wolves, live on small portions of several continents (North America and Eurasia). Relatively few terrestrial species are found on all or most of the world\u2019s continents. Notable exceptions include humans, Norway rats, and the bacterium Escherichia coli, which lives in the intestinal tracts of reptiles, birds, and mammals (including humans) and thus is found wherever its host organisms are found. Some marine species, including invertebrates with planktonic larvae (see Figure 7.11) and whales (see Interactive Figure 9.13), have large geographic ranges. But while range sizes vary greatly, the pattern in the oceans is similar to that on land, and for most marine species the geographic range is relatively small (Gaston 2003). The geographic range of a species includes the areas it occupies during all of its life stages. It is particularly important to keep this fact in mind for species that migrate and for species whose biology is poorly understood. For example, if we wish to protect monarch butterfly populations, we must ensure that conditions are favorable for them in both their summer breeding grounds and their overwintering sites. In some cases, we understand an organism\u2019s range poorly because it has life stages that are hard to find or study; this is true of many fungi, plants, and insects. We may know under what conditions the adult organism lives, yet have no idea where or how other life stages live. In fact, that was long the case for the monarch butterfly. Biologists knew that each spring these butterflies arrived in eastern North America from the south, but it took almost 120 years (from 1857 to 1975) before their overwintering sites were discovered in mountains west of Mexico City. The geographic ranges of species vary in patchiness Even within the geographic range of a species, much of the habitat is not suitable for the species. As a result, populations tend to have a patchy distribution. This observation holds at both large and small spatial scales. On land, for example, at the largest spatial scales, climate constrains where populations of a species are located (see Concept 3.1). At smaller spatial scales, factors such as topography, soil type, and the presence or absence of other species prevent populations from being spread evenly across the landscape. As we saw with the C. fremontii example (see Figure 9.5), some species require a very particular habitat that is found only in portions of its geographic range; hence its populations have a highly patchy distribution. Other species tolerate a broader range of habitats, but their abundances still vary throughout their geographic range. The distribution of red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) in arid regions of Australia illustrates this point. The abundance of red kangaroos varies throughout their geographic range, which includes several regions of high density and several areas where red kangaroos are not found (FIGURE 9.6). FIGURE 9.6 Abundance Varies throughout the Geographic Range of a Species The map shows abundances of the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) throughout its range in Australia. These data were based on aerial surveys conducted from 1980 to 1982. (After G. Caughley et al. 1987. Kangaroos: Their Ecology and Management in the Sheep Rangelands of Australia. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.) Finally, it is important to recognize that a population may exist in a series of habitat patches or fragments that are spatially isolated from one another but are linked by dispersal. Such a \u201cpatchy\u201d population structure can result from features of the abiotic environment, as we saw with Clematis, but can also result from human actions. For example, heaths in England once covered large, continuous areas, but over the past 200 years the development of farms and urban areas has greatly reduced the extent of these plants (FIGURE 9.7). In some cases, this fragmentation results in patches that are so isolated that little dispersal can occur among them, thus breaking a single large population into a series of much smaller populations. In Concept 9.4, we will explore the occurrence and consequences of patchy population structures (metapopulations) in more detail. FIGURE 9.7 Fragmentation of Dorset Heathlands The heathlands of Dorset, England, reached their maximum extent in Roman times, 2,000 years before the present. From 1759 to 1978, the decline of this habitat type accelerated: the total area of heathlands shrank from 400 km2 to less than 60 km2, and the number of patches increased greatly. (After N. R. Webb and L. E. Haskins. 1980.", "Biol Conserv 17: 281\u2013296.) How many patches of heathland were present in 1759? In 1978? Use your answers to estimate the average patch size in 1759 and 1978. Species distribution models can be used to predict a species geographic range As we have seen, to determine the geographic distribution of a species, scientists record all locations where the species is found. Most of our examples thus far in this chapter have involved species whose distributions are well understood. However, there are many species whose geographic ranges are not yet known. When such species are rare or in need of protection, it can be difficult to plan how best to protect them. Furthermore, ecologists often want to predict future distributions of species\u2014for example, whether and how a pest species will spread after it has been introduced to a new geographic region. Scientists and policymakers face similar challenges when they seek to predict how distributions of species will shift in response to global climate change. One way to predict the current or future distribution of a species is to characterize how both abiotic and biotic conditions influence the occurrence or abundance of species. Such information can be used to construct a species distribution model, a tool that predicts a species\u2019 geographic distribution based on the environmental conditions at locations the species is known to occupy. Investigators from the United States and Mexico used such an approach to predict the distributions of chameleons in Madagascar (Raxworthy et al. 2003). The researchers obtained information about vegetation cover (from satellite images), temperature, precipitation, topography (elevation, slope, aspect), and hydrology (water flow, tendency to pool) from government and commercial sources. Values for these environmental variables were recorded for each of a series of 1 \u00d7 1-km2 areas (referred to as grid cells) that covered all of Madagascar. Next, for each of 11 chameleon species, rules were developed that described the environmental conditions in which the species was most likely to be found; we\u2019ll refer to these rules as habitat rules. There are many different ways to develop such habitat rules. The chameleon study used a computer program that compared the environmental conditions of grid cells selected at random from a map of Madagascar with the environmental conditions of grid cells where a chameleon species was known to occur. For example, initially a habitat rule might state that a species should be found in regions where the temperature ranges from 15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C and the elevation ranges from 300 to 550 m. This rule might change at random to a temperature range of 15\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C and an elevation range of 300 to 500 m. If the new rule improves the ability of the program to predict where the species is actually found, it is retained, and other, less successful rules are discarded. For the Madagascar chameleons, the accuracy of the distribution model developed was tested with chameleon location data that had not been entered into the program. The model performed well, correctly predicting where these chameleons lived 75% to 85% of the time. Next, the model was used to predict the geographic ranges of each of the 11 chameleon species\u2014information that will be useful in efforts to protect chameleon habitat. Finally, the researchers investigated an interesting \u201cerror\u201d in the model: there were several overlapping areas in which the model predicted that 2 or more of the 11 species would be found but in which no chameleons were known to occur (FIGURE 9.8). When two of these overlapping areas were surveyed, 7 previously unknown chameleon species were discovered. More intensive surveys conducted at the same time, but at sites outside these overlapping areas, found only 2 new species. Thus, the scientists were able to predict both the distributions of known chameleon species and the locations of habitats suitable for other chameleons, and the latter prediction led to the discovery of 7 new chameleon species. FIGURE 9.8 Predicted Distributions of Madagascar Chameleons The predicted distributions of 3 of 11 species of chameleons are shown for the panther chameleon (Furcifer pardalis), the spiny chameleon (F. verrucosus), and the plated leaf chameleon (Brookesia stumpffi). All 11 of the predicted distributions proved accurate. (After C. J. Raxworthy et al. 2003. Nature 426: 837\u2013841.) Self-Assessment 9.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 9.3 Species are limited in their distribution and abundance by habitat suitability, historical factors, and dispersal.", "9.3.1 Describe the factors important to the suitability of habitat for populations and species. 9.3.2 Explain how the distribution and abundance of species can reflect their evolutionary and geologic history. 9.3.3 Describe the role of dispersal and migration in distributing organisms across the landscape. Processes Important to Distribution and Abundance It is clear from the chameleon example discussed earlier in this chapter that identifying the factors important to species presence is key to understanding their distribution and abundance patterns. Many factors can influence the distributions and abundances of organisms. We\u2019ll survey these factors by grouping them into three categories: habitat suitability, historical factors (such as evolutionary history and continental drift), and dispersal. Habitat suitability determines distribution and abundance Good and poor places to live exist for all species. A desert species is not likely to perform well in the Arctic, or vice versa. Even small differences among environments in how well individuals survive or reproduce there can cause the abundance of a species to be high in certain environments and low in others. Thus, the distribution and abundance of a species are influenced strongly by the presence of appropriate habitat. But what factors make habitat suitable? THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT As we discussed in Unit 1, the climate and other aspects of the abiotic (nonliving) environment, such as soil pH, salt concentration, and available nutrients, set limits on whether a habitat will be suitable for a particular species. Some species can tolerate a broad range of physical conditions, while others have more narrow requirements. Creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), for example, has a broad distribution in North American deserts, ranging across much of the southwestern United States and northwestern and central Mexico (FIGURE 9.9). Creosote bush is very tolerant of arid conditions: it uses water rapidly when it is available, then shuts down its metabolic processes during periods of extended drought. Creosote bush also tolerates cold well, so its populations thrive in high-elevation deserts where winter temperatures can remain below freezing for several days. FIGURE 9.9 The Distributions of Two Drought-Tolerant Plants The geographic distribution of creosote bush(After T. W. Yang. 1970.(Larrea tridentata) is much larger than that of saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea). J Arizona Acad 6: 41\u201345; F. Shreve and I. L. Wiggins. 1951. . Carnegie Institute of Washington: Sci Vegetation and Flora of the Sonoran Desert Washington, DC.) The saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea), on the other hand, has a more limited distribution. Like creosote bush, saguaro flourishes under arid conditions, but it achieves its drought tolerance in different ways. Although saguaro does not have typical leaves, its spines are actually modified leaves whose low surface area reduces water loss. Furthermore, during wet periods, the saguaro stores water in its massive trunk and arms, saving it for use during times of drought. Saguaro cannot tolerate cold, however; it is killed when temperatures remain below freezing for 36 hours or more. The importance of saguaro\u2019s sensitivity to cold is revealed by its distribution: the northern limit of its distribution corresponds closely to a boundary north of which temperatures occasionally remain below freezing for at least 36 hours (see Figure 9.9). THE BIOTIC ENVIRONMENT The biotic environment also has important effects on distributions and abundances of species. Obviously, species that depend completely on one or a few other species for their growth, reproduction, or survival cannot live where the species on which they depend are absent. For example, all species require food resources, and thus habitat suitability will depend on the distribution and abundance of their food. An example of this is the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), an endangered songbird. In the 1950s, this bird nearly went extinct: its total world population was reduced to just 26 individuals located on Cousin Island in the Seychelles, a group of islands off the east coast of Africa. After the Seychelles warbler was legally protected in 1968, the Cousin Island population increased to about 300 birds, and the species was introduced successfully to two other islands. Seychelles warblers are territorial: a breeding pair defends its territory against other birds of the species. But not all territories are equal: some are of higher quality than others because they provide more food (e.g., insects) (FIGURE 9.10). Birds that live in a high-quality territory live longer and produce more young. In addition, a breeding pair that lives in a high-quality territory often receives help rearing its young from offspring born in previous years.", "Because the high-quality sites attract offspring from previous years and are aggregated toward one end of the island, differences in territory quality make the dispersion of individuals in the population more clumped than it otherwise would be. FIGURE 9.10 Food Resources Affect Habitat Suitability The mean quality of Seychelles warbler territories on Cousin Island across the years 1986 to 1990. Territories were grouped into three quality categories: high, medium, and low. High-quality territories were clustered inland; these territories had high vegetation cover, little wind, and abundant insects. Coastal areas had lower-quality territories because salt spray led to defoliation, which lowered insect abundance. (After J. Komdeur. 1992. Nature 358: 493\u2013495.) Organisms can also be excluded from an area by herbivores, predators, competitors, parasites, or pathogens, any of which can greatly reduce the survival or reproduction of members of a population. For example, the case study describes how the distribution of kelp forests is dependent on the presence of sea urchins, which is determined by the presence of sea otter predators. Another dramatic example of biotic control of species distribution and abundance is provided by the successful biological control of Opuntia stricta, an introduced cactus that spread rapidly to cover large areas in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. The cactus was imported from the southern United States in 1839 and planted as hedge. Within 40 years, O. stricta had become a pest species, and by 1925 it covered 243,000 km2. The cactus can grow up to 2 m high, and in many areas it covered the ground with dense, spiny thickets, making the rangelands it occupied useless (FIGURE 9.11A). In the hope of controlling the cactus, an Argentinean moth, Cactoblastis cactorum, known to feed on Opuntia was released in 1926 (FIGURE 9.11B). By 1931, the moths had spread widely and destroyed billions of cacti. Since 1940, the cactus has persisted in small numbers, but its distribution and abundance have been greatly reduced. Although the introduction of C. cactorum as a means of biological pest control appears to have been a great success, such introductions must be undertaken cautiously because they can lead to unintended consequences, such as damage to native species (Louda et al. 1997). FIGURE 9.11 Herbivores Can Limit Plant Distributions In Australia, the moth Cactoblastis cactorum was used to control populations of an introduced cactus, Opuntia stricta. (A) A dense thicket of O. stricta 2 months before the release of the moth. (B) The same stand 3 years later, after the moth had killed the cacti by feeding on their growing tips. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC ENVIRONMENT In reality, the distribution and abundance of species are a product of both the abiotic and biotic environment. For example, the quality of the territories of the Seychelles warbler depends not only on insect food resources but also the exposure to salt spray and wind (see Figure 9.10). In another example, the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides cannot survive where summer air temperatures are above 25\u00b0C, and it cannot reproduce if winter air temperatures do not remain below 10\u00b0C for 20 days or more. On the Pacific coast of North America, temperatures are such that S. balanoides could be found 1,600 km farther south than it currently is (FIGURE 9.12). But this barnacle is absent from the region shown in purple in Figure 9.12, presumably because competition from other species of barnacles prevents it from living in what would otherwise be suitable habitat. To the north, as temperatures become increasingly colder, a point is reached where S. balanoides outcompetes the other barnacles and maintains healthy populations. Thus, the abiotic and biotic environments interact to determine where populations of this barnacle are found. FIGURE 9.12 Joint Effects of Temperature and Competition on Barnacle Distribution Although temperatures are suitable for the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides throughout the red- and purple-shaded regions, it is excluded from the southern region potentially by its competitors. In the red-shaded regions, temperatures are colder and S. balanoides is the superior competitor. Is global warming likely to increase or decrease the geographic range of S. balanoides? Explain. DISTURBANCE The distributions of some organisms depend on regular forms of disturbance. A disturbance is an abiotic event that kills or damages some individuals and thereby creates opportunities for other individuals to grow and reproduce. Many plant species, for example, persist in an area only if there are periodic fires.", "If humans prevent fires, such species are replaced by other species that are not as tolerant of fires but are superior competitors in the absence of fires. Thus, a change in the frequency of fires can change the composition of ecological communities, as you can explore in ANALYZING DATA 9.1. Floods, windstorms, and droughts are other forms of disturbance that can harm some species but give others an advantage. We\u2019ll discuss the role of disturbance in more detail in Chapter 17. Distribution and abundance reflect evolutionary and geologic history Events in the evolutionary and geologic history of Earth have had a profound effect on where organisms live today. Why, for example, are polar bears (Ursus maritimus) found in the Arctic but not in Antarctica? Polar bears hunt on ice packs and eat seals, both of which abound in Antarctica. Part of the answer to our question can be found in the evolutionary history of these bears. Fossils and genetic evidence indicate that polar bears evolved from brown bears (Ursus arctos) in the Arctic (Lindqvist et al. 2010); hence U. maritimus is found in the Arctic because the species originated there. As for their absence from Antarctica, although polar bears can travel over 1,000 km in a year, it appears they cannot or will not cross the tropical regions that separate the Arctic from Antarctica. Thus, the distribution of polar bear populations is influenced by evolutionary history and dispersal as well as by the presence of suitable habitat. ANALYZING DATA 9.1 Bush beardgrass (Schizachyrium condensatum), molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora), and several other non-native grasses were introduced by humans to Hawaii as forage for livestock. By 1969, introduced grasses had invaded the dry forests of Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii. These dry forests are open woodlands with an understory of shrubs; they contain few or no native grasses. Hughes et al. (1991)* provide data on fire occurrence (TABLE A) and on vegetation abundance in unburned and burned regions of dry forests in the park (TABLE B). TABLE A Time frame Number of fires Total area burned 1928\u20131968 9 2.3 ha 1969\u20131988 32 7,800 ha TABLE B Vegetation abundance index Vegetation type Unburned Burned once Burned twice Native trees and shrubs 112.3 5.2 0.7 Introduced grass 80.0 92.1 100.9 1. Using the data in Table A, calculate the frequency of fires and the average area burned before and after introduced grasses invaded Volcanoes National Park. What do your results suggest about how introduced grasses have affected the occurrence of fires in Volcanoes National Park? 2. Based on the data in Table B, does fire promote or limit the abundance of native trees and shrubs? How does fire affect introduced grasses? 3. Introduced grasses recover quickly from fires, and they provide more fuel for future fires than do native trees and shrubs. Use this information to predict what may happen if a fire occurs in a Hawaiian dry forest after introduced grasses have invaded that forest. Do the events you\u2019ve described help to explain the data in Tables A and B? Explain your reasoning. See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. *Hughes, F., P. M. Vitousek and T. Tunison. 1991. Alien grass invasion and fire in the seasonal submontane zone of Hawai\u2019i. Ecology 72: 743\u2013746. Geologic history plays a key role in some curious distribution patterns that puzzled biologists for nearly 100 years. Consider Alfred Russel Wallace\u2019s observation that the animals of a region can differ considerably across relatively short geographic distances (Wallace 1860). The mammal communities of the Philippines, for example, are more similar to those in Africa (88% overlap at the family level) than they are to those in New Guinea (64% overlap), despite the fact that Africa is 5,500 km away and New Guinea is only 750 km away. No explanation for this and other similar observations could be found until the discovery of continental drift, the gradual movement of continents over time (see WEB EXTENSION 18.1). This discovery led to the realization that the Philippines and New Guinea are on different tectonic plates and have been in close geographic contact for a relatively short time. Dispersal is a process that distributes organisms across the landscape Organisms differ greatly in their capacity for movement. In plants, for example, dispersal occurs when seeds move away from the parent plant.", "Although events such as storms can transport seeds long distances (hundreds of meters to many kilometers; see Cain et al. 2000), dispersal distances in plants are usually small (one to a few tens of meters). In some cases, typical seed dispersal distances are so small that they hardly count as movement. For example, seeds of the forest plant Viola odorata have been seen to disperse only 0.002 to 0.02 m (0.008\u20130.8 inches) when ants are not present; when ants are present, they may carry these seeds for a few meters. At the other end of the spectrum, some whale species travel tens of thousands of kilometers in a single year. Overall, the spatial extent of populations varies tremendously\u2014from very small, in organisms that disperse little, to very large, in species that travel great distances. Whales also migrate, which is a specific type of dispersal in response to seasonal variation in resources. Migration involves round-trip movement and usually includes the entire population. For example, five separate North Pacific populations of the humpback whale migrate more than 4,800 km (~3,000 miles) between their winter breeding grounds in the south (Mexico, Hawaii, and Japan) and their summer feeding grounds in the north (Northeast Pacific coast and Gulf of Alaska) (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 9.13). A 2006 survey of North Pacific humpback whales determined that these populations have rebounded since 1966, when commercial whaling of these populations was banned. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 9.13 Migration of North Pacific Humpback Whales Five separate populations (represented by different-colored arrows) of the North Pacific humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) migrate between their winter breeding grounds off Mexico, Hawaii, and Japan and their summer feeding grounds in the Gulf of Alaska and the Northeast Pacific coast. (Map after https://hawaiihumpbackwhale.noaa.gov/explore/humpback_whale.html. Migration data from SPLASH Research.) As demonstrated by the polar bear\u2019s absence from Antarctica, a species\u2019 limited capacity for dispersal can prevent it from reaching areas of suitable habitat\u2014a phenomenon known as dispersal limitation. In another example, the Hawaiian Islands have only one native terrestrial mammal, the Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), which was able to fly to the islands. No other land mammals have been able to disperse to Hawaii on their own, although cats, pigs, wild dogs, rats, goats, mongooses, and other mammals now thrive in Hawaii following their introduction to the islands by people. Dispersal limitation can also occur on smaller spatial scales, preventing populations from expanding to nearby areas of apparently suitable habitat. An example of dispersal limitation was documented in a longterm study of the English bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta). In 1960, 27 populations of 7 to 10 individuals each were established in apparently suitable forest habitat located near source populations (Van der Veken et al. 2007). Forty-five years later, only 11 (41%) of these experimental populations persisted, and most contained hundreds or thousands of individuals. These results suggested that dispersal limitation had prevented the bluebells from maintaining the majority of their original populations or creating new populations in areas nearby. In the following section, let\u2019s consider in more detail how dispersal can create and maintain multiple populations and the role of these metapopulations in the conservation of endangered species. Self-Assessment 9.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 9.4 In metapopulations, sets of spatially isolated populations are linked by dispersal. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 9.4.1 Describe how the rates of colonization and extinction of populations affect metapopulations. 9.4.2 Describe how the amount of suitable habitat and population isolation can affect metapopulation persistence or extinction. Metapopulations The checkered landscapes of the Dorset Heathlands demonstrate that the world is a patchy place (see Figure 9.7). The patchy nature of the landscape ensures that for many species, areas of suitable habitat do not cover large, continuous regions, but rather exist as a series of favorable sites that are spatially isolated from one another. As a result, the populations of a species are often scattered across the landscape, each in an area of favorable habitat but separated from one another by hundreds of meters or more. These seemingly isolated populations can be classified as a metapopulation when individuals (or gametes) occasionally disperse from one population to another. Literally, the term \u201cmetapopulation\u201d refers to a population of populations, but it is usually defined in a more particular sense as a set of spatially isolated populations linked to one another by dispersal (FIGURE 9.14).", "In some metapopulations, certain populations are sources (from which the number of individuals that disperse to other populations is greater than the number of migrants they receive) while other populations are sinks (which receive more immigrants than the number of emigrants they produce). FIGURE 9.14 The Metapopulation Concept A metapopulation is a set of spatially isolated populations linked by dispersal. (A) Seven patches of suitable habitat for a species are diagrammed, four of which are currently occupied and three of which are not. The area outside of these seven patches represents unsuitable habitat. (B) Satellite image of a group of lakes in northern Alaska that are sometimes connected to one another by temporary streams that form after the snow melts or after periods of heavy rainfall. Metapopulations are characterized by repeated extinctions and colonizations As ecologists have long recognized, populations of some species are prone to extinction for two reasons: (1) the patchiness of their habitat makes dispersal between populations difficult, and (2) environmental conditions can change in a rapid and unpredictable manner. Metaphorically, we can think of such populations as a set of \u201cblinking lights\u201d that wink on and off, seemingly at random, as patches of suitable habitat are colonized and the populations in those patches then go extinct. Although the individual populations may be prone to extinction, the collection of populations\u2014the metapopulation\u2014persists because it includes populations that are going extinct and new populations established by colonization. Building on this idea of random extinctions and colonizations, Richard Levins (1969, 1970) represented metapopulation dynamics in terms of the extinction and colonization of habitat patches: (9.4) where p represents the proportion of habitat patches that are occupied at time t, while c and e are the patch colonization and patch extinction rates, respectively. In deriving Equation 9.4, Levins made a few assumptions, including the following: (1) there is a very large (infinite) number of identical habitat patches, (2) all patches have an equal chance of receiving colonists (hence the spatial arrangement of the patches does not matter), and (3) all patches have an equal chance of extinction. As we\u2019ll discuss below, some of the assumptions of Levins\u2019s model are not realistic. Still, Equation 9.4 leads to a simple but fundamental insight: for a metapopulation to persist for a long time, the ratio e/c must be less than 1 (see WEB EXTENSION 9.1 for a description of how this result was obtained). This means that some patches will be occupied if the colonization rate is greater than the extinction rate. On the other hand, if the extinction rate is greater than the colonization rate (and hence, e/c > 1), the metapopulation will collapse and all populations in it will become extinct. Levins\u2019s groundbreaking approach focused attention on a number of key issues, such as how to estimate factors that influence patch colonization and extinction, the importance of the spatial arrangement of suitable patches, the extent to which the landscape between habitat patches affects dispersal, and the vexing problem of how to determine whether empty patches are suitable habitat or not. Levins\u2019s rule for persistence also has applied importance, as we will see shortly. A metapopulation can go extinct even when suitable habitat remains Human actions (such as land development) often convert large tracts of habitat into sets of spatially isolated habitat fragments (see Figure 9.7). Such habitat fragmentation can cause a species to have a metapopulation structure where it did not have one before. If land development continues and the habitat becomes still more fragmented, the metapopulation\u2019s colonization rate (c) may decrease because patches become more isolated and hence harder to reach by dispersal. Further habitat fragmentation also causes the patches that remain to become smaller; as a result, the extinction rate (e) may increase because smaller patches have smaller populations, which, as we have just seen, have a higher risk of extinction. Both of these trends (an increase in e and a decrease in c) cause the ratio e/c to increase. Thus, if too much habitat is removed, the ratio e/c may shift suddenly from less than 1 to greater than 1, thereby dooming all populations \u2014and the metapopulation\u2014to eventual extinction, even though some habitat remains. The idea that all populations in a metapopulation might go extinct while suitable habitat remains was developed further in studies on the northern spotted owl (FIGURE 9.15). The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America.", "It lives in old-growth forest, where nesting pairs establish large territories that range in size from 12 to 30 km2 (territories are larger in poor-quality habitat). Lande (1988) modified Levins\u2019s model to include a description of how owls might search for vacant \u201cpatches,\u201d which were interpreted as sites suitable for individual territories. Lande estimated that the entire metapopulation would collapse if the area covered by old-growth forest were reduced by logging to less than 20% of the total area of a large region. This result had a powerful impact: it illustrated how a species might go extinct if its habitat dropped below a critical threshold (in this case, 20% suitable habitat), and it contributed to the 1990 listing of the northern spotted owl as a threatened species in the United States. The importance of conserving old-growth forest has been highlighted by the effects of a recent invader, the barred owl (Strix varia): the arrival of this species can cause spotted owl populations to become extinct, but such extinctions are less likely in old-growth forests that cover a large area (Dugger et al. 2011). FIGURE 9.15 The Northern Spotted Owl The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) thrives in old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest; such forests include those that have never been cut, or have not been cut for 200 years or more. Extinction and colonization rates often vary among patches As the impact of Lande\u2019s work on the northern spotted owl suggests, the metapopulation approach has become increasingly important in applied ecology. But metapopulations in the field often violate the assumptions of Levins\u2019s model. For example, patches often differ considerably in population size and in the ease with which they can be reached by dispersal. As a result, extinction and colonization rates may vary greatly among patches. Therefore, most ecologists use more complex models (see Hanski 1999) when addressing practical questions in the field. Consider the skipper butterfly Hesperia comma. In the early 1900s, this butterfly was found on grazed calcareous grasslands (i.e., grasslands growing in alkaline soils found on limestone or chalk outcrops) throughout a broad range of the United Kingdom. Starting in the 1950s, however, calcareous grasslands became overgrown because the numbers of cattle and other important grazers were reduced. As a result, H. comma populations began to decline. By the mid-1970s, the butterfly was found in only 10 restricted regions, a very small fraction of its original range. Things began to pick up for the butterfly in the early 1980s. By this time, habitat conditions had improved because livestock had been reintroduced. Surveying these grasslands in 1982, Chris Thomas and Ter\u00e9sa Jones documented the locations of all patches containing H. comma populations and of all patches that appeared suitable for, but were not occupied by, H. comma. To determine the fate of each occupied and unoccupied patch over time, they surveyed the patches again in 1991 and noted which ones were occupied at that time. Their results highlight two important features of many metapopulations: isolation by distance and the effect of patch area. Isolation by distance occurs when patches located far from occupied patches are less likely to be colonized than are nearby patches. In H. comma, distance from occupied patches had a strong effect on whether patches vacant in 1982 were colonized by 1991: few patches separated by more than 2 km from an occupied patch were colonized during that period (FIGURE 9.16). Patch area also affected the chance of colonization: the majority of colonized patches were at least 0.1 ha in size. Patch area may have affected colonization rates directly because small patches may be harder for the butterflies to find than large patches. Alternatively, H. comma might have colonized small patches, but then suffered extinction in those patches by 1991 due to problems associated with small population size; such patches would appear never to have been colonized because the sites were not sampled between 1982 and 1991. FIGURE 9.16 Colonization in a Butterfly Metapopulation Colonization of suitable habitat from 1982 to 1991 by the skipper butterfly Hesperia comma was influenced by patch area and patch isolation (distance to the nearest occupied patch). Each red or blue circle represents a patch of suitable habitat that was not occupied by H. comma in 1982. The lines show the combinations of patch area and patch isolation for which there was a 90%, 50%, and 10% chance of colonization(After C. D. Thomas et al. 1992.", "92: 563\u2013567; C. D. Thomas and T. (as calculated from a statistical analysis of the data). OecologiaM. Jones. 1993. 62: 472\u2013481.) J Anim Ecol Based on these results, estimate the chance of colonization for a 1-ha patch located 1 km away from the nearest occupied patch. Among patches occupied in 1982, Thomas and Jones found that the chance of extinction was highest in small patches (most likely because small patches tend to have small population sizes) and in patches that were far from another occupied patch. Isolation by distance can affect the chance of extinction because a patch that is near an occupied patch may receive immigrants repeatedly, which may increase the patch population size and make extinction less likely. This tendency for high rates of immigration to protect a population from extinction (by reducing the problems associated with small population size) is known as the rescue effect (Brown and Kodric-Brown 1977). In Chapter 24, we discuss in more detail the role of metapopulation dynamics in the conservation of species experiencing habitat fragmentation. Self-Assessment 9.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED From Kelp Forest to Urchin Barren When sea urchins graze kelp so heavily that kelp forests are replaced by urchin barrens, what happens next? We might expect that the urchins would starve because they have destroyed their food source. Field studies show that urchin barrens can persist for years on end, however, because urchins can use food sources other than kelp, including benthic diatoms, less preferred algae (including hard, encrusting forms that cover rock surfaces), and detritus. When food is extremely scarce, urchins can reduce their metabolic rate, reabsorb their sex organs (forgoing reproduction but increasing their chances of survival), and absorb dissolved nutrients directly from seawater. As tough and resilient as urchins are, they are vulnerable to predation by sea otters (Enhydra lutris), which function as impressive urchin-eating machines. Otters need to eat large quantities of food each day because they have a high metabolic rate and they store little energy as fat. Urchins are a favorite food of otters, and since there are 20 to 30 otters per square kilometer around some Aleutian islands, the potential exists for otters to consume enormous quantities of urchins. These facts, coupled with the observation that urchins usually are common only where otters are absent, led investigators to suspect that otters might control the locations of urchins, and hence the locations of kelp forests. To test this hypothesis, Estes and Duggins (1995) compared sites with and without otters, both in the Aleutian Islands and along the coast of southern Alaska. Confirming the results of previous studies, they found that sites where otters had been present for a long time usually had many kelp and few urchins, whereas sites without otters usually had many urchins and few kelp. Estes and Duggins also collected data from sites colonized by otters during the course of their study. At sites in southern Alaska, the arrival of otters had a rapid and dramatic effect: within 2 years, urchins virtually disappeared, and kelp densities increased dramatically (FIGURE 9.17A). At Aleutian Islands sites, however, kelp recovered more slowly after the arrival of otters (FIGURE 9.17B). At these sites, otters ate most of the large urchins, reducing urchin biomass by an average of 50%. However, in a twist that did not occur at the southern Alaska sites, the arrival of new urchin larvae (most likely via ocean currents) provided a steady supply of small urchins. These small urchins slowed the rate at which kelp forests replaced urchin barrens. FIGURE 9.17 The Effect of Otters on Urchins and Kelp Plots of kelp density versus sea urchin biomass measured at sites in southern Alaska and in the Aleutian Islands before and 2 years after the return of otters. (A) Two years after otters colonized four sites in southern Alaska, urchin biomass had declined considerably, and kelp density had increased substantially at all sites. (B) Two years after otters colonized nine sites in the Aleutian Islands, sea urchin biomass had declined at six of the sites, but kelp showed clear signs of recovery at only two of the sites. Arrows indicate a decline in urchin biomass and (at some sites) an increase in kelp density in the presence of otters. (After J. A. Estes and D. O. Duggins. 1995. Ecol Mongr 65: 75\u2013100.)", "For the nine sites in (B), list the six sites where urchin biomass declined; also list the two sites where kelp density increased. Historically, sea otters were abundant throughout the North Pacific, but by 1900 they had been hunted (for fur) to near extinction. By 1911, when international treaties protected the sea otter, only about 1,000 otters remained\u2014less than 1% of their early numbers. Scattered colonies of otters survived and gradually increased in size around some Aleutian islands, causing the observed pattern of kelp forests around some islands, urchin barrens around others. In the 1990s, however, there was a sudden and unexpected decline in otter populations. Urchins made a comeback, and kelp densities were reduced (FIGURE 9.18A\u2013D). The question then became, What caused the decline of sea otter populations in the 1990s? FIGURE 9.18 Killer Whale Predation on Otters May Have Led to Kelp Declines Declines in otter abundance over time (A) are associated with (B) a rise in urchin biomass, (C) an increase in the intensity of urchin grazing on kelp, and (D) a decrease in kelp density. (E) The proposed mechanisms for these changes. Strengths of the effects are indicated by the thicknesses of the arrows. Error bars in (B) and (C) show one SE of the mean. (After J. A. Estes et al. 1998. Science 282: 5388.) James Estes and his colleagues have suggested that otters declined because of increased predation by the killer whale, Orcinus orca (FIGURE 9.18E). It is not known why killer whales began to eat more otters. Some researchers have argued that this change may have been part of a chain of events that began when commercial whaling drove populations of large whales to low numbers (Springer et al. 2003). According to this hypothesis, once their preferred prey (large whales) became rare, killer whales began to hunt a series of other species (first harbor seals, then fur seals, then sea lions), each of which then also declined in number. Other researchers dispute the connection between commercial whaling and the decline of seals and sea lions, suggesting that seal and sea lion populations declined for other reasons, such as a lack of food due to reduced fish populations in the open ocean (DeMaster et al. 2006). Whatever the cause, it was in the 1990s, when populations of harbor seals, fur seals, and sea lions had all declined to low levels, that killer whales were first seen attacking otters. Otters and killer whales had been observed in close proximity for decades, but within 10 years of the first known attack, otter populations crashed. CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF SPECIES The waters along the east coast of Tasmania have warmed considerably since 1950 (FIGURE 9.19A). As this warming has occurred, the long-spined sea urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii) has extended its range to the south (FIGURE 9.19B). The changes in the distribution of this urchin are consistent with the idea that climate change is the underlying cause: the larvae of C. rodgersii fail to develop properly in waters colder than 12\u00b0C, and the urchin has moved into new regions as waters in those locations have warmed to the point that they remain above that temperature. As C. rodgersii has expanded its range, it has established extensive urchin barrens in which all kelp have been removed by grazing (Ling 2008). Thus, through its effects on the geographic distribution of the long-spined sea urchin, ongoing climate change appears to be having a profound effect on kelp ecosystems along the Tasmanian coast. (For more information about how this example connects to other levels of the ecological hierarchy, see ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 9.1.) FIGURE 9.19 A Climate-Driven Range Extension Winter water temperatures along the east coast of Tasmania in August, the most important month for offspring production in long-spined sea urchins (A). The map in (B) shows the years in which long-spined sea urchins were first observed at points along the Tasmanian coast. (After S. Ling et al. 2009. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106: 22341\u201322345. \u00a9 2009 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.) As observed for the long-spined sea urchin, shifts in the geographic distributions of hundreds of other species have been linked to climate change (Parmesan and Yohe 2003). In some marine communities, range shifts driven by climate change have contributed to the rapid replacement of temperate species with species from subtropical or tropical regions, leading to the formation of entirely new communities (Wernberg et al. 2016).", "On land, many species in the Northern Hemisphere have expanded the northern edges of their ranges toward the pole, while the southern edges of their ranges have maintained relatively stable positions (Sunday et al. 2012). But range shifts do not always occur in this way, nor do they necessarily keep pace with ongoing climate change. For example, Kerr et al. (2015) found that the geographic ranges of 67 species of bumblebees have shown rapid losses in the south and only a slow expansion in the north\u2014as a result, their ranges are shrinking and the populations of some bumblebee species have declined as the climate has warmed. Moreover, even when the range expansion of one or more species keeps pace with climate change, such range shifts can have cascading and wide-ranging effects on other species (as illustrated by the decimation of kelp forests as the long-spined sea urchin expanded its range to the south). The exact nature of such cascading effects can be hard to predict, but it is clear that ongoing climate change will have major effects on ecosystems throughout the globe. CONNECTIONS in NATURE FROM URCHINS TO ECOSYSTEMS Urchins, otters, and perhaps killer whales and people play important roles in determining the distribution of kelp. But does the presence or absence of kelp matter? Do kelp have strong effects on nearshore ecosystems? Indeed they do. Kelp forests are among the most productive ecosystems in the world, rivaling tropical forests in2 the amount of new biomass they produce each year (up to 2,000 g of carbon/m /year). Kelp strands grow from their base, and their tips are constantly \u201ceroded\u201d by wave action and other physical forces. Thus, much of their biomass ends up as floating bits of detritus, which provides food for suspension feeders such as barnacles and mussels that filter food from the water. As a result, barnacles and mussels grow more rapidly and are more abundant in kelp forests than in urchin barrens. Carbon-13 labeling studies (see Ecological Toolkit 5.1) have shown that the sugars kelp produce by photosynthesis provide a food source for a wide range of species (Duggins et al. 1989). Kelp forests also serve as nurseries for the young of many marine species and as havens from predators for the adults of still more species. Overall, we can see that the effects of urchins on kelp, and of otters on urchins, do indeed matter: urchins and otters (and killer whales) set into motion a chain of events that alters fundamental aspects of the marine ecosystem. A similar chain of events seems to have affected kelp ecosystems along the coast of Tasmania, Australia. However, the events in Tasmania may be driven by an additional factor: climate change. Population Dynamics KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 10.1 Populations are dynamic entities that vary in size over time. CONCEPT 10.2 Delayed density dependence can cause populations to cycle. CONCEPT 10.3 The risk of extinction increases in populations that fluctuate in size and/or are small. A Sea in Trouble: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 In the 1980s, the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi (FIGURE 10.1) was introduced into the Black Sea, most likely by the discharge of ballast water from cargo ships. The timing of this invasion could hardly have been worse. At that time, the Black Sea ecosystem was already in decline due to increased inputs of nutrients such as nitrogen from sewage, fertilizers, and industrial wastes (and, as we\u2019ll see in this chapter\u2019s Connections in Nature, overfishing may also have contributed to the ecosystem\u2019s decline). The increased supply of nutrients had devastating effects across the northern Black Sea, where the waters are shallow (less than 200 m deep) and prone to problems that stem from eutrophication (an increase in the nutrient content of an ecosystem). As nutrient concentrations increased in these shallow waters, phytoplankton abundance increased, water clarity decreased, oxygen concentrations dropped, and fish populations experienced massive die-offs. Nutrient concentrations in deeper portions of the Black Sea also rose, causing increased phytoplankton abundance, but not fish die-offs. FIGURE 10.1 A Potent Invader The comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi was introduced from the east coast of North America to the Black Sea, wreaking havoc in its new ecosystem upon its arrival. Such was the situation when Mnemiopsis arrived. This marine invertebrate species is a voracious predator of zooplankton, fish eggs, and young fish.", "Furthermore, Mnemiopsis continues to feed even when it is completely full, which causes it to regurgitate large quantities of prey stuck in balls of mucus. Small prey encased in mucus survive poorly. As a result, the negative effect of Mnemiopsis on its prey outstrips even its considerable ability to digest food. Following its arrival in the Black Sea in the early 1980s, Mnemiopsis gradually increased in numbers. Then, in 1989, Mnemiopsis populations exploded (FIGURE 10.2A), reaching astonishing biomass levels (1.5\u20132.0 kg/m2) throughout the sea. The total biomass of Mnemiopsis in the Black Sea was estimated at 800 million tons (live weight) in 1989\u2014far greater than the world\u2019s entire annual commercial fish catch, which has never exceeded 95 million tons. FIGURE 10.2 Changes in the Black Sea Ecosystem The graphs track long-term changes in four components of the Black Sea ecosystem: (A) mean biomass of the invasive species Mnemiopsis leidyi (first measured in 1987), (B) mean biomass of zooplankton, (C) mean biomass of chlorophyll a (an indicator of phytoplankton abundance), and (D) Turkish anchovy landings (Turkish fishermen have garnered most of the Black Sea anchovy catch since 1980). (After A. E. Kideys. 2002. Science 297: 1482\u20131484.) The enormous numbers of Mnemiopsis present in 1989, and again in 1990, compounded the effects of the Black Sea\u2019s ongoing problems. Mnemiopsis ate huge quantities of zooplankton, causing their populations to crash (FIGURE 10.2B). Zooplankton eat phytoplankton, so Mnemiopsis indirectly caused phytoplankton populations to increase even more than they already had because of nutrient enrichment (FIGURE 10.2C). Upon their deaths, the phytoplankton and Mnemiopsis provided food for bacterial decomposers. Bacteria use oxygen as they decompose dead organisms, so as bacterial activity increased, oxygen concentrations in the water decreased, harming some fish populations. In addition, by devouring the food supplies (zooplankton), eggs, and young of important commercial fishes such as anchovies, Mnemiopsis led to a rapid decline in fish catches (FIGURE 10.2D), causing extensive losses in the Turkish fishing industry. The combined negative effects of nutrient enrichment and invasion by Mnemiopsis posed a serious threat to the Black Sea ecosystem. Although it covers a large surface area (over 423,000 km2), the Black Sea is nearly landlocked and exchanges little of its water each year with other ocean waters. In addition, the Black Sea is unusual in that only the top 150 to 200 m of its waters (~10% of its average depth) contain oxygen, which effectively makes the entire sea \u201cshallow\u201d for species that require oxygen. Its limited water exchange and anoxic deep waters make the Black Sea particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of nutrient enrichment. Native Black Sea predators and parasites had failed to regulate Mnemiopsis populations. Thus, in the early 1990s, the future of the Black Sea ecosystem looked bleak. Fortunately, by the late 1990s, there were signs of improvement: Mnemiopsis and phytoplankton populations had fallen, paving the way for the recovery of the Black Sea. How did this happen? View the script for the video Introduction In the last chapter, we focused on how and why the distribution and abundance of populations and species vary across landscapes. But population abundance can also change over time, displaying different patterns of population growth. This is true whether abundance is measured on a small spatial scale, such as the number of plants found in a restricted area along a riverbank, or on a much larger spatial scale, such as the number of cod found in the North Atlantic Ocean. Some populations differ little in abundance over time and space; others differ considerably. For example, Richard Root and Naomi Cappuccino (1992) studied abundances of 23 species of herbivorous insects that fed on tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima). They studied these insects for at least 6 consecutive years at each of 22 sites in the Finger Lakes region of New York (FIGURE 10.3). These sites were no more than 75 km (47 miles) apart; hence, in any given year, all the sites experienced roughly the same climate conditions. Nevertheless, insect abundances varied from one site to another and from one year to the next. For some species, such as the ball gall fly (Eurosta solidaginis), abundances varied relatively little. The maximum abundance reached by Eurosta over a 6-year period varied sixfold across the 22 sites, from 0.05 insects per stem at the site with the fewest individuals to 0.3 insects per stem at the site with the most individuals.", "Maximum abundances of other species, however, such as the beetle Trirhabda virgata, varied much more (by a factor of 336), ranging from 0.03 to 10.1 insects per stem. Overall, T. virgata populations varied considerably in abundance, both from one site to another and over time (see Figure 10.3). FIGURE 10.3 Populations Are Dynamic Changes in abundances of the beetle Trirhabda virgata on tall goldenrod plants over time at Montezuma, Maple Island, and Hector, 3 of the 22 sites used in the study. Five of these sites were located close to one another and are indicated on the map by an asterisk; all other sites are indicated by dots. (After R. B. Root and N. Cappuccino. 1992. Ecol Monogr 62: 393\u2013420; additional data from R. B. Root, personal communication.) In what year or years did Trirhabda abundance vary greatly over space? Explain. Ecologists typically use the term population dynamics to refer to the ways in which population sizes change over time. In this chapter, we\u2019ll consider the dynamics of populations in more detail, placing special emphasis on the patterns of population growth and the risk of extinction for small populations. In Chapter 11, we\u2019ll narrow our discussion of population dynamics by using quantitative models to understand and measure population growth patterns. But first, we\u2019ll begin our discussion of population dynamics by surveying patterns of population growth in nature. CONCEPT 10.1 Populations are dynamic entities that vary in size over time. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 10.1.1 List the different patterns of population growth observed in nature. 10.1.2 Compare the patterns of exponential growth with that of logistic growth. 10.1.3 Describe population size fluctuations and the special case of population cycling. Patterns of Population Growth Most observed patterns of population growth can be grouped into four major types: exponential growth, logistic growth, population fluctuations, and regular population cycles (a special type of fluctuation). Bear in mind, however, that a single population could experience each of these four types of growth at different times. For example, as we will see shortly, a population may grow logistically yet fluctuate around the values expected in logistic growth. Exponential growth can occur when conditions are favorable Many organisms, such as giant puffball fungi and the desert shrub Cleome droserifolia, produce large numbers of offspring. In such cases, if even a fraction of those offspring survive to reproduce, the population can increase in size very quickly, showing a pattern of exponential growth, or a J-shaped pattern (see Figure 11.4). Exponential growth occurs when the rate of growth increases (or decreases) in proportion to the current number of individuals. Exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely, but when conditions are favorable, a population can increase exponentially for a limited time. Such periods of exponential growth can occur within the established range of a species, as when good weather occurs for several years running. They can also occur when a species reaches a new geographic area, either by dispersing on its own or with human assistance. An example of how dispersal can lead to exponential growth is provided by the cattle egret subspecies Bubulcus ibis ibis (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 10.4A). These birds originally lived in the Mediterranean region and in parts of central and southern Africa. Since the late 1800s and early 1900s, however, they have colonized new regions on their own, including South America and North America. Typically, after the subspecies reached a new area, its population in that area increased exponentially as it became established in its new habitat (FIGURE 10.4B). For example, after the cattle egret colonized the San Francisco Bay area in the 1990s, its populations there grew exponentially for over a decade (Kelly et al. 2007). As in cattle egrets, species that successfully colonize new geographic regions on their own do so by long-distance events. Local populations in the new region then increase in size\u2014often growing exponentially\u2014while also expanding (by relatively short-distance dispersal events) to occupy nearby areas of suitable habitat. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 10.4 Colonizing the New World (A) The cattle egret subspecies Bubulcus ibis ibis dispersed from Africa to South America in the late 1800s. Once it established colonies in the northeastern region of South America, it then spread rapidly to other parts of South and North America. The contour lines and dates show the edges of the cattle egret\u2019s range at different times. (B) The number of active cattle egret nests observed annually within wetlands of the San Francisco Bay area. (A after R. L. Smith. 1974. Ecology and Field Biology, 2nd ed.", "Harper & Row: New York; S. Osborn. 2007. In The Birds of North America Online, A. Poole [Ed.]. Cornell Lab of Ornithology: Ithaca, NY; B. after J. P. Kelly et al. 2007. Waterbirds 30: 455\u2013478.) In logistic growth, the population approaches an equilibrium Some populations appear to reach a relatively stable population size, or equilibrium, that changes little over time. When this occurs, the number of individuals first increases in size, then fluctuates by a relatively small amount around what appears to be the maximum sustainable population size. Such populations exhibit the second pattern of population growth, logistic growth. Logistic growth is a pattern in which numbers of individuals increase rapidly at first and then stabilize as the population reaches carrying capacity, or the maximum population size that can be supported indefinitely by the environment. Classic logistic growth shows an S-shaped curve (see Figure 11.13). With few exceptions, population growth does not match the predictions of logistic growth precisely. For example, the graph of sheep abundance in Tasmania over time (FIGURE 10.5) is only roughly similar to the characteristic S shape of a logistic curve. FIGURE 10.5 Population Growth Can Roughly Resemble a Logistic Curve Population growth in a few species matches a logistic curve closely (see Figure 11.13). More often, a species shows a pattern of growth (a rise in abundance, followed by a roughly stable population size) in which the match to a logistic curve is very rough, as seen here for sheep introduced to the island of Tasmania. (After J. Davidson. 1938. Trans R Soc S Aust 62: 342\u2013346. CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.) All populations fluctuate in size Another characteristic of the sheep population in Tasmania is seen in all populations: their size rises and falls over time, illustrating the third and most common pattern of population growth, population fluctuations. In some populations, fluctuations occur as erratic increases or decreases in abundance from an overall mean (FIGURE 10.6). In other populations, fluctuations occur as deviations from a population growth pattern, such as exponential or logistic growth. If, for example, the growth of a population exactly matched a logistic curve, the population would not be said to fluctuate. But if population abundances rose above and fell below those expected in exponential growth (as in the cattle egret) and logistic growth (as in the Tasmanian sheep), the population would be said to fluctuate. FIGURE 10.6 Population Fluctuations Variation in phytoplankton abundance in water samples taken from Lake Erie during 1962, showing fluctuations above and below the overall mean abundance of 2,250 cells per cubic centimeter. The inset shows an October 2011 phytoplankton \u201cbloom\u201d (a rapid increase in phytoplankton numbers) in the lake. (After C. C. Davis. 1964. Limnol Oceanogr 9: 275\u2013283.) In some cases, population fluctuations are relatively small (as seen in Figure 10.5). In other cases, the number of individuals in a population can explode at certain times, causing a population outbreak (FIGURE 10.7). As we saw in Figure 10.2A, the biomass of the comb jelly Mnemiopsis increased 1,000fold during a 2-year outbreak in the Black Sea. Rapid variations in population sizes over time have also been observed in many terrestrial systems, especially in insects. Census data for the bordered white moth (Bupalus piniarius) collected from 1882 to 1940 in a German pine forest showed that the densities reached during outbreaks were up to 30,000 times as great as the lowest density observed. Such outbreaks can have wide-ranging ecological effects. For example, since 2000, an ongoing outbreak of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) has killed hundreds of millions of trees across 18.1 million hectares (45 million acres) in British Columbia, Canada (FIGURE 10.8). The death of these trees has altered the species composition of affected forests. Furthermore, as the dead trees decay, an estimated 17.6 megatons of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere each year (Kurz et al. 2008)\u2014an amount roughly equivalent to the yearly carbon emissions of all passenger cars in Great Britain. FIGURE 10.7 Populations Can Explode in Numbers When conditions are favorable, a population outbreak can occur in which the numbers of individuals increase very rapidly. The cockroaches covering the kitchen in this exhibit from the National Museum of Natural History represent the number that could have been produced by a single pregnant female in a few generations. FIGURE 10.8 Consequences of an Insect Outbreak This aerial view shows the red foliage of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees killed by an outbreak of mountain pine beetles in British Columbia, Canada.", "Many different factors can cause the size of a population to fluctuate. The increase in zooplankton populations in the Black Sea in the early 1980s probably occurred because their prey (phytoplankton) had increased in abundance (see Figure 10.2). Then, in 1991, zooplankton numbers plummeted, probably because of the spectacular increase in the abundance of their predator (Mnemiopsis) during the previous 2 years. The rapid changes in phytoplankton abundance in Lake Erie shown in Figure 10.6 could reflect changes in a wide range of environmental factors, including nutrient supplies, temperature, and predator abundance. Analyzing the factors important to population fluctuations can also help identify the factors important to disease outbreaks. In 1993, dozens of people in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States became sick with flu-like symptoms and shortness of breath, and 60% of them died within a few days of becoming ill. No one had seen this combination of symptoms before. An outbreak of a lethal, previously unknown disease appeared to be in progress, and there was no cure or successful treatment. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) quickly identified the disease agent as a new strain of hantavirus carried by the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Seeking more information about the new disease, now known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, or HPS, the CDC contacted ecologists who had been studying mouse populations in the Southwest. Examination of deer mouse specimens collected between 1979 and 1992 revealed that the virus had been present in the area for more than 10 years prior to the outbreak. Why, then, did the outbreak of HPS occur in 1993 and not before? To address this question, ecologists used data on the abundances of Peromyscus species collected since 1989 at the nearby Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. These data showed that the densities of several Peromyscus species had increased 3- to 20-fold between 1992 and 1993. Next, a series of satellite images was used to develop an index of how much plant matter was available as food for Peromyscus at different times. When that index was compared with precipitation data, the results suggested that unusually high rainfall from September 1991 through May 1992 had led to enhanced plant growth in spring 1992 (FIGURE 10.9). In turn, the enhanced plant growth produced abundant food for rodents (seeds, berries, green plant matter, arthropods), which allowed mouse populations to increase in size by 1993\u2014the year of the HPS outbreak. FIGURE 10.9 From Rain to Plants to Mice The outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the southwestern United States in 1993 may have been caused by a series of interconnected events. (After T. L. Yates et al. 2002. BioScience 52: 989\u2013998.) Rodents shed hantavirus in their urine, feces, and saliva; hence, high mouse numbers, which led to increased mouse\u2013human contact, were thought to be the cause of the 1993 outbreak. The actual risk to people varies greatly with location and depends on such factors as habitat type (which can influence mouse movements), microclimate (e.g., in arid regions, nearby areas often experience very different amounts of rainfall), and local food abundance. Overall, we now know enough about HPS to predict periods of heightened risk to human populations, but more remains to be learned about whether these factors create predictable population cycles in mice and the hantavirus disease. Let\u2019s now turn to what ecologists know about the factors important in producing population cycles. Some species exhibit population cycles The fourth pattern of population growth is population cycles, in which alternating periods of high and low abundance occur after constant (or nearly constant) intervals of time. Such regular cycles have been observed in populations of small rodents such as lemmings and voles, whose abundances typically reach a peak every 3 to 5 years (FIGURE 10.10). FIGURE 10.10 A Population Cycle In northern Greenland, collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus, left) abundance tends to rise and fall every 4 years. In this location, the population cycle appears to be driven by predators, the most important of which is the stoat (Mustela erminea, right). In other regions, lemming population cycles may be driven by food supply. (After O. Gilg et al. 2003. Science 302: 5646.) Based on data from 1988 through 2000, how many lemmings per hectare would you have expected there to be in 2002? Explain your reasoning. Population cycles are among the most intriguing patterns observed in nature. After all, what factors can cause numbers to fluctuate greatly over time, yet maintain a high degree of regularity?", "Possible answers to this question include both internal factors, such as hormonal or behavioral changes in response to crowding, and external factors, such as weather, food supplies, or predators. Gilg et al. (2003) used a combination of field observations and mathematical models to argue that the 4-year cycle of collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) abundance in Greenland is driven by predators, one of which, the stoat, specializes on eating lemmings (see Figure 10.10). Other investigators have suggested that cycles of the Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus) are caused by interactions between lemmings and their food plants. Similarly, a number of studies (e.g., Korpim\u00e4ki and Norrdahl 1998) have implicated predators as the driving force behind cycles of field voles in Scandinavia, but Graham and Lambin (2002), in a large-scale field experiment, showed that predator removal had no effect on field vole cycles in England. As these predator\u2013prey results and others (see Figure 12.2 for lynx and hares) suggest, a universal cause of population cycles in small rodents has not emerged. Instead, ecological mechanisms that drive population cycles may differ from place to place and from one species to another\u2014as is also true for factors that influence amphibian declines (see Interactive Figure 1.13). CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION COLLAPSING POPULATION CYCLES AND CLIMATE CHANGE Recent evidence suggests that population cycles may stop entirely if key environmental conditions change. For example, population cycles of lemmings (including the cycle shown in Figure 10.10), voles, and several insect herbivores have decreased in amplitude or ceased entirely in some high-latitude and high-elevation locations (Gilg et al. 2009; Johnson et al. 2010; Cornulier et al. 2013). What factors can cause the collapse of a population cycle? Some evidence points to climate change as a possible cause. Lemmings, for example, thrive when warmth from the ground melts a thin layer of the snow cover, leaving a small gap between the ground and the snow. In some regions, warmer winter temperatures have caused the snow to melt and refreeze, preventing the formation of these gaps. As discussed in Gilg et al. (2009), a shortage of gaps has made it more difficult for lemmings to feed and has made lemmings easier for their predators to catch. By holding lemming abundance in check (due to increased predation), these changes may have prevented lemming populations from increasing greatly in abundance every 3 to 4 years, thus halting the population cycles previously observed for this species (see Figure 10.10). Climate warming also may have contributed to the collapse of vole population cycles throughout Europe and across different species (Cornulier et al. 2013). This hypothesis is reasonable since temperatures have increased and climate warming could affect populations of different species across Europe. However, vole cycles in some areas of Finland have continued despite regional warming, indicating that the effect of climate change may depend on the species or on the particular mechanisms that drive the cycles (Brommer et al. 2010). Moreover, the collapse of a population cycle can be caused by factors other than climate change. For example, Allstadt et al. (2013) concluded that the recent collapse of cycles in Canadian populations of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) resulted from attack by a specialist pathogen rather than climate change. (See ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 10.1 for further discussion of climate change and population cycles.) Self-Assessment 10.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 10.2 Delayed density dependence can cause populations to cycle. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 10.2.1 Explain why there is often a time lag between changes in population density and future population sizes and how it produces population cycling. 10.2.2 Give an example of how delayed density dependence causes population cycling. Delayed Density Dependence Although relatively few populations exhibit regular population cycles, all populations fluctuate in size to some degree. As we\u2019ve seen, such fluctuations can result from a variety of factors, including changes in food supply, temperature, or predator abundance. Population fluctuations can also be caused by delayed density dependence, the effects of which we examine here. The effect of population density is often delayed in time Delays, or time lags, are an important feature of interactions in nature. For example, when a predator or parasite feeds, it does not produce offspring immediately; thus, there is a built-in delay in the effect of food supply on birth rates.", "As a result, it is common for the number of individuals born in a given time period to be influenced by the population densities or other conditions that were present several time periods ago, causing what is known as delayed density dependence (delays in the effect that density has on population size). How does delayed density dependence contribute to population fluctuations? Consider a population of predators that reproduce more slowly than their prey. If there are few predators initially, the prey population may increase rapidly in size. As a result, the predator population may also increase, reaching a point at which there are many adult predators that survive well and produce a large number of offspring. However, if the resulting large population of predators eats so many prey that the prey population decreases sharply in size, there may be few prey available for the next generation of predators. In such a case, a mismatch in predator and prey numbers (high predator numbers, low prey numbers) occurs because there is a time lag in the response of predator numbers to prey numbers. When such a mismatch takes place, the predators may survive or reproduce poorly and their numbers may drop. If prey numbers then increase (because there are now fewer predators), predator numbers may first rebound, then fall again because of the built-in time lag. Thus, in principle at least, it seems reasonable that a delay in the response of predators to prey density could cause predator numbers to fluctuate over time (see WEB EXTENSION 10.1 for a model of delayed density dependence). Delayed density dependence produces cycles in blowfly populations In the 1950s, A. J. Nicholson performed a series of pioneering laboratory experiments on density dependence in blowflies. These insects are both decomposers and parasites in that they feed on dead animals but also attack living hosts, including mammals and birds. Nicholson studied Lucilia cuprina\u2014the sheep blowfly\u2014so named because it is an important agricultural pest of sheep. Before they can lay eggs, the females of this species need a protein meal (which they usually get from animal dung or carcasses). Once they have fed, the females attack living sheep by laying their eggs near the tail or near open wounds or sores. Small white maggots hatch from those eggs and feed on dung attached to the skin or on exposed flesh. As they feed, the maggots grow larger and more voracious. At a certain point, the maggots burrow inside the sheep, where they feed on its internal tissues, causing severe lesions and sometimes death. Death can be caused directly by the maggots (as a result of their feeding activities) or by infections that spread through the lesions. The sheep blowfly\u2019s full life cycle (from egg to egg) can be completed in as little as 7 days. In several of his laboratory experiments, Nicholson examined the effect of delayed density dependence on blowfly population dynamics. In the first of the two experiments that we will consider here, Nicholson provided adult blowflies with unlimited food (ground liver) but restricted maggots to 50 g of food per day. Because adults had abundant food, each female was able to lay many eggs. Thus, when there were many adults, enormous numbers of eggs were produced. When those eggs hatched, however, lack of food caused most or all of the maggots to die before they reached adulthood (FIGURE 10.11A). As a result, few adults were produced, and the adult population invariably declined after reaching a peak. Eventually, the number of adults in the population reached such low levels that the few eggs they produced were able to give rise to a new generation of adults. Once this happened, the number of adults would begin to rise again, then crash, repeating the cycle just described. FIGURE 10.11 Nicholson\u2019s Blowfly Experiments (A) Adult blowflies were supplied with unlimited food, maggots with limited food. As a result, few or no adults were produced from the many eggs laid during periods of maximum adult abundance, because the many maggots that hatched from those eggs had insufficient food to eat. (B) Experimental conditions were the same as in part (A) until roughly halfway through the experiment (indicated by the dotted vertical line), when the food supply for adults was also limited. (After A. J. Nicholson. 1957. Cold Spring Harbor Symp Quant Biol 22: 153\u2013173.) Which of the four population growth patterns discussed under Concept 10.1 best characterizes the results shown in (A)? In (B)? Explain.", "Nicholson argued that delayed density dependence caused the number of adult blowflies to rise and fall repeatedly in this experiment. His reasoning was that because adults had unlimited food, the negative effects of high adult densities were not felt until a later time\u2014that is, when the maggots hatched and began to feed. To test this idea, Nicholson performed a second experiment in which he removed some of the effects of delayed density dependence by providing both adults and maggots with a limited amount of food. When he did this, the adult population size no longer repeatedly rose and crashed. Instead, the number of adults increased and then fluctuated around an average of about 4,000 flies (FIGURE 10.11B). Taken together, the results shown in Figure 10.11 suggest that delayed density dependence can play a role in causing the pronounced fluctuations seen in some populations. Delayed density dependence and other factors can cause a population to fluctuate in size because they can cause the growth, survival, or reproduction of individuals to vary over time, and that, in turn, can cause the population growth rate to vary significantly from one time period to the next. Next, we\u2019ll explore how such fluctuations affect the risk that a population will become extinct. Self-Assessment 10.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 10.3 The risk of extinction increases in populations that fluctuate in size and/or are small. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 10.3.1 Justify why fluctuations in population growth rate can increase a population\u2019s risk of extinction. 10.3.2 List and describe the ways that chance events can drive small populations to extinction. Population Extinction Populations can be driven to extinction by many different factors, including changes in the environment, biological interactions, and human-caused events. Consider a fish population that colonizes a temporary pond (one that forms during the rainy season but then dries out completely at other times of the year). The fish may thrive for a while, but as the water level drops, they are doomed. In this section, we\u2019ll look at how the risk of extinction is affected by the fluctuations and size of populations. Fluctuations in population size can increase the risk of extinction Imagine a population that is increasing over time. If the population size fluctuates very little over time, then in most years the population will continue to increase in size. Under these circumstances, the population will face little or no risk of extinction. However, random variation in environmental conditions could cause the population size to change considerably from year to year. What are the implications of such fluctuations? To show what happens when population size fluctuates, computer simulations were performed for three populations that were allowed to fluctuate at random. Examining the results in FIGURE 10.12, we see that two of the populations recovered from low numbers, but one went extinct. These results support what common sense tells us: fluctuations increase the risk of extinction. In part, this occurs because, for a given average population size, a population that fluctuates in size shows a slower growth rate than one that does not vary. ANALYZING DATA 10.1 mathematically examines how adding variation to the growth rate of a population results in a smaller population size than a population without that variability. Such a slowdown in population growth increases a population\u2019s risk of extinction, as is shown in Figure 10.12. FIGURE 10.12 Fluctuations Can Drive Small Populations Extinct Simulated growth of three populations in which the population growth rate varied at random from year to year. This variation over time was intended to simulate random variation in environmental conditions. Each simulated population began with 10 individuals but ended with variable population sizes, including one population that went extinct. A second (and related) factor is the extent to which the population growth rate fluctuates over time. If the variation in the population growth rate is high, the chances of population extinction will rise. The take-home message is that when variable environmental conditions increase the extent to which a population\u2019s growth rate fluctuates over time, the risk of extinction also increases. This effect, however, is dependent on the size of the population: small populations are at particular risk. ANALYZING DATA 10.1 In natural populations, year-to-year estimates of the population growth rate are never constant\u2014they vary at least slightly from one year to the next. How does variation in population growth rate affect subsequent population sizes?", "To find out, let\u2019s compare a population in which the growth rate has a constant value with a population in which the growth rate varies over time yet has the same (average) value. The table below provides the population sizes at different points in time for a population in which the growth rate varies from one year to the next and has an (average) value of 1.02. 1. As a first step, fill in the five missing values of the population growth rate, \u03bb, in the table, using the equation where N is the population size at time t (see Concept 11.1). For example, in year 0, the population size (N ) equals t0 1,000; one year later, N = 820. Thus, the first estimate of \u03bb (indicating the change in population size from time 0 to 1 time 1) equals N /N = 820/1,000 = 0.82. Compute the missing values of \u03bb, rounding each estimate to two decimal 10 places. Check that the average (the arithmetic mean, defined below) of the seven values of \u03bb equals 1.02. If it does not, redo your calculations. Year (t) Population size (N ) Yearly growth rate (\u03bb) t 0 1,000 0.82 1 820 0.91 2 746 ? 3 910 ? 4 792 ? 5 927 ? 6 946 ? 7 1,069 N/A 2. Use Equation 11.2 to calculate how large a population with a fixed growth rate of \u03bb = 1.02 and an initial size of 1,000 (N = 1,000) will be after t = 7 years. Compare your answer with the value shown in the table for year 7. How has 0 year-to-year variation in \u03bb affected the subsequent population size? 3. For multiplicative processes such as population growth, an alternative is to use the geometric mean (defined below and described more fully in WEB EXTENSION 10.2) instead of the arithmetic mean. Calculate the geometric mean of the seven year-to-year values of \u03bb in the table. 4. Use the geometric mean that you determined in Question 2 to calculate how large a population with an initial size of 1,000 will be after 7 years. Compare your answer with the data in the table and with your result in Question 1 (which was based on the arithmetic mean). 5. Explain why you agree or disagree with this statement: \u201cIt is wrong to use the arithmetic mean of year-to-year values of \u03bb to describe the growth of a population in a variable environment; instead, use the geometric mean.\u201d Arithmetic mean: For n data points x , x , x , \u2026 ,x , the arithmetic mean equals 123 n Geometric mean: For n data points x , x , x , \u2026 ,x , the geometric mean equals the nth root of the multiplicative product 123 n of these data points, or See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. Small populations are at much greater risk of extinction than large populations The size of a population has a strong effect on its risk of extinction. For example, Jones and Diamond (1976) studied extinction in bird populations on the Channel Islands, located off the coast of California. By combining data from published articles (from 1868 on), museum records, unpublished field observations, and their own fieldwork, they showed that population size had a strong effect on the chance of extinction (FIGURE 10.13). They found that 39% of populations with fewer than 10 breeding pairs went extinct, whereas they observed no extinctions in populations with over 1,000 breeding pairs. Similar work by Pimm et al. (1988) showed that small populations can go extinct very rapidly: on islands off the coast of Britain, bird populations with 2 or fewer nesting pairs had a mean time to extinction of 1.6 years, while populations with 5 to 12 nesting pairs had a mean time to extinction of 7.5 years. FIGURE 10.13 Extinction in Small Populations Among bird populations on the Channel Islands, the percentage of populations that went extinct declined rapidly as the number of breeding pairs in the population increased. (After H. L. Jones and J. M. Diamond. 1976. Condor 78: 526\u2013549.) Assume that a population is at high risk (>30%) of extinction. Use the graph to estimate the total number of breeding pairs the population should have to reduce its risk of extinction to 5%. These findings for birds have been confirmed in other groups of organisms, including mammals, lizards, and insects.", "Overall, field data indicate that the risk of extinction increases greatly when population size is small. But what are the factors that place small populations at risk? When populations are small, they reduce what is called effective population size, or the number of individuals that can contribute offspring to the next generation. A reduction in the effective population size can result in an extinction vortex in which smaller population sizes lead to further declines in population size, eventually resulting in extinction (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 10.14). How does the effective population size decline over time? There are three main categories of factors that place small populations at risk of extinction: genetic factors, demographic factors, and environmental factors. Let\u2019s consider each of them separately. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 10.14 Extinction Vortex Human-caused and natural events can reduce the effective population size of species, resulting in the loss of genetic diversity, and eventually leading to population-and species-level extinctions. RISK FROM GENETIC FACTORS Small populations can encounter problems associated with genetic drift and inbreeding depression, processes that reduce genetic diversity and the fitness of individuals and the adaptability of populations (see Interactive Figure 10.14). Recall from Concept 6.2 that genetic drift is the process by which chance events influence which alleles are passed on to the next generation. Genetic drift can occur in many ways, including chance events that determine whether individuals reproduce or die. Imagine, for example, that an elephant walks through a population of ten small plants, 50% of which have white flowers (genotype aa) and 50% of which have red flowers (AA). If the elephant happens to crush more red-flowered than white-flowered plants, then by chance alone, there will be more copies of the a allele than of the A allele in the next generation. This scenario is just one of many possible examples of how genetic drift can cause allele frequencies to change at random from one generation to the next. Genetic drift has little effect on large populations, but in small populations it can cause losses of genetic variation over time. For example, if genetic drift causes the frequency of two alleles (e.g., A and a) to change at random in each generation, one allele may eventually increase to a frequency of 100% (reach fixation), while the other is lost (see Figure 6.7). Drift can reduce the genetic variation of small populations rapidly: for example, after ten generations, roughly 40% of the original genetic variation is lost in a population of 10 individuals, while 95% is lost in a population of two individuals. In addition, small populations can show a high frequency of inbreeding (mating between related individuals). Inbreeding is common in small populations because after several generations at a small population size, most of the individuals in the population will be closely related to one another (to see why, answer Review Question 3). Inbreeding tends to increase the frequency of homozygotes, including those that have two copies of a harmful allele. Thus, like genetic drift, inbreeding depression can lead to the loss of genetic diversity, reducing individual fitness and hence population growth rates. The combined negative effects of genetic drift and inbreeding depression appear to have reduced the fertility of male lions that live on the floor of the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania (FIGURE 10.15). From 1957 to 1961, there were 60 to 75 lions living in the crater, but in 1962 an extraordinary outbreak of biting flies caused all but 9 females and 1 male to die. Seven males immigrated into the crater in 1964\u20131965, but no further immigration has occurred since that time. The population has increased in size since the 1962 crash. From 1975 to 1990, for example, the population fluctuated between 75 and 125 individuals. However, genetic analyses indicated that all these individuals were descendants of just 15 lions (Packer et al. 1991). In a population of 15 individuals, genetic drift and inbreeding depression have powerful effects. Those effects appear to be the reason why the crater population has less genetic variation and more frequent sperm abnormalities than the large population of lions found nearby on the Serengeti Plain. In such a situation, all is not necessarily lost: in some cases, populations in decline because of drift and inbreeding have been \u201crescued\u201d by introducing a small number of individuals from other, more genetically diverse populations (see Figures 6.8 and 23.16). FIGURE 10.15", "A Plague of Flies In 1962, the population of lions in the 260-km2 (100-square-mile) Ngorongoro Crater of Tanzania was nearly driven to extinction by a catastrophic outbreak of biting flies similar to those on the face of this male. Lions became covered with infected sores and eventually could not hunt, resulting in many deaths. In the population that descended from the few survivors, genetic drift and inbreeding depression have led to frequent sperm abnormalities, such as this \u201ctwo-headed\u201d sperm. RISK FROM DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS A second factor important to the loss of genetic diversity, and ultimately extinction, in small populations is that of demographic stochasticity, or the fluctuations in population size as the result of chance differences among individuals in reproduction and survival (see Interactive Figure 10.14). For example, for an individual, survival and reproduction are all-or-nothing events: an individual either survives or it does not, and it either reproduces or it does not. At the population level, we can transform such all-or-nothing events into a probability that survival or reproduction will occur. For example, if 70 out of 100 individuals in a population survive from one year to the next, then (on average) each individual in the population has a 70% chance of survival. In a small population, however, demographic stochasticity can result in outcomes that differ from what such averages would lead us to expect. Consider a population of ten individuals for which previous data indicate that, on average, each individual has a 70% probability of surviving from one year to the next. However, many chance events\u2014such as whether an individual is struck by a falling tree\u2014can cause the percentage of individuals that actually do survive to be higher or lower than 70%. For example, if six of the ten individuals experienced (the ultimate) \u201cbad luck\u201d and died in chance mishaps, the observed survival rate (40%) would be much lower than the expected 70%. By affecting the survival and reproduction of individuals in this way, demographic stochasticity can cause the size of a small population to fluctuate over time. In one year the population may grow, while the next it may decrease in size, perhaps so drastically that extinction results. In contrast, when the population size is large, there is little risk of extinction from demographic stochasticity. The fundamental reason for this has to do with laws of probability. You are, for example, much more likely to receive zero heads if you toss a fair coin 3 times than if you toss the same coin 300 times. Similarly, when we consider the demographic fates of individuals, we can see that chance events are much more likely to cause reproductive failure or poor survival in small populations than in large populations. If each individual in a population has a 33% chance of producing zero offspring, then if there are two individuals in the population, there is an 11% chance (0.33 \u00d7 0.33 = 0.332 = 0.11) that no offspring will be produced\u2014driving the population to extinction in one generation. Although demographic stochasticity could cause a population of 30 individuals to fluctuate in size (perhaps leading to eventual extinction), there is essentially no chance (0.3330) that it could cause the population to go extinct in a single generation. Demographic stochasticity is also one of several factors that can cause small populations to experience Allee effects. Allee effects occur when the population growth rate decreases as the population density decreases, perhaps because individuals have difficulty finding mates at low population densities (FIGURE 10.16). This phenomenon reverses the usual assumption that population growth rates tend to increase as population density decreases (see Figure 11.12). Allee effects can be disastrous for small populations. If demographic stochasticity or any other factor decreases the population size, Allee effects can cause the population growth rate to drop, which causes the population size to decrease even further in a downward spiral toward extinction. FIGURE 10.16 Allee Effects Can Threaten Small Populations Allee effects occur when the growth rate of a population decreases as population density decreases. (A) In laboratory experiments with the flour beetle Tribolium, population growth rates reached their lowest point at the lowest initial density. Allee effects can be important in animals such as (B) bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), which form schools or herds whose protective or early warning systems function poorly at small population sizes.", "Allee effects are also important in species in which individuals have difficulty finding mates at low population densities; there are many such species, including (C) kakapos (Strigops habroptilus) and (D) monkshood (Aconitum napellus). (A after F. Courchamp et al. 1999. Trends Ecol Evol 14: 405\u2013410.) RISK FROM ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION Finally, environmental stochasticity can cause declines in genetic diversity and ultimately extinction of small populations (see Interactive Figure 10.14). Environmental stochasticity refers to erratic or unpredictable changes in the environment. In the simulations described above (see Figure 10.12), we\u2019ve already seen that (1) variation in environmental conditions that causes fluctuations in population growth rates can lead to population size fluctuations and thus an increased risk of extinction, and (2) such environmental variation is more likely to cause extinction when the population size is small. Many species face such risks from environmental stochasticity. For example, census data on female grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) in Yellowstone National Park showed that the average population growth rate varied from year to year. Despite the fact that the population tends to grow in size, researchers using a mathematical model found that random variation in environmental conditions could place the Yellowstone grizzly population at high risk of extinction, especially if the population size were to drop to 40 females or less from its 1997 level of 99 females (FIGURE 10.17). FIGURE 10.17 Environmental Stochasticity and Population Size This graph plots the risk that the Yellowstone grizzly bear population will be close to extinction in 50 years against the population size (number of females). By studying 39 consecutive years of census data, researchers found that the average population growth rate of Yellowstone grizzlies could lead to explosive growth if it remained constant from year to year. The risk of extinction increased dramatically when random variation in environmental conditions dropped the population size to 40 females or less. (After W. F. Morris and D. F. Doak. 2002. Quantitative Conservation Biology: Theory and Practice of Population Viability. Oxford University Press/Sinauer: Sunderland, MA.) Environmental stochasticity differs from demographic stochasticity in a fundamental way. Environmental stochasticity refers to changes in the average birth or death rate of a population that occur from one year to the next. These year-to-year changes reflect the fact that environmental conditions vary over time, affecting all the individuals in a population: sometimes there are good years and sometimes there are bad years. In demographic stochasticity, the average (population-level) birth and death rates may be constant across years, but the actual fates of individuals differ because of the random nature of whether each individual reproduces or not, and survives or not. Populations also face risks from extreme environmental events such as floods, fires, severe windstorms, or outbreaks of disease or natural enemies. Even though they occur rarely, such natural catastrophes can eliminate or drastically reduce the size of populations that otherwise would seem large enough to be at little risk of extinction. For example, disease outbreaks have resulted in mass mortality in populations of sea urchins (up to 98% of the individuals in some populations) and Baikal seals (killing about 2,500 of a population of 3,000 seals). Environmental stochasticity also played a key role in the extinction of the heath hen (Tympanuchus cupido cupido). This bird was once abundant from Virginia to New England. By 1908, hunting and habitat destruction had reduced its population to 50 birds, all on the island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where a 1,600-acre reserve was established for its protection. Initially, the population thrived, increasing in size to 2,000 birds by 1915. A population of 2,000 may seem large enough to be nearly \u201cbulletproof\u201d against the problems that threaten small populations, including genetic drift and inbreeding, demographic stochasticity, and environmental stochasticity. However, a series of disasters struck between 1916 and 1920, including a fire that destroyed many nests, unusually cold weather, a disease outbreak, and a boom in the number of goshawks (a predator of heath hens). Because of the combined effects of these events, the heath hen population dropped to 50 birds by 1920 and never recovered. The last heath hen died in 1932. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that heath hens were vulnerable in 1915 because they all lived in a single population. More typically, members of a species are found in metapopulations, which are often isolated from one another by regions of unsuitable habitat. You can read more about metapopulation dynamics in Concept 9.4. Self-Assessment 10.3", "[Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED A Sea in Trouble In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Black Sea ecosystem was under severe duress from the combined effects of eutrophication and invasion by the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi, as described in the Case Study. Although Mnemiopsis numbers declined sharply in 1991, they rose steadily again from 1992 to 1995, and then remained high for several years\u2014at about 250 g per square meter, which translates to over 115 million tons of Mnemiopsis throughout the Black Sea. The situation did not look promising. But by 1999, matters were different: the Black Sea was showing signs of recovery. The events that set the stage for the recovery of the Black Sea actually began prior to the first onslaught of Mnemiopsis. In the mid- to late 1980s, the amounts of nutrients added to the Black Sea began to level off. From 1991 to 1997, nutrient inputs declined, probably because of hard economic times in former Soviet Union countries coupled with national and international efforts to reduce nutrient inputs. The reduction had rapid effects: after 1992, phosphate concentrations in the Black Sea declined, phytoplankton biomass began to fall, water clarity increased, and zooplankton abundance increased. Mnemiopsis still posed a threat, however, as evidenced by its high biomass and by falling anchovy catches from 1995 to 1998 (see Figure 10.2). Scientists and government officials were gearing up to combat the threat from Mnemiopsis when the problem was inadvertently solved by the arrival of another comb jelly, the predator Beroe (FIGURE 10.18). FIGURE 10.18 Invader versus Invader Another invasive comb jelly species, the predator Beroe, brought Mnemiopsis under control, thus contributing to the recovery of the Black Sea ecosystem. Beroe arrived in 1997. Like Mnemiopsis, Beroe probably reached the Black Sea in the ballast water of ships from the Atlantic. Beroe feeds almost exclusively on Mnemiopsis. It is such an effective predator that within 2 years of its arrival, Mnemiopsis numbers plummeted (see Figure 10.2A). Following the sharp decline in Mnemiopsis, the Black Sea population of Beroe also crashed, presumably because it depended on Mnemiopsis for food. The fall of Mnemiopsis led to a rebound in zooplankton abundance (which had dropped again from 1994 to 1996) and to increases in the population sizes of several native jellyfish species. In addition, after the Mnemiopsis population crashed, there was an increase in the anchovy catch and in field counts of anchovy egg densities. Overall, the decline of Mnemiopsis helped to improve the condition of the Black Sea ecosystem, including the fisheries on which people depend for food and income. CONNECTIONS in NATURE FROM BOTTOM TO TOP, AND BACK AGAIN The decrease in nutrient inputs by human activities and the control of Mnemiopsis by Beroe had rapid beneficial effects on the entire Black Sea ecosystem. The speed and magnitude of the ecosystem\u2019s recovery provide a source of hope, suggesting that it may be possible to solve large problems in other aquatic communities. Note, however, that ecologists rarely attempt to solve such problems by deliberately introducing new predators, such as Beroe, because such introductions can also have unanticipated negative effects. The details of the fall and rise of the Black Sea ecosystem also illustrate two important types of causation in ecological communities: bottom-up and top-down controls. The fall of the Black Sea ecosystem began when increased nutrient inputs led to problems associated with eutrophication: increased phytoplankton abundance, increased bacterial abundance, decreased oxygen concentrations, and fish die-offs. The effect of adding nutrients to the Black Sea illustrates bottom-up control, which occurs when the abundance of a population is limited by nutrient supply or food availability. In this case, prior to nutrient enrichment, phytoplankton abundance\u2014and thus the abundance of food for other organisms\u2014was limited by the supply of nutrients. Ecosystems are also affected by top-down control, which occurs when the abundance of a population is limited by predators. Recent evidence indicates that early steps in the decline of the Black Sea ecosystem were driven not only from the bottom up (by eutrophication), but also from the top down, by overfishing (Daskalov et al. 2007). Starting in the late 1950s, overfishing caused sharp drops in the abundances of predatory fishes. As predatory fish populations declined, their prey, planktivorous (plankton-eating) fishes, increased in number (FIGURE 10.19A).", "In turn, the increase in planktivorous fishes was associated with declining numbers of zooplankton and increasing numbers of phytoplankton (FIGURE 10.19B,C), suggesting possible top-down control. Later, the arrival of the voracious predator Mnemiopsis also had a top-down effect, altering many key features of the ecosystem (e.g., zooplankton abundance, phytoplankton abundance, fish abundance). Top-down control also seems to have influenced ecosystem recovery: it took another predator, Beroe, to rein in Mnemiopsis. In reality, as in the Black Sea, bottom-up and top-down controls interact to shape how ecosystems work. We\u2019ll return to bottom-up and top-down controls in Units 5 and 6, where we consider these important topics in more detail. FIGURE 10.19 Ecosystem Changes in the Black Sea Abundance indices of (A) planktivorous and predatory fishes, (B) zooplankton and planktivorous fishes, and (C) phytoplankton and zooplankton. In each graph, the organisms whose abundance is plotted on the y axis are eaten by the organisms whose abundance is plotted on the x axis. (Planktivorous fishes eat both zooplankton and phytoplankton, but they have a greater effect on zooplankton abundance than on phytoplankton abundance.) Numbers on the plots indicate years, beginning in 1952. In the abundance indices, data are standardized to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 (see WEB STATS REVIEW 1.2 to learn how and why this is done). (After G. M. Daskalov et al. 2007. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104: 10518\u201310523. \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.) Referring to (A), describe predatory and planktivorous fish abundance from 1952 to 1957. Next, summarize how abundances of phytoplankton, zooplankton, planktivorous fishes, and predatory fishes changed in the 1970s. Finally, convert your summary of abundance changes in the 1970s into a chain of feeding relationships, where arrow thickness indicates the strength of each relationship (see Figure 9.18, in which similar chains are shown for Alaska). Is the chain you drew more similar to that in Alaska pre-1990 or that in Alaska in the late 1990s? Explain. Population Growth and Regulation KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 11.1 Populations can grow exponentially when conditions are favorable, but exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. CONCEPT 11.2 Population size is determined by a combination of density-dependent and density-independent factors. CONCEPT 11.3 The logistic equation incorporates limits to growth and shows how a population may stabilize at a maximum size, the carrying capacity. CONCEPT 11.4 Life tables show how survival and reproduction vary with age or size structure, influencing population growth and size. Human Population Growth: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 Viewed from space, Earth appears as a beautiful ball of blue and white in a vast sea of black. If we use satellite images to explore the surface of this beautiful ball in more detail, we find clear signs of human impacts across the globe. These signs range from the clear-cutting of forests, to the quilt-like patterns of agricultural fields, to the eerie red glow of fires burning out of control across the Amazon and other regions of the world (FIGURE 11.1). FIGURE 11.1 Amazon on Fire This late-night NASA satellite image of South America shows the vast area over which large, intense, and persistent fires are burning in this region of the world (red areas). Fire activity in the Amazon varies considerably from year to year, driven by changes in human activity and climate. The timing and location of fires in 2019 (when this photo was taken) suggest that they were associated with extensive land clearing that year rather than regional drought conditions. People have a large effect on the global environment for two underlying reasons: our population has grown explosively, and so has our use of energy and resources. The human population crossed the 7.7 billion mark in 2019, more than double the 3 billion people alive in 1960 (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 11.2). Our use of energy and resources has grown even more rapidly. From 1860 to 1991, for example, the human population quadrupled in size, but our energy consumption increased 93-fold. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 11.2 Explosive Growth of the Human Population The size of the human population increased relatively slowly until 1825, when the effects of the Industrial Revolution took hold. Since that time our population has increased in size to 7.7 billion people in 2019. (Based on estimates by the History Database of the Global Environment [HYDE] and the United Nations. Visualization from OurWorldinData.org. CC BY-SA 4.0/Max Roser. Retrieved from https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth.)", "The addition of more than 4 billion people since 1960 is remarkable. For thousands of years, the size of our population increased relatively slowly, reaching 1 billion for the first time in 1825 (Cohen 1995). The time we took to reach the 1 billion mark puts the current growth of our population in perspective: it took roughly 200,000 years (from the origin of our species to 1825) for the human population to reach its first billion, but now we are adding 1 billion people every 13 years. When did we switch from relatively slow to explosive increases in the size of our population? No one knows for sure, given that it is difficult to estimate population sizes from long ago. According to the best information we have, by 1550 there were roughly 500 million people alive, and the population was doubling every 275 years. By the time we reached our first billion in 1825, the human population was growing at a very rapid rate: it doubled from 1 to 2 billion by 1930, in just 105 years. Forty-five years later, it had doubled again, reaching 4 billion in 1975, at which time it was growing at an annual rate of nearly 2%. To appreciate what that means, a population with a 2% annual growth rate doubles in size every 35 years. If that rate of growth could be sustained, our population would almost double from 7.7 billion in 2019 to 15.4 billion in 2054 and would reach 31 billion by 2090. What do you think the world would be like with 31 billion people? Already, with 7.7 billion people, we have transformed the planet. However, it is unlikely that there will be 31 billion people on Earth in 2090. Over the last 50 years, the rate of human population growth has slowed considerably, from a high of 2.2% per year in the early 1960s to the present rate of 1.1% annually. Even so, the current rate translates into a human population that is increasing by about 80 million people per year, more than 9,000 people each hour. Five countries\u2014India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, and the United States\u2014account for almost half of this annual increase. If the current annual growth rate of 1.1% were maintained, there would be more than 14 billion people on Earth in 2080. Can Earth support 14 billion people? Will there be that many people in 2080? Or will annual growth rates continue to fall? We\u2019ll return to these questions in the Case Study Revisited. View the script for the video Introduction Ecologists use population growth models to understand the ways in which populations change in abundance over time and what factors promote or limit population growth. What we learn from these models can surprise us. We may find, for example, that current methods used to protect an endangered species are inadequate. Such was the case for loggerhead sea turtles, a rare species whose young often die as they crawl to the sea after hatching from nests dug in the sand (FIGURE 11.3). Efforts to protect loggerhead turtles initially focused on protecting newborns. However, researchers found, using population growth models, that even if newborn survival could be increased to 100%, loggerhead turtle populations would still continue to decline. Fortunately, the researchers were able to use their population growth model to inform management techniques that resulted in more effective ways of protecting loggerhead turtles (see Ecological Toolkit 11.1). FIGURE 11.3 Dash to the Sea These loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings have emerged from nests in the sand and must reach the sea to survive. On land, eggs and hatchlings face threats from predators, beach development, and artificial lighting (which can disrupt the hatchlings\u2019 sense of direction, preventing them from reaching the sea). Loggerhead turtles also face threats in the marine environment from predators, commercial fisheries (turtles can be caught accidentally in nets and traps), collisions with boats, and pollution. As we have seen in Chapters 9 and 10, populations can change in size as a result of four processes: birth, death, immigration, and emigration. We can summarize the effects of these four processes on population size with the following equation: where N is the population size at time t, B is the number of births, D is the number of deaths, I is the number t of immigrants, and E is the number of emigrants between time t and time t + 1.", "As implied by this equation, populations are open and dynamic entities that can change from one time period to the next due to births and deaths. For simplification purposes, the population growth models we consider here do not include immigration or emigration. Let\u2019s use this basic information about population change over time to consider two common observed patterns of population growth that were described in Chapter 10: exponential population growth and logistic population growth. CONCEPT 11.1 Populations can grow exponentially when conditions are favorable, but exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 11.1.1 Define geometric population growth. 11.1.2 Define exponential population growth. 11.1.3 Describe the characteristics of geometric and exponential growth. Geometric and Exponential Growth In general, populations can grow rapidly whenever individuals leave an average of more than one offspring over substantial periods of time. In this section, we describe exponential growth and the special case known as geometric growth, two related patterns of population growth that can lead to rapid increases in population size. For exponential growth, the organisms are assumed to reproduce continuously over time compared to geometric growth, in which the organisms reproduce in synchrony at discrete periods of time. Let\u2019s consider geometric growth first. Populations grow geometrically when reproduction occurs at regular time intervals Some species, such as cicadas and annual plants, reproduce in synchrony at regular time intervals. These regular time intervals are called discrete time periods. Geometric growth occurs when a population with synchronous reproduction changes in size by a constant proportion from one discrete time period to the next. The fact that the population grows by a constant proportion means that the number of individuals added to the population becomes larger with each time period (births > deaths). As a result, the population grows larger by ever-increasing amounts. When plotted on a graph, this growth pattern forms a J-shaped set of points, with each point representing the resulting population size after each time period (FIGURE 11.4A). FIGURE 11.4 Geometric and Exponential Growth (A) The blue dots plot the size of a geometrically growing population that begins with 10 individuals and doubles in each discrete time period (i.e., N = 10 and \u03bb = 2). The red curve0 plots exponential growth in a comparable population that reproduces continuously, also beginning with 10 individuals and having a growth rate of r = ln(2) = 0.69. (B) When the population sizes represented by the blue circles and the red curve in (A) are plotted on a logarithmic scale, the result is a straight line. Mathematically, we can describe geometric growth as (11.1) where N is the population size after t generations or, equivalently, after t discrete time periods (e.g., t t years if there is one generation per year), and \u03bb is a constant whose value is determined by the per capita (or per individual) birth rate (b = B/N) minus the per capita death rate (d = D/N) over discrete time periods. In Equation 11.1, \u03bb serves as a multiplier that allows us to predict the size of the population in the next time period. We\u2019ll refer to \u03bb as the geometric population growth rate; \u03bb is also known as the (per capita) finite rate of increase. We use this terminology by convention, but it can be confusing: we can see from Equation 11.1 that when the population \u201cgrowth\u201d rate \u03bb is between 0 and 1, the population does not grow, but rather decreases in size over time. Geometric growth can also be represented by a second equation, (11.2) where N0 is the initial population size (i.e., the population size at time = 0). The two equations for geometric growth (Equations 11.1 and 11.2) are equivalent in that each can be derived from the other (see WEB EXTENSION 11.1). Which one we use depends on what we are interested in. If we want to predict the population size in the next time period and we know \u03bb and the current population size, either equation can be used. If we know the population size in both the current and previous time periods, we can rearrange Equation 11.1 by dividing Nt+1 by Nt to get an estimate of \u03bb. Finally, we can use Equation 11.2 to predict the size of the population after any number of discrete time periods.", "If \u03bb = 2, for example, then after 12 time periods, a population that begins with N = 10 individuals will have N = 212N 0 12 x individuals, which (as we can determine by using a calculator with a y function) equals 4,096 \u00d7 10, or 40,960. Populations grow exponentially when reproduction occurs continuously In contrast to the pattern described in the previous section, individuals in many species (including humans) do not reproduce in synchrony at discrete time periods; instead, they reproduce continuously over time. Exponential growth occurs when population size changes by a constant proportion at each instant in time (see the red curve in Figure 11.4A, representing continuous growth). Mathematically, exponential growth can be described by the following two equations: and (11.3) (11.4) where N is the population size at each instant in time, t. t In Equation 11.3, dN/dt represents the rate of change in population size at each instant in time; we see from the equation that dN/dt equals a constant rate (r; instantaneous birth rate (b) \u2013 instantaneous death rate (d)) multiplied by the current population size, N. Thus, the multiplier r provides a measure of how rapidly a population can grow; r is called the exponential growth rate or the (per capita) intrinsic rate of increase. As we did for Equation 11.2, we can use Equation 11.4 to predict the size of an exponentially growing population at any time t, provided we have an estimate for r and know N0, the initial population size. The \u201ce\u201d in Equation 11.4 is a constant, approximately equal to 2.718 [\u201ce\u201d is the base of the natural logarithm, ln(x)]. rt x We can calculate e using the function e , which can be found on many calculators. When plotted on a graph, the exponential growth pattern forms a curve that, like the geometric growth pattern, is J-shaped. Exponential growth and geometric growth are similar in that we can draw an exponential growth curve through the discrete points of a population that grows geometrically (see Figure 11.4A). Because exponential and geometric growth curves overlap, both types of growth are sometimes lumped together for simplicity and referred to as exponential growth. Geometric and exponential growth curves overlap because Equations 11.2 and 11.4 are similar in form, r except that \u03bb in Equation 11.2 is replaced by e in Equation 11.4. Thus, if we want to compare the results of discrete time and continuous time growth models, we can calculate \u03bb from r, or vice versa: where ln(\u03bb) is the natural logarithm of \u03bb, or log (\u03bb). For example, if \u03bb = 2 (as in Figure 11.4A), an equivalent e value for r would be r = ln(2), which is approximately 0.69. FIGURE 11.4B illustrates a simple way to determine whether a population really is growing geometrically (or exponentially): plot the natural logarithm of population size versus time, and if the result is a straight line, the population is increasing by geometric or exponential growth. Finally, look again at Equations 11.1 and 11.3. In Equation 11.1, which value of \u03bb will ensure that the population does not change in size from one time period to the next? Similarly, in Equation 11.3, which value of r causes the population to remain fixed in size? The answers are \u03bb = 1 (because then Nt+1 = Nt) and r = 0 (because then the rate at which the population size changes is 0). When \u03bb < 1 (or r < 0), the population will decline to extinction, whereas when \u03bb > 1 (or r > 0), the population will increase geometrically (or exponentially) to form a J-shaped curve (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 11.5). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 11.5 How Population Growth Rates Affect Population Size Depending on the value of \u03bb or r, a population with an exponential growth pattern will decrease in size, remain the same size, or increase in size. How can we estimate a population\u2019s growth rate (r or \u03bb)? In one approach, Equation 11.4 is used to estimate the growth rate r at different points in time, as you can explore for the human population in ANALYZING DATA 11.1. There are a variety of other methods as well (see Caswell 2001), including estimating r (or \u03bb) from life table data, as we will see in Concept 11.4. We can also use r to determine the doubling time (td) of a population, which is the number of years it will take the population to double in size.", "As interested readers can confirm (by solving Equation 11.4 for the time it takes a population to increase from its initial size, N0, to twice that size, 2N0), doubling times can be estimated as (11.5) where r is the exponential growth rate. Populations can grow rapidly because they increase by multiplication Equations 11.1 and 11.3 show that populations increase by multiplication, not addition: at each point in time, the population changes in size according to the multiplier \u03bb or r. As a result, populations have the potential to add large numbers of individuals rapidly whenever \u03bb > 1 or r > 0. The principle at work here is the same one that applies to interest on a savings account. Even when the interest rate is low, you can earn a lot of money each year if you have a large amount deposited in the bank, because savings, like populations, grow by multiplication. Similarly, the fact that populations grow by multiplication means that even a low growth rate can cause the size of a population to increase rapidly. ANALYZING DATA 11.1 Ecologists often use estimates of \u03bb or r to determine how rapidly a population is growing (or declining) at various points in time. For a population that is growing exponentially, we can calculate such estimates by rearranging Equation 11.4 to read where N is the population size at the beginning of a time period, t is the length of the time period, and N is the population 0 t size at the end of the period. If we know t, N , and N , we can then estimate r: 0 t In this exercise, we\u2019ll use this technique and the data in the table to examine the growth rate of the world\u2019s human population at different points in time. 1. Calculate the exponential growth rates for the years shown in the table and graph your results. For example, from year 1 to year 400, the length of the time period, t, is t = 400 \u2013 1 = 399, and we find that r = [ln(190 million/170 million)]/399 = 0.1112/399 = 0.00028. 2. If the human population continued to grow at the rate you calculated for 2016, how large would the population be in 2066? 3. What assumptions did you make in answering Question 2? Based on results for Question 1, is it likely that the human population will reach the size that you calculated for 2066? Explain. Year (C.E.) Population size Exponential growth rate (r) 1 170 million 0.00028 400 190 million ? 800 220 million ? 1200 360 million ? 1550 500 million ? 1825 1 billion ? 1930 2 billion ? 1960 3 billion ? 1999 6 billion ? 2010 6.87 billion ? 2016 7.35 billion ? 2019 7.7 billion (N/A) See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. Consider our own population. In this chapter\u2019s Case Study, we stated that the current annual growth rate of the human population was 1.1%. Such a growth rate implies that \u03bb = 1.011, and hence that r = ln(\u03bb) = 0.0109, a value that seems close to 0. If we set the year 2019 as time t = 0, we have N0 = 7.7 billion, the size of the human population in 2019. Plugging these values of r and N0 into Equation 11.4, we calculate that the 0.0109 population size 1 year later should be N1 = 7.7 \u00d7 e , which equals 7.78 billion people. Thus, in 2019, the human population was increasing by 80 million people per year (7.78 billion \u2013 7.70 billion = 0.08 billion = 80 million). Since populations grow by multiplication, if r remained constant at 0.0109 for an extended period of time, the yearly increments to the human population would become astronomical. For example, after 225 years, there would be over 89 billion people, and our population would be increasing in size by almost a billion people each year. Turning from humans to other species, what do field studies reveal about the growth rates of their populations? Some species, such as the woodland herb Asarum canadense (wild ginger), have maximum observed values of \u03bb that are close to 1 (\u03bb = 1.01 in young forests, \u03bb = 1.1 in mature forests) (FIGURE 11.6). Similar values were observed for a population of 25 reindeer introduced to Saint Paul Island off the coast of Alaska in 1911.", "After 27 years, the population had increased from 25 to 2,046 individuals, which (when we solve for \u03bb in Equation 11.2) yields \u03bb = 1.18. FIGURE 11.6 Some Populations Have Low Growth Rates The growth rates of a population of wild ginger (Asarum canadense) in a young forest vary from year to year. The maximum growth rate in this forest is 1.01. However, growth rates are often less than 1.0, suggesting that the population will decline in size unless conditions improve. (Data from H. Damman and M. L. Cain. 1998. J Ecol 86: 13\u201326.) Considerably higher annual growth rates have been observed for populations of many species, including western gray kangaroos (\u03bb = 1.9), field voles (\u03bb = 24), and rice weevils (\u03bb = 1017), which are insect pests of rice and other grains. Some bacteria, such as the mammalian gut inhabitant Escherichia coli, can double in 5,274 number every 30 minutes, resulting in the unimaginably high annual growth rate of \u03bb = 10 . Recall that when \u03bb > 1 (or r > 0) for an extended period, populations increase exponentially in size, forming a J-shaped curve like that in Figure 11.4A. In natural populations, \u03bb > 1 (or r > 0) when key factors in the environment are favorable for growth, survival, and reproduction. But can such favorable conditions last for long? There are limits to the growth of populations An argument from basic principles suggests that the answer to the question we just posed is no. Physicists estimate that the known universe contains a total of 1080 atoms. Yet if favorable conditions persisted for long enough, allowing \u03bb to remain greater than 1, even populations of relatively slowly growing species would eventually increase to more than 1080 individuals. For example, based on Asarum\u2019s growth rate of \u03bb = 1.01 in young forests, a population that began with 2 plants would have more than 1082 plants after 19,000 years. For an extremely rapidly growing species such as E. coli, the numbers are even more absurd: it would take only 6 days for a population that began with a single bacterium to exceed 1080 individuals. No population could ever come close to having 1080 individuals, because there would be no atoms with which to construct their bodies. Thus, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. While this is an extreme example (because other difficulties would be encountered long before there was a shortage of atoms), it illustrates a fundamental point: there are limits to population growth, which cause it to slow and eventually stop. We\u2019ll look at some of those limits in the following section. Self-Assessment 11.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 11.2 Population size is determined by a combination of density-dependent and density-independent factors. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 11.2.1 Define density-independent factors and describe how they affect population size and growth rate. 11.2.2 Define density-dependent factors and describe how they affect population size and growth rate. Effects of Density Although populations can show exponential growth under favorable conditions, conditions in nature are rarely favorable for long. For example, Damman and Cain (1998) calculated the geometric growth rate (\u03bb) in each of 5 years for a population of the woodland herb A. canadense located in a young forest. As mentioned above, the maximum growth rate was \u03bb = 1.01. During the other 4 years, however, values for \u03bb ranged from 0.77 to 0.96 (see Figure 11.6). Thus, far from threatening to overrun the planet with its offspring, we would expect this population to decline in the long run, unless conditions changed for the better. What factors change population sizes and growth rates over time? One set of factors are referred to as density-independent factors, meaning that their effects on population size or population growth rate (\u03bb or r) are independent of the number of individuals in the population (FIGURE 11.7A). The other set of factors are known as density-dependent factors because their effects on population size or population growth rate are dependent on the number of individuals in the population (FIGURE 11.7B). Let\u2019s discuss density-independent factors first. FIGURE 11.7 Comparing Density Independence and Density Dependence Each point represents one population. (A) Density independence. (B) Density dependence. In this example, population growth rates decrease as population density increases. Density-independent factors can determine population size In many species, year-to-year variation in weather leads to dramatic changes in abundance and hence in population growth rates.", "For example, Davidson and Andrewartha (1948) studied how weather in Adelaide, Australia, affected populations of the insect Thrips imaginis, a pest of roses. By correlating weather conditions with thrips population sizes over a 14-year period, they showed that yearly fluctuations in population size could be predicted accurately by an equation that used temperature and rainfall data (FIGURE 11.8). FIGURE 11.8 Weather Can Influence Population Size Davidson and Andrewartha accurately predicted the mean number of thrips per rose observed in Adelaide, Australia, using an equation based on four weather-related variables. (After J. Davidson and H. Andrewartha. 1948. J Anim Ecol 17: 200\u2013222.) The effects of climate can also change the birth or death rates of species more gradually over time, as is the case for forests across broad regions of the western United States. CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON TREE MORTALITY RATES Over the course of several decades, mortality rates increased gradually in populations of coniferous forest trees across the western United States (FIGURE 11.9). These increases occurred in stands of seemingly healthy forest that had not been cut for more than 200 years, leading researchers to ask, \u201cWhat is killing the trees? \u201d FIGURE 11.9 Rising Tree Mortality Rates Trends in coniferous tree mortality rates for 76 study plots located in the three regions of the western United States shown on the map. (After P. J. van Mantgem et al. 2009. Science 323: 521\u2013524.) In seeking an answer to this question, Van Mantgem et al. (2009) ruled out several possible causes, including air pollution, forest fragmentation, changes in fire frequency, and within-stand increases in the intensity of competition. The researchers went on to note that during the time period covered by their study, regional temperatures in the western United States had increased at rates of 0.3\u00b0C to 0.5\u00b0C per decade. These rapid temperature increases were associated with declines in the snowpack, earlier spring snowmelt, and a lengthening of the summer dry period. These changes caused an increase in the trees\u2019 climatic water deficit (the amount by which a plant\u2019s annual evaporative demand for water exceeds available water). Previous studies had shown that tree mortality rates tend to increase when climatic water deficit increases (Bigler et al. 2007). Overall, van Mantgem et al.\u2019s study suggests that the rise in tree mortality rates was driven by regional warming and the ensuing drought stress. Similarly, in the southwestern United States, warmer temperatures in the summer and reduced snowfall in the winter have produced \u201chotter droughts\u201d that are associated with increases in the area burned by wildfires and the area affected by insect outbreaks\u2014again causing tree mortality rates to rise (Williams et al. 2013). (We will continue our discussion of how climate change affects forests in ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 11.1.) Population size can also fluctuate as a consequence of biotic factors, such as hunting. For example, in 2002, a system for recording the cause of death of elephants was established in 45 sites across Africa. Wittemyer et al. (2014) combined that information with other demographic data to estimate how elephant population growth rates have changed over time (FIGURE 11.10). Their analyses indicated that across the African continent, elephant population growth rates have dropped below \u03bb = 1.0, primarily because of a rapid increase in illegal poaching (for tusk ivory) after 2009. For example, 100,000 elephants were killed for ivory over a 3-year period (2010\u20132012)\u2014a level of illegal killing that cannot be sustained. To prevent elephants from becoming extinct in the wild, elephant population growth rates must increase and remain above \u03bb = 1.0. For this to occur, new efforts must be taken to curb the rate of illegal killing and reduce the global demand for illegal ivory. FIGURE 11.10 Will Elephants Become Extinct in the Wild? Population growth rates (\u03bb) for 306 elephant populations show that elephants have been in decline across the African continent since 2010. (After G. Wittemyer et al. 2014. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111: 13117\u201313121.) As these examples suggest, density-independent factors can have major effects on population size from one year to the next. In principle, such factors could account entirely for year-to-year fluctuations in the size of a population. But density-independent factors do not tend to increase the size of populations when they are small and decrease the size of populations when they are large.", "A factor that did consistently lead to such changes would cause the population growth rate to change as a function of density\u2014that is, to be density dependent, not density independent. Density-dependent factors regulate population size Limited amounts of factors such as food or habitat can influence population size in a density-dependent manner, which means that they cause birth rates, death rates, or dispersal rates to change as the density of the population changes (see Figure 11.7B). As densities increase, it is common for birth rates to decrease, death rates to increase, and dispersal from the population (emigration) to increase\u2014all of which tend to decrease population size. When densities decrease, the opposite occurs: birth rates tend to increase, and death and emigration rates decrease. When one or more density-dependent factors cause population size to increase when numbers are low and decrease when numbers are high, population regulation is said to occur. Ultimately, when the density of any species becomes high enough, density-dependent factors decrease population size because food, space, or other essential resources are in short supply. Note that \u201cregulation\u201d has a particular meaning here, referring to the effects of factors that tend to increase \u03bb or r when the population size is small and decrease \u03bb or r when the population size is large. Density-independent factors can have large effects on population size, but they do not regulate population size because they do not consistently increase population size when it is small and decrease population size when it is large. Thus, by definition, only density-dependent factors can regulate population size. Density dependence has been observed in many populations Density dependence can often be detected in natural populations (FIGURE 11.11). For example, in a study that combined field observations with controlled experiments, Arcese and Smith (1988) examined the effect of population density on reproduction in the song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) on Mandarte Island, British Columbia. They found that the number of eggs laid per female decreased with density, as did the number of young that survived long enough to become independent of their parents (see Figure 11.11A). Because Mandarte Island is small and the birds were likely to suffer food shortages at high densities, Arcese and Smith predicted that if they provided food to a subset of nesting pairs when densities were high, the birds that were fed should be able to rear more young to independence. That is exactly what happened: nesting pairs that were fed reared nearly four times as many young to independence as did control birds that were not fed (see Figure 11.11A). FIGURE 11.11 Examples of Density Dependence in Natural Populations (A) Numbers of young song sparrows reared to independence on Mandarte Island at different densities of breeding females. The number next to each point indicates the year of observation (1975\u20131986). (B) Density of surviving soybeans 93 days after they were planted at densities ranging from 10 to 1,000 seeds per square meter. (C) Mortality rates in flour beetles at various egg densities. (A after P. Arcese and J. N. M. Smith. 1988. J Anim Ecol 57: 119\u2013136; B after J. A. Yoda et al. 1963. J Biol 14: 107\u2013120; C after T. S. Bellows, Jr. 1981. J Anim Ecol 50: 139\u2013156.) In (A), based on data from years other than 1975, how many young song sparrows per female would you have expected to be reared to independence in 1975? Explain your reasoning and describe factors that could have caused the observed results. In addition to density-dependent reproduction, density-dependent mortality has been observed in many populations. For example, when Yoda et al. (1963) planted soybeans (Glycine soja) at various densities, they found that at the highest initial planting densities, many of the seedlings had died by 93 days of age (see Figure 11.11B). Similarly, in an experiment in which eggs of the flour beetle Tribolium confusum were placed in glass tubes (each with 0.5 g of food), death rates increased as the density of eggs per tube increased \u2014again revealing density dependence (see Figure 11.11C). Density dependence has also been detected in populations whose abundance is strongly influenced by factors usually considered to act in a density-independent manner, such as temperature or precipitation; we describe one such example in WEB EXTENSION 11.2, in which Smith (1961) reanalyzed a classic example of density independence (Davidson and Andrewartha\u2019s thrips data). When birth, death, or dispersal rates show strong density dependence, population growth rates (\u03bb or r) may decline as densities increase (FIGURE 11.12).", "Eventually, if densities become high enough to cause \u03bb to equal 1 (or r to equal 0), the population stops growing entirely; if \u03bb becomes less than 1 (or r < 0), the population declines. As we\u2019ll see in the next section, such density-dependent changes in the population growth rate can cause a population to reach a stable, maximum population size. FIGURE 11.12 Population Growth Rates May Decline at High Densities Each point represents one population. (A) The geometric population growth rate (\u03bb) of the grass Poa annua is density dependent, as is (B) the exponential growth rate (r) of the water flea Daphnia pulex. (A after R. Law. 1975. Unpublished PhD thesis. University of Liverpool; B after P. W. Frank et al. 1957. Physiol Zool 30: 287\u2013305.) Are high-density populations increasing in size in (A)? In (B)? Explain. Self-Assessment 11.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 11.3 The logistic equation incorporates limits to growth and shows how a population may stabilize at a maximum size, the carrying capacity. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 11.3.1 Define logistic population growth and compare to exponential population growth. 11.3.2 Describe the growth patterns of the U.S. population. Logistic Growth Some populations exhibit logistic growth, a pattern in which abundance increases rapidly at first and then stabilizes at a population size known as the carrying capacity, the maximum population size that can be supported indefinitely by the environment. The growth of such a population can be represented by an S-shaped curve (FIGURE 11.13). The growth rate of the population decreases as the population size nears the carrying capacity because resources such as food, water, or space begin to be in short supply. At the carrying capacity, the growth rate is zero, and hence the population size does not change. FIGURE 11.13 An S-Shaped Growth Curve in a Natural Population At a site in Australia, heavy grazing by rabbits had prevented willows from colonizing the area. The rabbits were removed in 1954, opening up new habitat for willows. When willows colonized the area in 1966, ecologists tracked the growth of their population. (After M. C. Alliende and J. L. Harper. 1989. J Ecol 77: 1029\u20131047.) The logistic equation models density-dependent population growth To see how the idea of a carrying capacity can be represented in a mathematical model of population growth, let\u2019s reconsider Figure 11.12. The data in both graphs show that population growth rates (r or \u03bb) decreased approximately as a straight line as population densities increased. But r is assumed to be constant in the exponential growth equation, dN/dt = rN. As we\u2019ve seen, a constant value of r > 0 allows for unlimited growth in population size. Thus, to modify the exponential growth equation to make it more realistic, we replace the assumption that r is constant with the assumption that r declines in a straight line as density (N) increases. When we do this, as described in WEB EXTENSION 11.3, we obtain the logistic equation: (11.6) where dN/dt is the rate of change in population size at time t, N is population density (also at time t), r is the (per capita) intrinsic rate of increase under ideal conditions, and K is the density at which the population stops increasing in size. K can be interpreted as the carrying capacity of the environment, and the term (1 \u2013 N/K) can be viewed as the fraction of the carrying capacity that is available for population growth. As long as the population size is less than the carrying capacity (i.e., N < K), only a fraction of the available resources are being used and the population will continue to grow. As the population size approaches the carrying capacity, however, the fraction of resources available for individuals becomes smaller and the population growth slows and ultimately stops at K. Just as you saw with Equation 11.4, we can rearrange Equation 11.6 to allow us to predict the population size at some later time, assuming logistic growth. When we do this, we get (11.7) Logistic growth is similar to, but slightly slower than, exponential growth when densities are low (FIGURE 11.14). This occurs because when N is small, the term (1 \u2013 N/K) is close to 1, and hence a population that grows logistically grows at a rate close to r. As the population density increases, however, logistic growth and exponential growth differ greatly.", "In logistic growth, the rate at which the population changes in size (dN/dt) approaches zero as the population size nears the carrying capacity, K. As a result, over time, the population size approaches K gradually, eventually remaining constant with K individuals in the population. FIGURE 11.14 Comparison of Logistic and Exponential Growth Over time, logistic growth differs greatly from the unlimited growth of a population that increases exponentially. In the logistic equation, as the population size (N) becomes increasingly close to the carrying capacity, K, how does that affect the term (1 \u2013 N/K)? Why does this cause N to stop increasing in size? In Concept 10.1, we discussed the extent to which the growth of natural populations can be described by the S-shaped curve that results from the logistic equation; here, we examine efforts to fit the logistic equation to U.S. census data. Can logistic growth predict the carrying capacity of the U.S. population? In a groundbreaking paper published in 1920, Pearl and Reed examined the fit of several different mathematical models to U.S. census data for the period 1790\u20131910. Several of the approaches they tested did a good job of matching the historical data, but none included limits to the eventual size of the U.S. population. To address this shortcoming, they derived the logistic equation, which, unknown to them, had been first described in 1838 by the Belgian mathematician P. F. Verhulst. Pearl and Reed argued that the logistic equation provided a sensible way to represent population growth because it included limits to growth. When they fit the census data to the logistic curve, they obtained an excellent match, from which they estimated that the U.S. population had a carrying capacity of K = 197,274,000 people. The logistic curve estimated by Pearl and Reed provides a good fit to U.S. population data through 1950. After that time, however, the actual population size differed considerably from Pearl and Reed\u2019s projections (FIGURE 11.15). By 1967, the carrying capacity (197 million) they had predicted had been surpassed. Pearl and Reed intended their estimate of the carrying capacity to represent the number of people that could be supported in the United States in a self-sufficient manner. They recognized that if conditions changed\u2014for example, if agricultural productivity increased or if more resources were imported from other countries\u2014the population could increase beyond 197 million. These and other changes have occurred, leading some ecologists and demographers to shift their focus from the number of humans that make up the carrying capacity to the total area of land required to support humans (the \u201cecological footprint,\u201d discussed in Connections in Nature). FIGURE 11.15 Fitting a Logistic Curve to the U.S. Population Size In 1920, Pearl and Reed fitted a logistic curve to U.S. census data for 1790\u20131910. They estimated the nation\u2019s carrying capacity (K) as 197 million people. (Data through 1910 from R. Pearl and L. J. Reed. 1920.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 11.4.1 Justify the use of life tables to determine population growth and size. 11.4.2 Describe how age or size structure influences population growth and population size. 11.4.3 Compare the three types of survivorship curves. 11.4.4 Analyze life table data and calculate a net reproductive rate (R0) and exponential growth rate (r). Life Tables Up to this point, we have assumed that individuals within a population do not vary in their birth (b) and death (d) rates. This is a big assumption given that we know real populations are made up of individuals of different ages, sizes, and sexes, which vary in their capacity to reproduce and survive. Information about the varying patterns of reproduction and survival in a population is essential if we want to understand current population growth or predict future population sizes. A life table provides a summary of how survival and reproductive rates vary with the age, size, or life stage of the individuals within a population. These summaries can then be used to predict future population trends and develop strategies for managing populations of commercial or ecological value. Before we explore life tables in more detail, let\u2019s first consider how populations can differ in their age and survivorship structure.", "Age or size structure influences how rapidly populations grow Members of a population whose ages fall within a specified range are said to be part of the same age class. Age class 1, for instance, might include all individuals who are at least 1 year old but who are not yet 2 years old. Once individuals have been categorized in this way, a population can be described by its age structure: the proportions of the population in each age class. Imagine a population of a hypothetical organism in which all members die before they reach 3 years of age. In this population, every individual will be 0 (\u201cnewborns,\u201d which includes all individuals less than 1 year old), 1, or 2 years old. If there are 100 individuals in the population, and if 20 are newborns, 30 are 1-year-olds, and 50 are 2-year-olds, then the age structure will be 0.2 in age class 0, 0.3 in age class 1, and 0.5 in age class 2. Age structure is a key feature of populations, in part because it influences whether a population increases or decreases in size. Consider two human populations of the same size and with the same survival and reproduction rates, but with different age structures. If one of the populations had many people older than 55, while the other had many people between ages 15 and 30, we would expect the second population to grow more rapidly than the first because it contained more individuals of reproductive age. Indeed, human populations that are growing rapidly typically have a greater percentage of people in younger age classes than do populations that are growing slowly or are in decline (FIGURE 11.16). FIGURE 11.16 Age Structure Influences Growth Rate in Human Populations Population pyramids for Nigeria and Japan show age structures that are typical of human populations with rapidly growing populations (Nigeria) and with growth rates that are negative or close to zero (Japan). The main reproductive ages (15\u201344) are shown in green. (After L. Roberts. 2011. Science 333: 540\u2013543. Pyramids from United Nations, DESA, Population Division. World Population Prospects 2019/CC BY 3.0 IGO. https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/DemographicProfiles/Pyramid/392 and https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/DemographicProfiles/Pyramid/566.) We have emphasized the importance of age because in many species, birth and death rates differ greatly among individuals of different ages. For other kinds of organisms, age is less important. In many plant species, for example, if conditions are favorable, a seedling may grow to full size relatively rapidly and reproduce at a young age. If conditions are not favorable, however, the plant may remain small for years and reproduce little or not at all; if conditions become favorable at a later time, the plant may then grow to full size and reproduce. For such species, whether an individual reproduces or not is more closely related to size than to age. When birth and death rates correlate poorly with age, or when age is difficult to measure, life tables based on the sizes or the life cycle stages (e.g., newborn, juvenile, adult) of individuals in the population can be constructed. There are three types of survivorship curves As discussed previously, different age classes of populations have different rates of survivorship. Survivorship data can be graphed as a survivorship curve. In such a curve, survivorship data are used to plot the numbers of individuals from a hypothetical cohort (typically, of 1,000 individuals) that will survive to reach different ages. Results from studies on a variety of species suggest that survivorship curves can be classified into three general types, which indicate the life stages at which high rates of mortality are most likely to occur (FIGURE 11.17). In populations with a type I survivorship curve, newborns, juveniles, and young adults all have high survival rates; death rates do not begin to increase until old age. Examples of populations with type I survivorship curves include U.S. females (FIGURE 11.18) and Dall mountain sheep (Figure 11.17A). In populations with a type II survivorship curve, individuals have an approximately constant chance of surviving from one age to the next throughout their lives. Some bird species have a type II survivorship curve (Figure 11.17B), as do mud turtles (after their second year), some fishes, and some plant species. Finally, in populations with a type III survivorship curve, individuals die at very high rates when they are young, but those that reach adulthood survive well later in life. Type III survivorship curves\u2014 the most common type observed in nature\u2014are typical of species that produce large numbers of young.", "Examples include giant puffballs, some plants, most insects, and many marine invertebrates, including the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula (Figure 11.17C). In this species, a population size of a million juveniles declines precipitously to 62 individuals after 1 year and to 2 individuals after 8 years. FIGURE 11.17 Three Types of Survivorship Curves Ecologists recognize three general types of survivorship curves. Survivorship curves are given for (A) the Dall mountain sheep, (B) the song thrush, and (C) the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula. Notice that the number of survivors has been plotted on a logarithmic scale. (A,B after E. S. Deevey. 1947. Q Rev Biol 22: 283\u2013314; C after J. H. Connell. 1970. Ecol Monogr 40: 49\u201378.) What percentage of Dall mountain sheep survive to age 11? FIGURE 11.18 Survivorship Varies among Human Populations In the United States, survivorship (l ) does notx drop greatly until old age. In Gambia, many people die at much younger ages. (U.S. data from E. Arias. 2015. National Vital Statistic Reports 64. National Center for Health Statistics: Hyattsville, MD; Gambia data from S. E. Moore et al. 1997. Nature 388: 434.) The proportion of Gambians born in the hungry season who live to age 45 is roughly the same as the proportion of U.S. females who live to what age (see Table 11.2)? We have discussed type I to III survivorship curves as if they were constant for each species, but that is not necessarily the case. Survivorship curves can vary among populations of a species, between males and females in a population, and among cohorts of a population that experience different environmental conditions (see Figure 11.18). In fact, by comparing birth and death rates in groups of individuals that experience different conditions, we can assess the effects of those conditions on populations. As we\u2019ll see in the next section, we can also use birth and death rates in a life table analysis to predict how the size and composition of a population will change over time. Life tables can be based on age, size, or life cycle stage The data that ecologists collect on the patterns of births and deaths for populations can be used to construct life tables. TABLE 11.1 shows a life table using data from the acorn barnacle B. glandula on the shorelines of Scotland. This life table is known as a cohort life table, in which the fate of a group of individuals born during the same time period (a cohort) is followed from birth to death. The two columns on the left show the number of individuals surviving and the number of offspring produced at different ages (x) through time. As the individuals within the cohort die, N decreases from 1 million barnacles to only 2 barnacles after 8 years x (see Figure 11.17C). The proportion of individuals that survive, known as survivorship (l ), can be calculated by simply x dividing Nx by N0, the number of barnacles originally born into the cohort (represented by age 0). In addition, we can calculate the fecundity (F ), or the mean number of barnacle offspring produced per x surviving adult barnacle per age class, by dividing the total number of offspring (Nx offspring) by the number of individuals (N ) that produce those offspring. Multiplying survivorship (l ) by fecundity (F ) gives us the x xx number of offspring produced for individuals within a particular age class within the population. The sum of these values for all the age classes gives us the net reproductive rate (R0), which is simply the mean number of offspring produced per individual in the cohort, adjusted for survival: (11.8) If R0 is greater than 1.0, there is a net increase in offspring produced each generation, and assuming the birth and death rates do not change over time, the population should increase exponentially. If R0 is less than 1.0, and individuals are not replaced as they die, the population declines eventually to extinction. If R0 is 1.0, then the births and deaths balance out and the population will not change in size. We can use R0 to estimate the per capita growth rate, r, of a cohort by scaling R0 to account for the generation time of the cohort. The generation time (G) is the average age of the parents of all the offspring produced within the cohort (see Table 11.1 for equation). To estimate r, we simply divide the natural log (ln) of R0 by G and get (11.9)", "Note that R0 equals \u03bb when the generation time of the population is equal to 1. Once we have calculated r from the life table, we can use it (or \u03bb) in our population growth models (Equation 11.2 for geometric growth, Equation 11.4 for exponential growth, or Equation 11.7 for logistic growth) to predict population sizes in the future. In addition, other methods exist to calculate future population growth and size using life table data. One such method, which allows for a prediction of future age structure and population size, is given in WEB EXTENSION 11.4. Cohort life tables follow individuals from birth to death as a function of calendar year or life stage (e.g., eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults in insects). This is relatively easy to do if the organisms are easily followed\u2014 for example, if they are sessile and short-lived, as we saw in the barnacle example. However, for organisms that are highly mobile or have long life spans (e.g., trees that live much longer than people), it is hard to observe the fate of individuals from birth to death. In some of these cases, a static life table can be used, in which the survival and reproduction of individuals of different ages during a single time period are recorded. To construct a static life table, one must be able to estimate the ages of the organisms under observation. Estimating ages is difficult in some species, but for others, reliable indicators of age are known, including annual growth rings in fish scales and tree wood and tooth wear in deer. Once ages have been estimated, agespecific birth rates can be determined by counting how many offspring the individuals of different ages produce. Age-specific survival rates can also be determined from a static life table (see Review Question 3), but only if we assume that survival rates have remained constant during the entire time that the individuals in the population have been alive\u2014an assumption that may not be correct. Finally, ecologists and natural resource managers can seek to change the birth or death rates of certain populations, with the ultimate goal of decreasing the size of a pest population or increasing the size of an endangered population. An efficient way to reach this goal is to identify the age-specific birth or death rates that most strongly influence the population growth rate. In one such example, life table data indicated that the most effective way to increase the growth rates of endangered sea turtle populations was to increase the survival rates of juvenile and mature turtles\u2014a change from the common practice of protecting newborns (ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 11.1). ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 11.1 Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) are large marine turtles that lay eggs in nests that adult females dig into sandy beaches. Newly hatched baby turtles weigh just 20 g (0.04 pounds) and have a shell length of 4.5 cm (1.8 inches). They reach adulthood after 20\u201330 years, at which point they can weigh up to 227 kg (500 pounds) and have a shell length of 122 cm (4 feet). Loggerhead sea turtles have been listed as a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act since 1978. Many species eat loggerhead eggs or hatchlings, and the juveniles and adults are eaten by large marine predators such as tiger sharks and killer whales. Loggerheads also face threats from people, including the destruction of nesting sites by development, as well as commercial fisheries (in whose nets sea turtles can become trapped and drown). Early efforts to protect loggerhead sea turtles focused on the egg and hatchling stages, which suffer extensive mortality and are relatively easy to protect. To evaluate this approach, Crouse et al. (1987) and Crowder et al. (1994) used life table data to determine how the existing exponential growth rate of r = \u20130.05 would change if new management practices improved the survival rates of turtles of various ages (FIGURE A). Their findings suggested that even if hatchling survival rates were increased by 90%, loggerhead populations would continue to decline. Instead, they found that the population growth rate was most responsive to increasing the survival rates of older juveniles and adults. FIGURE A Management Practices and Sea Turtle Population Growth Rates Researchers used life table data to identify the age-specific death rates that most strongly influenced the population growth rate of loggerhead sea turtles. (After L. B. Crowder et al. 1994. Ecol Appl 4: 437\u2013445.)", "The results obtained by Crouse, Crowder, and their colleagues prompted the enactment of laws requiring turtle excluder devices (TEDs) to be installed in shrimp nets (FIGURE B). A TED functions as a hatch through which juvenile and adult sea turtles can escape when caught in a net. Shrimp nets were singled out because the data suggested that shrimping accounted for more loggerhead deaths (5,000\u201350,000 deaths per year) than all other human activities combined. FIGURE B Turtle Excluder Device (TED) Loggerheads are most easily counted when they nest, yet it takes 20\u201330 years for turtles to become sexually mature. As a result, it will be decades before we know whether TED regulations help turtle populations to increase in size. But early results are encouraging: the number of turtles killed in nets dropped substantially (up to 94%) after the TED regulations were implemented (Finkbeiner et al. 2011). Extensive life table data exist for people Many economic, sociological, and medical applications rely on human life table data. Life insurance companies, for example, use census data to construct static life tables that provide a snapshot of current survival rates; they use these data to determine the premiums they charge customers of different ages. Let\u2019s consider two examples of human life tables, one from the United States, the other from Gambia. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention periodically release reports that provide life table data for people in the United States. Reports released in 2009 and 2015 provide information on the survivorship (l ), fecundity (F ), and life expectancy (expected number of years of life remaining) of U.S. xx females of different ages (TABLE 11.2). To make their interpretation easier, such data can be graphed, as in Figure 11.18, which plots l data for U.S. females. This curve shows that survival probabilities for U.S. x females remain high for many years; in fact, as Table 11.2 reveals, these survival probabilities do not begin to drop sharply until around age 70.

National Center for Health Statistics: Hyattsville, MD. The data from the United States are in stark contrast to data from Gambia, a country located on the west coast of Africa. Moore et al. (1997) analyzed birth and death records for 3,102 people born in three Gambian villages between 1949 and 1994. They found that the season of birth had long-term effects: individuals born during the \u201chungry season\u201d (July\u2013October, when food stored from the previous year is in low supply) had lower survivorship as adults than did individuals born at other times of the year (see Figure 11.18). Their data also reveal large differences between the survivorship of people in Gambia and in the United States. For example, only 47% to 62% of Gambians (depending on their season of birth) survived to reach age 45, whereas 97% of U.S. females survived to that age. Self-Assessment 11.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Human Population Growth Media reports often state that the human population is growing exponentially. As we saw in Figure 11.4, a simple way to determine whether a population is growing exponentially is to plot the natural logarithm of population size versus time. If a straight line results, the population is growing exponentially. When we plot the natural logarithm of human population size versus time for the last 2,000 years, however, we see that our population sizes deviate considerably from the straight line expected in exponential growth (FIGURE 11.19). In fact, as fast as exponential growth is, historically the human population has increased even more rapidly than that.", "FIGURE 11.19 Faster than Exponential A plot of the logarithm of the human population size over the last 2,000 years differs dramatically from the straight line expected if it were growing exponentially. The faster-than-exponential nature of human population growth is also evident from historical doubling times for the human population. Recall that in a population that grows exponentially, the doubling time remains constant. However, as shown in the inset of Figure 11.19, the doubling times observed for the human population dropped from roughly 1,400 years in 5000 B.C.E. to a mere 39 years in 1960\u2014again indicating that historically, our population has increased more rapidly than expected of exponential growth. Projecting into the future, we can predict how long it will take our population to double in size at current rates of growth. To do this, the doubling time is estimated from the relation td = ln(2)/r (see Equation 11.5), where r is the current growth rate of the human population. Such estimates have shown that the human population was growing most rapidly in the early 1960s, with a doubling time of 32 years. Since then, the doubling time has increased (because r has decreased), reaching 63 years in 2019. The increase in the doubling time (and the decrease in r) over the past 5 decades indicates that the human population is now growing more slowly than expected in exponential growth. So, returning to the question we asked in the Case Study (whether there would be 14 billion people in 2080), the answer is probably not. U.S. Census Bureau projections indicate that population growth rates are likely to continue to fall over the next 40 years (FIGURE 11.20), leading to a predicted population size of 9.6 billion in 2050 (FIGURE 11.21). Extending that curve out to 2080 suggests that there will be roughly 10 billion people in that year. If these projections turn out to be correct, or nearly so, what will the future hold with that many people? Is 10 billion above the carrying capacity of the human population? FIGURE 11.20 World Population Growth Rates Are Dropping Annual world population growth rates have declined since the early 1960s. (Data from U. S. Census Bureau, International Data Base, June 2011 update.) In 2050, will the human population still be increasing in size? Explain. FIGURE 11.21 United Nations Projections of Human Population Size The human population is expected to increase to 9.7 billion by 2050; low and high projections range from 8.3 billion to 10.9 billion. (From United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. 2019. World Population Prospects 2019: Data Booklet [ST/ESA/SER.A /424].) Using the best-estimate curve shown here and the annual growth rate estimated for the human population in 2050 (see Figure 11.20), approximately how large will our population be in 2051? To answer these questions, we must determine the carrying capacity of the human population, but that is trickier than it may at first appear. Many researchers have estimated the human carrying capacity, obtaining values that range from fewer than 1 billion to more than 1,000 billion (see Cohen 1995). This large variation is due in part to the fact that many different methods\u2014from logistic models to calculations based on crop production and human energy requirements\u2014have been used. In addition, different researchers have made different assumptions about how people would live and how technology would influence our future, assumptions that have a large effect on the estimated carrying capacity. For example, by using the ecological footprint approach described in this chapter\u2019s Connections in Nature, it has been estimated that Earth could support 1.5 billion people indefinitely if everyone used the amount of resources used by people in the United States in 2007 (Ewing et al. 2010). On the other hand, if everyone used the amount of resources used by people in India in 2007, the world could support over 13 billion people. Thus, as we suggested in this chapter\u2019s Case Study, issues of human population size and resource use are linked inextricably: more people means that more resources will be used, but the degree to which our growing population affects the environment depends on the amount of resources used by each person. CONNECTIONS in NATURE YOUR ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT When you turn on a light, purchase an appliance, drive a car, or eat fruit imported from another country, you may not think about the effects your actions have on the natural world. How, for example, does driving to the store to get groceries affect forests or coral reefs?", "To answer this question, we must account for the resources required to support our actions. The grains we eat require farmland; the wood products we use require natural forests or plantations; the fish we eat require productive fishing grounds; the machines and appliances we purchase require raw materials and energy to build, as well as energy for their operation. Ultimately, every aspect of our economy depends on the land and waters of Earth. Recognizing this, William Rees proposed that we measure the environmental impact of a population as its ecological footprint, which is the total area of productive ecosystems required to support that population (Rees 1992). The ecological footprint approach turns the carrying capacity concept on its head: instead of asking how many people a given area can support, it asks how much area is required to support a given number of people. Ecological footprints are calculated from national statistics on agricultural productivity, production of goods, and resource use. The area required to support these activities is then estimated. For example, the land required to support wheat consumption in 1993 by people in Italy was estimated by dividing the amount of wheat consumed (26,087,912 tons) by the amount of wheat produced per unit of land, which was 2.744 tons per hectare (ha). This resulted in 9,507,257 ha, or 0.167 ha per person (Wackernagel et al. 1999). To compare footprint calculations among nations and across different crops, such results are typically converted to global hectares, where a global hectare is defined as a hectare of world-average biological productivity (Kitzes and Wackernagel 2009). Methods of calculating ecological footprints are still being refined, but results to date are sobering. In 2007, there were 11.9 billion global hectares of productive land available, and the ecological footprint of an average person was 2.7 global hectares (Ewing et al. 2010). These results suggest that Earth could have supported 4.4 billion people (11.9 billion ha/2.7 ha per person) for a long time. In fact, the human population in 2007 was 6.7 billion, more than a 50% overshoot of its carrying capacity. An overshoot of this magnitude indicates that in 2007, environmental resources were being used more rapidly than they could be regenerated, a pattern of use that cannot be sustained. Similar calculations can be made for nations, cities, and even companies, schools, or individuals (see Review Question 4). In the United States, for example, the average ecological footprint was 8.0 global hectares per person in 2007. Since there were 1,330 million global hectares of productive land available in the nation, this calculation suggests that the carrying capacity of the United States in 2007 was 166 million people (1,330 million ha/8.0 ha per person); the actual population was 309 million, nearly double the carrying capacity. Human use of resources changes from year to year, depending on population size, per capita rates of resource use, and technology (i.e., the efficiency of production). In addition, the total area of productive ecosystems available to support our activities changes over time because of factors such as gain or loss of farmland, destruction of natural habitat, pollution, and extinctions of species. As a result, our ecological footprint changes over time. People have now begun to use our changing footprint as a way to assess whether our current population size and resource use can be sustained. This approach highlights the fact that all of our actions\u2014what we eat, how big a house we buy, how much we drive or fly, the goods we purchase (e.g., clothes, cars, cell phones)\u2014depend on and affect the natural world. Unit 4 Predation KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 12.1 Most carnivores have broad diets, whereas a majority of herbivores have relatively narrow diets. CONCEPT 12.2 Predation results in a wide range of capture and avoidance mechanisms. CONCEPT 12.3 Predator populations can cycle with their prey populations. CONCEPT 12.4 Predation can affect prey distribution and abundance, in some cases causing a shift from one community type to another. Snowshoe Hare Cycles: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 In 1899, a fur trader in northern Ontario reported to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company that \u201cIndians are bringing poor hunts. They have been starving all spring. Rabbits being scarce\u201d (Winterhalder 1980). The \u201chunts\u201d referred to were pelts of beavers and other fur-bearing animals trapped by members of the Ojibwa tribe, and the \u201crabbits\u201d were actually snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus; FIGURE 12.1).", "Collectively, 200 years of such reports show that hare populations increased and decreased regularly. When hares were abundant, the Ojibwa had enough food to spend time trapping for pelts, which they then traded to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. But when hares were scarce, tribal members concentrated on gathering food, rather than trapping animals that provided pelts, but little meat. FIGURE 12.1 Predator and Prey A snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) flees from its specialist predator, the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis). Beginning in the early 1900s, wildlife biologists used the careful records of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company to estimate abundances of snowshoe hares and their Canada lynx predators (Lynx canadensis). Both species exhibited regular population cycles, with abundances peaking about every 10 years and then falling to low levels (FIGURE 12.2A). Snowshoe hares constitute a major portion of the lynx diet, so it was not surprising that numbers of lynx should rise and fall with numbers of hares. But what drove the cyclic fluctuations in the hare population? Adding to the mystery, hare population sizes rose and fell in synchrony across broad regions of the Canadian forest, so explanations of hare cycles had to account for the large-scale synchrony as well. FIGURE 12.2 Hare Population Cycles and Reproductive Rates (A) Historical trapping data from the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company indicate that numbers of both hares and lynx fluctuated in a 10-year cycle. (B) The highest hare reproductive rates do not coincide with the highest hare densities. (A after D. A. MacLulich. 1936. J R Astron Soc Can 30: 233\u2013246; B after J. R. Cary and L. B. Keith. 1979. Can J Zool 57: 375\u2013390.) In (A), does the peak abundance of one species typically occur after the peak abundance of the other species? Describe the observed pattern and hypothesize why it might occur. One approach to finding the factors important to hare population cycles is to document the changes in birth, death, and dispersal rates that are associated with increasing or declining numbers of hares. Dispersal plays a relatively small role: it may alter local population sizes, but hares do not move far enough to account for the simultaneous changes in their abundance seen across broad geographic regions. In contrast, consistent patterns of birth and death rates have been found across different regions of Canada. Snowshoe hares can raise up to three or four litters over the summer, with an average of five young per litter. Hare reproductive rates reach their highest levels (ca. 18 young per female) several years before hare density reaches a maximum. Reproductive rates then begin to fall, reaching their lowest levels 2\u20133 years after hare density peaks (FIGURE 12.2B). Hare survival rates show a similar pattern: they are highest several years before hare density peaks; then they fall and do not rise again until several years after hare density peaks. Together, the changes over time in hare birth and survival rates drive the hare population cycle. But what causes these rates to change? Several hypotheses have been proposed, one of which focuses on food supplies. Large numbers of hares consume prodigious amounts of vegetation, and studies have shown that 2 food can be limiting at peak hare densities (up to 2,300 hares/km ). Two observations, however, indicate that food alone does not drive the hare cycle: first, some declining hare populations do not lack food, and second, the experimental addition of high-quality food does not prevent hare populations from declining. A second hypothesis focuses on predation. Many hares (up to 95% of those that die) are killed by predators such as lynx, coyotes, and birds of prey. In addition, lynx and coyotes kill more hares per day during the peak and decline phases of the hare cycle than during the increase phase. But questions remain. The killing of hares by predators explains the drop in survival rates as hare numbers decline, but by itself it does not explain (1) why hare birth rates drop during the decline phase of the cycle or (2) why hare numbers sometimes rebound slowly after predator numbers plummet. Nor does it explain other observations, such as why the physical condition of hares worsens as hares decrease in numbers. What other factors are at work? View the script for the video Introduction Over half the animals on Earth sustain themselves by feeding on other organisms. Some kill organisms, then eat them, while others \u201cgraze\u201d on living organisms by eating their tissues or internal fluids.", "As we will see, those millions of species interact with the organisms they feed in a rich variety of ways. But all these interactions share a common feature: they are all forms of predation, a trophic interaction in which an individual of one species, a predator, consumes individuals (or parts of individuals) of another species, its prey. Over the course of this and the next chapter, we will consider the three broad categories of predation: carnivory, herbivory, and parasitism (FIGURE 12.3). Predation includes carnivory, in which the predator (a carnivore) and prey are both animals; herbivory, in which the predator (an herbivore) is an animal and the prey is a plant or alga; and parasitism, in which the predator (a parasite) lives in symbiosis (close physical and/or physiological contact) with its prey (a host) and consumes certain tissues without necessarily killing the host. Some parasites are pathogens that cause disease in their hosts. FIGURE 12.3 Three Ways to Eat Other Organisms (A) Some carnivorous plants, such as these Cape sundews (Drosera capensis), consume insects that become trapped in the sticky substance that the plants secrete from the hairlike structures on the leaves. (B) Herbivores such as giraffes eat grasses, leaves, or other plant parts. (C) This marine isopod is a parasite that has attached to and is feeding on the tissues of its host, a creole fish (Paranthias furcifer) of the Caribbean coral reefs. These definitions seem simple, and it is easy to think of examples: a lion that kills and eats a zebra, an insect that eats a plant leaf, a tapeworm that robs a dog of nutrients in its digestive tract. But the natural world defies such simple categorization. Consider those prototypical herbivores, sheep: they get most of their food from plants, but they have also been known to eat the helpless young of ground-nesting birds. Conversely, carnivores can act like herbivores: wolves, for example, will eat berries, nuts, and leaves. And some organisms do not fit neatly into any category. Parasitoids are insects that typically lay one or a few eggs on or in another insect (the host) (FIGURE 12.4). After they hatch from their eggs, the parasitoid larvae remain with the host, which they eat and usually kill. Parasitoids can be considered unusual parasites (because they consume most or all of their host, almost always killing it) or unusual carnivores (because over the course of their lives they eat only one individual, killing it slowly). FIGURE 12.4 Are Parasitoids Carnivores or Parasites? Parasitoids such as the wasp Aphidius colemani, shown here depositing an egg into an aphid, can be considered unusual carnivores because during their lifetime they eat and slowly kill only one prey individual. Parasitoids can also be viewed as unusual parasites that eat all or most of their host, thereby killing it. Despite these and other complications, we will approach the rich variety of trophic interactions in two chapters: this chapter will cover carnivory and herbivory, and Chapter 13 will focus on parasitism. We will begin by exploring some aspects of carnivores and herbivores that define and characterize their dietary preferences. CONCEPT 12.1 Most carnivores have broad diets, whereas a majority of herbivores have relatively narrow diets. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 12.1.1 Understand why carnivores tend to be generalist and have broad animal prey diets. 12.1.2 Know why herbivores tend to be specialists and have narrow plant prey diets. Carnivore and Herbivore Dietary Preferences Although they share some similarities, carnivores and herbivores differ from each other in many aspects. The most obvious difference is that carnivores invariably kill their prey (it is hard to eat only part of an animal without killing it), while herbivores usually do not kill the plants they eat, at least not immediately. Another difference is that animal prey can usually move away or hide from their predators but most plant prey cannot. Finally, even though plant prey are often more abundant, their body tissues have much lower nitrogen content, and thus are less nutritious, than animal prey (FIGURE 12.5). These three factors have important consequences for the dietary preferences of carnivores versus herbivores. FIGURE 12.5 The Nitrogen Contents of Plants and Animals Differ Nitrogen is an essential component of any animal\u2019s diet. Body tissues of animals have much higher nitrogen content than those of plants. Of plant tissues, leaves tend to have the highest nitrogen content of any plant parts other than seeds. (After W. J. Mattson, Jr. 1980. Ann Rev Ecol Syst 11: 119\u2013161.)", "As we learned in Concept 8.2, optimal foraging and dietary preferences are thought to be dependent on two factors: (1) encounter rate, a function of search time, or the time it takes to search and find prey, and (2) handling time, or the time it takes to subdue and consume the prey. If the encounter rate for prey is low, as would be the case for predators searching for mobile animal prey, then the prediction is that the predators should not be too narrow in their prey choices. As a consequence, these predators (carnivores) should be generalists and have fairly broad diets. On the other hand, if prey are relatively easy to search for but their handling times are longer, as is the case for immobile but less nutritious plants, then the predators (herbivores) should be specialists and have narrow diets. Let\u2019s consider these predictions in more detail below. Many carnivores have broad diets Most carnivores eat prey in relation to their availability without showing a preference for any particular prey species. This lack of preference is likely a result of a generalist strategy. A predator can be said to show a preference for a particular prey species if it eats that species more often than would be expected based on that prey\u2019s availability. Some carnivores do show a strong preference for certain prey species. Lynx and coyotes, for example, eat more hares than would be expected based on their availability; even when hares constitute only 20% of the available food, they constitute 60%\u201380% of the diet of lynx and coyotes. Some carnivores concentrate their foraging on whatever prey is most plentiful. When researchers provided guppies with two kinds of prey, fruit flies (floating on the water surface) and tubificids (aquatic worms found on the bottom), the guppies ate disproportionate amounts of whichever prey was most abundant (FIGURE 12.6). Predators like these guppies that focus on abundant prey tend to \u201cswitch\u201d from one prey species to another. Such switching may occur because the predator forms a search image of the most common prey type and hence tends to orient toward that prey, or because learning enables it to become increasingly efficient at capturing the most common prey type. As we saw in Concept 8.2, in some cases predators switch from one type of prey to another in a manner consistent with the predictions of optimal foraging theory. FIGURE 12.6 A Predator That Switches to the Most Abundant Prey Guppies focused their foraging efforts on whichever prey species was most common in their habitat: aquatic worms (tubificids) or fruit flies. The green line indicates the results that would have been expected if the guppies had captured worms according to their availability instead of switching to whichever prey species was more abundant (blue line). (After W. W. Murdoch et al. 1975. Ecology 56: 1094\u2013 1105.) Most herbivores have relatively narrow diets While most predators eat a broad range of prey species, the majority of herbivores feed on comparatively restricted sets of plant parts or plant species. SPECIALIZATION ON PARTICULAR PLANT PARTS As we saw in Figure 12.5, the tissues of plant parts differ in their nitrogen content and thus their nutritional value. While some herbivores that are large relative to their food plant eat all parts of the plant, most herbivores tend to specialize on particular parts of plants. They can be grouped according to whether they eat leaves, stems, roots, seeds, or internal fluids (e.g., nutrient-containing sap). More herbivores eat leaves than any other plant part. Leaves are abundant, and they are available yearround in many places; leaves are also more nutritious than other plant parts (except for seeds) (see Figure 12.5). Herbivores that eat leaves range from large browsers, such as deer or giraffes, to grasshoppers and herbivorous fishes, to tiny \u201cleaf miners\u201d such as fly larvae that enter a leaf and eat it from the inside. By removing photosynthetic tissues, leaf-eating herbivores can reduce the growth, survival, or reproduction of their food plants. Belowground herbivory can also have major effects on plants, as illustrated by the 40% reduction in growth observed in bush lupine plants after 3 months of herbivory by caterpillars of the root-killing ghost moth (Hepialus californicus). Similarly, herbivores that eat seeds can have large effects on plant reproductive success, sometimes reducing it to zero. The effects of herbivores that feed on internal fluids are not always obvious (because visible plant parts are not removed), but they too can be considerable.", "For example, Dixon (1971) showed that although the lime aphid (Eucallipterus tiliae) did not reduce aboveground growth in lime trees during the year of infestation, the roots of trees infested with aphids did not grow that year, and a year later, their leaf production dropped by 40%. SPECIALIZATION ON PLANT SPECIES Most herbivores also specialize on particular plant species. This statement is true largely because of insects: there is an enormous number of herbivorous insect species, and most of them live on and eat only one (or a few) plant species. For example, most species of agromyzid flies, whose larvae are leaf miners, feed on only one or a few plant species (FIGURE 12.7). Similar results have been found for leaf-feeding beetles in the genus Blepharida: among 37 species of these beetles, 25 feed on a single plant species, 10 feed on 2\u20134 plant species, and only 2 feed on a relatively broad suite of plants (12\u2013 14 species) (Becerra 2007). FIGURE 12.7 Most Agromyzid Flies Have Narrow Diets The larvae of agromyzid flies are leaf miners that live inside leaves and feed on leaf tissue. (After K. A. Spencer. 1972. Handbooks for the Identification of British Insects, Diptera, Agromyzidae, Vol. X, Part 5G. Royal Entomological Society: London.) Using the data in the graph, make a rough estimate of the percentage of agromyzid fly species that feed on fewer than five host plant species. There are numerous examples of herbivores that eat many plant species, however. Grasshoppers, for example, graze on a broad range of plant species, and even among the leaf miners in Figure 12.7, several species eat more than ten different plants. Large browsers, such as deer, often switch from one tree or shrub species to another; in addition, they eat all or most of the aboveground parts of many herbaceous plant species. The golden apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata) is a voracious generalist herbivore, capable of removing all the large plants from wetlands; the snail then survives by eating algae and detritus. Now that we have considered diet preferences, we\u2019ll next focus on adaptations of predators and prey to either obtain food or avoid being eaten. Self-Assessment 12.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 12.2 Predation results in a wide range of capture and avoidance mechanisms. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 12.2.1 Know the search and capture mechanisms of carnivores and the ways animal prey avoid being eaten. 12.2.2 Describe how plants avoid being eaten and how herbivores can overcome these defenses. Mechanisms Important to Predation Among the other challenges they face, all animals must obtain food while striving to avoid being eaten themselves. As we have seen in Concepts 5.4 and 8.2, this ongoing drama has resulted in the evolution of a dazzling array of morphological and behavioral mechanisms in both predator and prey. Let\u2019s consider some of them here. Some carnivores move to search for and capture prey, while others sit and wait Many carnivores forage throughout their habitat, moving about in search of prey. Examples of species that hunt in this way include wolves, sharks, and hawks. Other carnivores remain in one place and attack prey that move within striking distance (as do moray eels and some snakes, such as mambas and vipers) or enter a trap (such as a spider\u2019s web or the modified leaf of a carnivorous plant). Many carnivores have unusual physical features that help them capture prey. The body form of the cheetah, for example, enables great bursts of speed that allow it to catch gazelles and other rapidly fleeing prey. In another example, most snakes can swallow prey that are considerably larger than their heads (FIGURE 12.8). Unlike those of other terrestrial vertebrates, the bones of a snake\u2019s skull are not rigidly attached to one another. This unique feature allows the snake to open its jaws to a seemingly impossible extent. Curved teeth mounted on bones that can move inward then help to pull prey items down the throat. A person with similar adaptations would be able to swallow a watermelon whole. FIGURE 12.8 How Snakes Swallow Prey Larger Than Their Heads (A) Snakes have movable skull bones that allow them to swallow surprisingly large prey. (B) This eastern green mamba snake (Dendroaspis angusticeps) is swallowing a mouse larger than its head. While some carnivores depend primarily on their physical structure, others subdue prey with poison (e.g., venomous spiders).", "Still others use mimicry: ambush bugs, scorpionfishes, and many other predators blend into their environment so well that prey may be unaware of their presence until it is too late. Some predators have inducible traits that improve their ability to feed on specific prey species. The predatory ciliate protist Lembadion bullinum has such an inducible offense: individuals gradually adjust their size to match the size of the available prey. Thus, if a ciliate is small but the available prey in its environment are large, the ciliate increases in size. Similarly, if a ciliate is large but available prey are small, the ciliate decreases in size. Finally, some predators can detoxify or tolerate prey chemical defenses, as the following example shows. The garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) is the only predator known to eat the toxic rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa). In some of its populations, the skin of this newt contains large amounts of tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin. TTX binds to sodium channels in nerve and muscle tissue, thus preventing nerve signal transmission and causing paralysis and death. A single newt can contain enough TTX to kill 25,000 mice\u2014far more than enough to kill a person, as was tragically demonstrated in 1979 when a 29-year-old man died after eating a rough-skinned newt on a dare. The garter snakes in some populations, however, can eat rough-skinned newts because they can tolerate TTX. These snakes have TTX-resistant sodium channels (Geffeney et al. 2005). Although these garter snakes are protected from the lethal effects of TTX, those individuals that can tolerate the highest concentrations of TTX move more slowly than less resistant individuals\u2014a trade-off between tolerance for the poison and speed of locomotion. In addition, once they swallow a poisonous newt, the snakes are immobilized for up to 7 hours. During that time, the snakes are vulnerable to predation themselves and may also suffer from heat stress. Escaping carnivores: Physical defenses, toxins, mimicry, and behavior Many prey species have physical features that reduce their chances of being killed by predators. Such physical defenses include large size (e.g., elephants), a body plan designed for rapid or agile movement (e.g., gazelles), and body armor (e.g., snails and armored mammals such as the pangolin in FIGURE 12.9A). FIGURE 12.9 Adaptations to Escape Being Eaten Prey have evolved a wide range of mechanisms to escape from predators, including (A) physical features, such as the armor of the ground pangolin of South Africa (Manis temmenickii); (B) toxins, advertised by bright warning colors such as those of the nudibranch Hypselodoris bullockii; (C) crypsis, or camouflage, as in this female Saturniid moth (Rhodinia fugax), which blends in with the leaf litter on the forest floor; and (D) mimicry, as in this terrestrial flatworm (Bipalium everetti) that resembles a snake. Other species use poisons to defend themselves against predators. Species that contain powerful toxins are often brightly colored (FIGURE 12.9B). Such warning (aposematic) coloration can itself provide protection from predators, which may instinctually avoid prey that are brightly colored or may learn from experience not to eat them. Other prey species use mimicry as a defense: by resembling less palatable organisms or physical features of their environment, they cause potential predators to mistake them for something less desirable to eat. There are many forms of mimicry. Some species have a shape or coloration that provides camouflage, allowing them to avoid detection by predators (FIGURE 12.9C); this form of mimicry is called crypsis (from cryptic, \u201chidden\u201d). Other prey species use mimicry as a form of \u201cfalse advertising\u201d: their shape and coloration mimic those of a species that is fierce or that contains a potent toxin (FIGURE 12.9D). Finally, many prey species change their behavior when predators are present. When predators are abundant, snowshoe hares, like the elk described in Concept 8.2, forage less in open areas (where they are most vulnerable to attack). When threatened, musk oxen form a defensive circle, which makes them a difficult target (see Figure 8.19). In some cases, there may be a trade-off between different types of defenses. For example, among four species of marine snails eaten by the green crab (Carcinus maenas), the species whose shells could be crushed most rapidly by crabs were the quickest to take refuge when crabs were detected, and vice versa (FIGURE 12.10). The exact negative correlation between resistance to crushing and predator avoidance behavior suggests that there may be a trade-off between a snail\u2019s physical and behavioral defenses. FIGURE 12.10 A Trade-Off in Snail Defenses against Crab Predation?", "(A) Handling time taken by green crabs (Carcinus maenas) to manipulate and crush the shells of each of four snail species. (B) Index of the strength of the predator avoidance response of each of four snail species; larger values indicate a more rapid behavioral response to crabs. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After P. A. Cotton et al. 2004. Ecology 85: 1581\u20131584.) Reciprocal plant\u2013herbivore interactions As we have learned, herbivores generally consume only parts of their food plant and usually do not kill them. Moreover, because most plants are not mobile and thus unable to escape herbivory in space, they employ defenses to reduce being eaten. Let\u2019s first consider plant responses to reduce herbivory and then ways that herbivores can respond. REDUCING HERBIVORY: AVOIDANCE, TOLERANCE, AND DEFENSES Some plants avoid herbivory by producing great numbers of seeds in some years and few or no seeds in other years. For example, up to 100 years may pass between bouts of seed production, as in the mass flowering of bamboos in China. This phenomenon, known as masting, allows plants to hide (in time) from seed-eating herbivores, then overwhelm them by sheer numbers. Plants can also avoid herbivores in other ways, such as by producing leaves at times of the year when herbivores are scarce. Other plants have adaptive growth responses that allow them to compensate for, and hence tolerate, the effects of herbivory\u2014at least up to a point. Compensation occurs when removal of plant tissues stimulates a plant to produce new tissues, allowing for relatively rapid replacement of the material eaten by herbivores. When full compensation occurs, herbivory causes no net loss of plant tissue. Compensation may occur when, for example, removal of leaf tissue decreases self-shading, resulting in increased plant growth, or when removal of apical buds (those at the end of a branch or shoot) allows lower buds to open and grow. Beech trees respond to simulated herbivory (clipping) by increasing both their leaf production and their photosynthetic rate. Similarly, moderate to high levels of herbivory may benefit field gentians (Gentianella campestris) under some circumstances (FIGURE 12.11). In this case, the timing of herbivory is critical: early in the growing season (up to July 20), the plant more than fully compensates for the lost tissue, but later in the season (July 28), it does not. If the amount of material removed from a field gentian\u2014or any other plant\u2014is large enough, however, or if insufficient resources are available for growth, the plant cannot fully compensate for the damage. FIGURE 12.11 Compensating for Herbivory Field gentians (Gentianella campestris) were clipped at different times during the growing season to simulate herbivory. (A) The shape and production of flowers in unclipped (control) and clipped plants. (B) Numbers of fruits produced by control plants and plants clipped on different dates. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After T. Lennartsson et al. 1998. Ecology 79: 1061\u20131072.) How many fruits would you expect to be produced by a field gentian that compensates fully for clipping? Explain your reasoning. Finally, plants use an enormous array of structural and chemical defenses to ward off herbivores (Pellmyr et al. 2002; Agrawal and Fishbein 2006). A stroll through many plant communities makes this readily apparent: the leaves of many plants are tough, and many plant bodies are covered with spines, thorns, sawlike edges, or pernicious (nearly invisible) hairs that can pierce the skin like miniature porcupine quills. In some cases, such structures are an induced defense (stimulated by herbivore attack), as illustrated by individual cacti that increase their production of spines only after they have been grazed (Myers and Bazely 1991). Plants also produce a wide variety of chemicals, called secondary compounds, that function to reduce herbivory. Some secondary compounds are toxic, protecting the plant from all but the relatively small number of herbivore species that can tolerate them. Others serve as chemical cues that attract predators or parasitoids to the plant, where they attack herbivores (Schnee et al. 2006). Some plant species, such as oak trees, produce secondary compounds constantly, regardless of whether herbivores have attacked the plant. In other species, the production of secondary compounds is an induced defense. For example, when attacked by herbivores, a North American tobacco species, Nicotiana attenuata, produces two induced defenses: toxic secondary compounds that deter herbivores directly, and volatile compounds that deter herbivores indirectly by attracting predators and parasitoids. Acting together, these defenses are very effective in reducing losses of tissue to herbivores.", "In one experiment, the application of compounds that are normally induced by herbivory to the stems of N. attenuata caused the numbers of a leaf-feeding herbivore on the plants to drop by more than 90% (Kessler and Baldwin 2001). OVERCOMING PLANT DEFENSES: STRUCTURAL, CHEMICAL, AND BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATIONS The defenses used by plants prevent most herbivores from eating most plants. But for any given plant species, there are some herbivores that can cope with its defensive mechanisms. A plant covered with spines may be attacked by an herbivore that can avoid or tolerate those spines. Many herbivores have evolved digestive enzymes that enable them to disarm or tolerate plant chemical defenses. Such herbivores may gain a considerable advantage: they can eat plants that other herbivores cannot and thereby have access to an abundant food resource. Some herbivores use behavioral responses to circumvent an otherwise effective plant defense. For example, some beetles use a behavioral response to cope with the defenses of tropical plants in the genus Bursera. These plants combine the production of toxic secondary compounds with a high-pressure delivery system: they store a toxic, sticky resin in a network of canals that runs through their leaves and stems (FIGURE 12.12). If an insect herbivore chews through one of these canals, the resin squirts from the plant under high pressure and may repel or even kill the insect (the resin hardens after it is exposed to air, so if an insect is drenched in resin, it can be entombed). Yet some tropical beetles in the genus Blepharida have evolved an effective counterdefense (Becerra 2003). Their larvae chew slowly through the leaf veins where the resin canals are located, releasing the pressure so gradually that the resin does not squirt from the plant. It often takes a beetle larva more than an hour to \u201cdisarm\u201d a leaf in this manner; once that job is done, the larva eats the leaf in 10\u201320 minutes. FIGURE 12.12 Plant Defense and Herbivore Counterdefense Some plants in the genus Bursera store toxic resin under high pressure in leaf canals. (A) When herbivores eat the leaves, they chew through these canals, causing the resin to be squirted up to 2 m from the leaf. (B) The larvae of some beetles in the genus Blepharida can disable this defense by chewing slowly through the canals, releasing the pressure in a gradual and harmless way. Evolution can influence plant\u2013herbivore interactions The variety of antiherbivore defenses seen in plants suggests that herbivores represent a strong source of selection on plant populations. Several recent studies have tested this claim. For example, in an experiment lasting five plant generations, Zt et al. (2012) tested the hypothesis that aphid herbivores cause evolution by natural selection in populations of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a small plant in the mustard family that is often used in laboratory experiments and genetic studies. They began their experiment with equal mixtures of 27 different Arabidopsis genotypes obtained from natural populations (FIGURE 12.13A). Typically, any one plant genotype expresses a subset of the full chemical arsenal of a species; collectively, however, the 27 genotypes used in this study were chosen to represent the full diversity of Arabidopsis chemical defenses. FIGURE 12.13 Does Herbivory Cause Evolution in Plant Populations? (A) This pie chart shows the equal proportions of 27 Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes used at the start of an experiment testing the hypothesis that herbivory by aphids caused evolution in experimental plant populations. Orange indicates plant genotypes that encode defensive compounds that have three-carbon side chains (3C defensive compounds), while green indicates plant genotypes that encode defensive compounds that have four-carbon side chains (4C defensive compounds). (B) The herbivory by aphids (two species were used, Brevicoryne brassicae and Lipaphis erysimi) caused the average mass of A. thaliana plants to increase from generation to generation, indicating an evolutionary response by plant populations. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (After T. Zt et al. 2012. Science 338: 116\u2013119.) Zt and colleagues found that feeding by aphids (two species were used, Brevicoryne brassicae and Lipaphis erysimi) reduced average plant size by up to 82% compared with a no-aphid (control) treatment, indicating that herbivory has a cost. However, they also found that the average sizes of plants exposed to the two species of aphids rose steadily over the course of the experiment (FIGURE 12.13B), suggesting that rapid evolution may have occurred in these populations.", "These increases in average plant size were associated with considerable changes in the genotypic composition of the plant populations. For example, ten plant genotypes were lost completely, and different aphid species selected for different plant genotypes. You can explore the extent to which different aphid species caused different plant genotypes to be favored by natural selection in ANALYZING DATA 12.1. Overall, Zt et al.\u2019s results provide clear experimental evidence that herbivores can cause evolution by natural selection in plant populations. ANALYZING DATA 12.1 As a graduate student, Tobias Zt (Zt et al. 2012)* examined how herbivory by aphids affected evolution by natural selection in plant populations. Six replicate populations of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana were established for each of three experimental treatments: a control (no aphids), herbivory by the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae, and herbivory by the aphid Lipaphis erysimi. Each replicate population was initiated from 27 natural genotypes, and plants were grown at 2 high densities (over 8,000 plants/m ) in each of the three treatments. At the start of the experiment, each replicate population contained equal proportions of the 27 plant genotypes (see Figure 12.13A). The experiment was conducted for five generations. At the end of the experiment, the frequencies of all surviving genotypes were determined. The table shows the average plant genotype frequencies at the end of the selection experiment; in addition to the genotypes shown here, genotypes 12, 14, and 21 occurred at low frequencies (less than 1.5%) in one or two treatments. Other genotypes not shown in the table did not survive. 1. In total, how many plant populations were established in this experiment? In each of these populations, what was the initial frequency of each plant genotype? 2. Did evolution occur in the control populations? If so, what factor or factors may have caused evolution by natural selection in these populations? Explain your answers. 3. Did evolution occur in the populations exposed to aphid herbivores? If so, what factor or factors may have caused evolution by natural selection in these populations? Explain your answers. 4. Compare results for the B. brassicae treatment with those for the L. erysimi treatment, focusing on whether selection favored genotypes that code for 3C or 4C defensive compounds (see Figure 12.13A). To what extent do the plant genotypes favored by selection differ between these two treatments?

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 12.3.1 Know how to model predator and prey population cycling. 12.3.2 Describe the factors that affect whether predator\u2013prey populations cycle. Predator\u2013Prey Population Cycles We introduced population cycles in Chapter 10 (see Figure 10.10), and in the Case Study at the opening of this chapter, we described the most famous one of all: the hare\u2013lynx cycle. Cyclic fluctuations in abundance are one of the most intriguing patterns in nature. After all, what could cause populations to change so considerably in size over time, yet in such a regular manner? We will return to the mechanisms that underlie the hare\u2013lynx cycle in the Case Study Revisited, but first we\u2019ll describe some insights into the causes of population cycles that have come from models, experiments, and field observations of predator\u2013prey interactions. Predator\u2013prey cycles can be modeled mathematically One way to evaluate possible causes of population cycles is to investigate the issue mathematically. In the 1920s, Alfred Lotka and Vito Volterra independently represented the dynamics of predator\u2013prey interactions with what is now called the Lotka\u2013Volterra predator\u2013prey model: (12.1) In these equations, N represents the number of prey individuals and P represents the number of predator individuals.", "The equation for change in the prey population over time (dN/dt) assumes that when predators are absent (P = 0), the prey population grows exponentially (i.e., dN/dt = rN, where r is the exponential growth rate; see Concept 11.1). When predators are present (P \u2260 0), the rate at which they kill prey depends in part on how frequently predators and prey encounter one another. This frequency is expected to increase with the number of prey (N) and with the number of predators (P), so a multiplicative term (NP) is used in the equation for dN/dt. The rate at which predators kill prey also depends on the efficiency with which predators capture prey; this capture efficiency is represented by the constant a, so the overall rate at which predators remove individuals from the prey population is aNP. Predators starve when there are no prey. Thus, the equation for change in the predator population over time (dP/dt) assumes that in the absence of prey (N = 0), the number of predators decreases exponentially with a mortality rate of m (i.e., dP/dt = \u2013mP). When prey are present (N \u2260 0), individuals are added to the predator population according to the number of prey that are killed (aNP) and the efficiency with which prey are converted into predator offspring (represented by the constant b). Thus, the rate at which individuals are added to the predator population is baNP. We can determine the relationship between prey and predator populations by solving for the population growth equation of each species (Equation 12.1) when they stop changing in size (or reach an equilibrium). This approach involves determining the zero population growth isocline for both prey and predator. The zero population growth isocline (or simply isocline) is the condition in which the population size of the prey (or the predator) does not change in size for a given number of predators (or prey). For prey, their abundance does not change when dN/dt = 0, which occurs when P = r/a. Similarly, the abundance of predators does not change when dP/dt = 0, which occurs when N = m/ba. Once we determine r/a and m/ba, we can then plot the isocline for both the prey (x axis) and predators (y axis) in graphical form. For the prey, the isocline will be a horizontal line originating at the value P = r/a (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.14A). This line represents the number of predators needed to keep the prey population from changing (or at equilibrium). If the predator abundance is below the line, the prey population will increase in size. If the predator abundance is above this line, then the prey population will decrease in size. Similarly, for the predator, the isocline will be a vertical line originating at the value N = m/ba (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.14B). This line represents the number of prey needed to maintain the predator population at zero growth. If the prey abundance is to the left of the line, the predator population will decrease in size. If the prey abundance is to the right of the line, then the predator population will increase in size. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.14 The Lotka\u2013Volterra Predator\u2013Prey Model Produces Population Cycles (A) Considering the prey population first, the abundance of prey does not change when dN/dt = 0, which occurs when P = r/a (see Equation 12.1). (B) Similarly, considering the predator population, the abundance of predators does not change when dP/dt = 0, which occurs when N = m/ba. Combining the results in parts (A) and (B) shows that the combined abundances of predator and prey populations (represented by the red vectors) have an inherent tendency to cycle (C). These cycles are shown here in two ways: (C) by plotting the abundances of predators and prey populations together, and (D) by plotting the abundance of both predators and prey versus time; the four inset diagrams in (D) show the combined effect of prey and predator abundance. In (D), note that the predator abundance curve is shifted one-fourth of a cycle behind the prey abundance curve. Combining the isoclines in Interactive Figure 12.14A,B shows that the isoclines cross at 90\u00b0 angles and divide the graph into four regions (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.14C). We can then follow the population growth of both predator and prey in each of these regions and find that both cycle over time, with the predators lagging behind the prey by one-fourth of a cycle (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.14D).", "Starting in the lower right corner, both prey and predator populations are growing but the increasing numbers of predators cause the prey abundance to level off and eventually reach zero population growth at its isocline. As the populations move into the upper right corner, predator abundance is still increasing but prey abundance is in decline. This causes the predator population to slow its growth and eventually reach its isocline. Now the prey population has declined to the point that the predator population cannot sustain itself and it declines as well (upper left corner). Finally, in the lower left corner, the prey population rebounds because of low predator numbers and begins to increase. This increase eventually leads to an increase in predators when the cycle starts all over again. The Lotka\u2013Volterra predator\u2013prey model thus yields an important result: it suggests that predator and prey populations have an inherent tendency to cycle because the abundance of one population is dependent on the abundance of the other population. The only condition in which the two populations do not cycle is when the predator and prey isoclines intersect. Here, by definition, both populations do not change in size. But the model also has a curious and unrealistic property: the amplitude of the cycle (the magnitude by which predator and prey numbers rise and fall) depends on the initial numbers of predators and prey. If the initial numbers shift even slightly, the amplitude of the cycle will change (see WEB EXTENSION 12.1 to find out what features of the model cause this change). More complex predator\u2013prey models (e.g., Harrison 1995) still produce cycles but do not show this unrealistic dependence on initial population sizes. The same general conclusion emerges from all of these models, however: predator\u2013prey interactions have the potential to cause population cycles. Predator\u2013prey cycles can be reproduced under laboratory conditions Can the cycling behavior of predator\u2013prey models be reproduced in the laboratory? Experiments show that such cycles can be difficult to achieve. When prey are easy for predators to find, predators typically drive prey to extinction, then go extinct themselves. Such was the case in C. B. Huffaker\u2019s experiments with the herbivorous six-spotted mite (Eotetranychus sexmaculatus) and the predatory mite, Typhlodromus occidentalis, that eats it (Huffaker 1958). In an initial set of experiments, Huffaker released 20 six-spotted mites on a tray with 40 positions, a few of which contained oranges, which these herbivorous mites could eat (FIGURE 12.15A). At first, the six-spotted mite population increased, in some cases reaching densities of 500 mites per orange. Eleven days after the start of the experiment, Huffaker released two predatory mites on the tray. Both prey and predator populations increased for a time, then declined to extinction (FIGURE 12.15B). FIGURE 12.15 In a Simple Environment, Predators Drive Prey to Extinction (A) C. B. Huffaker constructed a simple laboratory environment to test for conditions under which predators and prey would coexist and produce population cycles. He placed oranges in a few positions in an experimental tray to provide food for the herbivorous six-spotted mite (Eotetranychus sexmaculatus); the remainder of the positions contained inedible rubber balls. (B) When a predatory mite (Typhlodromus occidentalis) was introduced into this simple environment, it drove the prey to extinction, causing its own population to go extinct as well. (B after C. B. Huffaker. 1958. Hilgardia 27: 343\u2013383.) Huffaker observed that the prey persisted longer if the oranges were widely spaced\u2014presumably because it took the predators more time to find their prey. He tested this idea in a follow-up experiment in which he increased the complexity of the habitat in the following way. First, he added strips of Vaseline that partially blocked the predatory mites as they crawled from one orange to another. Then he placed small wooden posts in an upright position on some of the oranges; these posts allowed the six-spotted mites to take advantage of their ability to spin a silken thread and float on air currents over the Vaseline barriers. Thus, he altered the experimental environment to favor dispersal of the six-spotted mite and impede dispersal of the predatory mite. Under these conditions, the prey and the predators both persisted, illustrating a form of \u201chide-andseek\u201d dynamics that produced population cycles (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.16). The six-spotted mites dispersed to unoccupied oranges, where their numbers increased. Once the predators found an orange with six-spotted mites, they ate them all, causing both prey and predator numbers on that orange to plummet.", "In the meantime, however, some six-spotted mites dispersed to other portions of the experimental environment, where they increased in number until they too were discovered by the predators. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.16 Predator\u2013Prey Cycles in a Complex Environment Huffaker modified the simple laboratory environment shown in Figure 12.15 to create a more complex environment that aided the dispersal of the prey species but hindered the dispersal of the predator. Under these conditions, predator and prey populations coexisted, and their abundances cycled over time. The top panels show the locations within the environment of prey (shaded regions) and predators (circles) at five different points in time. (After C. B. Huffaker. 1958. Hilgardia 27: 343\u2013383.) Predator\u2013prey cycles can persist in the field Natural populations of predators and prey can coexist and show dynamics similar to those of Huffaker\u2019s mites. Clumps of mussels off the coast of California, for example, can be driven to local extinction by predatory sea stars. However, mussel larvae float in ocean currents and hence disperse more rapidly than the sea stars. As a result, the mussels continually establish new clumps that flourish until they are discovered by sea stars. Thus, like the six-spotted mites in Huffaker\u2019s experiments, the mussels persist because portions of their population escape detection by predators for a time. Field studies have also shown that predators influence population cycles in species such as southern pine beetles, voles, collared lemmings, snowshoe hares, and moose (Gilg et al. 2003; Turchin 2003). But predation is not the only factor that causes population cycles in these species. The supply of food plants for the herbivorous prey can also play an important role, and in some cases, social interactions are important as well. Thus, reality is not as simple as implied by the results of predator\u2013prey models (in which cycles are maintained purely by predator\u2013prey interactions). In the field, some population cycles may be caused by three-way feeding relationships\u2014by the effects of predators and prey on each other, coupled with the effects of prey and their food plants on each other. Whether their populations cycle or not, a variety of factors can prevent predators from driving prey to extinction. Such factors include habitat complexity and limited predator dispersal (as in Huffaker\u2019s mites), prey switching in predators (see Figure 12.6), spatial refuges (i.e., areas in which predators cannot hunt effectively), and evolutionary changes in the prey population (see WEB EXTENSION 12.2). In this section, we have seen how predation can alter the population size of predator and prey, resulting in population cycles. We turn next to how predators can have major effects on ecological communities. Self-Assessment 12.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] UNITED STATES \uf107JUMP TO \uf107QUICK SEARCH \uf107 CONCEPT 12.4 Predation can affect prey distribution and abundance, in some cases causing a shift from one community type to another. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 12.4.1 Understand how predators can affect prey distribution and abundance. 12.4.2 Describe how carnivores and herbivores can alter communities in dramatic ways. Effects of Predation on Communities A general theme that runs through this book is that ecological interactions can affect the distributions and abundances of species, affecting communities and ecosystems. The community-level consequences of predation can be profound, in some cases causing major shifts in the types of organisms found at a given location. All trophic interactions have the potential to reduce the growth, survival, or reproduction of the organisms that are eaten. These effects can be dramatic, as demonstrated in the case of a leaf-feeding beetle, Chrysolina quadrigemina, that rapidly reduced the density of Klamath weed, an invasive plant that is poisonous to livestock (FIGURE 12.17). Predators and parasitoids can also have dramatic effects when they are introduced as biological pest controls. In six cases, introductions of wasps that preyed on crop-eating insects decreased the herbivores\u2019 densities by more than 95%, thus greatly reducing the economic damage caused by those pests. FIGURE 12.17 A Beetle Controls a Noxious Rangeland Weed Klamath weed (Hypericum perforatum), which poisons cattle, once covered about 4 million acres of rangeland in the western United States. (A) This photograph, taken in 1949, shows a field completely covered with flowering Klamath weed. (B) The leaf-feeding beetle Chrysolina quadrigemina was introduced in 1951 in the hope of controlling Klamath weed. This graph tracks densities of beetles and of Klamath weed (as a percentage of plant cover) in plots after the beetle\u2019s introduction. (B after C. Huffaker and C. Kennett. 1959.", "A ten-year study of vegetational changes associated with biological control of Klamath weed. J Range Manage 12: 69\u201382. doi:10.2307/3894934. Material used with permission of the publisher.) Explain how a plant community might change after C. quadrigemina reduced the density of Klamath weed. As we\u2019ve seen, predators and herbivores can change the outcome of competition (see Concept 14.4), thereby affecting the distributions or abundances of competitor species. In particular, inferior competitors may increase in abundance when they are in the presence of a predator that decreases the abundance or performance of a dominant competitor. Paine (1974) found such a result: he showed that the removal of a predatory sea star (Pisaster) led to the local extinction of all large invertebrates but one, a mussel. The mussel was a dominant competitor that, in the absence of the sea star, drove all the other large invertebrates to local extinction. We turn now to examples of how trophic interactions can affect communities, first for carnivores and second for herbivores. Carnivores can alter communities in dramatic ways Anolis lizards are predators that eat a broad range of prey species, including spiders. Thomas Schoener and David Spiller studied the effects of lizard predators on their spider prey in the Bahamas. They selected 12 small islands and divided them into four groups of 3 islands each that were similar in size and vegetation. Initially, each group of 3 islands contained an island with lizards and 2 without. One of the latter 2 islands was then chosen at random to have two male and three female adult Anolis sagrei lizards introduced to it; the other island was left as a control where lizards were absent naturally. The introduced lizards greatly reduced the distributions and abundances of their spider prey (Schoener and Spiller 1996). Before the experiment began, the numbers of spider species and the overall densities of spiders were similar among the 8 islands that lacked lizards. By the end of the experiment, however, the introduction of lizards to 4 islands had reduced the numbers and densities of spider species to the levels found on the 4 islands where lizards were present naturally. The proportion of spider species that went extinct was nearly 13 times higher on islands where lizards were introduced than on islands without lizards (FIGURE 12.18). Similarly, the density of spiders was about 6 times higher on islands without lizards than on islands that had lizards (either naturally or experimentally). The introduction of lizards reduced the densities of both common and rare spider species, and most of the rare species went extinct. Similar experimental results have been obtained for beetles eaten by rodents and grasshoppers eaten by birds. FIGURE 12.18 Lizard Predators Can Drive Their Spider Prey to Extinction The experimental introduction of lizards to small islands in the Bahamas greatly increased the rate at which their spider prey became extinct. Error bars show one SE of the mean. The photograph shows Thomas Schoener on one of the study islands. (After T. W. Schoener and D. A. Spiller. 1996. Nature 381: 691\u2013694.) Schoener and Spiller\u2019s work on the effects of predatory lizard on spiders shows that the direct effects of a predator can greatly reduce the number of prey species in a community. In other cases, a predator that suppresses a dominant competitor can (indirectly) cause the number of species in a community to increase (as in the sea star and mussel example). Indirect effects of predators can also alter ecological communities by affecting the transfer of nutrients from one ecosystem to another, as the following study on arctic foxes illustrates. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, humans introduced arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) to some of the Aleutian islands off the coast of Alaska. Other islands remained fox-free, either because foxes were never introduced there or because the introductions failed. Taking advantage of this inadvertent large-scale experiment, Croll et al. (2005) determined that, on average, the introduction of foxes to an island reduced the density of breeding seabird populations nearly 100-fold. The decrease in seabird numbers, in turn, reduced the input of guano (bird feces) to an island from roughly 362 to 6 g per square meter. Seabird guano, which is rich in phosphorus and nitrogen, transfers nutrients from the ocean (where seabirds feed) to the land. By reducing the amount of guano that fertilized the (nutrient-limited) plant communities on the islands, the introduction of foxes caused dwarf shrubs and forbs to increase in abundance at the expense of grasses.", "As a result, the introduction of foxes had the unexpected effect of transforming the island communities from grasslands to communities characterized by small shrubs and forbs. Herbivores can alter communities in dramatic ways Herbivores can have equally large effects. Lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) migrate from their overwintering grounds in the United States to breed in salt marshes that border Canada\u2019s Hudson Bay. During the summer, the geese graze on marsh grasses and sedges. Historically, although the geese removed considerable plant matter, their presence benefited the marshes by adding nitrogen, which is a limiting resource for plant growth. As they eat, the geese defecate every few minutes, thereby adding nitrogen to the soil (nitrogen moves into the soil from goose feces more rapidly than it does from the decomposing leaves of marsh plants). The plants absorb the added nitrogen, which allows them to grow rapidly after being grazed. Overall, low to intermediate levels of grazing by geese lead to increased plant growth (Jefferies et al. 2003). For example, net primary production (NPP, measured as the amount of new aboveground plant growth) was higher in lightly grazed plots than in ungrazed plots (FIGURE 12.19A). FIGURE 12.19 Snow Geese Can Benefit or Decimate Marshes (A) When lightly grazed (for a single 15- to 90minute episode) by snow goose goslings, salt marsh plants increased their subsequent cumulative production of new biomass compared with no grazing, because of the nitrogen added by the defecating geese. (B) Heavy grazing by high densities of snow geese can convert salt marshes to mudflats, as seen by comparing this small remnant of marsh (protected from geese) with the surrounding mudflat (a former marsh that was grazed heavily by geese). (A after D. S. Hik and R. L. Jefferies. 1990. J Ecol 78: 180\u2013195.) About 40 years ago, however, the situation described in the previous paragraph started to change. Beginning around 1970, lesser snow goose densities increased exponentially. This increase probably occurred because increased crop production near their overwintering sites provided the geese with a superabundant supply of food. The ensuing high densities of geese no longer benefited marsh plants. The geese completely removed the vegetation, drastically changing the community of marsh plant species (FIGURE 12.19B). Of an original 54,800 hectares (135,400 acres) of intertidal marsh in the Hudson Bay region, geese are estimated to have destroyed 35% (19,200 ha or 47,400 acres). An additional 30% (16,400 ha or 40,500 acres) of the original marsh has been badly damaged by the geese. Controlled hunts (from 1999 on) have slowed goose population growth; this strategy may eventually lead to marsh recovery. In The Origin of Species, Darwin (1859) noted the speed with which Scotch fir trees replaced heaths after regions of heathland were enclosed to prevent grazing by cattle. When he observed heathlands grazed by cattle, \u201con looking closely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings and little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard \u2026 I counted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, judging from the rings of growth, had during 26 years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had failed.\u201d Darwin concluded that seeds dispersed from trees located at the edge of the heath would germinate and overgrow the heath if not for grazing by cattle. Thus, the very existence of the heath community in that area depended on grazing. Herbivores can also have pronounced effects in aquatic environments. The golden apple snail was introduced into Taiwan from South America in 1980 for local consumption and export. The snail escaped from cultivation and spread rapidly through Southeast Asia (FIGURE 12.20). Its spread caught the attention of researchers and government officials because it proved to be a serious pest of rice. The snail has also been found in Hawaii, the southern United States, and Australia and is expected to reach Bangladesh and India (Carlsson et al. 2004). FIGURE 12.20 The Geographic Spread of an Aquatic Herbivore Since its introduction to Taiwan in 1980, the golden apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata) has spread rapidly across parts of Southeast Asia, threatening rice crops and native plant species. The map shows the regions the snail had occupied by 1985 and by 2002. (After J. O. L. Carlsson et al. 2004. Ecology 85: 1575\u20131580.)", "Most freshwater snails eat algae, but the golden apple snail prefers to eat aquatic plants, including those that float on the water surface and those that attach themselves to the bottom. However, as mentioned in Concept 12.1, golden apple snails are generalists, and if plants are not available, they can survive on algae and detritus. As a result, these snails are resilient and hard to get rid of. As a first step toward assessing how the snail had affected natural communities, Nils Carlsson and colleagues surveyed 14 wetlands in Thailand with varying densities of snails. They found that wetland communities with high densities of snails were characterized by few plants, high nutrient concentrations in the water, and a high biomass of algae and other phytoplankton (FIGURE 12.21). FIGURE 12.21 A Snail Herbivore Alters Aquatic Communities Nils Carlsson and colleagues measured characteristics of 14 natural wetlands in Thailand that differed in their densities of golden apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata). (A) Percentage of the wetlands covered by edible plant species. (B) Concentrations of phosphorus in the water. (C) Chlorophyll a concentrations (an indicator of phytoplankton biomass). Note the log scale in (B) and (C). Experiments conducted separately indicated that all the trends shown here could have been caused by the snail. (After J. O. L. Carlsson et al. 2004. Ecology 85: 1571\u20131580.) In (B), compare the average total phosphorus concentration in wetlands without snails with that in wetlands with snails. To test whether the trends observed in their survey could have been caused by the snail, Carlsson et al. (2004) placed 24 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1-m enclosures in a wetland in which snail densities were low. To each enclosure, they added about 420 g of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), one of the most abundant plant species in many Southeast Asian wetlands. Next, they added 0, 2, 4, or 6 snails to the enclosures; there were six replicates of each of the four snail density treatments. Carlsson and colleagues then measured the effects of the snails on plant biomass and phytoplankton biomass. Water hyacinth biomass increased in the enclosures where no snails were present but decreased in all the other enclosures. At the highest snail density tested (6 2 snails/m ), phytoplankton biomass increased. The results of the survey and the experiment concur in suggesting that the golden apple snail can have an enormous effect on wetland communities, causing a shift from a wetland with clear water and many plants to a wetland with turbid water, few plants, high nutrient concentrations, and high phytoplankton biomass. It is likely that this shift occurs because the snails suppress plants directly (by eating them) and because they release the nutrients they obtain from the plants into the water, thus providing improved growth conditions for algae and other phytoplankton. CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION CLIMATE CHANGE AND SPECIES INTERACTIONS Climate affects the physiology of organisms, the distribution and abundance of populations, and the outcome of interactions between species (see Chapter 2). As a result, changes in climate are expected to have wide-ranging effects on species interactions and thus ecological communities (Gilman et al. 2010). For example, in a review of over 600 articles, Tylianakis et al. (2008) found that climate change affected the strength and frequency of a wide range of ecological interactions (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.22). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.22 Climate Change Alters Species Interactions This diagram provides an overview of a literature review of how climate change is predicted to alter species interactions in terrestrial systems, including some with parasites, in studies that tested for the effects of increased temperature, changing rainfall patterns, or increased frequency of extreme weather events. Arrows with solid outlines indicate nutrient and energy flow; double-headed arrows with dotted outlines indicate competition. A + or \u2013 symbol within an arrow indicates benefit or cost to each participant. (After J. M. Tylianakis et al. 2008. Ecol Lett 11: 1351\u20131363.) Collectively, these results suggest that species interactions are likely to complicate efforts to predict how climate change will affect predator\u2013prey relationships. For example, although the direct effects of climate on predators or herbivores might suggest that these species would extend their ranges in response to climate change, competition with other species could prevent this from occurring. If competition had this effect, then interactions with other organisms would have caused the actual distribution of a species under climate change to be smaller than its potential distribution (see Figure 4.3). In other circumstances, however, a very different result might be observed.", "For example, as discussed in Concept 25.2, changes in climate can lead to the formation of new types of communities that contain collections of species that differ from those found in current communities. In such a new community type, a predator might interact with new prey or hosts and hence might expand its geographic range farther than would otherwise be expected. In this case, over time, the actual distribution of the predator would become larger than its (predicted) potential distribution because of changes in community structure that resulted from climate change. Overall, the results of Tylianakis et al. (2008) and Gilman et al. (2010) indicate that ecological interactions will influence how future climate change will affect predator\u2013prey interactions and many other species associated with these interactions. Self-Assessment 12.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Snowshoe Hare Cycles What is the cause of snowshoe hare population cycles? As we saw in the Case Study, neither the food supply hypothesis nor the predation hypothesis alone can explain these cycles. However, much of the variation in hare densities can be explained when we combine these two hypotheses\u2014and add even more realism with a few new twists. Charles Krebs and colleagues (1995) performed an experiment designed to determine whether food, predation, or their interaction caused population cycles in hares. The sheer scope of the experiment was impressive: the experimental treatments were performed in seven 1 \u00d7 1-km blocks of forest located in an isolated region of Canadian wilderness. Three blocks were not manipulated and were used as controls. Food for hares was added to two blocks (the \u201c+Food\u201d treatment). In 1987, an electric fence 4 km in length was constructed to exclude predators from one block of forest (the \u201c\u2013Predators\u201d treatment). In the following year, a second 4-km fence was built; in the block of forest enclosed by this fence, food was added and predators were excluded (the \u201c+Food/\u2013Predators\u201d treatment). The two fences (with a total length of 8 km) had to be monitored daily during the winter, when temperatures could plummet to \u201345\u00baC (\u201349\u00baF); this monitoring required so much time that the researchers could not replicate either fenced treatment. The survival rates and densities of hares in each block of forest were observed for 8 years. Compared with the control blocks, hare densities were considerably higher in the +Food, the \u2013Predators, and the +Food/\u2013Predators blocks (FIGURE 12.23). The most pronounced effects were seen in the +Food/\u2013 Predators block, where, on average, hare densities were 11 times those in the control blocks. The strong effect of jointly adding food and removing predators suggests that hare population cycles are influenced by both food supply and predation. FIGURE 12.23 Both Predators and Food Influence Hare Density (A) This aerial photograph shows one of the 1-km2 snowshoe hare study sites described in the text. (B) Average hare densities relative to their densities in control blocks of forest. (B after C. J. Krebs et al. 1995. Science 269: 1112\u20131115.) This conclusion was supported by results from a mathematical model that examined feeding relationships across three levels: vegetation (the hares\u2019 food), hares, and predators (King and Schaffer 2001). Field data were used to estimate the model parameters, and the model\u2019s predictions were compared with the actual results for Krebs et al.\u2019s four treatments. Although the match was not exact, there was reasonably good agreement between the model and the results, again suggesting that both food and predators influence hare population cycles (FIGURE 12.24). FIGURE 12.24 A Vegetation\u2013Hare\u2013Predator Model Predicts Hare Densities Accurately The model assumes that hare population densities are influenced by feeding relationships across three levels: vegetation (the hares\u2019 food), hares, and predators. Parameters for the model were estimated from field data. When the investigators compared the predictions of their model with the experimental results of Krebs et al. (1995), they found a reasonably good match between (A) the experimental results and (B) the model\u2019s predictions. (After A. A. King and W. M. Schaffer. 2001. Ecology 82: 814\u2013830.) While much progress has been made in the study of snowshoe hare population cycles, some questions remain. We do not yet have a complete understanding of the factors that cause hare populations across broad regions of Canada to cycle in synchrony. Lynx can move from 500 to 1,100 km.", "If lynx move from areas with scarce prey to areas with abundant prey on a scale of hundreds of kilometers, their movements might be enough to cause geographic synchrony in hare cycles. In addition, large geographic regions in Canada experience a similar climate, and that may also affect the synchrony of hare population cycles. Finally, the Krebs et al. experiment provided a test of whether the addition of food or the removal of predators (or both) could stop the hare population cycle. Although hare densities declined less in the +Food/\u2013 Predators block than in the control blocks, they did decline at the usual point in the hare cycle. Why did the +Food/\u2013Predators treatment fail to stop the cycle? One possible reason is that the fences excluded lynx and coyotes but did not exclude owls, goshawks, and other birds of prey. Collectively, these bird predators accounted for about 40% of snowshoe hare deaths and thus could have contributed to the onset of the decline phase of the hare cycle in the +Food/\u2013Predators block. Next we\u2019ll explore another possible explanation: stress caused by fear of predator attack. CONNECTIONS in NATURE FROM FEAR TO HORMONES TO POPULATION DYNAMICS Predators not only affect their prey directly (by killing them) but also influence them indirectly (e.g., by altering their foraging behavior, as described for elk in Concept 8.2). Boonstra et al. (1998) tested snowshoe hares for another possible indirect effect of predators: fear. Their results hint at a fascinating way in which predation might influence the decline phase of the hare cycle. When humans are in a dangerous situation, we often engage a set of fight-or-flight responses that can produce rapid and sometimes astonishing results (such as the ability to move unusually heavy weights). Snowshoe hares have a similar stress response. A hormone called cortisol stimulates the release of stored glucose into the blood, where it becomes available to the muscles; cortisol also suppresses body functions that are not essential for immediate survival, including growth, reproduction, and immune system function (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.25). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 12.25 The Stress Response The Stress Response When an animal is stressed, the hypothalamus releases a hormone called CRF, which stimulates a cascade of reactions that affect a number of body processes. (After R. Boonstra et al. 1998. Ecol Monogr 79: 371\u2013394.) The stress response works well for immediate, or acute, forms of stress, such as an attack by a predator. Energy is provided to the muscles rapidly to help the animal deal with the threatening situation. Shortly thereafter, the response is shut down by a negative feedback process. The stress response works less well for long-term, or chronic, stress, however. In such cases, the negative feedback signals are weak, and the stress response is maintained for a long time. A failure to \u201cturn off\u201d the stress response can have harmful effects, including decreased growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to disease. Collectively, such effects can reduce a population\u2019s survival and reproductive rates. When predators are abundant, as we have seen, they can cause up to 95% of snowshoe hare deaths. At such times, hares are at increased risk of encountering predators; hares would also be likely to see or hear predators killing other hares and to find the remains of hares that had been killed by predators. Reasoning that the fear provoked by such events could trigger chronic stress, Boonstra and colleagues measured the hormonal and immune responses of hares exposed in the field to high versus low numbers of predators. During the decline phase of the hare cycle (when hares are exposed to many predators), cortisol levels increased, blood glucose levels increased, reproductive hormone levels decreased, and overall body condition worsened\u2014as expected for hares experiencing chronic stress (see Interactive Figure 12.25). Further experiments showed that a predator-induced increase in cortisol levels led to a drop in the number and size of offspring produced by female snowshoe hares (Sheriff et al. 2009). In addition, female hares with high cortisol levels (caused by exposure to predators) transmitted high cortisol levels to their offspring, who also had reduced reproductive rates (Sheriff et al. 2010). Overall, chronic stress induced by predation may help to explain some of the puzzling observations mentioned in the Case Study, including the drop in birth rates during the decline phase of the hare cycle and the slow rebound of hare numbers after predator numbers plummet.", "If future studies confirm the results of Boonstra et al. (1998) and Sheriff et al. (2009, 2010), their work will provide a clear example of how predation risk can alter the physiology of individual prey, thereby changing prey population dynamics and influencing predator\u2013prey cycles."]}
