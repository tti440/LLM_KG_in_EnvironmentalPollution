In particular, the discussion often focuses on how a particular part of the troposphere or stratosphere deviates in quality from a norm. Popular perceptions of air pollution are driven largely by fear. After all, the most notorious air pollution events have often been associated with dramatic atmospheric visuals, such as smoke billowing from industrial stacks into the air, smog hangingoverlargecities,deadtreesfrom acid rain, and disasters with plumes of contaminants reaching upward and outward into the troposphere, the lowest atmospheric layer where humans and other organisms reside. Other mental pictures have been more abstract, yet just as dramatic, e.g. increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the troposphere or the so-called \u201chole\u201d in the ozone layer higher up in atmosphere, the stratosphere. Like many perceptions, those of the atmosphere are frequently correct, but incomplete. For example, the atmosphere is studied at every scale from planetary to molecular. The portion of atmosphere infuencing a single cell organism may be a few cubic nanometers in volume, whereas the atmosphere infuencing and being infuenced by biome shift is planetary in scale, with pollution encompassing many cubic kilometers. Indeed, much of a human being\u2019s exposure to air pollutants occurs in comparatively small parcels of the atmosphere, especially in the home. These small compartments, known as microenvironments, are indeed subdivisions of the atmosphere. In fact, humans are frequently exposed at highest rates to many of the most harmful air pollutants in what is known as a \u201cpersonal cloud\u201d.1 1.2 PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERE By dry volume, 99.997% of the atmosphere consists of four gases, molecular nitrogen and oxygen (N2 and O2, respectively), argon (Ar), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Chemically, Ar is inert (nonreactive) since it is a noble gas. The other three compounds are also very stable and nonreactive under most atmospheric conditions of temperature and pressure, so they remain very stable components of the atmosphere. Approximately 99% of the mass of the atmosphere lies within 50 kilometers (km) of the earth\u2019s surface, i.e. in the troposphere and stratosphere. This is where the air pollution occurs. The earth\u2019s atmospheric temperature varies with altitude (Figure 1.1), as does the density of the substances comprising the atmosphere.2 The earth is warmed when incoming solar radiation is absorbed at or near the earth\u2019s surface and reradiated at longer electromagnetic wavelengths (infrared). In general, the air grows progressively less dense with increasing altitude moving upward from the troposphere through the stratosphere and the chemosphere to the ionosphere. In the upper reaches of the ionosphere, the gaseous molecules are few and far between as compared with the troposphere.

All of the polygons shown in the diagram will exist, but their shapes and slopes of the polygon sides and points of phase changes will differ. The vaporeliquid boundary line temperature is the boiling point and the pressure is the vapor pressure. The line between the vapor and solid phases is known as the sublimation point (i.e. a phase change from solid to gas, or gas to solid, without frst becoming a liquid). The liquidesolid boundary line temperature is freezing and melting point. Cpressure and Ctemperature are the pressure and temperature, respectively, of a fuid at its critical point; i.e. the point at which a gas cannot be liquefed by an increase of pressure. plasmas have no defnite volume or shape since the ions and electrons move freely. Air pollution terminology generally breaks matter down into two phases, particulate and gas. Particulates and aerosols are generally synonymous terms in air pollution literature, i.e. liquid and solid phase. They are distinguished from gases and vapors. a For air pollutants, gases are distinguished from vapors in that they exist entirely within the vapor phase of Figure 1.2 under environmental conditions, i.e. not under extremely high pressure and extremely low temperature.", "That is, gases are those that would be in the physical gaseous state under conditions ranging from the arctic temperatures to the largest pressures found in the atmosphere. At higher orders important to air pollution, systems include the \u201cecosystem\u201d and the \u201corganism\u201d ordering systems. These consist of physical phases and order. For example, ecosystems ordering systems include producereconsumeredecomposer, predatoreprey, and individualeassociationecommunity. Ordering within organisms includes celletissueeorganesystem. Thermodynamic systems are classifed into two major types: closed and open. Both exist and are important in the environment. A closed system does not allow material to enter or leave the system (engineers refer to a closed system as a \u201ccontrol mass\u201d). The open system allows material to enter and leave the systems (such a system is known as a control volume). Another thermodynamic concept is that of the \u201cproperty\u201d. As will be covered in more detail in Section 1.4 discussions of fuid properties of contaminants, a property is some trait or attribute that can be used to describe a system and to differentiate that system from the others. A property must be able to be stated at a specifc time independently of its value at any other time and unconstrained by the process that induced the condition (state). An intensive property is independent of the system\u2019s mass (such as pressure and temperature). An extensive property is proportional to the mass of the system (such as density or volume). Dividing the value of an extensive property by the system\u2019s mass gives a \u201cspecifc property\u201d, such as speci\ufb01c heat, speci\ufb01c volume, or speci\ufb01c gravity. The thermodynamic term for the description of the change of a system from one state (e.g. equilibrium) to another is known as a \u201cprocess\u201d. Processes may be reversible or irreversible; they may be adiabatic (no gain or loss of heat, so all energy transfers occur through work interactions) or non-adiabatic (See Chapter 2). Other processes includeisometric (constant volume), isothermal (constant temperature), isobaric (constant pressure), isentropic (constant entropy), and isenthalpic (constant enthalpy). This discussion introduces the concept of phase partitioning, which is covered in detail in Chapter 18. Partitioning simply means the substance will exist in one or more physical phases. An important partitioning coeffcient for air pollution is Henry\u2019s Law, which states that the partial pressure of a compound can be related to its equilibrium concentration in a dilute aqueous solution through a constant of proportionality. In other words, a varying number of molecules will fnd their way into the air, even though most of the molecules remain in the water, i.e. dissolved in water. Even a small amount of partitioning can account for large amounts of vapor phase compounds in the atmosphere. One of the earth\u2019s nicknames is the \u201cwater planet\u201d, so the predominant vapor in the air is, not surprisingly, water vapor. In the atmosphere, above their temperature of condensation, vapor molecules act just like permanent gas molecules in the air. Below its condensation a Although the plasma is the most common state of matter in the universe, plasmas are not often mentioned in air pollution. Perhaps they should be since fres are plasmas, which are a major source of pollutants. Lightning produces plasmas, a major source of nitrogen exchange between the earth\u2019s surface and the atmosphere. The upper portion (85e600 km altitude) of the atmosphere, i.e. the ionosphere, is the plasma resulting from solar radiation. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 1.

This phenomenon gives rise to fog or mist in the air and condensed liquid water on cool surfaces exposed to air. The quantity of water vapor in the air varies greatly from almost complete dryness to supersaturation, i.e. between 0 and 4% by weight (see Table 1.2).", "If Table 1.1 is compiled on a wet air basis at a time when the water vapor concentration is 31,200 parts by volume per million parts by volume of wet air (Table 1.2), the concentration of condensable organic vapors is seen to be so low compared to that of water vapor that for all practical purposes the difference between wet air and dry air is its water vapor content. Gaseous composition in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 is expressed as parts per million by volumedppm (vol.) or ppmV. (When a concentration is expressed simply as ppm, it is unclear whether a volume or weight basis is intended.) To avoid confusion caused by different units, air pollutant concentrations in this book are generally expressed as micrograms per cubic meter of air (mgm 3) at an environmental temperature (e.g. 20 or 25 C) and 760 mmHg, i.e. in metric units. To convert from units of ppm (vol.) to mgm 3, it is assumed that the ideal gas law is accurate under ambient conditions. A generalized formula for the conversion at 25 C and 760 mmHg is: 1 l pollutant 1 ppm \u00f0vol: \u00de pollutant \u00bc 106 l air 1 \u00f01l=22:4\u00de MW 106 mg gm (1.1) \u00bc 106l 298K=273K 103m3 l1 3 \u00bc 40:9 MW mgm ppm (vol.) mgm L3 to ppm to mgm L3, (vol.) , multiply Pollutant multiply by by (3 10L3) Ammonia (NH3) 695 1.44 Carbon dioxide 1800 0.56 Carbon monoxide 1150 0.87 Chlorine 2900 0.34 Ethylene 1150 0.87 Hydrogen chloride 1490 0.67 Hydrogen fuoride 820 1.22 Hydrogen sulfde 1390 0.72 Methane (carbon) 655 1.53 Nitrogen dioxide 1880 0.53 Nitric oxide 1230 0.81 Ozone 1960 0.51 Peroxyacetyl nitrate 4950 0.20 Sulfur dioxide 2620 0.38 where MW equals molecular weight (g mol 1). For convenience, conversion units for common pollutants are shown in Table 1.3. The rationale for Eqn (1.1) is discussed in Section 1.4.1. Extra care must be taken for conversions of pollutant classes. For example, the units of the air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), can be converted using Eqn (1.1). However, when addressing smog and ozone in the troposphere, the oxides of nitrogen, not NO2 specifcally, are the major concern. The concentrations of NO2 and nitric oxide (NO) are commonly expressed in ppm (vol.) and expressed as a sum, known as \u201cNOx\u201d. Thus, the conversion from ppm (vol.) to mgm 3 must be carried out separately for NO2 and NO before the two species are added together. 1.3 ATMOSPHERIC CHEMICAL CONCENTRATIONS As mentioned, molecular nitrogen (N2), molecular oxygen (O2), water (H2O), argon (Ar), and carbon dioxide (CO2) make up most of the atmosphere (Tables 1.1 and 1.2). Most other compounds and substances exist only in trace amounts. Note that of the remaining most abundant gases by volume, all but two are also quite nonreactive; the exceptions being hydrogen (H2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Neon (Ne), helium (He), krypton (Kr), and I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 1.3 ATMOSPHERIC CHEMICAL CONCENTRATIONS xenon (Xe) are noble gases; and methane (CH4) is quite stable under atmospheric conditions. Hydrogen is highly reactive, but exists only in trace amounts in the lower troposphere. Its relative abundance, i.e. seventh most abundant gas in dry air, is mainly because of the high energy conditions in the upper atmosphere (altitude > 500 km), where the solar radiation dissociates molecules of H2O, CH4, and H2, producing H atoms. Since concentrations of H2O and CH4 molecules are highly variable in the atmosphere, the amount of H produced in this manner is also highly variable. Incidentally, the same is true for ozone (O3) which is also produced photochemically in the upper atmosphere (15e50 km altitude) and why there is a distinctive O3 layer in the stratosphere. This is also the reason that atomic oxygen, which is almost nonexistent in the lower layers, is also much more abundant in the upper atmosphere.3 It should be noted from a mass balance perspective that nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) exist in numerous chemical compounds in the atmosphere. As will be discussed in detail in Chapter 22, nitrogen\u2019s compounds include a number of air pollutants, especially nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and many essential compounds, e.g. nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia. However, N2 is the dominant atmospheric N-constituent, i.e. 3.9 1018 kilograms (kg) being six orders of magnitude larger than the second, N2O. The movement to and from the atmosphere, i.e. fux, of N in its many species is massive.", "The fux of N2 between the earth\u2019s surface and the atmosphere is about 1011 kg annually.3 Unlabelled image Oxygen is a part of myriad compounds, including most organic compounds. Photosynthesis provides most of the atmospheric O2, predominant from terrestrial plants and aquatic microbes, especially phytoplankton (see Figure 1.3).3 Using light energy from incoming solar radiation, photosynthesis converts vapor phase CO2 and water into solid phase carbohydrates and O2. Although there are numerous intermediate steps, the reaction is summarized as: CO2 D H2O D sunlight / CH2O D O2 (1.2) In the upper altitudes, water vapor and N2O undergo photodissociation via UV solar radiation, additional O2 is formed providing between 1 and 2 percent of atmospheric oxygen. Respiration is the chemical counterpart to photosynthesis, i.e. the transport of O2 from the atmosphere into cells and the transport of CO2 away from cells into the atmosphere. Respiration is the process by which organisms use O2 for energy and to build cells, with CO2 as the FIGURE 1.3 Photosynthesis and respiration processes in a tree. Note that there are several sites at which O2,H2O, and CO2 are exchanged, both above and below ground. Although photosynthesis is the dominant process for plant life, there is also respiration (i.e. dark respiration) in the absence of sunlight.

Conversely, air breathing organisms come in many forms, but the basic respiration chemistry is similar. Humans and other mammals, as well as birds, reptiles for their entire lives, and amphibians for parts of their lives use lungs to exchange the O2 in the air mixture. Fish similarly use gills to exchange the O2 in the water mixture (i.e. dissolved oxygen). Other organisms in air and water use similar mechanisms to extract O2 for respiration. The only exceptions are the anaerobic organisms, which use electron acceptors other than O2. These electron acceptors include sulfate \u00f0SO2 \u00de, nitrate 4 \u00f0NO3 \u00de, sulfur (S), and fumarate (HO2CCH]CHCO2H). Carbon (C) is the distinguishing element for organic compounds, i.e. those with CeC and/or HeC bonds, but it is also part of many inorganic compounds, including CO2 and carbon monoxide (CO). Organic compounds include those that comprise cells in organisms and other biochemical substances. Carbon is a major constituent of many air pollutants, including CO, PM in various forms, as well as many of the most toxic air pollutants, e.g. dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and many pesticides. Of recent interest are greenhouse gases, of which, most are carbon compounds, e.g. CO2,CH4, and chlorofuorocarbons (HCHs). Thus, C, O, N, and H are the principal elements involved in air pollution. Several of the abundant compounds in the atmosphere are greenhouse gases, most notably CO2,CH4, and N2O. Indeed, H2O is also a greenhouse gas since, by defnition, it traps heat in the atmosphere. That is, the portion of the incoming solar radiation that is reradiated as infrared wavelengths is either trapped by greenhouse gases or is allowed to leave the atmosphere. In particular, as the most abundant greenhouse gas, CO2 has been the focus of much recent interest in both scientifc communities and the public at large. The amount has steadily increased in recent decades (see Figure 1.4). Methane (CH4), the most abundant organic molecule in the atmosphere, also increased in concentration dramatically after the industrial revolution, but is no longer increasing. It is produced from anaerobic processes. These include agriculture, e.g. livestock and rice paddies; landflls; fossil fuel extraction and gas distribution; and biomass burning.3 These anthropogenic sources produce about the same amounts of CH4 as natural sources, which include reduced, anoxic portions of wetlands and portions of ecosystems undergoing organic decomposition. CH4 is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, absorbing 22 times energy per unit mass. However, at about nine years, its atmospheric residence could be far less than that of CO2, which is estimated to range between 5 and 100 years (see Table 1.4). No unique lifetime can be defned for CO2 given the varying rates of uptake by different FIGURE 1.4 Monthly mean atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (ppm by volume) at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii.", "The CO2 data (red curve) are presented as the mole fraction in dry air, on Mauna Loa constitute the longest record of direct measurements in the atmosphere. The black curve represents the seasonally corrected data. Data are reported as a dry mole fraction defned as the number of molecules of CO2 divided by the number of molecules of dry air multiplied by one million (ppm).

More than 90% of the degradation of methane is by oxidation, mainly by reactions with the hydroxyl radical in the stratosphere which accounts for more than 90% of methane loss. The equilibria and fate of CO2,CH4, and other carbon compounds are discussed in detail in Chapter 21. It is important to note that the gases listed in the tables vary in concentration throughout the atmosphere. Each gas mixes in the air at different altitudes, i.e. they have unique mixing ratios (see Figure 1.5). The mixing ratio is the number density of the gas divided by number density of all gases in dry air. Only N2 and the noble gases have nearly constant mixing ratios below 100 km, given their chemical stability. Since most CH4 and N2Oare destroyed at the stratosphere, their mixing ratios start decreasing at about 20 km altitude. The mixing ratio of water vapor, with a highly temperature-dependent concentration, decreases sharply with altitude and decreasing temperatures in the troposphere. The stratospheric O3 layer is also apparent at 35 km from Figure 1.5. The trace amounts of thousands of compounds in the atmosphere include both essential compounds and air pollutants. The physics, chemistry, and biology of these substances comprise the bulk of scientifc interest in air pollution. I.

Essential compounds include micronutrients needed by plant life and other organisms in the ecosystems. However, even essential substances can become pollutants in the wrong concentrations. Thus, expression of chemical concentration is crucial to understanding atmospheric science generally and the fundamentals of air pollution specifcally. Constituents of air are expressed as densities. Many earth and atmospheric science texts and references express the larger constituents (i.e. N2,O2, and H2O) in percent volume of air. Thus, this is a unitless expression, i.e. volume of constituent per volume of air. However, smaller air constituents, including all air pollutants, are expressed either as a number density, i.e. molecules per unit volume, such as molecules cm 3; or as a mass density, such as mgm 3. An example of a number density expression of an air pollutant 1012 would be 1.2 formaldehyde (CH2O) molecules per cm3 \u00bc 1.2 1018 molecules per m3. Unitless density (e.g. parts per billion [ppb]) and mass density are the most common expressions of air pollutant concentration. A number density can be converted to mass density by the use of gram molecular weight (mole) per volume.", "Avogadro\u2019s constant, the number of constituent particles (molecules or atoms), informs us about the number of moles. That is, 1 mole 1023 (mol) of any particle contains 6.022 molecules. Thus, since we know the number density of formaldehyde, we can fnd its mass density from its number of moles per volume: &#1;&#3; 3 1:2 1018 CH2O molecules per m O6:022 63 1023 moleculesz2 10 mol m Therefore, the number density can be converted to a mass density. In this case, the number density of 1.2 1012 formaldehyde (CH2O) molecules per cm3 is the same as the mass density 2 10 6 mol m 3 or 2 micromoles (mmol) per cublic meter. The 2 mmol formaldehyde per m3 of air can be converted to the more common units of mgm 3. The atomic mass of carbon (C) is 12, hydrogen (H) is 1, and oxygen (O) is 16, so the atomic mass of CH2O is 30. Thus, 1 mol CH2O \u00bc 30 g \u00bc 3 105 mg. Since 1 mmol \u00bc 10 6 mol, then 2 mmol formaldehyde \u00bc 2 30 10 6g \u00bc 6 10 5g \u00bc 60 mg. Expressed as a mass density, 2 mmol per m3 CH2O in air is the same as a chemical concentration of 60 mgm 3. Mass I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 1. THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE density is more commonly used than number density to express air pollutant concentrations. However, the expression of mass density is highly variable, especially with regard to standards and regulations. Even in the same standards, different units are used (e.g. ppb and mgm 3). 1.3.1 Chemical Concentration The chemical concentrations in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are mean atmospheric concentrations. Concentration can be expressed as combinations of mass and volume, usually volume per volume or mass per volume. Note that the tables include at the bottom what would appear to be a small amount of compounds under the classifcation of \u201corganic vapors\u201d. Actually, this seemingly small group of compounds comprises a very large amount of air pollutants. It includes any compound with at least one carbon-to-carbon or carbon-to-hydrogen bond that emits molecules into the atmosphere. These molecules are emitted as vapors. Generally, the higher the vapor pressure of a substance, the more of the molecules of that substance fnds its way to the atmosphere. This exchange among solid, liquid, and gas phases, including vaporization, is discussed in detail in Chapter 18. Indeed, formaldehyde would be included among the organic vapors that in total comprise about 0.02 ppm. However, formaldehyde concentrations are highly variable, depending on the unique environmental conditions where it exists. There is both spatial and temporal variability, such as the differences in ambient concentrations in various urban areas and seasonal differences in the same urban area (Figure 1.6). For example, formaldehyde concentrations in urban areas are generally higher in summer; whereas, the concentrations of benzene, another organic vapor, are generally higher in the winter (Figure 1.7). Atmospheric concentrations can vary even more in different microenvironments than in the ambient air (see Table 1.5). Formaldehyde is not unique. All other organic vapor concentrations also vary signifcantly in different parts of the atmosphere; as do inorganic compounds, for that matter. Thus, although the total amount of substances under the category \u201corganic vapors\u201d is somewhat constant on a global atmospheric scale, it is highly variable in the ambient air (e.g. much higher concentrations near a wood processing facility) and even more variable between ambient and indoor air, as indicated in Table 1.5. The variability in chemical concentrations can be even greater among various types of indoor environments. For example, the two types of homes listed in Table 1.5 have very different mean and maximum concentrations, with manufactured homes much higher than conventional homes. This likely indicates that manufactured homes include sources of formaldehyde that are greater than those of conventional homes, e.g. higher ratios of formaldehyde-containing building materials to non-formaldehyde-containing materials in manufactured homes. It may also be the result of smaller air exchange rates in manufactured homes. Some microenvironments contain concentrations of compounds that are several orders of magnitude higher than these mean values. For example, workplace microenvironments may contain levels far higher than atmospheric means and even higher than those found in highly polluted urban air; especially if air pollution control devices are not deployed. Thus, the concentration of an air pollutant that is expected and permitted will vary according to the protection needed in ambient air and various personal and workplace microenvironments (see Figure 1.8).", "This type of fgure is used frequently in this text, especially in Chapter 7. It is quite useful in comparing allowable amounts of toxic air pollutants. Higher concentrations of air pollutants are often permitted in workplace environments than in the general environment. This is because workplace environments often require personal protection equipment (PPE), which is enforced by occupational regulatory agencies. In addition, exposures in workplace environments are generally much shorter in duration and frequency, e.g. 8 h per day, fve days per week for 30 years, compared to general exposures, e.g. 24 h per day, seven days per week for a lifetime. Thus, both the cancer and minimum risk level (MRL) are much lower than the occupational levels on the right-hand side of Figure 1.8. The MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of adverse noncancer health effects over a specifed duration of exposure.4 The recommended or regulated amount of exposure to air pollutants varies by scenario and activity. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) workplace exposure standard is the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for each air pollutant. The PEL is set to protect workers day in and day out for their entire career, i.e. a long-term exposure. There are three types of PELs: 1. The Time-Weighted Average (TWA) is the average employee exposure over a time period that a person is expected to work. This is usually 8 h, so the 8-h TWA is very commonly used. It is based on the measurements taken near or on the worker, i.e. personal exposure. The measured pollutant concentration may exceed the TWA value at times during the 8-h period but the 8-h average concentration must be below the PEL. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 2. The Ceiling Limit (PEL-C) is the maximum allowable concentration, not an average. Thus, any exceedence is considered a violation of the PEL, even for a very short time. 3. The Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL) is the concentration that must not be exceeded when averaged over a specifed short period of time (usually 15 min). When there is an STEL for a substance, exposure still must never exceed the PEL-C or the 8-h TWA. The majority of air pollutants with PELs have a published TWA value. Some air pollutants also have ceiling or short-term exposure limits (STELs). Others have ceilings and STELs instead of TWA values. The science behind recommended levels of workplace exposure comes from governmental research; e.g. the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) publishes air quality limits for substances to provide guidance on safe worker exposures. The recommendations can also come from professional and scientifc associations. For example, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists publishes occupational exposure guidelines, i.e. the threshold limit values (TLV). Both, the TLV and Recommended Exposure Level (REL) are advisory, but the PEL is a legal requirement that carries penalties when exceeded. NIOSH publishes four types of exposure recommendations, structured similarly to the PELs: 1. The REL-TWA: 8-hour time-weighted average concentration. 2. The REL-TWA: 15-min time-weighted average concentration.

Table 1.6 shows the PELs and RELs for some important workplace air pollutants. 1.3.2 Concentration Unit Example The REL-TWA concentration of for ammonia (NH3)is 25 ppm. The ceiling REL is 5 ppm for hydrogen chloride (HCl). The ammonia TLV is also 25 ppm. The PEL-TWA for ammonia is 50 ppm, and the ceiling PEL for HCl is 5 ppm, the same as its REL. For ammonia, the time for which the concentration is averaged is often 8 h (i.e. 8-h TWA), but the TWA can also be calculated for extended work periods, e.g. a 10-h TWA, or for short-term exposures. Suppose that a work area is monitored to show an 8-h TWA NH3 concentration of 23 mg m 3 and 3 mg m 3 for HCl. Are the workplace concentrations meeting NIOSH and OSHA recommendations? I.

Due diligence would call for fnding ways to reduce the workplace concentrations to be closer to the REL and TLV. For HCl, applying the 0.67 conversion factor gives: Given that 2 ppm < 5 ppm, would OSHA deem that this facility is not violating the PEL standard of 5 ppm if this area requires workers to be present? Note that Table 1.6 indicates that HCl is not a TWA PEL, but is a C-PEL. The C-PEL cannot be exceeded, even instantaneously. Thus, the average HCl concentration is not the appropriate measure. The actual measurements would have to be used instead to determine compliance with the C-PEL.

Sometimes, industrial operations can be conducted entirely within a sealed area, e.g. using robots. However, several industrial operations may require work in higher workplace exposures. This is permitted if the workers wear appropriate PPE, especially respirators. Assigned protection factors (APFs) are published by OSHA.12 An APF defnes the level of respiratory protection expected to be provided by a respirator or class of respirators. The APFs range from 5 to 10,000 (see Table 1.7). Similarly, the maximum use concentration (MUC) is the highest atmospheric concentration of a hazardous substance from which a worker would be expected to be protected when wearing the respirator.

If the measured 13.4 ppm peak concentration represents the highest HCl levels expected in this workplace, respirators providing an APF of 10 should be suffcient protection, if worn and used properly. Monitoring must continue; but let us assume that the equipment being used does not display ppm units, but gives units of mgm 3. Since the peak (ceiling PEL) concentration not to be exceeded using the APF 10 respirator is 50 ppm, what is this in units of mgm 3? Returning to Table 1.3, the conversion factor for HCl to use when ppm is known is 1490: 3 1490 50 \u00bc 74;500 mgm 3 \u00bc 74:5mgm If concentrations begin to approach 70 mg m 3,a more protective respirator may be needed (e.g. the supplied-air respirator with an APF of 1000 would be much more protective). To ensure that the unit conversions for NH3 and HCl are correct, the molecular weight (MW) of each can be inserted in to Eqn (1.1): 33.12 ppm NH3 \u00bc 33.12 [40.9 MW] mgm 3 33.12 ppm NH3 \u00bc 33.12 [40.9 17.0] mgm 3 33.12 ppm NH3 \u00bc 23,028 mgm 3 13.4 ppm HCl \u00bc 13.4 [40.9 MW] mgm 3 13.4 ppm HCl \u00bc 13.4 [40.9 36.5] mgm 3 13.4 ppm HCl \u00bc 20,004 mgm 3 Both unit conversions are within rounding error at three signifcant fgures. 1.4 FLUID PROPERTIES AND DYNAMICS Gases and liquids are fuids. Since the air is a mixture of gases, with varying amounts of suspended liquids and solids, it posseses fuid properties.b In addition to the complex and changing chemical composition of the atmosphere, the air\u2019s fuid properties and dynamics must be understood at various scales, from the movement of air masses at a global scale to the movement of contaminants and essential nutrients among and within an organism\u2019s cells. Air is the most prominent fuid when considering air pollutants, but it is not the only fuid involved in air pollution. Water is arguably equally important for numerous reasons, including as a component of the atmosphere and as the transport and transformation medium of bodily fuids during intake, adsorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion of air pollutants and their byproducts within an organism. Many other fuids are important to air pollution. Indeed, the pollutants themselves are often fuids under environmental conditions, e.g. alcohols, solvents, and oils. The frst law of motion states that every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it, i.e. inertia. The most common external force that changes the state of uniform motion is friction. The second law of motion describes the relationship between an object\u2019s mass m, its acceleration a, and the applied force: F \u00bc ma (1.4) Acceleration and force are vectors; wherein the direction of the force vector is the same as the direction of the acceleration vector.", "For example, if the mass of the pollutant, the mass of the fuid where it resides (i.e. air mass), and applied force (e.g. generated by the wind) are known, then the acceleration of a particle can be calculated, as well as the acceleration of the entire plume from one point to another. The third law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Like the frst law, this means that movements are dynamic and actions taken to change the velocity or direction of a pollutant (e.g. baffes, vents, and barriers) will be met with resistance and will result in changes in fow and direction of the pollutants. This comes into play when designing pollution control equipment. The laws of chemistry remind us that what we put into a reaction always leads to a specifc product. Thus, science tells us that so long as we understand the variables and parameters of any system, the outcome is predictable. This is obviously not completely possible when designing air pollution control equipment, for example, but lessons learned from successes and failures in previous designs lead to improved control technologies. There are numerous ways to identify, characterize, and analyze air pollution and to determine how the exposure to a pollutant has led and can lead to health and environmental impacts. Accurate descriptions of fuid properties and fuid dynamics are an essential part of this. 1.4.1 Atmospheric Fluid Properties Air pollution involves fuids. The term \u201cfuid\u201d includes all liquids and gases. A liquid is a form of matter that is composed of molecules that move freely among themselves without separating from each other. A gas is a form of matter that is composed of molecules that b Even solids can be fuids at a very large scale. For example, in plate tectonics and other expansive geological processes, solid rock will fow, albeit very slowly. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 1. THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE move freely and are infnitely able to occupy the space in which they are contained at a constant temperature. Engineers defne a fuid as a substance that will deform continuously upon the application of a shear stress; i.e. a stress in which the material on one side of a surface pushes on the material on the other side of the surface with a force parallel to the surface. The medium itself, i.e. air, is a fuid. So are some of the pollutants (gases like carbon monoxide, vapors like benzene, and liquid aerosols). Also, water is a key fuid, such as its vapor phase (e.g. clouds, fog, and steam) and its liquid phase (e.g. droplets, surface and groundwater interactions with the atmosphere). Indeed, many other fuids must be considered to describe air pollution fully, notably after exposure, blood, lipids, and other bodily fuids transport air pollutants and their metabolites within organisms. As mentioned, fuids are either liquid or gaseous. Fluid properties, along with fuid dynamics determine the extent and severity of a disaster. For example, contaminant\u2019s fuid properties will determine how soluble it will be in water droplets that are transported and deposited differently from air pollutants having lower aqueous solubility. A substance that is insoluble in water is often quite soluble in fats, meaning that exposures will lead to buildup in lipids. If a chemical is easily absorbed, the hazard may be higher. The fuid properties of an agent, whether chemical or biological (e.g. bacteria and viruses), determine where the agent is likely to be found in the environment after release (e.g. in the air as a vapor, sorbed to a particle, dissolved in water, or accumulated in biota). As science becomes less reductionist and more systematic, certain long-held boundaries between disciplines are becoming blurred. For example, physical transport is not only a function of the mechanics of fuids, but it is also a chemical process, such as when and under what conditions transport and chemical transformation processes become a steady state or nearly steady state, e.g. sequestration and storage in the environment. Thus, transport and transformation of air pollutants depends on the characteristics of environmental fuids. Fluids can be classifed according to observable physical characteristics of fow felds. A continuum fuids mechanics classifcation is shown in Figure 1.9. Laminar fow is in layers, while turbulent fow has random movements of fuid particles in all directions. In incompressible fow, the variations in density are assumed to be constant, while the compressible fow has density variations, which must be included in fow calculations.", "Viscous fows must account for viscosity while inviscid fows assume viscosity is zero. The time rate of change of a fuid particle\u2019s position in space is the fuid velocity (V). This is a vector feld quantity. Speed (V) is the magnitude of the vector velocity V at any given point in the fuid, and average speed \u00f0V\u00de is the mean fuid speed through a control volume\u2019s surface. Therefore, velocity is a vector quantity (magnitude and direction), while speed is a scalar quantity (magnitude only). The standard units of velocity and speed are meter per second (m s 1). Velocity is important in determining pollution properties and mechanisms, such as mixing rates after an effuent is discharged to a stream, how rapidly an aquifer will become contaminated, and the ability of liners to slow the movement of leachate from a landfll toward the groundwater. The distinction between velocity and speed is seldom made, even in technical discussions. Another important fuid property is pressure. A force per unit area is pressure (p): F p \u00bc (1.5) A So, p is a type of stress that is exerted uniformly in all the directions. It is common to use pressure instead of force to describe the factors that infuence the behavior of fuids. The standard unit of p is the pascal (Pa), which is equal to 1 N m 2. The preferred pressure unit in this book is the kilopascal (kPa), since the standard metric unit of pressure is the pascal, which is quite small. Potential and kinetic energy discussions must consider the fuid acceleration due to gravity. In many ways, it seems that acceleration was a major reason for Compressible Incompressible Compressible Incompressible I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 1.4 FLUID PROPERTIES AND DYNAMICS Isaac Newton\u2019s need to develop the calculus.13 Known as the mathematics of change, calculus is the mathematical means of describing acceleration and addressed Newton\u2019s need to express mathematically his new law of motion. Acceleration is the time rate of change in the velocity of a fuid particle. In terms of calculus, it is a second derivative. That is, it is the derivative of the velocity function. And a derivative of a function is itself a function, giving its rate of change. This explains why the second derivative must be a function showing the rate of change of the rate of change, which is readily apparent from the units of acceleration: length per time per time (m s 2). Unfortunately, in the United States and some other countries, pollution rules, regulations, and standards are not used consistently and uniformly. For example, the regulations for ozone (O3) are expressed volumetrically in parts per billion, but aerosols are usually mass per volume. Since volume is directly proportional and temperature indirectly proportional to density (combined gas law), some assumptions must be made before converting volumetric units (ppm, volume) to concentration units (mgm 3). Unless otherwise stated, the frst simplifying assumption is that the ideal gas law is expected to apply to environmental conditions in this book: pV \u00bc nR0T (1.6) where n is the number of moles and R0 is the gas constant, R0\u00bc 8.315JK 1mol 1. An ideal gas is one in which the atoms or molecules are moving randomly and not interacting with one another. Under environmental conditions, e.g. standard temperature and pressure, most gases in the atmosphere behave like ideal gases. However, at decreasing temperatures and pressures, gases begin to deviate from ideal behavior, especially due to molecular size (i.e. less space between molecules means the ratio of molecule to void space increases) and intermolecular forces (i.e. the ratio of kinetic energy to intermolecular forces decreases). Since the density (r) of a fuid is its mass per unit volume (e.g. mgm 3), the density of an ideal gas is found using the gas constant specifc to that molecule and applying the ideal gas law: 1 r \u00bc p\u00f0RT\u00de (1.7) where, p \u00bc gas pressure R \u00bc specifc gas constant T \u00bcabsolute temperature. The specifc gas constant must be known to calculate the gas density. For example, the R for air is 287 J kg 1 K 1. The specifc gas constant for methane (RCH4)is 518Jkg 1K 1. Applying these assumptions, at 25 C and 760 mmHg, ppb (vol.) can be converted to mgm 3: 1 l pollutant 1 ppb \u00f0vol:\u00de pollutant \u00bc 109 l air 1 \u00f01l=22:4\u00de MW 109 mg gm (1.8) \u00bc 109l 298K=273K 103 l1 3 \u00bc 4:09 104 MW mgm where MWequals the molecular weight.", "Thus, Equations 1.1 and 1.8 can be used to convert any molecule volumetric concentration to mass per volume concentration. Severalairpollutantsareconsideredasclassesorcollections of compounds (e.g. coke oven emissions, oxides of sulfur, and oxides of nitrogen). Thus, it is important to keep in mind that a published concentration will often beanaverageortotal. Tobecompletelycorrect,eachchemicalspeciesmust be convertedseparately, sincethedensity of each compound in the group differs. For example, it is a common practice to add concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide in ppm (vol.) and express the sum as \u201coxides of nitrogen\u201d. In metric units, conversion from ppm (vol.) to mgm 3 must be calculated separately for nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide prior to addition. Density is a very important fuid property for any air pollution situation. If a pollutant is very dense, such as a heavy particle, it will stay aloft for a much shorter time and distance than will a lighter particle of the same shape and size. For frst responders, the density in part determines the response. For example, whether a burning substance is of greater or lesser density than water will be one of the factors on how to extinguish the fre. If the substance is less dense than water, the water will likely settle below the layer of water, making water a poor choice for fghting the fre. So, any fammable liquid with a density less than water (see Table 1.8), such as benzene or acetone, will require fre-extinguishing substances other than water. For substances heavier than water, like carbon disulfde, water may be a good choice. The reciprocal of a substance\u2019s density is known as its specifc volume (y). This is the volume occupied by a unit mass of a fuid. The units of y are reciprocal density units (m3 kg 1). Stated mathematically, this is: 1 y \u00bc r (1.9) The weight of a fuid per unit volume is known as the specifc weight (g). Scientists and engineers sometimes use the term interchangeably with density. Geoscientists frequently refer to a substance\u2019s specifc weight. A substance\u2019s g is not an absolute fuid property as it depends upon the fuid itself and the local gravitational force: g \u00bc gp (1.10) I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 1.

Specifc weight is not often used by air pollution practitioners and researchers, but it can be an important property when characterizing fugitive dust and for source apportionment. For example, a particle\u2019s specifc weight may be a way to distinguish dust from soil erosion or surface mining or from other sources. The fractional change in a fuid\u2019s volume per unit change in pressure at constant temperature is the fuid\u2019s coeffcient of compressibility. Any fuid can be compressed in response to the application of pressure (p). ibility of mercury (3.9 10 atm ) and the greater For example, water\u2019s compressibility at 1 atm is 10 5 atm 1 . This compares to the lesser compress 6 1 compressibility of hydrogen (1.6 10 3 atm 1). A fuid\u2019s bulk modulus, E, is a function of stress and strain on the fuid, and is a description of its compressibility, and is defned according to the fuid volume (V): stress dp E \u00bc\u00bc (1.11) strain dV=V1 TABLE 1.9 Surface Tension (Contact with Air) of Selected Environmental Fluids Surface Tension, s Fluid (N m L1 at 20 C) Acetone 0.0236 Benzene 0.0289 Ethanol 0.0236 Glycerin 0.0631 Kerosene 0.0260 Mercury 0.472 n-Octane 0.0270 Tetrachloromethane 0.0236 Toluene 0.0285 Water 0.0728 E is expressed in units of pressure (e.g. kPa). Water\u2019s E \u00bc 2.2 106 kPa at 20 C. Surface tension effects occur at liquid surfaces (interfaces of liquideliquid, liquidegas, liquidesolid). Surface tension, s, is the force in the liquid surface normal to a line of unit length drawn on the surface. Surface tension decreases with temperature and varies depending on the contact fuid. Surface tension is involved in capillary rise and drop. Water has a very high s value (0.0728 N m 1 at 20 C).", "Of the environmental fuids, only mercury has a higher s (see Table 1.9). The high surface tension creates a type of skin on a free surface, which is how an object that is denser than water (e.g. a steel needle) can \u201cfoat\u201d on a still water surface. It is the reason insects can sit comfortably on water surfaces. Surface tension is somewhat dependent upon the gas that is in contact with the free surface. If not indicated, it is usually assumed that the gas is air. The composition and fuid properties of the atmosphere provide the setting and context for the discussion of air pollution. The following chapters consider various ways of characterizing air pollution and air pollutants, beginning with the physical processes at work in the atmosphere, followed by discussions of society\u2019s expectations of scientists and professionals who must apply scientifc principles to address air pollution.

THE PHYSICS OF THE ATMOSPHERE however, the total mass of the atmosphere is about 5 kg. Therefore, its heat content and energy po 1018 tential are very large. 2.1.1 Radiation from a Blackbody Physics applies the term blackbody to an object that is a perfect emitter and absorber of radiation at all wavelengths. Although no such object exists in nature, the properties are useful for comparison with materials found in the real world. The amount of radiation, or radiant \ufb02ux over all wavelengths (F), from a unit area of a blackbody is dependent on the temperature of that body and is given by the StefaneBoltzmann law: F \u00bc sT4 (2.1) where s is the StefaneBoltzmann constant and equals 11 214 8.17 10 cal cm min deg and T is the temperature in K. Radiation from a blackbody ceases at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K. In comparing the radiative properties of materials to those of a blackbody, the terms absorptivity and emissivity are used. Absorptivity is the amount of radiant energy absorbed as a fraction of the total amount that falls on the object. Absorptivity depends on both frequency and temperature; for a blackbody it is 1. Emissivity is the ratio of the energy emitted by an object to the emission energy of a blackbody at the same temperature. It depends on both the properties of the substance and the frequency. Kirchhoff\u2019s law states that for any substance, its emissivity at a given wavelength and temperature equals its absorptivity. Note that the absorptivity and emissivity of a given substance may be quite variable for different frequencies. As seen in Eqn (2.1), the total radiation from a blackbody is dependent on the fourth power of its absolute temperature. The frequency of the maximum intensity of this radiation is also related to temperature through Wien\u2019s displacement law (derived from Planck\u2019s law): nmax \u00bc 1:04 1011 T (2.2) where frequency n is in inverse second units (s 1) and the constant is in s 1 K 1. The radiant \ufb02ux can be determined as a function of frequency from Planck\u2019s distribution law for emission: &#1;&#3; &#4;&#5; 1 31 Endn \u00bc c1n exp c2$n$T 1dn (2.3) where c1 \u00bc 2p$h$c 2 h \u00bc 6.62 10 27 erg s (Planck\u2019s constant) c \u00bc 3 108 ms 1 (speed of light) c2 \u00bc h$k 1 and k \u00bc 1.37 10 16 erg K 1 (Boltzmann constant)", "The radiation from a blackbody is continuous over the electromagnetic spectrum. The use of the term black in blackbody, is quite misleading, as a number of nonblack materials approach blackbodies in behavior. The sun behaves almost like a blackbody; snow radiates in the infrared nearly as a blackbody. At some wavelengths, water vapor radiates very ef\ufb01ciently. Unlike solids and liquids, many gases absorb (and reradiate) selectively in discrete wavelength bands, rather than smoothly over a continuous spectrum. 2.1.2 Incoming Solar Radiation As mentioned, the sun radiates approximately as a blackbody, with an effective temperature of about 1026 6000 K. The total solar \ufb02ux is 3.9 W. Using Wien\u2019s law , it has been found that the frequency of maximum 1014 1 solar radiation intensity is 6.3 s (wavelength (l) \u00bc 0.48 mm), which is in the visible part of the spectrum; 99% of solar radiation occurs between the fre 1013 1 1015 1 quencies of 7.5 s (l \u00bc 4 mm)and2 s (l \u00bc 0.15 mm) and about 50% in the visible region between 4.3 1014 s 1 (l \u00bc 0.7 mm) and 7.5 1014s 1 (l \u00bc 4 mm). The intensity of this energy \ufb02ux at the distance of the earth is about 1400 W m 2 on an area normal to a beam of solar radiation. This value is known as the solar constant. Due to the eccentricity of the earth\u2019s orbit as it revolves around the sun once a year, the earth is closer to the sun in January (perihelion) than in July (aphelion). This results in about a 7% difference in radiant \ufb02ux at the outer limits of the atmosphere between these two times. Since the area of the solar beam intercepted by the earth is pE2,where E is the radius of the earth. As the earth rotates, the energy falling within this circle is spread over the area of the earth\u2019s sphere, 4pE2,in24h, the average energy reaching the top of the atmosphere is one-fourth of the solar constant, i.e. 338 W m 2.Thisaccounts for the angle of solar radiation striking the earth\u2019s surface and the fact that only one-half of the earth is illuminated at any time. The average radiant energy reaching the outer limits of the atmosphere is depleted as it attempts to reach the earth\u2019s surface. Ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength less than 0.18 mm is strongly absorbed by molecular oxygen in the ionosphere 100 km above the earth; shorter X-rays are absorbed at even higher altitudes above the earth\u2019s surface. At 60e80 km above the earth, the absorption of 0.2e0.24 mm wavelength radiation leads to the formation of ozone; below 60 km there is so much ozone that much of the 0.2e0.3 mmwavelength radiation is absorbed. This ozone layer in the lower mesosphere and the top of the stratosphere shields life from much of the harmful ultraviolet radiation. The various layers warmed by the absorbed radiation reradiate in wavelengths dependent on their temperature I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION and spectral emissivity. Approximately 5% of the total incoming solar radiation is absorbed above 40 km. Under clear sky conditions, another 10e15% is absorbed by the lower atmosphere or scattered back to space by the atmospheric aerosols and molecules; as a result, only 80e85% of the incoming radiation reaches the earth\u2019s surface. With average cloudiness, only about 50% of the incoming radiation reaches the earth\u2019s surface, because of the additional interference of the clouds. 2.1.3 Albedo and Angle of Incidence The portion of the incoming radiation re\ufb02ected and scattered back to space is the albedo (unitless, between 0 and 1). The albedo of clouds, snow, and ice-covered surfaces is around 0.5e0.8, i.e. between 50 and 80% of the incoming solar radiation is re\ufb02ected. The albedo of \ufb01elds and forests is 0.03e0.3, and that of water is 0.02e0.05 except when the angle of incidence becomes nearly parallel to the water surface.1 Table 2.1 shows the albedo of a water surface as a function of the angle of incidence. The albedo averaged over the earth\u2019s surface is about 0.35. Table 2.2 provides albedo values for various surfaces. The albedos of communities can vary considerably, depending on vegetative cover, materials used and amount of paved surfaces. Albedo is a very important factor in microclimatology, e.g. it has a major impact on the urban heat island effect, because of which downtown areas have higher average summer temperatures than surrounding suburban and rural areas.", "Materials that re\ufb02ect more and absorb less shortwave radiation can be used to ameliorate this heat island effect (see Figure 2.2). For example, dark asphalt has albedo between 5 and 8%; whereas grass has between 18 and 22% albedo. Some roo\ufb01ng materials have albedos greater than 70%.3 TABLE 2.1 Percent of Incident Radiation Re\ufb02ected by a Water Surface (Albedo of Water) Angle of Incidence Percent Re\ufb02ected Percent Absorbed 90 2.0 98.0 70 2.1 97.9 50 2.5 97.5 40 3.4 96.6 30 6.0 94.0 20 13.0 87.0 10 35.0 65.0 5 58.0 42.0 Adapted from: Ref. 1.

Although events taking place on the sun, such as sunspots and solar \ufb02ares, alter the amount of radiation, the alteration is almost entirely in the X-ray and ultraviolet regions and does not affect the amount in the wavelengths reaching the earth\u2019s surface. Therefore, the amount of radiation from the sun that can penetrate to the earth\u2019s surface is remarkably constant. In addition to the effect of albedo on the amount of radiation that reaches the earth\u2019s surface, the angle of incidence of the radiation compared to the perpendicular to the surface affects the amount of radiation \ufb02ux on an area.4 The \ufb02ux on a horizontal surface Sh is as follows: Sh \u00bc S cos Z (2.4) where S is the \ufb02ux through an area normal to the solar beam and Z is the zenith angle (between the local vertical, the zenith, and the solar beam). Because of the tilt of the earth\u2019s axis by 23.5 with respect to the plane of the earth\u2019s revolution around the sun, the north pole is tilted toward the sun on June 22 and away from the sun on December 21 (see Figure 2.3). This tilt causes the solar beam to have I.

I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION the presence of particles and greater absorption due to this greater thickness. 2.1.4 Outgoing Longwave Radiation", "Because most ultraviolet radiation is absorbed from the solar spectrum and does not reach the earth\u2019s surface, the peak of the solar radiation which reaches the earth\u2019s surface is in the visible part of the spectrum. The earth reradiates nearly as a blackbody at a mean temperature of 290 K. The resulting infrared radiation extends over wavelengths of 3e80 mm, with a peak at around 11 mm. The atmosphere absorbs and reemits this longwave radiation primarily because of water vapor but also because of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Because of the absorption spectrum of these gases, the atmosphere is mostly opaque to wavelengths less than 7 mm and greater than 14 mm and partly opaque between 7 and 8.5 mm and between 11 and 14 mm. The atmosphere loses heat to space directly through the nearly transparent window between 8.5 and 11 mm and also through the absorption and successive reradiation by layers of the atmosphere containing these absorbing gases. Different areas of the earth\u2019s surface react quite differently to heating by the sun. For example, although a sandy surface reaches fairly high temperatures on a sunny day, the heat capacity and conductivity of sand are relatively low; the heat does not penetrate more than about 0.2e0.3 m and little heat is stored. In contrast, in a body of water, the sun\u2019s rays penetrate several meters and slowly heat a fairly deep layer. In addition, the water can move readily and convection can spread the heat through a deeper layer. The heat capacity of water is considerably greater than that of sand. All these factors combine to allow considerable storage of heat in water bodies compared to that of land. 2.1.5 Heat Balance Because of the solar beam\u2019s more direct angle of incidence in equatorial regions, considerably more radiation penetrates and is stored by water near the equator than water nearer the poles. This excess is not compensated for by the outgoing longwave radiation, yet there is no continual buildup of heat in equatorial regions. The \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics requires that the energy entering the system (earth\u2019s atmosphere) be balanced with that exiting the system. Figure 2.4 shows the annual mean incoming and outgoing radiation averaged over latitude bands. There is a transfer of heat poleward from the equatorial regions to make up for a net outward transfer of heat near the poles. This heat is transferred by air and ocean currents as warm currents move poleward and cool currents move equatorward.4 Considerable heat 1 cal cm 2 min 1 697.58 W m 2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 20 40 60 90 Latitude 21 2 (1 cal cm min \u00bc 697.58 W m ). Adapted from: Ref. 4. transfer occurs by the evaporation of water in the tropics and its condensation into droplets farther poleward, with the release of the heat of condensation. Enough heat is transferred to result in no net heating of the equatorial regions or cooling of the poles.5 The poleward \ufb02ux of heat across various latitudes is shown in Table 2.4. Taking the earth as a whole over a year or longer, because there is no appreciable heating or cooling, there is a heat balance between the incoming solar radiation and the radiation escaping to space.6 This balance is depicted as bands of frequency of electromagnetic radiation in Figure 2.5. For every 100 units of energy entering the atmosphere, 51 units are absorbed by the earth\u2019s surface, 19 units are absorbed by the atmosphere, and 30 units are re\ufb02ected back into space. Thus, there are 70 units that will be eventually reradiated as longwave radiation. Thermodynamically, the earth operates as a large heat engine, with hotecold contrasts that generate power. Heat may be transferred with or without matter\u2019s movement.

Additional transfers from the earth\u2019s surface to the atmosphere consist of latent heat (LH), 23; and sensible (S) heat, 10. Ref. 7. transported by conduction, convection, and advection. During conduction, heat is transferred through matter without transferring the matter itself. Due to heat-induced density differentials, heat is transferred with matter moving vertically (i.e. conduction) or horizontally (i.e. advection).2 The heat exchange involves the two most abundant \ufb02uids, air and water, and can be seen as an oceaneatmosphere interaction. About 60% of the heat exchange is attributed to air movements, and approximately 40% is the result of ocean currents. In the oceans, warm water \ufb02ows poleward along the western side of an ocean basin and cold water \ufb02ows toward the equator on the eastern side. At higher latitudes, warm water moves poleward in the eastern side of the ocean basin and cold water \ufb02ows toward the equator on the western side.7 2.2 MOTION Vertical air motions affect both weather and the mixing processes of importance to air pollution. Upward vertical motions can be caused by lifting over terrain, lifting over weather fronts, and convergence toward low-pressure centers. Downward vertical motions can be caused by sinking to make up for divergence near high-pressure centers. When the atmosphere resists vertical motions, it is called stable; when the atmosphere enhances vertical motions, it is called unstable or in a state of instability. In incompressible \ufb02uidsa,suchaswater,the vertical structure of temperature very simply reveals the stability of the \ufb02uid. When the lower layer is warmer and thus less dense than the upper layer, the \ufb02uid is unstable so that convective currents will cause it to overturn. When the lower layer is cooler than the upper layer, the \ufb02uid is stable and vertical exchange is minimal. However, because air is compressible, the determination of stability is somewhat more complicated. The temperature and density of the atmosphere normally decrease with elevation. Air compressibility and convection is further complicated since density is also affected by theamountofmoistureinthe air. The relationship between pressure p, volume V, mass m, and temperature T is given by the equation of state: pV \u00bc RmT (2.8) where R is a speci\ufb01c gas constant, which is equal to the universal gas constant divided by the gram molecular weight of the gas. Since the density r is m/V, the equation can be rewritten as: p \u00bc RrT (2.9) a For atmospheric purposes, many liquids, including water, are usually considered to be \u201cincompressible\u201d. In fact, water 101 101 compressibility has been published, i.e. at 0 C, its compressibility is 5.1 10 Pa , reaching a minimum of 4.4 10 Pa at approximately 45 C, after which the compressibility again increases with increasing temperature. See: Fine RA, Millero FJ. Compressibility of water as a function of temperature and pressure. J Chem Phys 1973;59(10):5529. http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1. &#3;&#4; 5 1679903. Water\u2019s compressibility, expressed as change of volume per volume DV , is 4.6 10 per atm in the vicinity of 1 atm V dropping to 4.0 10 5 atm 1 around 250 atm. Pressure increases about 1 atm per 10 m depth. So, even under 4 km of ocean water (the mean ocean depth), i.e. 400 atm, the water only decreases by about 1.8% volume (The top 250 atm: 250 (4.6 10 5 atm 1) \u00bc 0.0115, and the lower 150 atm: 150 (4.0 10 5 atm 1) \u00bc 0.006; total compression \u00bc 0.0175). Other liquids have similar compressibilities, e.g. 5151 51 phenol \u00bc 5.0 10 atm , aniline \u00bc 4.5 10 atm and benzene \u00bc 9.5 10 atm. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION or considering speci\ufb01c volume a \u00bc r 1 it may also be rewritten as: ap \u00bc RT (2.10) These equations combine the principles of two gas laws: Boyle\u2019s law, which states that when temperature is held constant the volume varies inversely with the pressure; and the law of Gay-Lussac, which states that when pressure is held constant the volume varies in proportion to the absolute temperature. 2.2.1 First Law of Thermodynamics If a volume of air is held constant and a small amount of heat Dh is added, the temperature of the air will increase by a small amount DT. This can be expressed as Dh \u00bc cvDT (2.11) where cv is the speci\ufb01c heat at constant volume.", "In this case, all the heat added is used to increase the internal energy of the volume affected by the temperature. From the equation of state (Eqn (2.8)), it can be seen that the pressure will increase. If, instead of being restricted, the volume of air considered is allowed to remain at an equilibrium constant pressure and expand in volume, as well as change temperature in response to the addition of heat, this can be expressed as Dh \u00bc cvDT \u00fe pDv (2.12) By using the equation of state, the volume change can be replaced by a corresponding pressure change: Dh \u00bc cpDT \u00fe vDp (2.13) where cp is the speci\ufb01c heat at constant pressure and equals cv \u00fe Rd, where Rd is the gas constant for dry air. 2.2.2 Adiabatic Processes An adiabatic process is one with no loss or gain of heat to a volume of air. Conversely, if heat is supplied or withdrawn, the process is diabatic or nonadiabatic. Near the earth\u2019s surface, where heat is exchanged between the earth and the air, the processes are diabatic. However, at increasing altitude from the surface, processes frequently are adiabatic. For example, if a volume (parcel) of air is forced upward over a ridge, the upward-moving air will encounter decreased atmospheric pressure and will expand and cool. If the air is not saturated with water vapor, the process is called dry adiabatic. Since no heat is added or subtracted, Dh in Eqn (2.13) can be set equal to zero, and introducing the hydrostatic equation, the change in pressure can be expressed as: Dp \u00bc rgDz (2.14) Furthermore, combining equations results in: 1 DTDz 1 \u00bc gc (2.15) p Thus air cools as it rises and warms as it descends. Since this assumes an adiabatic process, DTDz 1 de\ufb01nes gd, the dry adiabatic process lapse rate, which is a constant equal to 0.0098 K m 1. This is nearly 1K100 m 1or5.4 F1000ft 1. If an ascending air parcel reaches saturation, the addition of latent heat from condensing moisture will partially overcome the cooling due to expansion. Therefore, the saturated adiabatic lapse rate (of cooling) gw is smaller than gd. 2.2.3 Determining Stability By comparing the density changes of a rising or descending parcel of air in relation to the density of the surrounding environment, the enhancement or suppression of the vertical motion can be determined. Since pressure decreases with height, there is an upward-directed pressure gradient force. The force of gravity is downward. The difference between these two forces is the buoyancy force. Using Newton\u2019s second law of motion, which indicates that a net force equals an acceleration, the acceleration a of an air parcel at a particular position is given by &#3;&#4; 1 a \u00bc gTp Te Tp (2.16) where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m s 2), Tp is the temperature of an air parcel that has undergone a temperature change according to the process lapse rate, and Te is the temperature of the surrounding environment at the same height. (Temperatures are expressed in degrees Kelvin.) Figure 2.6 shows the temperature change undergone by a parcel of air forced to rise 200 m over a ridge. Assuming that the air is dry, and therefore that no condensation occurred, this \ufb01gure also represents the warming of the air parcel if the \ufb02ow is reversed so that the parcel moves downslope from B to A. Comparing the temperature of this parcel to that of the surrounding environment (see Figure 2.7), the ascension from 100 to 300 m changes the parcel temperature at the dry adiabatic process lapse rate. The dashed line is a dry adiabatic line or dry adiabat. Suppose that the environmental temperature structure is shown by the solid curve. Since the lapse rate of the surrounding environment in the lowest 150e200 m is steeper than the adiabatic lapse rate (superadiabatic)dthat is, since the I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 2.

Dry air forced to rise 200 m over a ridge cools 500 adiabatically by 2 C. 400 300 200 100 A 0 temperature drops more rapidly with heightdthis part of the environment is thermally unstable. At 300 m the parcel is 0.2 C warmer than the surrounding environment, the resulting acceleration is upward, and the atmosphere is enhancing the vertical motion, so it is unstable.", "The parcel of air continues to rise until it reaches 350 m, where its temperature is the same as that of the environment and its acceleration drops to zero. However, above 350 m the lapse rate of the surrounding environment is not as steep as the adiabatic lapse rate (subadiabatic), and this part of the environment is thermally stable (it resists upward or downward motion). If the temperature structure, instead of being that of Figure 2.7, differs primarily in the lower layers, it resembles Figure 2.8, where a temperature inversion exists, i.e. an increase rather than a decrease of temperature with height. In the forced ascent of the air parcel up the slope, dry adiabatic cooling produces parcel temperatures that are everywhere cooler than the environment; acceleration is downward, resisting displacement; and the atmosphere is stable. In this situation, pollutants can be trapped in stable layers near the earth\u2019s surface, which can prolong exposures and lead to the unhealthy conditions of air pollution episode. Thermodynamic diagrams which show the relationships between atmospheric pressure (rather than altitude), temperature, dry adiabatic lapse rates, and moist adiabatic lapse rates are useful for numerous 500 atmospheric thermodynamic estimations. Standard meteorology provides additional details. In air pollution meteorology, the thermodynamic diagram may be used to determine the current mixing height, i.e. the top of the neutral or unstable layer. The mixing height at a given time may be estimated by use of the morning radiosonde ascent plotted on a thermodynamic chart. The surface temperature at the given time is plotted on the diagram. If a dry adiabat is drawn through this temperature, the height aboveground at the point where this dry adiabat intersects the morning sounding is the mixing height for that time. The mixing height for the time of maximum temperature is the maximum mixing height. Use of this sounding procedure provides an approximation because it assumes that there has been no signi\ufb01cant advection since the time of the sounding. Stability is described as either static or dynamic. The former does not account for wind speed. However, increasing wind speed increases vertical mixing of air parcels. Thus, static stability is based on buoyancy forces resulting from density differences; whereas dynamic stability is based on shear forces. Describing the stability of an air parcel must include these and other factors. For example, if the wind speed is <2ms 1 and incoming solar radiation is strong, the atmosphere would be very unstable. Conversely, on a clear night, the same calm winds would make for a stable air mass. These conditions induce very different air pollution plumes (see Figure 2.9). 500 100 100 0 0 78 9101112 45678 Temperature (\u00b0C) Temperature (\u00b0C) FIGURE 2.7 Temperature of a parcel of air forced to rise 200 m FIGURE 2.8 Temperature of a parcel of air forced to rise 200 m compared to the superadiabatic environmental lapse rate.

FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION X Z Z To address these complexities, meteorologists have devised atmospheric stability classi\ufb01cations, which are addressed in detail in Chapter 27. 2.2.4 Potential Temperature The atmosphere is very dynamic in terms of temperature and pressure, which calls for a benchmark to compare conditions at a speci\ufb01c time and place to other conditions. This is particularly important for stability, i.e. determining the extent to which one layer of the atmosphere is more or less stable than another, given various temperatures and pressures. Potential temperature (q) provides a benchmark, i.e. a means of identifying the dry adiabat to which a particular given atmospheric combination of temperature and pressure is related. Potential temperature is the temperature of the air if the measured temperature were at sea level and 1 atm pressure, i.e. the temperature that an unsaturated parcel of air would have it brought where T \u00bc temperature (in K) and k is known as the Poisson constant, which is usually assumed to be 2/7 z 2.86, i.e. the ratio of the gas constant (R \u00bc 8.316963 J mol 1 K 1) to the speci\ufb01c heat capacity at constant pressure for an ideal diatomic gas. adiabatically and reversibly from its initial standard pressure (p0): &#6; k q \u00bc T p0 p (2.17)", "The potential temperature q can be calculated from the temperature (T) at a given pressure p: &#6; 0:286 1 atm q \u00bc T (2.18) p Or, if p is in millibars (mb), Eqn (2.17) would be: &#6; 0:286 1000 q \u00bc T (2.19) p This value is the same as the temperature that a parcel of dry air would have if brought dry adiabatically to a pressure of 1000 mb. If the potential temperature decreases with height, the atmosphere is unstable. If the potential temperature increases with height, the atmosphere is stable. The average lapse rate of the atmosphere is about 6.5 Ckm 1;that is, the potential temperature increases with height and the average state of the atmosphere is stable. If the atmosphere is in a dry adiabatic, hydrostatic condition, its q does not vary vertically: vq \u00bc 0 (2.20) vz This means that in a dry adiabatic atmosphere, T must decrease with height. It is important to keep in mind that near the earth\u2019s surface the atmosphere is continuously undergoing heating and cooling. Thus, the adiabatic assumptions are rarely ful\ufb01lled. Neither are the hydrostatic, dry conditions. That is, the lower portions of the troposphere are seldom neither adiabatic nor dry. Thus, near the surface the atmosphere\u2019s slope of dT does not equal the dry adia dz batic lapse rate. Parcels of air can be assumed to be under local adiabatic conditions, since they are commonly transported locally by a turbulent atmosphere, which does not allow much energy exchange during these short times of transport. 2.2.5 Effect of Mixing The mixing of air in a vertical layer produces constant potential temperature throughout the layer. Such mixing is usually mechanical, such as air movement over a rough surface. In Figure 2.10 the initial temperature structure is subadiabatic (solid line). The effect of mixing is to achieve a mean potential temperature throughout the layer (dashed line), which in the lower part is dry adiabatic. The bottom part of the layer is warmed; the top is cooled. Note that above the vertical extent of the mixing, an I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 2. THE PHYSICS OF THE ATMOSPHERE Inversions are of considerable interest in relation to air pollution because of their stabilizing in\ufb02uence on the atmosphere, which suppresses the vertical motion that causes the vertical spreading of pollutants. 2.3 ENERGYeMOTION RELATIONSHIPS The atmosphere is continuously in motion. The scales and magnitude of these motions extend over a wide FIGURE 2.10 Effect of forced mixing (dashed line) on the envi ronmental subadiabatic lapse rate (solid line). Note the formation of an range. Although vertical motions certainly occur in the atmosphere and are important to both weather pro- inversion at the top of the mixed layer. inversion is formed connecting the new cooled portion with the old temperature structure above the zone of mixing. If the initial layer has considerable moisture, although not saturated, cooling in the top portion of the layer may decrease the temperature to the point where some of the moisture condenses, forming clouds at the top. An example of this is the formation of an inversion and a layer of stratus clouds along the California coast. Inversions at the surface are caused frequently at night by radiational cooling of the ground, which in turn cools the air near it. Such inversions are known as radiation or nocturnal inversions. 2.2.6 Subsidence Inversions There is usually some descent (subsidence) of air above surface high-pressure systems. This air warms dry adiabatically as it descends, decreasing the relative humidity and dissipating any clouds in the layer. A subsidence inversion forms as a result of this sinking. Since the descending air compresses as it encounters the increased pressures lower in the atmosphere, the top portion of the descending layer will be further warmed due to its greater descent than will the bottom portion of the layer (Figure 2.11). Occasionally a subsidence inversion descends all the way to the surface, but usually its base is well above the ground. cesses and the movement of pollutants, for convenience the only horizontal component of velocity is often wind. On the regional scale (hundreds to thousands of kilometers), the winds are most easily understood by considering the balance of various forces in the atmosphere. The applicable physical law is Newton\u2019s second law of motion, F \u00bc ma; if a force F is exerted on a mass m, the resulting acceleration a equals the force divided by the mass.", "This can also be stated as the rate of change of momentum of a body, which is equal to the sum of the forces that act on the body. It should be noted that all the forces to be discussed are vectors; that is, they have both magnitude and direction. Although Newton\u2019s second law applies to absolute motion, it is most convenient to consider wind relative to the earth\u2019s surface. This assumption causes some slight dif\ufb01culties, but they are usually easily managed. 2.3.1 Pressure Gradient Force Three forces of importance to horizontal motion are the pressure gradient force, gravity, and friction. Atmospheric pressure equals mass times the acceleration of gravity. Considering a unit volume, p \u00bc rg; the gravitational force on the unit volume is directed downward. Primarily because of horizontal temperature gradients, there are horizontal density gradients and consequently horizontal pressure gradients. The horizontal pressure Dp gradient force ph \u00bc , where Dp is the horizontal pres rDx sure difference over the distance Dx. The direction of this force and of the pressure difference measurement is locally perpendicular to the lines of equal pressure (iso bars) and is directed from high to low pressure. 2.3.2 Coriolis Force If the earth were not rotating, the wind would blow exclusively from high to low pressure. Close to the earth, it would be slowed by friction between the atmosphere and the earth\u2019s surface but would maintain the same FIGURE 2.11 Formation of a subsidence inversion in subsiding (sinking) air.

The path of air moving from the North Pole to the south as viewed from space is straight; as viewed from the earth\u2019s surface it is curved. atmospheric motions when examined from a point of reference on the earth\u2019s surface. For example, consider a wind of velocity 10 m s 1 blowing at time 1 in the direction of the 0 longitude meridian across the north pole (see Figure 2.12). The wind in an absolute sense continues to blow in this direction for 1 h, and a parcel of air starting at the pole at time 1 travels 36 km in this period. However, since the earth turns 360 every 24 h, or 15 h 1, it has rotated 15 in the hour and we \ufb01nd that at time 2 (60 min after time 1) the 15 meridian is now beneath the wind vector. As viewed from the absolute frame of reference (i.e. space), the \ufb02ow has continued in a straight line. However, as viewed from the earth, the \ufb02ow has undergone an apparent de\ufb02ection to the right. The force required to produce this apparent de\ufb02ection is the Coriolis force and is equal to D \u00bc vf where f, the Coriolis parameter, equals 2U sin 4. Here, U is the angular speed of the 1 earth\u2019s rotation, 2p \u00bc 7:27 10 5s ,and 4 is the 24 6060 latitude. The value of f is maximal at the poles and zero at the equator. The de\ufb02ecting force is to the right of the wind vector in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. For the present example, the de\ufb02ecting force is 1.45 10 3 ms 2, and the amount of de\ufb02ection after the 36-km movement in 1 h is 9.43 km. 2.3.3 Geostrophic Wind Friction between the atmosphere and the earth\u2019s surface may generally be neglected at altitudes of about 700 m and higher. Therefore, large-scale air currents closely represent a balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force. Since the Coriolis force is at a right angle to the wind vector, when the Coriolis force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the pressure gradient force, a wind vector perpendicular to both of these forces occurs, with its direction along the lines of constant pressure (Figure 2.13). In the northern hemisphere, the low pressure is to the left of the wind vector (Buys Ballot\u2019s law); in the Time Time 1 2 Apparent (1h later) motion relative to earth Low PressureP pressure gradient force p 1 Geostrophic wind p Coriolis pressure C force High FIGURE 2.13 Balance of forces resulting in geostrophic wind.", "southern hemisphere, low pressure is to the right. The geostrophic velocity is: Dp ng \u00bc (2.21) rf Dd When the isobars are essentially straight, the balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force results in a geostrophic wind parallel to the isobars. 2.3.4 Gradient Wind When the isobars are curved, an additional force, a centrifugal force outward from the center of curvature, enters into the balance of forces. In the case of curvature around low pressure, a balance of forces occurs when the pressure gradient force equals the sum of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces (see Figure 2.14) and the wind continues parallel to the isobars. In the case of curvature around high pressure, a balance of forces occurs when the sum of the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces equals the Coriolis force (see Figure 2.15). To maintain a given gradient wind speed, a greater pressure gradient force (tighter spacing of the isobars) is required in the \ufb02ow around low-pressure systems than in the \ufb02ow around high-pressure systems. Low Pressure gradient Gradient Coriolis force force I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 2. THE PHYSICS OF THE ATMOSPHERE High Low p 3 2.3.5 Friction The frictional effect of the earth\u2019s surface on the atmosphere increases as the earth\u2019s surface is approached from aloft. Assuming geostrophic balance aloft, the effect of friction with distance approaching the earth\u2019s surface is to slow the wind velocity, which in turn decreases the Coriolis force. The wind then turns toward low pressure until the resultant vector of the frictional force and the Coriolis force balances the pressure gradient force (see Figure 2.16). The greater the friction, the slower the wind and the greater the amount of turning toward low pressure.

SFC, surface wind. from the surface through the friction layer is called the Ekman spiral. A radial plot, or hodograph, of the winds through the friction layer is shown diagrammatically in Figure 2.17. Note that this frictional effect will cause pollutants released at two different heights to tend to move in different directions. This is particularly important when predicting the path and expected destination of long-range transport of a plume. In the friction layer where the isobars are curved, the effect of frictional drag is added to the forces discussed under gradient wind. The balance of the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis deviating force, the centrifugal force, and the frictional drag in the vicinity of the curved isobars results in wind\ufb02ow around low pressure and high pressure in the northern hemisphere, as shown in Figure 2.18. 2.3.6 Divergence So far in discussing motion in the atmosphere, horizontal motions have been emphasized. Although of much smaller magnitude than horizontal motions, vertical motions are important both to daily weather formation and to the transport and dispersion of pollutants. (B) High I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 2.4 LOCAL WIND SYSTEMS Persistent vertical motions are linked to the horizontal motions. If there is divergence (spreading) of the horizontal \ufb02ow, there is sinking (downward vertical motion) of air from above to compensate. Similarly, converging (negative divergence) horizontal air streams cause upward vertical motions, producing condensation and perhaps precipitation in most air masses, as well as transport of air and its pollutants from near the surface to higher altitudes. 2.4 LOCAL WIND SYSTEMS Frequently, local wind systems are superimposed on the larger-scale wind systems just discussed. These local \ufb02ows are especially important to air pollution since they determine the amount of a pollutant that will come in contact with the receptor. In fact, local conditions may dominate when the larger-scale \ufb02ow becomes light and inde\ufb01nite. Local wind systems are usually quite signi\ufb01cant in terms of the transport and dispersion of air pollutants. 2.4.1 Sea and Land Breezes The sea breeze is a result of the differential heating of land and water surfaces by incoming solar radiation. Since solar radiation penetrates several meters of a body of water, it warms very slowly. In contrast, only the upper few centimeters of land are heated, and warming occurs rapidly in response to solar heating.", "Therefore, especially on clear summer days, the land surface heats rapidly, warming the air near the surface and decreasing its density. This causes the air to rise over the land, decreasing the atmospheric pressure near the surface relative to the pressure at the same altitude over the water surface. The rising air increases the pressure over the land relative to that above the water at altitudes of approximately 100e200 m. The air that rises over the land surface is replaced by cooler air from over the water surface. This air, in turn, is replaced by subsiding air from somewhat higher layers of the atmosphere over the water. Air from the higher-pressure zone several hundred meters above the surface then \ufb02ows from over the land surface out over the water, completing a circular or cellular \ufb02ow (see Figure 2.19). Any general \ufb02ow due to large-scale pressure systems will be superimposed on the sea breeze and may either reinforce or inhibit it. Ignoring the larger-scale in\ufb02uences, the strength of the sea breeze will generally be a function of the temperature excess of the air above the land surface over that above the water surface. Just as heating in the daytime occurs more quickly over land than over water, the radiational cooling at H p 2 Return flow p 1 p p 1 p 2 L Water FIGURE 2.19 Sea breeze due to surface heating over land, resulting in thermals, and subsidence over water. night occurs more quickly over land. The pressure pattern tends to be the reverse of that in the daytime. The warmer air tends to rise over the water, which is replaced by the land breeze from land to water, with the reverse \ufb02ow (water to land) completing the circular \ufb02ow at altitudes somewhat aloft. Frequently at night, the temperature differences between land and water are smaller than those during the daytime, and therefore the land breeze has a lower speed. 2.4.2 Mountain and Valley Winds Solar heating and radiational cooling in\ufb02uence local \ufb02ows in terrain situations. Consider midday heating of a south-facing mountainside. As the slope heats, the air adjacent to the slope warms, its density is decreased, and the air attempts to ascend (see Figure 2.20). Near the top of the slope, the air tends to rise vertically. Along each portion of the slope farther down the mountain, it is easier for each rising parcel of air to move upslope, replacing the parcel ahead of it rather than rising vertically. This upslope \ufb02ow is the valley wind. At night when radiational cooling occurs on slopes, the cool dense air near the surface descends along the I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 2. THE PHYSICS OF THE ATMOSPHERE slope (see Figure 2.21). This is the downslope wind. To compensate for this descending air, air farther from the slope that is cooled very little is warmer relative to the descending air and rises, frequently resulting in a closed circular path. Where the downslope winds occur on opposite slopes of a valley, the cold air can accumulate on the valley \ufb02oor. If there is any slope to the valley \ufb02oor, this pool of cold air can move down the valley, resulting in a drainage or canyon wind. Different combinations of valley and mountain slope, especially with some slopes nearly perpendicular to the incoming radiation and others in deep shadow, lead to many combinations of wind patterns, many nearly unique. Also, each local \ufb02ow can be modi\ufb01ed by the regional wind at the time which results from the current pressure patterns. Table 2.5 gives characteristics of eight different situations depending on the orientation of the ridgeline and valley with respect to the sun, wind direction perpendicular or parallel to the ridgeline, and time of day. Figure 2.22 shows examples of some of the mountain and valley winds listed in Table 2.5. These are rather idealized circulations compared to observed, real-world \ufb02ows at any one time. The effect of solar radiation is different with valley orientation. An eastewest valley has only one slope that is signi\ufb01cantly heateddthe south-facing slope may be near normal with midday sunshine. A northesouth valley will have both slopes heated at midday. The effect of \ufb02ow in relation to valley orientation is such that \ufb02ows perpendicular to valleys tend to form circular eddies and encourage local \ufb02ows; \ufb02ows parallel to valleys tend to discourage local \ufb02ows and to sweep clean the valley, especially with stronger wind speeds.", "Air \ufb02ows result from the combination of the general and local \ufb02ows; the lighter the general \ufb02ow, the greater the opportunity for generation of local \ufb02ows. Complicated terrain such as a major canyon with numerous side canyons will produce complicated and unique \ufb02ows, especially when side canyon drainage \ufb02ows reinforce the drainage \ufb02ow in the main valley. 2.4.3 UrbaneRural Circulations Urban areas have surface roughness and thermal characteristics different from those of their rural surroundings. Although the increased roughness affects both the vertical wind pro\ufb01le and the vertical temperature pro\ufb01le, the effects due to the thermal features are dominant.

Also, some surfaces of buildings are normal to the sun\u2019s rays just after sunrise and also before sunset, allowing warming throughout the day. The result is that the urban area becomes warmer than its surroundings during the day and stores suf\ufb01cient heat so that reradiation of the stored heat during the night keeps the urban atmosphere considerably warmer than its rural surroundings throughout most nights with light winds. Under the lightest winds, the air rises over the warmest part of the urban core, drawing cooler air from all directions from the surroundings (see Figure 2.23). Subsidence replaces this air in rural areas, and a closed torus (doughnut)-shaped circulation occurs with an out\ufb02ow above the urban area. This circulation is referred to as the urban heat island, mentioned during the discussion of albedo. The strength of the resulting \ufb02ow is dependent on the difference in temperature between the urban center and its surroundings. When the regional wind allows the out\ufb02ow to take place in primarily one direction and the rising warm urban air moves off with this regional \ufb02ow, the circulation is termed the urban plume (see Figure 2.24). Under this circumstance, the in\ufb02ow to the urban center near the I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 2.

(A) (B) surface may also be asymmetric, although it is more likely to be symmetric than the out\ufb02ow at higher altitudes. The urban area also emits heat through the release of gases from combustion and industrial processes. Compared to the heat received through solar radiation and subsequently released, the combustion and process heat is usually quite small, although it may be greater than 10% in major urban areas. Heating from these sources can be substantial in the vicinity of a speci\ufb01c local source, such as a steam power plant (where the release of heat is large over a small area) and during light-wind winter conditions. 2.4.4 Flow around Structures When the wind encounters objects in its path, such as an isolated structure, the \ufb02ow usually is strongly perturbed and a turbulent wake is formed in the vicinity of the structure, especially downwind of it. If the structure is semistreamlined in shape, the \ufb02ow may move around it with little disturbance. Since most structures have edges and corners, generation of a turbulent wake is quite common. Figure 2.25 shows schematically the \ufb02ow in the vicinity of a cubic structure.", "The disturbed \ufb02ow consists of a cavity with strong turbulence and mixing, a wake extending downwind from the cavity a distance equivalent to a number of structure side lengths, a displacement zone where \ufb02ow is initially displaced before entering the wake, and a region of \ufb02ow that is displaced away from the structure but does not get caught in the wake. Wind tunnels, water channels, and/or towing tanks are extremely useful in studying building wake effects.8 Such micrometeorological phenomena as \ufb02ow around structures is very important to estimating micro-environmental exposures to air pollutants, including street canyon effects and penetration of pollutants into structures. 2.5 GENERAL CIRCULATION Atmospheric motions are driven by the heat from incoming solar radiation and the redistribution and dissipation of this heat to maintain constant temperatures on the average. The atmosphere is inef\ufb01cient, because only about 2% of the received incoming solar radiation is converted to kinetic energy, that is, air motion; even this amount of energy is tremendous compared to that which humans are able to produce. As was shown in Section 2.1.5, a surplus of radiant energy is received in the equatorial regions and a net out\ufb02ux of energy occurs in the polar regions. Many large-scale motions serve to transport heat poleward or cooler air toward the equator. If the earth did not rotate or if it rotated much more slowly than it does, a meridional (i.e. along meridians) circulation would take place in the troposphere (see Figure 2.26). Air would rise over the tropics, move poleward, sink over the poles forming a subsidence inversion, and then stream equatorward near the earth\u2019s surface. However, since the earth\u2019s rotation causes the apparent de\ufb02ection due to the Coriolis force, meridional motions are de\ufb02ected to become zonal (along latitude bands) before moving more than 30 . Therefore, instead of the single cell consisting of dominantly meridional motion, meridional transport is accomplished by three I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 2.5 GENERAL CIRCULATION North pole High FIGURE 2.26 Meridional single-cell circulation (on the sunny side of a nonrotating earth). cells between the equator and the pole (see Figure 2.27). This circulation results in subsidence inversions and high pressure where there is sinking toward the earth\u2019s surface and low pressure where there is upward motion. 2.5.1 Tropics Associated with the cell nearest the equator are surface winds moving toward the equator which are de\ufb02ected toward the west. In the standard terminology of winds, which uses the direction from which they come, these near-surface winds are referred to as easterlies (see Figure 2.28), also called trade winds. Since most of the earth\u2019s surface near the equator is ocean, these winds absorb heat and moisture on their way to the equator. North Equator Calm Doldrums 0\u00b0 Calm Where the trade winds from each hemisphere meet is a low-pressure zone, the intertropical convergence zone. This zone of light winds or doldrums shifts position with the season, moving slightly poleward into the summer hemisphere. The rising air with high humidity in the convective motions of the convergence zone causes heavy rainfall in the tropics. This giant convective cell, or Hadley cell, absorbs heat and the latent heat of evaporation at low levels, releasing the latent heat as the moisture condenses in the ascending air. Some of this heat is lost through infrared radiation from cloud tops. The subsiding air, which warms adiabatically as it descends in the vicinity of 30 latitude (horse latitudes), feeds warm air into the midlatitudes. Although the position of the convergence zone shifts somewhat seasonally, the Hadley cell circulation is quite persistent, resulting in a fairly steady circulation. 2.5.2 Midlatitudes Because at higher latitudes the Coriolis force de\ufb02ects wind to a greater extent than in the tropics, winds become much more zonal (\ufb02ow parallel to lines of latitude). Also in contrast to the persistent circulation of the tropics, the midlatitude circulations are quite transient. There are large temperature contrasts, and temperature may vary abruptly over relatively short distances (frontal zones). In these regions of large temperature contrast, potential energy is frequently released and converted into kinetic energy as wind. Near the surface there are many closed pressure systemsdcyclones and anticyclones, which are quite mobile, causing frequent changes in weather at any given location. In contrast I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 2.", "THE PHYSICS OF THE ATMOSPHERE to the systems near the earth\u2019s surface, the motions aloft (above about 3 km) have few closed centers and are mostly waves moving from west to east.1 The core where speeds are highest in this zonal \ufb02ow is the jet stream at about 11e14 km aboveground (see Figure 2.29). Where the jet stream undergoes acceleration, divergence occurs at the altitude of the jet stream. This, in turn, promotes convergence near the surface and encourages cyclogenesis (formation of cyclonic motion). Deceleration of the jet stream conversely causes convergence aloft and subsidence near the surface, intensifying high-pressure systems. The strength of the zonal \ufb02ow is determined by the zonal index, which is the difference in average pressure of two latitude circles such as 35 and 55 . A high index thus represents strong zonal \ufb02ow; a low index indicates weak zonal \ufb02ow. A low index is frequently accompanied by closed circulations which provide a greater degree of meridional \ufb02ow. In keeping with the transient behavior of the midlatitude circulation, the zonal index varies irregularly, cycling from low to high in periods ranging from 20 to 60 days. The jet stream is caused by strong temperature gradients, so it is not surprising that it is frequently above the polar front, which lies in the convergence zone between the midlatitude loop of the general circulation and the loop nearest the poles (see Figure 2.27). The positions of both the polar front and the jet stream are Adapted from: Ref. 1. quite variable, shifting poleward with surface surges of warm air and moving toward the equator with outbreaks of cold air. 2.5.3 Polar Region The circulation cells nearest the poles include rising air along the polar front, movement toward the poles aloft, sinking in the polar regions causing subsidence inversions, and \ufb02ow toward the equator near the earth\u2019s surface. These motions contribute to the heat balance as the moisture in the air rising over the polar front condenses, releasing the heat that was used to evaporate the water nearer the equator. Also, the air moving toward the equator is cold and will be warmed as it is moved toward the tropics. 2.5.4 Other Factors Of considerable usefulness in transporting heat toward the poles are the ocean currents. They are particularly effective because of the high heat content of water. Significant poleward-moving currents are the Brazil, Kuroshio, and Gulf Stream currents. Currents returning cold water toward the equator are the Peru and California currents. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION The pressure pattern changes from winter to summer in response to temperature changes. Because most of the southern hemisphere consists of ocean, the summer-towinter temperature differences are moderated. However, the increased landmass in the northern hemisphere allows high continental temperatures in summer, causing small equator-to-pole temperature differences; cooling over the continents in winter produces more signi\ufb01cant equator-to-pole temperature differences, increasing the westerly winds in general and the jet stream in particular.

All rights reserved. 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION conditions on certain days. Conversely, if they live near a nearly pristine park or forest, they may be particularly leery of any change in air quality. Both observations call for action, but different approaches, i.e. cleaning polluted air and preventing air pollution. A person with asthma may be more concerned about certain air pollutants than those who have never experienced breathing problems. Students who have taken a few earth science or meteorology courses, hopefully, will be more aware of even subtle forms of pollution than are lesser informed people. A farmer experiencing crop damage is likely to be concerned that the conditions leading to the damage are not repeated. One\u2019s level of awareness and concern is enhanced with a suf\ufb01cient amount of scienti\ufb01cally sound and reliable information and knowledge about air pollution speci\ufb01cally. This book is designed to provide such information and to enhance the reader\u2019s knowledge of air pollution. Air pollution to some extent is in the eye of the beholder (actually it is also in the beholder\u2019s ears, nose, mouth, skin, and, most prominently, lungs). Each person perceives a difference between polluted and unpolluted air. Science requires a more objective distinction. To understand the fundamentals of air pollution requires knowledge of the pollutant and of the air in which the pollutant is found. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) de\ufb01nes air pollution as the presence of contaminants or pollutant substances in the air that interfere with human health or welfare, or produce other harmful environmental effects.1 The key verb in the de\ufb01nition is \u201cinterfere\u201d. Thus, we obviously have a desired state, but these substances are keeping us from achieving that state. So, then, what is that state? The second part of the de\ufb01nition provides some clues; namely, air must be of a certain quality to support human and other life. Like many scienti\ufb01c concepts, there is a general understanding of air pollution that includes the essence of the scienti\ufb01c de\ufb01nition, but differs in detail from the more technical delineation between polluted and unpolluted air. Technical de\ufb01nitions and characterizations require clarity of meaning, with as little ambiguity as possible. For centuries people knew that something was amiss when their air was \ufb01lled with smoke or when they smelled an unpleasant odor. They relied on their unaided senses to determine whether a pollutant existed and to perceive its unpleasantness. However, most pollutants cannot be suf\ufb01ciently and accurately detected solely by the \ufb01ve human senses. Many are odorless, colorless, and otherwise undetectable. Even those that are inherently detectable with unaided human senses, such as hydrogen sul\ufb01de\u2019s (H2S) rotten egg odor or orange color of lead oxide (PbO), are sensed only at concentrations well above thresholds of harm. Unfortunately, the adage, \u201cwhat you don\u2019t know won\u2019t harm you\u201d is not true for most air pollutants. Generally, environmental agencies must take action if the expected exposure concentration of a pollutant is within the range of where it may cause harm. Thus, the state of the science has had to advance to begin to address air pollution properly. Sound science was needed to identify those constituents in the air that might be causing problems. Science was also needed to measure such agents. Biomedical sciences had to advance to discern which adverse health events were being caused by these agents. Indeed, a baseline had to be set to begin to take action. Another way to look at the interferences mentioned in the EPA de\ufb01nition is to place them within the context of \u201charm\u201d. The recipients of the harm have undergone varying levels of interest. In the 1960s, harm to ecosystems, including threats to the very survival of certain biological species was paramount. This concern was coupled with harm to humans, especially in terms of diseases directly associated with obvious episodes, such as respiratory diseases and even death associated with combinations of weather and pollutant releases. Other emerging concerns were also becoming apparent, including anxiety about nuclear power plants, particularly the possibilities of meltdown and the continuous generation of large volumes of cancer-causing nuclear wastes. The petrochemical revolution was also causing concerns, such as the increasing production and release of ominous-sounding chemicals like dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and other pesticides, as well as spills of oil and chemicals.", "These apprehensions would increase in the next decade, with the public\u2019s growing wariness about \u201ctoxic\u201d chemicals added to the more familiar \u201cconventional\u201d pollutants like soot, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen and sulfur. The major new concern about toxics was that of cancer. The next decades kept these concerns, but added new ones, including threats to hormonal and reproductive systems in humans and wildlife, neurotoxicity (especially in children), and immune system disorders. Growing numbers of studies in the last quarter of the twentieth century provided evidence linking disease and adverse effects to extremely low levels of certain particularly toxic substances. For example, exposure to dioxin at almost any level above what science could detect could be associated with numerous adverse effects in humans. During this time, other recipients of pollution were identi\ufb01ed, including the loss of aquatic diversity in lakes due to deposition of acid rain. Acid deposition was also increasingly associated with the corrosion of materials, including some of the most important human-made structures, such as the pyramids in Egypt and monuments to democracy in Washington, DC. Somewhat later, global pollutants became I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.1 AIR POLLUTION IN PERSPECTIVE the source of public concern, such as those that seemed to be destroying the stratospheric ozone layer or those that appeared to be affecting the global climate. This escalation of awareness of the multitude of pollutants complicated matters. For example, many pollutants under other circumstances would be \u201cresources\u201d, such as compounds of nitrogen. In the air, these compounds can cause respiratory problems directly or, in combination with hydrocarbons and sunlight indirectly can form ozone and smog. But, in the soil, nitrogen compounds are essential nutrients. So, it is not simply a matter of \u201cremoving\u201d pollutants, but one of managing systems to ensure that optimal conditions for health and environmental quality exist. Science must be able to explain the conditions under which something in our air that is at \ufb01rst harmless or even bene\ufb01cial becomes harmful. Impurities are common, but in excessive quantities and in the wrong places they become harmful. One of the most interesting de\ufb01nitional quandaries about pollution has come out of the water pollution literature, especially by the language in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-500). The objective of this law was to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the U.S. waters. To achieve this objective, the law set two goals: the elimination of the discharge of all pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States by 1985; and to provide an interim level of water quality to protect \ufb01sh, shell\ufb01sh, and wildlife and recreation by 1983.2 Could the Congress have realistically expected all sources that drained into U.S. lakes and rivers to be completely free of pollutants in 13 years? Or did this goal hinge upon the de\ufb01nition of a pollutant? In other words, even toxic substances are not necessarily \u201cpollutants\u201d if they exist below a threshold of harm. In light of the fact that this same law established so-called \u201cef\ufb02uent limitations\u201d, there is a strong likelihood that the de\ufb01nition called for in this goal was concentration-based.3 This paradigm spilled over into air pollution. More recently, the term \u201czero emission\u201d has been applied to vehicles, as the logical next step following low emission vehicles (LEVs) and ultralow emission vehicles (ULEVs) in recent years. However, zero emissions of pollutants will not be likely for the foreseeable future, especially if one considers that even electric cars are not emission free, but are actually an example of emission trading, since the electricity is generated at a power plant that is emitting pollutants as it burns fossil fuels or is generating thermal and radioactive wastes if it is a nuclear power plant. Even hydrogen, solar and wind systems are not completely pollution free since the parts and assemblages require energy and materials that may even include hazardous substances. These de\ufb01nitional uncertainties beg the question, then, of when does an impurity become a pollutant? Renaissance thinking may help us here. Paracelsus, the sixteenth century scientist is famous for his contention that \u201cdose alone makes a poison.. All substances are poisons; there is none which is not a poison. The right dose differentiates a poison and a remedy\u201d.4 Paracelsus\u2019 quote illuminates a number of physical, chemical, and biological concepts important to understanding air pollution. Notably, the poisonous nature, i.e. the toxicology, of a substance must be related to the circumstances of exposure.", "In other words, to understand a pollutant, one must appreciate its context. Air pollutants become a problem when they come into contact with the receptor. This leads to some important questions that must be answered to address air pollution: 1. What is the physical, chemical, and biological nature of the air pollutant and what are the conditions surrounding the receptor (e.g. a person, an endangered species, or an entire population or ecosystem)? 2. What is the exposed or potentially exposed person\u2019s existing health status; including vulnerabilities and susceptibilities that differ from the general population (e.g. a baby, an asthmatic child, an elderly person)? 3. What is the condition of the ecosystem? 4. What are the chemical composition and physical form of the air contaminant? 5. How has the person or organism been exposed to the pollutant; from inhalation of air, eating food contaminated by air pollutants in the home, or dermally from people touching settled dust with their skin? 6. Does the pollution involve one substance or is it present along with other, possibly synergistic contaminants? These and other characterizations of a contaminant must be known to determine the extent and degree of harm. Another concept highlighted by Paracelsus is that dose is related to response. This is what scientists refer to as a biological gradient or a doseeresponse relationship (See Chapter 7). Under most conditions, the more poison to which one is exposed the greater the harm. The classi\ufb01cation of harm is an expression of hazard, which is a component of risk. The terms hazard and risk are frequently used interchangeably in everyday parlance, but hazard is actually a component of risk. As we will see throughout this text, hazard is expressed as the potential of unacceptable outcome, while risk is the likelihood (i.e. probability) that such an adverse outcome will occur. A hazard can be expressed in numerous ways. For chemical or biological agents, the most important hazard is the potential for disease or death (referred to in medical literature as \u201cmorbidity\u201d I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION and \u201cmortality\u201d, respectively). So, the hazards to human health are referred to collectively in the medical and environmental sciences as \u201ctoxicity\u201d. Toxicology is chie\ufb02y concerned with health outcomes and their potential causes. To scientists and engineers, risk is a straightforward mathematical and quanti\ufb01able concept. Risk equals the probability of some adverse outcome. Any risk is a function of probability and consequence. 5 The consequence can take many forms. In environmental sciences, a consequence is called a \u201chazard\u201d. Risk, then, is a function of the particular hazard and the chances of person (or neighborhood or workplace or population or a part or all of an ecosystem) being exposed to the hazard. For air pollution, this hazard often takes the form of toxicity, although other public health and welfare hazards abound (such as corrrosivity to materials; See Chapter 15). 3.2 EMERGENCE OF AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, AND TECHNOLOGY Environmental science and engineering are young professions compared to many other disciplines in the physical and natural sciences and engineering. In a span of just a few decades, advances and new environmental applications of science, engineering, and their associated technologies have coalesced into a whole new way to see the world. Science is the explanation of the physical world, while engineering encompasses applications of science to achieve results. Thus, what we have learned about the environment by trial and error has incrementally grown into what is now standard practice of environmental science and engineering. This heuristically attained knowledge has come at a great cost in terms of the loss of lives and diseases associated with mistakes, poor decisions (at least in retrospect), and the lack of appreciation of environmental effects. Environmental awareness is certainly more \u201cmainstream\u201d and less a polarizing issue than it was in the 1970s, when key legislation re\ufb02ected the new environmental ethos. The number of laws intended to protection natural resources, including air quality, grew steadily throughout the 20th century. Following the 1960s, the growth of such legislation grew exponentially with increased public awareness and concern. Notably, the 1970 Clean Air Act codi\ufb01ed the national need to decrease air pollution by requiring federal standards for ambient air quality. This was accomplished by requiring state and local jurisdictions to implement plans to achieve air quality standards and to require sources of air pollution to decrease emissions.", "There has been a steady march of advances in environmental science and engineering for several decades, as evidenced by the increasing number of Ph.D. dissertations and credible scienti\ufb01c journal articles addressing a myriad of environmental issues. Corporations and government agencies, even those whose missions are not considered to be \u201cenvironmental\u201d, have established environmental programs. Arguably, a more complete understanding of atmospheric processes is one of the more emergent areas of environmental science and technology; growing from the increasing awareness of air pollution and advances of control technologies in the twentieth century. However, the roots of the science of air pollution can be traced to the Ancients. The environmental sciences, including its subdisciplines specializing in air pollution, apply the fundamentals of chemistry, physics, and biology, and their derivative sciences such as meteorology, to understand these abiotic6 and biotic relationships. Expanding these observations to begin to control outcomes is the province of environmental engineering. As scientists often do, systematic and speci\ufb01c explanations must be applied to practical knowledge. So, biologists and their subdisciplines began to specialize in what came to be known as the environmental sciences. Health scientists, like Paracelsus and William Harvey, provided insights into how the human body interacts with and reacts to environmental stimuli. In fact, Paracelsus\u2019 studies of metal contamination and exposure to miners may well be among the earliest examples of environmental epidemiology. Not only are the environmental disciplines young, but also many of the environmental problems faced today differ from those throughout most of human history. The difference is in both kind and degree. For example, the synthesis of chemicals, especially organic compounds has grown exponentially since the mid-1900s. Most organisms lack mechanisms to metabolize and eliminate these new compounds. Also, stresses put on ecosystems prior to the Industrial Revolution were comparatively small in extent of damage. Pollutants have been emitted into the atmosphere throughout human history, but only recently were such emissions so large and long-lasting, or of pollutants with such high toxicity, that they have diminished the quality of entire airsheds. 3.3 WHAT IS AIR POLLUTION? In spite of its vastness, the atmosphere can be and has been polluted. But, when does science consider the atmosphere to be unpolluted versus polluted? Sometimes, the best that can be done is to compare the condition of the atmosphere currently against some type of baseline, e.g. preindustrialized atmosphere prior to the nineteenth century. Another approach is to consider the I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.3 WHAT IS AIR POLLUTION? principles by which materials are released into the atmosphere, move, transform, and are removed from the atmosphere, and based on this assessment determine the extent of atmospheric pollution. The de\ufb01nition of an air pollutant or air pollution depends on the context of time, space, and impact for a particular set of circumstances. Earlier discussions attempted to distinguish unpolluted from polluted air. However, the same chemical compounds or particles from a natural source (e.g. a volcano) elicit the same adverse effects as when they are emitted by anthropogenic sources. Thus, unpolluted air is merely a benchmark to show the extent and trends of air pollution. Governments around the world have established and are continuously evaluating the impact of elevated levels of myriad gaseous and particulate material in the atmosphere. Air pollution implies acceptability. The difference between acceptable and unacceptable air quality is the focus. Over the past few decades the central feature of air pollution has been its association with harm, especially harm to humans in terms of diseases, such as respiratory diseases associated with air pollutants. Harm implies a value; i.e. something that society values is lost or diminished. Air pollutants affect both human health and ecosystems. The United Nations Environmental Programme estimates that indoor and outdoor air pollution are responsible for nearly 5% of the global disease burden, including excess cases of asthma and other allergic respiratory diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g. stillbirth and low birth weight).2 People in developing countries are particularly vulnerable to air pollution. Approximately two million people in rural areas die each year from exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter (PM) suspended in the indoor air. Excess mortality due to outdoor PM and sulfur dioxide contribute to mortality of about 500,000 people annually.3 In the United States, a handful of commonly found air pollutants are known to cause three speci\ufb01c types of harm. They impair health, destroy and adversely affect environmental resources, and damage property. To address these harms, as mentioned in Chapter 1, legislation has been passed around the world.", "In the United States, the Clean Air Act of 1970 established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to address six so-called \u201ccriteria air pollutants\u201d: 1. particulate matter (PM) 2. ozone (O3) 3. carbon monoxide (CO) 4. sulfur dioxide (SO2) 5. nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 6. lead (Pb) These pollutants are called criteria air pollutants because agencies around the world, such as the U.S. EPA, Health Canada, and Environment Directorate General of the European Union regulate them by using two sets of criteria for pollutant standards. The \ufb01rst set of standards is designed to protect public health based on sound science. This set of limits (known as primary standards)protects health. A second set of limits (known as secondary standards) aims to prevent environmental and property damage. When an urban area or other geographic area has concentrations of a criteria pollutant below the standard it is said to be \u201cin attainment\u201d and the area is declared to be an \u201cattainment area\u201d. Conversely, any area that has concentrations of a criteria pollutant above the standard is called a \u201cnonattainment area\u201d. Such a designation is not only problematic because of the potential health and environmental effects, but also because it means that the local and state governments will have to take actions to bring the area into attainment. The Clean Air Act gives the federal government a range of possible sanctions to encourage these actions, including withholding certain federal funds (e.g. road-building and other transportation projects). At present, many urban areas are classi\ufb01ed as nonattainment for at least one criteria air pollutant. In fact, about 90 million Americans live in nonattainment areas. 3 The public\u2019s apprehensions, however, extend beyond the criteria pollutants and increase with the growing wariness about \u201ctoxic\u201d chemicals added to the more familiar \u201cconventional\u201d pollutants. The clearest association of toxic air pollutants in recent decades has been with cancer, although neurotoxicity (especially in children) from lead and mercury grew in importance in the 1970s and 1980s. By the end of the twentieth century, new toxic pollutants also competed for the public\u2019s attention, including air pollutants that threaten hormonal systems in humans and wildlife, as well as those associated with immune system disorders. 3.3.1 Particulate Matter Neither Table 1.1 nor Table 1.2 lists among the constituents of the air the PM that is always suspended in various concentrations in the troposphere. Each gas or vapor exists as an individual molecule in random motion that exerts its proportionate partial pressure in the air. However, particles are aggregates of many molecules, sometimes of similar molecules, often of dissimilar ones. They form and transform in the air by several processes. Some particles serve as nuclei upon which vapors condense. Some particles react chemically with atmospheric gases or vapors to form different compounds. When two particles collide in the air, they tend to adhere to each other because of attractive surface forces, thereby forming progressively larger and larger particles by agglomeration. The larger a particle becomes, the greater its weight and the greater its likelihood of falling I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION to the ground rather than remaining airborne. The process by which particles fall out of the air to the ground is called sedimentation. Washout of particles by snow\ufb02akes, rain, hail, sleet, mist, or fog is a common form of agglomeration and sedimentation. Still other particles leave the air by impaction onto and retention by the solid surfaces of vegetation, soil, and buildings. The particulate mix in the atmosphere is dynamic, with continual injection into the air from sources of small particles; creation of particles in the air by vapor condensation or chemical reaction among gases and vapors; and removal of particles from the air by agglomeration, sedimentation, or impaction. Before the advent of humans and their works, there must have been particles in the air from natural sources. These certainly included all the particulate forms of condensed water vapor; the condensed and reacted forms of natural organic vapors; salt particles resulting from the evaporation of water from sea spray; wind-borne pollen, fungi, molds, algae, yeasts, rusts, bacteria, and debris from live and decaying plant and animal life; particles eroded by the wind from beaches, desert, soil, and rock; particles from volcanic and other geothermal eruption and from forest \ufb01res started by lightning; and particles entering the troposphere from outer space.", "As mentioned earlier, the true natural background concentration will never be known because when it existed humans were not there to measure it, and by the time humans started measuring PM levels in the air, these particles had already been polluting the atmosphere for eons. The best that can be done now is to assume that the particulate levels at remote placesdthe middle of the sea, the poles, and the mountaintopsdapproach the true background concentration. The very act of going to a remote location to make a measurement implies some change in the atmosphere of that remote location attributable to the means people used to travel and to maintain themselves while obtaining the measurements. PM is measured on a dry basis, thereby eliminating from the measurement not only water droplets and snow\ufb02akes but also all vapors, both aqueous and organic, that evaporate or are desiccated from the PM during the drying process. Since different investigators and investigative processes employ different drying procedures and de\ufb01nitions of dryness, it is important to know the procedures and de\ufb01nitions employed when comparing data. Although many of the air pollutants discussed in this book are best classi\ufb01ed by their chemical composition, particles are \ufb01rst classi\ufb01ed according to their physical properties. PM is a common physical classi\ufb01cation of particles found in the air, such as dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets.4 Unlike other U.S. criteria pollutants (O3, CO, SO2,NO2, and lead [Pb]), PM is not a speci\ufb01c chemical entity but is a mixture of particles from different sources and of different sizes, compositions, and properties. The chemical composition of PM is very important and highly variable. In fact, knowing what a particle is made of tells us much about its source, e.g. receptor models use chemical composition and morphology of particles as a means to trace pollutants back to the source. The chemical composition of tropospheric particles includes inorganic ions, metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and crustal substances (e.g. carbonates and compounds of alkali and rare earth elementals). For example, the mean 24 h PM2.5 concentration measured near Baltimore, Maryland in 1999 was composed of 38% sulfate, 13% ammonium, 2% nitrate, 36% organic carbon, 7% elemental carbon, and 4% crustal matter.5 In addition, some atmospheric particles can be hygroscopic, i.e. they contain particle-bound water. The organic fraction can be particularly dif\ufb01cult to characterize, since it often contains thousands of organic compounds. Particles range from ultra\ufb01ne to coarse (see Figure 3.1). The size of a particle is determined by how the particle is formed. For example, combustion can generate very small particles, while coarse particles are often formed by mechanical processes (see Figure 3.2). If particles are suf\ufb01ciently small and of low mass, they can be suspended in the air for long periods of time. Larger particles (e.g. 10 mm aerodynamic diameter) are found in smoke or soot (see Figure 3.3), while very small particles (<2.5 mm) may be apparent only indirectly, such as the manner in which they diffuse, diffract, absorb, and re\ufb02ect light (see Figure 3.4). Sources of particles are highly variable. They may be emitted directly to the air from stationary sources, such as factories, power plants, and open burning, and from moving vehicles (known as \u201cmobile sources\u201d), \ufb01rst by direct emissions from internal combustion engines, but also when these and other particles are re-entrained due to the movement of vehicles (e.g. in a \u201cnear-road\u201d situation). Area or nonpoint sources of particles include construction, agricultural activities such as plowing and tilling, mining, and forest \ufb01res. Numerous physical processes are at work in the formation of particles in the troposphere. These processes give a clue as to how to control particle emissions. By measuring each portion of the particle size spectrum by the most appropriate method, a composite diagram of the size distribution of the atmospheric aerosol can be produced. Figure 3.5 shows that there are separate size distributions with respect to the number, surface area, and volume (or mass) of the particles. The volume (mass) distribution is called bimodal because of its separate maxima at about 0.2 and 10 mm, which result from different mechanisms of particle formation. The mode with the 0.2-mm maximum results from coagulation I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.3 WHAT IS AIR POLLUTION? I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.", "THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION I.

As mentioned, these particles are created in the atmosphere by chemical reactions among gases and vapors. They are called \ufb01ne particles to differentiate them from the particles in the 10-mm maximum mode, which are called coarse. These \ufb01ne particles are primarily sulfates, nitrates, organics, ammonium, and lead compounds. The mode with the 10-mm maximum are particles introduced to the atmosphere as solids from the surface of the earth and the seas, plus particles from the coagulatione condensation mode which have grown larger and moved across the trough between the modes into the larger size mode. These are primarily silicon, iron, aluminum, sea salt, and plant particles. Thus, there is a dynamism that creates small particles, allows them to I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.

The majority of particles in the atmosphere are spherical in shape because they are formed by condensation or cooling processes or they contain core nuclei coated with liquid. Liquid surface tension draws the material in the particle into a spherical shape. Other important particle shapes exist in the atmosphere; e.g. asbestos is present as long \ufb01bers and \ufb02y ash can be irregular in shape. The amount of each element or radical, anion, or cation that is present in the mixture can be determined. Speci\ufb01c organic compounds may be separated and identi\ufb01ed. The shapes of individual particles may be analyzed by electron microscopy. Particle size is important for many reasons. They dictate the necessary control technologies. They determine the types of health and environmental problems to be expected when particles are inhaled and retained by the human respiratory system and when particles absorb and scatter incoming solar radiation. 3.4 ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT AND FATE A number of scienti\ufb01c concepts apply to the movement of air pollutants and other airborne substances in the atmosphere. Air pollutants are studied from at least three perspectives: the sources, the movement, and the receptors. The sources of air pollutants vary in size (e.g. tons emitted per year), type (e.g. stationary or mobile) and composition (e.g. coke oven emissions include thousands of compounds, but many smelters include a handful of metals). Movement can range from molecular diffusion to continental and global transport in winds aloft. Receptors include humans, ecosystems, and materials. Following are a few concepts that underpin most discussions about air pollution. 3.4.1 Sources and Sinks The places from which pollutants emanate are called sources. There are natural as well as anthropogenic sources of the particles and gases considered to be pollutants. These include plant and animal respiration and the decay of what was once living matter. Volcanoes and naturally caused forest \ufb01res are other natural sources. A special type of natural sources are biogenic, which are living things that release a variety of pollutants, both organic (e.g. volatiles like pinene) and inorganic (e.g. carbon dioxide [CO2] and methane [CH4]). The places to which pollutants disappear from the air are called sinks. Sinks include the soil, vegetation, structures, and water bodies, particularly the oceans.", "The mechanisms whereby pollutants are removed from the atmosphere are called scavenging mechanisms, and the measure used for the aging of a pollutant is its half-lifedthe time it takes for half of the quantity of a pollutant emanating from a source to disappear into its various sinks. Fortunately, most pollutants have a rather short half-life (i.e. days rather than decades) that prevents their accumulation in the air to the extent that they substantially alter the composition of unpolluted air shown in Table 1.1. Several gases do appear to be accumulating in the air to the extent that measurements have documented the increase in concentration from year to year. The best-known example is CO2. Other accumulating gases are nitrous oxide (N2O), CH4, CFCs, and other halocarbons. All of these gases have complex roles in climate change processes, and thus are at the center of discussions about global warming concerns. CFCs are chemically very stable compounds in the troposphere and have half-lives from tens of years to over hundreds of years. One of the sinks for CFCs is transport to the stratosphere, where shortwave UV radiation photodissociates the molecules, releasing chlorine (Cl) atoms. When in excess, these Cl atoms decrease the steady-state stratospheric ozone concentration, in turn increasing the penetration of harmful UV radiation to the earth\u2019s surface. Oxidation, either atmospheric or biological, is a prime removal mechanism for inorganic as well as organic gases. Inorganic gases, such as nitric oxide (NO), I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.4 ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT AND FATE nitrogen dioxide (NO2), hydrogen sul\ufb01de (H2S), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and sulfur trioxide (SO3), may eventually form corresponding acids: 1 NO \u00fe O2/NO2 (3.1) 2 4NO2 \u00fe 2H2O \u00fe O2/4HNO3 (3.2) 2 H2S \u00fe O2/SO2 \u00fe H2O (3.3) 3 1 SO2 \u00fe O2/SO3 (3.4) 2 SO3 \u00fe H2O/H2SO4 (3.5) Oxidation of SO2 is slow in a mixture of pure gases, but the rate is increased by light, NO2, oxidants, and metallic oxides which act as catalysts for the reaction. The formed acids can react with PM or ammonia to form salts. 3.4.2 Receptors A receptor is something that is adversely affected by polluted air. A receptor may be a person or animal that breathes the air and whose health may be adversely affected thereby, or whose tissue may be irritated, or whose surfaces (e.g. skin, leaf cover, roof) may be coated or discolored. It may be a tree or plant that dies, or the growth yield or appearance of which is adversely affected. It may be some material such as paper, leather, cloth, metal, stone, or paint that is affected. Some properties of the atmosphere itself, such as its ability to transmit radiant energy, may be affected. Aquatic life in lakes and some soils are adversely affected by acidi\ufb01cation via acidic deposition. 3.4.3 Transport and Dispersion Transport is the mechanism that moves the pollution from a source to a receptor. The simplest sourcee receptor combination is that of an isolated point source and an isolated receptor. A point source may best be visualized as a chimney or stack emitting a pollutant into the air; the isolated point source might be the stack of a smelter standing by itself in the middle of a \ufb02at desert next to the body of ore it is smelting. The isolated receptor might be a resort hotel 5 mi distant on the edge of the desert. The ef\ufb02uent from the stack will \ufb02ow directly from it to the receptor when the wind is along the line connecting them (Figure 3.6). The wind is the means by which the pollution is transported from the source to the receptor. However, during its transit over the 5 mi between the source and the receptor, the plume does not remain a cylindrical tube of pollution of the same diameter as the interior of the stack from which it was emitted. Instead, as it travels over the 5-mile distance, turbulent eddies in the air and in the plume move parcels from the edges of the plume into the surrounding air and move parcels of surrounding air into the plume. If the wind speed is greater than the speed of ejection from the stack, the wind will stretch out the plume until the plume speed equals wind speed.", "These two processesdmixing by turbulence and stretch-out of the plume, plus a third one, meandering (which means that the plume may not follow a true straight line between the source and the receptor but may meander somewhat about that line as wind direction \ufb02uctuates from its mean value over the time of transit between the two points)dtend to make the concentration of the plume as it arrives at the receptor less than its concentration on release from the stack. The sum of all these processes is called diffusion. However, the term diffusion has a substantially different meaning in chemistry. Substances diffuse Smelter I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION according to Fick\u2019s law of diffusion, wherein the concentration diminishes with distance from the source. This is known as a concentration gradient. Therefore, dispersion is the preferred term when discussing atmospheric transport at a scale larger than molecular. If the plume carrying air pollutants is above the height where ground-based convective and turbulent processes will bring it down to the ground reasonably close to its origin, it may travel for hundreds of miles at that height before being brought to earth by these processes in a remote community. This is known as long-range or long-distance transport. 3.4.4 Polluted Atmosphere Most atmospheric constituent data presented in meteorological and atmospheric science references are assumed to re\ufb02ect the composition of an \u201cunpolluted\u201d atmosphere. Air pollution exists within the context of time, space, and impact for a particular set of circumstances. The same chemical compounds or particles from a natural source (e.g. a volcano) elicit the same adverse effects as when they are emitted by anthropogenic sources. Thus, the source does not de\ufb01ne air pollution. The receptor is a better reference point for determining whether air is polluted or unpolluted. A substance in the same concentration in one scenario could be a pollutant, but not in another. For example, schools now must be careful to ensure that highly allergic children are not exposed to allergens, such as those emitted by certain legumes, such as peanuts (Arachis hypogaea). Most children would not be affected by the volatilization of small concentrations of vapors or aerosols from opening a package of peanut products. However, highly sensitive children might suffer a severe respiratory response. For this sensitive subpopulation, the indoor air in the school cafeteria would be \u201cpolluted\u201d. In this case, the school air may be deemed polluted by a substance that is not even regulated by environmental and occupational health agencies. Thus, unpolluted air is merely a benchmark to show the extent and trends of air pollution. Governments around the world have established and are continuously evaluating the impact of elevated levels of myriad gases and particulate material in the atmosphere. Clearly, these agencies are charged with addressing polluted air so that it is healthy to breathe, supports ecosystems, and supports other welfare uses, such as visibility and integrity of buildings and other structures. This leads to the need to consider the risks brought about by a polluted atmosphere. Although, air pollution is a scienti\ufb01c concept, during the second half of the twentieth century, air pollution de\ufb01nitions progressively joined the legal parlance. For example, the State of Florida de\ufb01nes air pollution as \u201cthe presence of any substances in the atmosphere in quantities which are or may be harmful or injurious to human health, welfare, animal or plant life, or property or unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or property\u201d.4 Similarly, the State of Victoria, Australia, says that \u201cair pollution occurs when the air contains gases, dust, fumes or odor in harmful amounts. That is, a substance is an air pollutant only in amounts which could be harmful to the health or comfort of humans and animals or which could cause damage to plants and materials\u201d.5 Terms like \u201cunreasonably\u201d and \u201ccould be\u201d are problematic for scientists, since such words are quite subjective. Unfortunately, this is often the case for debates as to what air pollution is and is not. When a substance is deemed to be an air pollutant, the governments are compelled to set standards and to require prevention, control, and other actions to decrease the pollution to a concentration considered acceptable from a public health or environmental perspective. The decision of when air is considered to be polluted never completely rests within the bounds of science. Air quality control agencies must decide when a concentration of a substance is acceptable and when it is unacceptable.", "This leads to the need to consider the risks brought about by a polluted atmosphere. As the peanut allergy example illustrates, even if the atmosphere is not generally polluted, the atmosphere is often compartmentalized so that parts of the atmosphere can still be polluted. Indeed, average pollution is not nearly as important as pollution in particular microenvironments. For example, indoor air pollution is extremely important, since in most parts of the world people spend more time indoors than out. Thus, if ambient conditions are acceptable, but microenvironmental air is polluted, the public health is harmed. Air pollutants are a type of \u201ccontaminant\u201d. Contamination often is a call to arms for regulators. Contamination implies that something must be cleaned up. For example, if a community were told that their yards, homes, neighborhoods, or air is contaminated, it is very likely that the residents would be greatly troubled. They would probably want to know the extent of the contamination, its source, what harm they may have already suffered from it, and what they can do to reduce it. Contamination is also a term that is applied differently by scientists and the general public, as well as among scientists from different disciplines. The dictionary7 de\ufb01nition of the verb \u201ccontaminate\u201d includes \u201cto corrupt by contact or association\u201d, or \u201cto make inferior, impure, or un\ufb01t\u201d. These are fairly good descriptions of air pollutants. When they come into contact with people, ecosystems, crops, materials, or anything that society values, they cause harm. They make resources less valuable or less \ufb01t to perform their useful purposes. From an air quality perspective, contamination I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.4 ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT AND FATE is usually meant to be \u201cchemical contamination\u201d and this most often is within the context of human health. However, air pollution abatement laws and programs have recognized that effects beyond health are also important, especially welfare protection. Thus, public health is usually the principal driver for assessing and controlling environmental contaminants, but ecosystems are also important receptors of contaminants. As mentioned, contaminants also impact structures and other engineered systems, including historically and culturally important monuments and icons, such as the contaminants in rainfall (e.g. nitrates and sulfates) that render it more corrosive than would normally be expected (i.e. acid rain). Contaminants are not limited to abiotic chemical substances, but can be biological (viruses, molds, etc.) and physical, such as the energy from ultraviolet (UV) light. In some instances, the physical contamination, this exposure is realized by chemical contamination. For example, the release of chemicals into the atmosphere, in turn react with ozone in the stratosphere, decreasing the ozone concentration and increasing the amount of UV radiation at the earth\u2019s surface. This has meant that the mean UV dose in the temperate zones of the world has increased. Higher UV dosage has been associated with an increase in the incidence of skin cancer, especially the most virulent form, melanoma. The disease is the result of UV exposure, but the UV exposure has been increased due to chemical reactions in the stratosphere, decreasing the absorption of UV. The characteristics of the pollutant and the characteristics of the place where the chemical is found determines the extent and severity of pollution. This place is known as the \u201cenvironmental medium\u201d. The major environmental media are air, water, soil, sediment, and even biota. This book is principally concerned with the air medium, but every medium affects or is affected by air pollution actions and inactions, as demonstrated by the fuel additive methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) (see Discussion Box: Cure Worse than the Disease: The Case of MTBE). CURE WORSE THAN THE DISEASE: THE CASE OF MTBE Automobiles generally rely on the internal combustion engine to supply power to the wheels.8 Gasoline is the principal fuel source for most cars. The exhaust from automobiles is a large source of air pollution, especially in densely populated urban areas. To improve fuel ef\ufb01ciency and to provide a higher octane rating (for antiknocking), most gasoline formulations have relied on additives. Up to relatively recently, the most common fuel additive to gasoline was tetraethyl-lead. But with the growing awareness of lead\u2019s neurotoxicity and other health effects, tetraethyl-lead has been banned in most parts of the world, so suitable substitutes were needed. Methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) was one of the \ufb01rst replacement additives, \ufb01rst used to replace the lead additives in 1979.", "It is manufactured by reacting methanol and isobutylene, and has been produced in very large quantities (more than 200,000 barrels per day in the United States in 1999). MTBE is a quite volatile (vapor pressure \u00bc 27 kPa at 20 C), so that it is likely to evaporate readily. It also readily dissolves in water (aqueous solubility at 20 C \u00bc 42 g l 1) and is very \ufb02ammable (\ufb02ash point \u00bc 230 C). MTBE is a member of the chemical class of oxygenates. The Clean Air Act called for greater use of oxygenates in an attempt to help to reduce the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), one of the most important air pollutants. So in 1992, MTBE began to be used at higher concentrations in some gasoline to ful\ufb01ll the oxygenate requirements. Even before the national mandate, some cities, notably Denver, used MTBE at higher concentrations during the wintertime in the late 1980s. The rationale was noble, given that CO toxicity results by interfering with the protein hemoglobin\u2019s ability to carry oxygen. Hemoglobin absorbs CO about 200 times faster than its absorption rate for oxygen. The CO-carrying protein is known as carboxyhemoglobin and when suf\ufb01ciently high it can lead to acute and chronic effects. This is why smoking cigarettes leads to cardiovascular problems, i.e. the body has to work much harder because the normal concentration of oxygen in hemoglobin has been displaced by CO. CO is also a contributing factor in the photochemistry that leads to elevated levels of ozone (O3) in the troposphere. In addition, oxygenates decrease the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which along with oxides of nitrogen are major precursors to the formation of tropospheric O3. This is one of the most important roles of oxygenates, since unburned hydrocarbons can largely be emitted before catalytic converters start to work. From an air pollution control perspective, the use of MTBE was a success by providing oxygen and helping gasoline burn more completely, resulting in less harmful exhaust from motor vehicles. The oxygen also dilutes or displaces compounds such as benzene and its derivatives (e.g. toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene), as well as sulfur. The oxygen in the MTBE molecule also (Continued ) I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION CURE WORSE THAN THE DISEASE: THE CASE OF MTBE (cont\u2019d) enhances combustion (recall that combustion is oxidation in the presence of heat). MTBE was not the only oxygenate, but it has very attractive blending characteristics and is relatively cheap compared to other available compounds. Another widely used oxygenate is ethanol. Unfortunately, MTBE exposure has been linked to certain health effects, including cancer in some animal studies. In addition, MTBE has subsequently been found to pollute water, especially groundwater in aquifers. Some of the pollution comes from unburned MTBE emitted from tailpipes, some from fueling, but a large source is underground storage tanks (USTs) at gasoline stations or other fuel operations (see Figure 3.7). A number of these tanks have leaked into the surrounding soil and unconsolidated media and have allowed the MTBE to migrate into the groundwater. Since it has such a high aqueous solubility, the MTBE is easily dissolved in the water. When a pollutant moves from one environmental compartment (e.g. air) to another (e.g. water), as it has for MTBE, this is known as cross-media transfer. The problem has not really been eliminated, just relocated. It is also an example of a risk trade-off, albeit unknown at the time. The risks posed by the air pollution were traded for the new risks from exposure to MTBE-contaminated waters. These trade-offs are discussed as part of the discussion of life cycles in Chapter 5.

Water Resources Investigation Report 96-4145, Washington (DC); 1996.", "I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.5 AIR POLLUTION ENGINEERING 3.5 AIR POLLUTION ENGINEERING When air pollution engineering \ufb01rst became recognized as a unique discipline, most of the engineers involved called themselves sanitary engineers, but now they are usually considered to be environmental engineers. \u201cEnvironmental engineering\u201d for the most part has replaced \u201csanitary engineering\u201d in the United States. Sanitary engineering has existed as a \ufb01eld since at least as early as the nineteenth century. The School of Military Engineering at Chatham, Kent, England, held a series of lectures given by J. Bailey Denton in 1876.6 By that time, Denton had already written extensively on sanitary engineering concepts and practices, including wastewater, potable water, drainage, and town planning. In the preface of the book capturing these lectures, Denton stated his desire \u201cto place before the engineering student the character of information which will qualify him for Sanitary duties, being much impressed with the conviction that, until all those who are charged with the execution of works upon which the public health depends, fully appreciate the principles which guide the Medical Of\ufb01cer in his opinions and reports, and comprehend the data which govern the Chemist in his analyses and deductions, they will be placed at a great disadvantage, and cannot entirely command the con\ufb01dence of the public\u201d. (capitalization and italics are Denton\u2019s). Denton\u2019s view of sanitary engineering continues to be emblematic of professionals and scientists engaged in addressing air pollution. First, he reminds the engineer this, to paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public even before professional conduct had been codi\ufb01ed as the \ufb01rst canon of engineering ethics. Thus, to the sanitary engineer \ufb01rst and the environment engineer later, the public places its trust in the engineer to ensure the air is healthful. Denton also ties the work of the engineer to the health profession (i.e. the medical of\ufb01cer). Engineers must understand and connect their work with that of the biomedical community, e.g. health-based air quality standards. Finally, Denton reminds us that public health of\ufb01cials and engineers must base their decisions and designs on physicochemical principles. Although sanitary engineering generally and Denton speci\ufb01cally focused on water quality and quantity, his \ufb01rst lecture addressed air. His description of the constituents was quite accurate: \u201cAir in its normal condition consists of about four-\ufb01fths, by volume, nitrogen, and one-\ufb01fth oxygen\u201d. He also accurately estimated that the air contains carbonic acid (the source of reduced pH in unpolluted air). In an early scienti\ufb01c de\ufb01nition of air pollution, Den-ton concluded that altering the constituents, e.g. \u201cincrease of carbonic acid, and mixture of other foreign matters\u201d, leads to unhealthy air (although he quotes his colleague, Angus Smith, as attributing this mainly to the reduction in oxygen content, rather than to the toxicity of the \u201cforeign matters\u201d). An interesting observation is that since carbonic acid has a sour taste, and nitrogen and oxygen have no taste, the fouling of the air can be largely attributed to increased carbonic acid. This is interesting because Denton and Smith appear to indicate that combustion is somehow tied to air pollution; a fact we now accept, but was less obvious in the nineteenth century. In the United States, the \ufb01eld of environmental engineering can be traced back to the early part of the twentieth century, with the \ufb01rst mention in 1890 by the War Department\u2019s Chief of Engineers\u2019 Report of the Examination and Survey of the Savannah River above Augusta (Georgia). The U.S. Public Health Service\u2019s Division of Environmental Engineering and Food Protection was established in 1961.9 There were many reasons for the name change from \u201csanitary\u201d to \u201cenvironmental\u201d. One certainly is the growing appreciation for the interconnections among abiotic and biotic systems in the protection of ecosystems and human health. Starting with the New Deal in second quarter of the twentieth century, engineers engaged in \u201cpublic works\u201d projects, which in the second half of the century evolved to include sanitary engineering projects, especially wastewater treatment plants, water supplies, and sanitary land\ufb01lls. Meanwhile, sanitary engineers were designing cyclones, electrostatic precipitators, scrubbers, and from other devices to remove air pollutants from industrial emissions. The realization that there was much more that engineers design beyond these structures and devices has led to comprehensive solutions to environmental problems. Certainly, structural and mechanical solutions are still the foundation of air pollution engineering, but these are now seen as a part of an overall set of solutions.", "Thus, systems engineering, optimizations, and the application of more than physical principles (adding chemical and biological foundations) are better re\ufb02ected in \u201cenvironmental engineering\u201d than in sanitary engineering. Air pollution engineering has the problem in that \u201ceverything seems to matter\u201d.10 The challenge for the engineer is to choose wisely the variables to be optimized. By the mid-1970s, many universities had replaced sanitary engineering majors with environmental engineering (see Figure 3.8). This could in part be because \u201csanitary\u201d implies human health, while \u201cenvironmental\u201d brings to mind ecological and welfare as well as human health as primary objectives of the profession. Sanitation is the province of industrial hygienists and public health professionals. The protection of the environment is a broader mandate for engineers. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION The historical \u201cinertia\u201d may help to explain why environmental engineering, and its subdiscipline air pollution engineering, is commonly considered to be a civil rather than chemical engineering \ufb01eld. This can be in part due to chemical engineering\u2019s concern with the design and building of systems (e.g. \u201creactors\u201d) that convert raw materials into useful products. So, in a way, chemical engineering is the mirror image of pollution engineering, which strives to remove and treat substances, e.g. converting complex chemicals to simpler compounds (ultimately CO2,CH4,and H2O). So, one could view the two \ufb01elds as a chemical equilibrium within which reactions in each direction are equal. Chemical engineers design reactors to synthesize compounds and air pollution engineers design systems to collect and degrade compounds. Actually, both \ufb01elds are crucial in addressing air pollution and contribute in unique ways. Treatment systems are indeed reactors. Toxic and harmful reagents enter and, hopefully, innocuous products exit. In addition, chemical engineers improve processes within industry so that less pollution results, i.e. \u201cgreen engineering\u201d. 3.6 SOCIAL ASPECTS OF AIR POLLUTION Environmental quality is important to everyone. This book stresses the importance of sound science, but it should always be understood that when it comes to the environment and public health, the social sciences can never be ignored. Certain social values have been passed down for generations, while others have been recently adapted to changes. For example, if a person or neighborhood has just experienced a nasty battle with an industry or governmental organization regarding an environmental decision, such as the location of land\ufb01ll or prohibition of a certain type of use of their own land, they may be reticent to trust the environmental professional who promises that it will be different this time. The second half of the twentieth century, particularly the time from the mid-1960s through the 1970s ushered in a new environmental ethos, or at least memorialized the fact that most, if not all, people expect certain quality of the environment. The laws and policies stemming from these years are still evolving. Environmental awareness grew in the second half of the twentieth century. With this awareness, the public demand for environmental safeguards and remedies to environmental problems was an expectation of a greater role for government. A number of laws were on the books prior to the 1960s, such as early versions of federal legislation to address limited types of water and air pollution, and some solid waste issues, such as the need to eliminate open dumping. The real growth, however, followed the tumultuous decade of the 1960s. Environment had become a social cause, akin to the civil rights and antiwar movements. Major public demonstrations on the need to protect \u201cspaceship earth\u201d encouraged elected of\ufb01cials to address environmental problems, exempli\ufb01ed by air pollution \u201cinversions\u201d that capped polluted air in urban valleys, leading to acute diseases and increased mortality from inhalation hazards, the \u201cdeath\u201d of Erie Canal and rivers catching on \ufb01re in Ohio and Oregon. 3.7 AIR POLLUTION LAWS The increased awareness and public demand for improved environmental quality led to exponential growth of laws, rules, and policies around the world to address air pollution. Some directly target air pollutants, e.g. the Clean Air Act in the United States, the Clean Air and Climate Act in Canada, and similar laws in Europe and Asia.", "As indicated in Table 3.1, the I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION TABLE 3.1 Comparison of US Clean Air Act Provisions to European Air Quality Policies and Measures US EU Geographical areas covered What triggers the planning requirement Consequences related to status of attainment Who makes the plans What is required to be in the plans Transboundary aspects Regulatory oversight during the review process of the plans Consequences of inadequate plans Consequences of noncompliance and/or nonattainment Each state has primary responsibility for assuring air quality within its entire geographic area. AQ is managed on the basis of air quality control regions (AQCRs), usually counties, US EPA may redesignate any interstate or major intrastate areas into one AQCR if necessary or appropriate for AQM States must submit state implementation plans (SIPs) covering each of the NAAQs for the AQCRs within their areas. The SIP is either an attainment-maintenance SIP (if the AQCR is designated as in attainment) or an attainment demonstration SIP (if the AQCR is designated as nonattainment). Requirements for control measures & deadlines for achieving attainment are differentiated according to the severity (degree) of nonattainment. Agency(s) differ from state to state due to various geographic spans of AQCRs. A SIP can be prepared by the state authority or a local or regional government. SIPs are required to include a list of local, state, regional, and federal air quality control measures in accordance with the pollutant-speci\ufb01c requirements provided by the Clean Air Act (CAA). Downwind states can petition EPA to have upwind contribution recognized & force upwind state to take action (NOx SIP call resulted in upwind states being given caps for LCP emissions) Once SIPs are developed, they are submitted to EPA to check if the plan meets requirements. If EPA approves the SIP, it becomes enforceable as a matter of federal & state law (& subject to lawsuits if failure to comply). EPA can disapprove a SIP if it does not meet the procedural and substantive requirements & require a resubmission with revisions. If a state fails to generate a SIP, EPA has the power to control the AQM programs for that state. In extreme cases, EPA can replace an inadequate SIP with a federal implementations plan (FIP). If AQCRs fail to demonstrate attainment by deadline, the following measures can be applied: (1) sanctions: (a) 2-to-1 emission offset sanctions before allowing any new or expanded major stationary sources; (b) withholding of federal funding for highway projects, except for projects to improve safety, transit, & AQ; (c) federal funding, authorization, or approval of any project or program that does not conform with the SIPs withheld; (2) \u201cbump-up\u201d provision: reclassi\ufb01cation of a failed ozone nonattainment area to a higher classi\ufb01cation, triggering more stringent requirements; and (3) penalty fee (severe & extreme ozone nonattainment areas only): each major source in area required to pay $5000 per ton of VOC or NOx emitted in excess of 80% of the stationary source\u2019s permitted level of emissions until attainment is demonstrated. 1. Under the AQFD, each member state is responsible for ensuring air quality within its territory, and for designating agglomerations and zones on the basis of AQ management considerations. 2. The NECD also places responsibility on each member state to reduce emissions within its territory. 1. The AQFD requires plans only for those zones and agglomerations with pollutant levels higher than the AQLVs, and not if a zone is in attainment. 2. The NECD requires MS to draw up national-level programs for progressive reduction of pollutants as required to achieve ceilings by 2010. No differentiation in terms of requirements for control measures or attainment deadlines on the basis of severity of nonattainment. 1. MS designate at the appropriate levels the competent authorities and bodies responsible for implementing the AQFD requirements. 1. The AQFD requires plans to list main emission sources, total emissions from these sources (tonnes/year), pollution imported from other regions, description of measures; estimated improvement of AQ & time to attain the objectives. 1. Member states required to consult each other when level of pollution due to signi\ufb01cant pollution originating in another member state. 2. NECs set at levels aimed at reducing regional pollutant transport problems. AQFD requires MS to report to Commission on the plans & programs prepared in order to attain the target value, & to inform the Commission every 3 years on the progress of any such plan or program. 1. AQFD does no specify.", "In general, if an MS is not in compliance with EU law, the Commission can decide to initiate an infringement action (see below). 1. The Commission publishes an annual list of the zones & agglomerations in exceedance of AQLVs. 2. The Commission is obliged to submit reports in 2004 & 2008 to the Council & European Parliament on progress toward meeting the NECs. The reports, if appropriate, are to be accompanied by proposals for modi\ufb01cations to the NECs, possible further emission reductions, and/or measures to ensure compliance with the ceilings. If an MS does not comply with the AQLVs or the NEC, the Commission may pursue an infringement action, including an action before the European Court of Justice, under its general power of enforcement over the MS. 3.7 AIR POLLUTION LAWS I.

THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION goals and approaches are similar. Other laws and regulations address environmental quality more generally, but include provisions for air quality. 3.7.1 The National Environmental Policy Act The movement was institutionalized in the United States by a series of new laws and legislative amendments. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) wasinmanywayssymbolicofthe new federal commitment to environmental stewardship. It was signed into law in 1970 after contentious hearings in the U.S. Congress. NEPA was not really a technical law. It did two main things. It created the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and established the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in the Of\ufb01ce of the President. Of the two, the EIS represented a sea change in how the federal government was to conduct business. Any federal agency was required to prepare EISs on any major action that it was considering that could \u201csigni\ufb01cantly\u201da affect the quality of the environment. From the outset, the agencies had to reconcile often-competing values; i.e. their mission and the protection of the environment. The CEQ was charged with developing guidance for all federal agencies regarding NEPA compliance, especially when and how to prepare an EIS. The EIS process combines scienti\ufb01c assessment with public review. The process is similar for most federal agencies. Agencies often strive to receive a so-called \u201cFONSI\u201d or the \ufb01nding of no signi\ufb01cant impact, so that they may proceed unencumbered on a mission-oriented project.11 Whether a project either leads to a full EIS or a waiver through the FONSI process, it will have to undergo an evaluation. This step is referred to as an \u201cenvironmental assessment\u201d. An incomplete or inadequate assessment will lead to delays and increases the chance of an unsuccessful project, thus sound science is needed from the outset of the project design. The \ufb01nal step is the record of decision (ROD). The ROD describes the alternatives and the rationale for \ufb01nal selection of the best alternative. It also summarizes the comments received during the public reviews and how the comments were addressed. Many states have adopted similar requirements for their RODs. The EIS documents were supposed to be a type of \u201cfull disclosure\u201d of actual or possible problems if a federal project is carried out. This was accomplished by looking at all of the potential impacts to the environment from any of the proposed alternatives, and comparing those outcomes to a \u201cno action\u201d alternative. At \ufb01rst, many tried to demonstrate that their \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d was in fact very environmentally sound. In other words, the environment would be better off with the project than without it (action is better than no action). Too often, however, an EIS was written to justify the agency\u2019s mission-oriented project. One of the key advocates for the need for a national environmental policy, Lynton Caldwell, is said to have referred to this as the federal agencies using an EIS to \u201cmake an environmental silk purse from a mission-oriented sow\u2019s ear!\u201d12 The courts adjudicated some very important laws along the way, requiring federal agencies to take NEPA seriously. Some of the aspects of the \u201cgive and take\u201d and evolution of federal agencies\u2019 growing commitment to environmental protection were the acceptance of the need for sound science in assessing environmental conditions and possible impacts, and the very large role of the public in deciding on the environmental worth of a highway, airport, dam, waterworks, treatment plant, or any other major project sponsored by or regulated by the federal government. This change provided a major impetus in the growth of the environmental disciplines since the 1970s.", "Experts were needed who not only would \u201cdo the science\u201d but who could communicate what their science means to the public. All federal agencies must follow the CEQ regulations13 to \u201cadopt procedures to ensure that decisions are made in accordance with the policies and purposes of the Act\u201d. This process must be set up in advance, early in an agency\u2019s planning stages. For example, if waste remediation or reclamation is a possible action, the NEPA process must be woven into the remedial action planning processes, beginning with the identi\ufb01cation of the need for and possible kinds of actions being considered. Noncompliance or inadequate compliance with NEPA rules and regulations has led lawsuits, increased project costs, delays, and the loss of the public\u2019s loss of trust and con\ufb01dence, even if the project is designed to improve the environment, and even if the compliance problems seem to be only \u201cprocedural\u201d. The U.S. EPA is responsible for reviewing the environmental effects of all federal agencies\u2019 actions. This authority was written as Section 309 of the Clean Air Act. The review must be followed with the EPA\u2019s public comments concerning the environmental impacts of any matter related to the duties, responsibilities, and authorities of EPA\u2019s administrator, including EISs. The EPA\u2019s rating system (see Table 3.2) is designed to determine whether a proposed action by a federal agency is unsatisfactory from the standpoint of public health, environmental quality, or public welfare. This determination is a This is the actual adjective used in NEPA. It is unfortunate given its ambiguity. Also, \u201csigni\ufb01cant\u201d is a term with clear meaning in the sciences, i.e. unlikely to occur by chance at a de\ufb01ned level of con\ufb01dence (e.g. 0.05%); which is not the meaning in NEPA.

The 1970 version was enacted to provide a comprehensive set of regulations to control air emissions from area, stationary, and mobile sources. The CAA\u2019s goal, from its beginning, has been to protect public health and the environment from air pollution.", "In the more recent versions, air pollutants are classi\ufb01ed into categories, with distinction between \u201cconventional\u201d as opposed to \u201ctoxic\u201d pollutants: ambient concentrations of vapors and particulate matter (PM), including those to reduce photochemical oxidant smog or ozone (see Discussion Box: Smog and Ozone). The six conventional or \u201ccriteria\u201d pollutants that are covered under the NAAQS are summarized in Table 3.3. Note that the NAAQS are continuously evaluated, with the possibility of adding criteria pollutants (the TABLE 3.3 US National Ambient Air Quality Standards under the Clean Air Act Amendments Criteria Pollutant Primary/Secondary Averaging Time Level Standard Description Carbon monoxide Primary 8 h 1 h 9 ppm 35 ppm Not to be exceeded more than once per year Lead Primary and secondary Rolling 3 month 30.15 mgm * Not to be exceeded average Nitrogen dioxide http://www.epa.gov/airquality/ nitrogenoxides/ Primary Primary and secondary 1 h Annual 100 ppb 53 ppbx 98th Percentile, averaged over 3 years Annual mean Ozone Primary and secondary 8 h 0.075 ppm{ Annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hr concentration, averaged over 3 years Particle pollution http://www.epa.gov/airquality/ particlepollution/ PM2.5 Primary Secondary Annual Annual 312 mgm 315 mgm Annual mean, averaged over 3 years Annual mean, averaged over 3 years Primary and secondary 24 h 335 mgm 98th Percentile, averaged over 3 years PM10 Primary and secondary 24 h 3150 mgm Not to be exceeded more than once per year on average over 3 years Sulfur dioxide Primary 1 h 75 ppbjj 99th Percentile of 1-h daily maximum concentrations, averaged over 3 years Secondary 3 h 0.5 ppm Not to be exceeded more than once per year * Final rule signed October 15, 2008. The 1978 lead standard (1.5 mgm 3 as a quarterly average) remains in effect until one year after an area is designated for the 2008 standard, except that in areas designated nonattainment for the 1978, the 1978 standard remains in effect until implementation plans to attain or maintain the 2008 standard are approved. xThe of\ufb01cial level of the annual NO2 standard is 0.053 ppm, equal to 53 ppb, which is shown here for the purpose of clearer comparison to the 1-h standard. { Final rule signed March 12, 2008. The 1997 ozone standard (0.08 ppm, annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-h concentration, averaged over 3 years) and related implementation rules remain in place. In 1997, EPA revoked the 1-h ozone standard (0.12 ppm, not to be exceeded more than once per year) in all areas, although some areas have continued obligations under that standard (\u201cantibacksliding\u201d). The 1-h ozone standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum hourly average concentrations above 0.12 ppm is less than or equal to one. jj Final rule signed June 2, 2010. The 1971 annual and 24-h SO2 standards were revoked in that same rulemaking. However, these standards remain in effect until one year after an area is designated for the 2010 standard, except in areas designated nonattainment for the 1971 standards, where the 1971 standards remain in effect until implementation plans to attain or maintain the 2010 standard are approved.

THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION metal lead was the last to be added, but CO2 is currently under discussion). Existing NAAQS requirements are also revised when supported by sound science. For example, the particulate standard was changed to address \ufb01ner particles; i.e. particles with diameters <2.5 mm (PM2.5), in response to research showing that exposure to these smaller particles is more likely to lead to health problems than do exposures to larger particles (see Chapters 9 and 10). Smaller particles are able to penetrate further into the lungs and likely are more bioavailable than the larger PM10. Recently, however, concerns about larger particles (e.g. PM10) have increased, particularly as research is beginning to link coarse particles to chronic diseases like asthma. Other provisions, such as averaging times, are evaluated and changed if they are deemed to be a better re\ufb02ection of potential exposures and health effects. The original goal was to set and to achieve NAAQS in every state by 1975. These new standards were combined with charging the 50 states to develop state implementation plans (SIPs) to address industrial, transportation, and other sources in the state. The ambient atmospheric concentrations are measured at over 4000 monitoring sites across the United States. The ambient concentrations have continuously decreased, as shown in Table 3.4.", "The improvements in Table 3.3 correlate directly with reductions in emissions. Emission trends can be derived using on a combination of actual measurements and TABLE 3.4 Percent Change in Air Quality in the United States as Refected by Trends in the Six National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) Pollutants Time Period for Trend 1980 1990 2000 versus versus versus 2012 2012 2012 Carbon monoxide (CO) 83 75 57 Ozone (O3)(8 h) 25 14 9 Lead (Pb) 91 87 52 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (annual) 56 50 38 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)(1 h) 60 46 29 PM10 (24 h) ND 39 27 PM2.5 (annual) ND ND 33 PM2.5 (24 h) ND ND 37 Sulfur dioxide (SO2)(1 h) 78 72 54 Notes: 1.

Nitric oxide (NO) and NO2 together are known as NOx. Since 1980, NOx emissions have been halved. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are precursors to O3, are a third of what they were in 1980. Dust and other particle emissions have also dropped by more than half. In spite of these improvements, about 90 million tons of NAAQS pollutants are still released annually in the United States.7 The Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1977 mandated new dates to achieve attainment of NAAQS (many areas of the country had not met the prescribed dates set in 1970). Other amendments were targeted at insuf\ufb01ciently addressed types of air pollution, including acidic deposition (so-called \u201cacid rain\u201d), tropospheric ozone pollution, depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, and a new program for air toxics, the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs). The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAAA90) profoundly changed the law, by adding new initiatives and imposing dates to meet the law\u2019s new requirements. 3.7.2.1 State Implementation Plans The CAA\u2019s criteria air pollutants require measures to limit their concentrations in ambient air. Nonattainment areas those parts of the country where the air exceeds the NAAQS for any of the six criteria pollutants. Each state in the United States establishes a SIP to engage control strategies for reducing air pollution in nonattainment areas. These plans are periodically reviewed for effectiveness. The SIP addresses mobile sources, including baselines and projection inventories of pollutants from automobiles and other mobile sources. The inventories are tools in targeting control strategies for on-road and off-road mobile sources. The SIP also addresses stationary sources by requiring control strategies to address pollutants from industrial facilities and other stationary sources. As for mobile sources, the SIP also requires stationary source inventories based on emissions data from major regulated facilities, as well as calculated emissions from minor stationary sources (i.e. area source calculations).8 3.7.2.2 Prevention Strategies: Source Review The CAA includes provisions to keep clean air clean under the New Source Review (NSR). The NSR embodies sets of rules that apply to a proposed construction, either new or substantially modi\ufb01cations to an existing site. The two categories of NSR rules are: (1) I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.7 AIR POLLUTION LAWS SMOG AND OZONE The term smog is a shorthand combination of \u201csmokee fog\u201d. However, it is really the code word for photochemical oxidant smog, the brown haze that can be seen when \ufb02ying into Los Angeles, St. Louis, Denver, and other metropolitan areas around the world (see Figure 3.9). Point-of-fact is that to make smog, at least three ingredients are needed: light, hydrocarbons, and radical sources, such the oxides of nitrogen. Therefore, smog is found most often in the warmer months of the year, not because of temperature, but because these are the months with greater amounts of sunlight. More sunlight is available for two reasons, both attributed to the earth\u2019s tilt on its axis. In the summer, the earth is tilted toward the sun, so the angle of inclination of sunlight is greater than when the sun tipped away from the earth leading to more intensity of light per earth surface area. Also, the days are longer in the summer, so these two factors increase the light budget. Hydrocarbons come from many sources, but the fact that internal combustion engines burn gasoline, diesel fuel, and other mixtures of hydrocarbons makes them a ready source.", "Complete combustion results in carbon dioxide and water, but anything short of complete combustion will be a source of hydrocarbons, including some of the original ones found in the fuels that are released during re\ufb01ning, transport, and during refueling, as well as new ones formed during combustion. The compounds that become free radicals, like the oxides of nitrogen, are also readily available from internal combustion engines, since the three quarters of the troposphere is made up of molecular nitrogen (N2). Although N2 is relatively not chemically reactive, with the high temperature and pressure conditions in the engine, it does combine with the O2 from the fuel/air mix and generates oxides that can provide electrons to the photochemical reactions. The pollutant most closely associated with smog is ozone (O3), which forms from the photochemical reactions mentioned above. In the early days of smog control efforts, O3 was used more as a surrogate or marker for smog, since one could not really take a sample of smog. Later, O3 became recognized as a pollutant in its own right since it was increasingly linked to respiratory diseases. Nonattainment NSR and (2) Prevention of Signi\ufb01cant Deterioration (PSD). The nonattainment NSR rules are designed to assist in efforts to attain and maintain compliance with the NAAQS, applying to pollutants for which an area has been designated as not meeting one or more of the NAAQS, i.e. a nonattainment area. These standards are summarized in Table 3.3. The nonattainment NSR rules assumes that minor sources and minor modi\ufb01cations do not signi\ufb01cantly affect the attainment status, nor do they interfere with plans to achieve compliance with the NAAQS. Some of the key provisions are Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER), offsets, alternative site analysis, and compliance certi\ufb01cation.14 In the United States, PSD rules are designed to curtail transport of pollution to areas whose air is presently meeting standards. The CAAA90 de\ufb01nes the amount of deterioration that can be considered insigni\ufb01cant. PSD is needed to protect public health and welfare; and to preserve, protect, and enhance the air quality in national parks, national wilderness areas, national I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION monuments, national seashores, and other areas of special national or regional natural, recreational, scenic, or historic value. PSD also requires that economic growth will occur in a manner consistent with the preservation of existing clean air resources. The PSD provisions also ask that regulatory actions be viewed in a manner that allows for certain levels of air pollutant releases from the perspective of the cumulative impact in any area. This provision is analogous to a virtual bubble over a group of stacks and vents, addressing the total releases under the bubble instead of emissions from each of the sources. The permit applicant can conduct a netting exercise, i.e. the demonstration that by aggregating emission changes which have occurred at a source over a contemporaneous time period (see Figure 3.10). These resulting emission changes are then reviewed to determine if the proposed project must undergo NSR. The key is to account for other emission decreases and increases which have occurred and are expected to occur over the contemporaneous timeframe. The applicant must demonstrate that the overall net increase in emissions would not be \u201csigni\ufb01cant\u201d.c The provisions governing netting differ for each attainment area, e.g. netting is more stringent in serious, severe, and extreme ozone nonattainment 11 areas. Basically, PSD rules must be followed when a company adds a new source or modi\ufb01es an existing source in an area designated as attainment of the NAAQS under CAAA90. The PSD rules need to be addressed for the pollutants for which the area is classi\ufb01ed as attainment with the NAAQS. The rules are a safeguard for ensuring that compliance with the NAAQS continues in time. As with nonattainment NSR, the strategy with PSD rules assumes that minor new sources and minor modi\ufb01cations do not signi\ufb01cantly affect the air quality. The distinctive requirements of PSD are Best Available Control Technology (BACT), air quality c As in NEPA, \u201csigni\ufb01cant\u201d does not necessarily mean the change must meet some level of statistical con\ufb01dence (e.g. alpha level), but is the more general term (e.g. substantial or important). I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.7 AIR POLLUTION LAWS analysisdmodeling (allowable increments), and analysis of impacts of the project on visibility, vegetations, and soils. Preserving air quality depends on knowing which sources are contributing to the deterioration.", "When the results of air pollution measurements are interpreted, one of the \ufb01rst questions asked by scientists, engineers, and policy makers is where did it come from? Sorting out the various sources of pollution is known as source apportionment. A number of tools are used to try to locate the sources of pollutants. A widely used approach is the \u201csourceereceptor model\u201d or as it is more commonly known, the receptor model. Using receptor models can be distinguished from the dispersion models in that dispersion models usually start from the source and estimate the direction and mixing of the plume and its contaminants is expected to move (see Chapter 21). Conversely, receptor models are based upon measurements taken in the ambient environment and from these observations, make use of algorithms and functions to determine pollution sources. 3.7.2.3 Urban Air Pollution Cities that failed to achieve human health standards as required by NAAQS were required to reach attainment within 6 years of passage of CAAA90, although Los Angeles was given 20 years, since it was dealing with major challenges in reducing ozone concentrations. Almost 100 cities failed to achieve ozone standards, and were ranked from marginal to extreme. The more severe the pollution, the more rigorous controls required, although additional time was given to those extreme cities to achieve the standard. Measures included new or enhanced inspection/maintenance (I/M) programs for autos; installation of vapor recovery systems at gas stations and other controls of hydrocarbon emissions from small sources; and new transportation controls to offset increases in the number of miles traveled by vehicles. Major stationary sources of nitrogen oxides were also required to reduce emissions. The 41 cities failing to meet carbon monoxide standards were ranked moderate or serious; states may have to initiate or upgrade inspection and maintenance programs and adopt transportation controls. The 72 urban areas that did not meet PM10 standards were ranked moderate; states will have to implement Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT); use of wood stoves and \ufb01replaces may have to be curtailed. 3.7.2.4 Mobile Sources As mentioned, SIPs must address mobile sources. However, mobile sources are problematic for both conventional and toxic air pollutants. Vehicular tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen were to be reduced with the 1994 models. Standards now have to be maintained over a longer vehicle life. Evaporative emission controls were mentioned as a means for reducing hydrocarbons. Beginning in 1992, \u201coxyfuel\u201d gasolines blended with alcohol began to be sold during winter months in cities with severe carbon monoxide problems. In 1995, reformulated gasolines with aromatic compounds were introduced in the nine cities with the worst ozone problems; but other cities were also allowed to participate. Later, a pilot program introduced 150,000 low emitting vehicles to California that met tighter emission limits through a combination of vehicle technology and substitutes for gasoline or blends of substitutes with gasoline. Other states are also participating in this initiative. Air toxic emissions from vehicles and other mobile sources are a growing concern. Near-roadway environments can be substantial exposure pathways to benzene and other organic air pollutants. And, in nations that have not banned leaded gasoline, near-roadway exposures can be a major contributor to Pb body burden.11 Air toxic exposure from mobile sources, therefore, is particularly worrisome for children, given the neurological, developmental, and cancer risks. 3.7.2.5 Toxic Air Pollutants In the 1990 amendments, the number of toxic air pollutants covered by the Clean Air Act was increased to 189 compounds in 1990. As of 2013, 187 hazardous air pollutants are listed. Most of these are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and/or toxic to neurological, endocrine, reproductive, and developmental systems. Actually, this list includes many more than 189 chemical compounds. For example, the coke oven emission category includes thousands of chemical species, and the metals are listed as metals and their compounds. All 189 air toxic emissions were to be reduced within 10 years. The EPA published a list of source categories and issued Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for each category over a speci\ufb01ed timetable. The next step beyond MACT standards was to begin to address chronic health risks that would still be expected if the sources meet these standards. This is known as residual risk reduction. The \ufb01rst step was to assess the health risks from air toxics emitted by stationary sources that emit air toxics after the technology-based, i.e. MACT, standards are in place.", "The residual risk provision sets additional standards if MACT does not protect public health with an \u201cample margin of safety\u201d, as well as additional standards if they are needed to prevent adverse environmental effects. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION Ample margin of safety met Ample margin of safety with consideration of costs, technical feasibility and Risk unsafe: action needed to reduce risks other factors 10&#2;6 10&#2;4 Increasing population risk FIGURE 3.11 Ample margin of safety based on airborne contaminant\u2019s cancer risk. The actual thresholds between the three risk categories can vary by pollutants, depending on available control technologies, as well as by jurisdiction, statutes and regulations. For example, the middle category could be much smaller than the other two if control technologies are not available or are quite expensive, e.g. ample margin of safety would be de\ufb01ned as a risk less than 10 6, but the unsafe category could be a risk greater than 10 5.5. What an \u201cample margin of safety\u201d means is still up for debate, but one proposal for airborne carcinogens is shown in Figure 3.11. That is, if a source can demonstrate that it will not contribute to greater than 10 6 cancer risk, then it meets the ample margin of safety requirements for air toxics. The ample margin needed to protect populations from noncancer toxins, such as neurotoxins, is being debated, but it will involve the application of some type of hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ is the ratio of the potential exposure to the substance to the level at which no adverse effects are expected. An HQ <1 means that the exposure levels to a chemical should not lead to adverse health effects. Conversely, an HQ >1 means that adverse health effects are possible. Due to uncertainties and the feedback that is coming from the business and scienti\ufb01c communities, the ample margin of safety threshold is presently ranging from HQ \u00bc 0.2 to HQ \u00bc 1.0. So, if a source can demonstrate that it will not contribute to greater than the threshold for noncancer risk (whether it is 0.2, 1.0, or some other level established by the federal government), it meets the ample margin of safety requirements for air toxics. An air toxics source is designated as \u201cmajor\u201d if it emits 10 or more tons per year of any of the listed toxic air pollutants, or 25 or more tons per year of a mixture of air toxics. In addition to releases from stacks and vents, these emission totals include equipment leaks and releases during transfer. Area sources are those facilities that emit less than 10 tons per year of a single air toxic, or less than 25 tons per year of a combination of air toxics.12 The MACTs are customized for speci\ufb01c source categories. For example, semiconductor manufacturing, semiconductor packaging, printed wiring board manufacturing, and display manufacturing, each with speci\ufb01c air toxics that apply (see Table 3.5). In this case, the list includes both organic contaminants and metals. In addition, the manufacturer must be aware of upcoming plans to use other chemicals used in its processes computer industry MACTs address. The company would be encouraged to \ufb01nd less hazardous substances as substitutes, if possible.

FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.7 AIR POLLUTION LAWS 3.7.2.6 Acid Deposition The introduction of acidic substances to \ufb02ora, soil, and surface waters has been collectively called \u201cacid rain\u201d or \u201cacid deposition\u201d. Acid rain is generally limited to the so-called \u201cwet\u201d deposition (low pH precipitation), but acidic materials can also reach the earth\u2019s surface by dry deposition (\u201cacid aerosols\u201d) and acid fog (e.g. airborne droplets of water that contains sulfuric acid or nitric acid).", "Generally, acid deposition is not simply materials of pH <7, but usually of pH <5.7, since \u201cnormal\u201d rainfall has a pH of about 5.7, due to the ionization of absorbed carbon dioxide (see discussions in Chapters 5 and 21). There is much concern about acid deposition because aquatic biota can be signi\ufb01cantly harmed by only slight changes in pH. The problem of acidi\ufb01ed soils and surface waters is a function of both the increase in acidity of the precipitation and the ability of the receiving waters and soil to resist the change in soil pH. So, it is the contribution of the human-generated acidic materials, especially the oxides of sulfur and the oxides of nitrogen, which are considered to be the sources of \u201cacid rain\u201d. The 1990 amendments introduced a two-phase, market-based system to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants by more than half. Total annual emissions were to be capped at 8.9 million tons, a reduction of 10 million tons from the 1980 baseline levels. Power facilities were issued allowances based on \ufb01xed emission rates set in the law, as well as their previous fossil-fuel use. Penalties were issued for exceedances, although the allowances could be banked or traded within the fuel burning industry. In Phase I, large, high-emission plants in eastern and midwestern regions of the United States were required to reduce emissions by 1995. Phase II began in 2000 to set emission limits on smaller, cleaner plants and further tightening of the Phase I plants\u2019 emissions. All sources were required to install continuous emission monitors to assure compliance (see Chapter 24). Emissions of the oxides of nitrogen were also to be reduced; however, the approach differed from the oxides of sulfur, using EPA performance standards, instead of the two-phase system. The 1990 amendments required a National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) to evaluate air toxics, i.e. a state-of-the-science screening tool to prioritize pollutants, emission sources, and locations of interest for further study in order to gain a better understanding of risks. NATA provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from inhaling air toxics. NATA assessments use general information about sources to calculate estimates of risks, erring on the side of overestimating rather than underestimating risks. The estimates of cancer and noncancer health effects are based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources, providing a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remain unchanged. The NATA follows a four step process13: 1. Compiling a national air toxics emissions inventory of outdoor stationary and mobile sources (i.e. the National Emissions Inventory (NEI)). 2. Estimating ambient concentrations of air toxics based on air dispersion and photochemical models. 3. Calculating population exposure estimates using a screening-level inhalation exposure model. 4. Characterizing potential cancer and noncancer public health risks due to inhaling air toxics. The \ufb01rst NATA was in 1996 and the most recent assessment is for 2005. The 2005 assessment addresses the inhalation of 178 air toxics, for cancer and noncancer risk, plus noncancer risk for diesel PM. The 2005 NATA results are summarized in Figure 3.12. Note that the route of exposure is assumed to be inhalation, so the NATA does not include other routes (e.g. ingestion and dermal exposure to the same air toxic). For cumulative cancer risks15 from all air toxics compounds listed as carcinogenic or likely to be carcinogenic to humans are estimated by combining the risks at the census tracts level. In 2005, the combined upper bound lifetime cancer risk from these compounds exceeded 10 in 1 million risk and more than 2 million people live in census tracts where the combined upper bound lifetime cancer risk from these compounds exceeded 100 in 1 million risk. The overall national average risk in the United States is 36 in a million. For cumulative noncancer risks,16 HQs would ideally combine pollutants that cause the same adverse effects by the same toxic mechanism. However, because detailed information on mechanisms is unavailable for most air toxics, a simpler and more conservative method was used. Many of the pollutants in this assessment cause adverse effects in humans or animals by irritating the lining of the respiratory system or by causing various effects to the nervous system. Additive effects are represented by a \u201chazard index\u201d, i.e. the sum of the HQs of the air toxics compounds that affect the respiratory or nervous system.", "In 2005, the respiratory hazard index was dominated by a single substance, acrolein. The respiratory hazard index exceeded 1.0 for nearly the entire U.S. population, and exceeded 10 for more than 22 million people. The neurological hazard index was similarly dominated by manganese compounds, with minor contributions by cyanide compounds, ethylene oxide, and mercury compounds. The neurological hazard index exceeded 1.0 for fewer than 350,000 people in the United States. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION 3.7.2.7 Protecting the Ozone Layer breakdown of the ozone (see Discussion box: Good The ozone layer \ufb01lters out substantial amounts of Ozone, Bad Ozone). UV radiation from the sun. This UV radiation can cause The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments required a skin damage andleadtocertain formsofcancer, phase-out of the production and use of ozone-including the most fatal form, melanoma. Therefore, destroying chemicals. By 1996, the United States no the international scienti\ufb01c and policy communities longer produced many propellants and other chemicals have been concerned about the release of chemicals that destroy the ozone layer, e.g. chloro\ufb02uorocarbons that \ufb01nd their way to stratosphere and accelerate the (CFCs), halons, and methyl chloroform. 3.7 AIR POLLUTION LAWS GOOD OZONE, BAD OZONE Like the three rules of real estate, i.e. location, location, and location, where a chemical is found in the atmosphere can make a difference as to whether it is desirable or harmful. As shown in Figure 3.13, ground-level (tropsospheric) ozone (O3) concentrations are small, but increase in the stratosphere. Approximately 90% of the atmosphere\u2019s O3 lies in the layer between 10 and 17 km above the earth\u2019s surface up to an altitude of about 50 km. This is commonly known as the ozone layer. Most of the remaining ozone is in the lower part of the atmosphere, the troposphere. The stratospheric O3 concentrations must be protected, while the tropospheric O3 concentrations must be reduced. The stratosphere ranges from 16 to 48 km above the earth\u2019s surface. Stratospheric ozone (the \u201cgood ozone\u201d) absorbs most of the biologically damaging UV sunlight (UV-B), allowing only a small amount to reach the earth\u2019s surface. The absorption of UV radiation by ozone generates heat, which is why Figure 3.13 shows an increase in temperature in the stratosphere. Without the \ufb01ltering action of the ozone layer, greater amounts of the sun\u2019s UV-B radiation would penetrate the atmosphere and would reach the earth\u2019s surface. Many experimental studies of plants and animals and clinical studies of humans have shown the harmful effects of excessive exposure to UV-B radiation. Scientists have been studying the stratospheric ozone layer since the 1970s. In the 1980s, scienti\ufb01c evidence overwhelmingly indicated that the ozone layer was being depleted. The so-called \u201cozone hole\u201d above the South Pole has appeared each year during the Antarctic winter, growing larger in extent as the area of the continental United States. The concentration of O3 decreased by 5% from 1978 to 1997. Two of the largest ozone holes were observed in 2006, the largest of 29 million square kilometers (11.4 million square miles). These \ufb01ndings spurred over 190 nations, including the major industrialized nations in Europe and North America to sign Montreal Protocol in 1997, calling for the elimination of chemicals that destroy stratospheric ozone.17 In the troposphere, O3 exposure is destructive (\u201cbad ozone\u201d), because it is highly reactive with tissues, leading to ecological and welfare effects, such as forest damage and reduced crop production, and human health effects, especially cardiopulmonary diseases. These compounds are often highly persistent; in some cases, taking decades to degrade. This means that nearly 60 years will be needed to restore the stratospheric ozone layer to its preindustrial condition. Indeed, ending the production and use does not end the reaction of compounds with O3. Ozone-destroying chemicals already in the stratosphere are still moving through the troposphere and will arrive within the next few years. The CFCs, along with other chlorine-and bromine-containing compounds, can accelerate the depletion of stratospheric O3 layer. CFCs were \ufb01rst developed in the early 1930s for many industrial, commercial, and household products. They are generally compressible, non\ufb02ammable, and nonreactive, which led to many CFC uses, including as coolants for commercial and home refrigeration units, and aerosol propellants. In 1973, chlorine was found to catalyze ozone destruction. Catalytic destruction of ozone removes the odd-numbered oxygen species (atomic oxygen [O] and ozone [O3]), but leaves the chlorine unaffected. A complex scenario involving atmospheric dynamics, solar radiation, and chemical reactions accounts for spring thinning of the ozone layer at the earth\u2019s poles.", "Global monitoring of ozone levels from space using National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instrument has shown profound downward trends in ozone concentrations at all of the earth\u2019s latitudes, except the tropics. In the high-energy stratosphere, the compounds undergo hundreds of catalytic cycles involving O3 before the CFCs are scavenged by other chemicals. CAAA90 built upon the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, the international treaty where nations agreed to reduce or eliminate ozone-destroying gas production and uses of chemicals that pose a threat to the ozone layer. The amendments further restricted the use, emissions, and disposal of these chemicals, including the phasing out of the production of CFCs, as well as other chemicals that lead to ozone attacking halogens, such as tetrachloromethane (commonly called carbon tetrachloride) and methyl chloride by the year 2000, and methyl chloroform by 2002. The act also will freeze the production of CFCs in 2015 and requires that CFCs be phased out completely by 2030. Companies servicing air conditioning for vehicles are now required to purchase certi\ufb01ed recycling equipment and train employees. EPA regulations require reduced emissions from all other refrigeration sectors to lowest achievable levels. \u201cNonessential\u201d CFC applications are prohibited. The act increases the labeling requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) by mandating the placement of warning labels on all containers and products (such as cooling I.

The Clean Air Act includes other steps to protect the ozone layer, including encouraging the development of \u201cozone-friendly\u201d substitutes for ozone-destroying chemicals. Numerous systems, products, and processes have been redesigned, e.g. refrigerators manufactured in the United States and many other nations no longer use CFCs. Indeed, the search for more environmentally benign substances has been underway for some time. One set of potential substitutes is the hydrochloro\ufb02uorocarbons (HCFCs). Obviously, the HCFC molecules contain Cl atoms, but the hydrogen increases the reactivity of the HCFCs with other tropospheric chemical species. These low altitude reactions decrease the probability of a Cl atom \ufb01nding its way to the stratosphere. Hydro\ufb02uorocarbons (HFCs) are potential substitutes that lack chlorine. There are still numerous challenges, such as \ufb01nding substitutes for CFCs used in certain biomedical applications. Agricultural substitutions can also be challenging. For example, ozone-depleting methyl bromide is still used because farmers have not yet found an effective alternative pesticide. 3.7.3 Solid and Hazardous Wastes Laws Although the Clean Air Act and its amendments comprise the most notable example of U.S. legislation passed to protect air quality, other laws address air pollution more indirectly. For example, air pollution around solid and hazardous waste facilities can be problematic. The two principal U.S. laws governing solid wastes are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and Superfund. The RCRA law covers both hazardous and solid wastes, while Superfund and its amendments generally address abandoned hazardous waste sites. RCRA addresses active hazardous waste sites. 3.7.3.1 Management of Active Hazardous Waste Facilities With RCRA, the US EPA received the authority to control hazardous waste throughout the waste\u2019s entire life cycle, known as the \u201ccradle-to-grave\u201d. This means that manifests must be prepared to keep track of the waste, including its generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal. RCRA also set forth a framework for the management of nonhazardous wastes in Subtitle D. The Federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) to RCRA required the phase out of land disposal of hazardous waste. HSWA also increased the federal enforcement authority related to hazardous waste actions, set more stringent hazardous waste management standards, and provided for a comprehensive underground storage tank (UST) program. The 1986 amendments to RCRA allowed the federal government to address potential environmental problems from USTs for petroleum and other hazardous substances. 3.7.3.2 Addressing Abandoned Hazardous Wastes The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) is commonly known as Superfund. Congress enacted it in 1980 to create a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries and to provide extensive federal authority for responding directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the environment.", "The Superfund law established prohibitions and requirements concerning closed and abandoned hazardous waste sites; established provisions for the liability of persons responsible for releases of hazardous waste at these sites; and established a trust fund to provide I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.7 AIR POLLUTION LAWS for cleanup when no responsible party could be identi\ufb01ed. The CERCLA response actions include: \u0081 Short-term removals, where actions may be taken to address releases or threatened releases requiring prompt response. This is intended to eliminate or reduce exposures to possible contaminants. \u0081 Long-term remedial response actions to reduce or eliminate the hazards and risks associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances that are serious, but not immediately life threatening. These actions can be conducted only at sites listed on EPA\u2019s National Priorities List (NPL). Superfund also revised the National Contingency Plan (NCP), which sets guidelines and procedures required when responding to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. CERCLA was amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) in 1986. These amendments stressed the importance of permanent remedies and innovative treatment technologies in cleaning up hazardous waste sites. SARA required that Superfund actions consider the standards and requirements found in other state and federal environmental laws and regulations and provided revised enforcement authorities and new settlement tools. The amendments also increased state involvement in every aspect of the Superfund program, increased the focus on human health problems posed by hazardous waste sites, encouraged more extensive citizen participation in site cleanup decisions, and increased the size of the Superfund trust fund. SARA also mandate that the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) be revised to ensure the adequacy of the assessment of the relative degree of risk to human health and the environment posed by uncontrolled hazardous waste sites that may be placed on the NPL. 3.7.4 Environmental Product and Consumer Protection Laws Most authorizing legislation targeted at protecting and improving the environment is based on actions needed in speci\ufb01c media (i.e. air, water, soil, and sediment), however, certain laws have been written in an attempt to prevent environmental and public health problems by focusing on potential exposures to substances during product development, before hazardous ingredients reach the market, and during product usage. In this way, air pollution is prevented to some extent at the potential source, such as chemical ingredients in products that can be sources of indoor air pollution. The predominant product laws designed to protect people and ecosystems in the United States from contaminants before they reach the market and at the point of use are the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA); the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The European Union has similar measures that categorize product ingredients. Such laws differ from the previously discussed legislation in that they look at products in terms of potential risks for yet-to-be-released products and estimated risks for products already in use. If the risks are unacceptable, new products may not be released as formulated or the uses will be strictly limited to applications that meet minimum risk standards. For products already in the marketplace, the risks are periodically reviewed. For example, pesticides have to be periodically reregistered with the government. This reregistration process consists of reviews of new research and information regarding health and environmental impacts discovered since the product\u2019s last registration. FIFRA\u2019s major mandate is to control the distribution, sale, and applications of pesticides. This not only includes studying the health and environmental consequences of pesticide usage, but also to require that those applying the pesticides register when they purchase the products. Commercial applicators must be certi\ufb01ed by successfully passing exams on the safe use of pesticides. FIFRA requires that the EPA license any pesticide used in the United States. The licensing and registration makes sure that pesticide is properly labeled and will not cause unreasonable environmental harm. An important, recent product production law is the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), including new provisions to protect children and limit their risks to carcinogens and other toxic substances. The law is actually an amendment to FIFRA and FFDCA that includes new requirements for safety standarddreasonable certainty of no harmdthat must be applied to all pesticides used on foods.", "FQPA mandates a single, health-based standard for all pesticides in all foods; gives special protections for infants and children; expedites approval of pesticides likely to be safer than those in use; provides incentives for effective crop protection tools for farmers; and requires regular re-evaluation of pesticide registrations and tolerances so that the scienti\ufb01c data supporting pesticide registrations include current \ufb01ndings. There is some ongoing debate about the actual routes and pathways that contribute the most to pesticide exposure. For example, certain pesticides seem to be most likely to be present in dietary pathways (e.g. the purchased food contains the pesticide), nondietary ingestion (e.g. the food is contaminated by airborne pesticides in the home or the people living in the home touch contaminated surfaces and then touch the food), and dermal exposure (people come into contact with I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION the pesticide and it in\ufb01ltrates the skin). This seems to vary considerably by the type of pesticide, but it suf\ufb01ces to say that the air pathways are important. Another product-related development in recent years is the screening program for endocrine disrupting substances. Research suggests a link between exposure to certain chemicals and damage to the endocrine system in humans and wildlife. Because of the potentially serious consequences of human exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, Congress added speci\ufb01c language on endocrine disruption in the FQPA and recent amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The FQPA mandated that the EPA develop an endocrine disruptor screening program, and the SDWA authorizes EPA to screen endocrine disruptors found in drinking water systems. In the United States, rapid screening programs are being used to detect and characterize the toxicity of chemicals. The scienti\ufb01c data needed for the estimated 87,000 chemicals in commerce does not exist to conduct adequate assessments of potential risks. The screening provides information to decide appropriate regulatory action by prioritizing chemicals for their potential to elicit toxic effects and their potential exposures in near-\ufb01eld scenarios (e.g. indoors, product use) and far-\ufb01eld scenarios (e.g. ambient air exposures). Thousands of chemicals undergo sorting into four categories according to the available existing, scienti\ufb01cally relevant information: 1. Category 1 chemicals have suf\ufb01cient, scienti\ufb01cally relevant information to determine that they are not likely to interact with the estrogen, androgen, or thyroid systems. This category includes some polymers and certain exempted chemicals. 2. Category 2 chemicals have insuf\ufb01cient information to determine whether they are likely to interact with the estrogen, androgen, or thyroid systems, thus will need screening data. 3. Category 3 chemicals have suf\ufb01cient screening data to indicate endocrine activity, but data to characterize actual effects are inadequate and will need testing. 4. Category 4 chemicals already have suf\ufb01cient data for the EPA to perform a hazard assessment. TSCA gives the EPA the authority to track 75,000 industrial chemicals currently produced or imported to the United States. This is accomplished through screening the chemicals and requiring that reporting and testing be done for any substance that presents a hazard to human health or the environment. If a chemical poses a potential or actual risk that is unreasonable, the EPA may ban the manufacture and import of that chemical. The EPA has tracked thousands of new chemicals being developed by industries each year, if those chemicals have either unknown or dangerous characteristics. This information is used to determine the type of control that these chemicals would need to protect human health and the environment. Manufacturers and importers of chemical substances \ufb01rst submitted information about chemical substances already on the market during an initial inventory. Since the initial inventory was published, commercial manufacturers or importers of substances not on the inventory have been subsequently required to submit notices to the EPA, which has developed guidance about how to identify chemical substances in order to assign a unique and unambiguous description of each substance for the inventory. The categories include: \u0081 polymeric substances; \u0081 certain chemical substances containing varying carbon chains; \u0081 products containing two or more substances, formulated, and statutory mixtures; and \u0081 chemical substances of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products, and biological materials (\u201cUVCB\u201d substance). 3.8 AIR POLLUTION BEFORE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION While the programs to address air pollution are recent, controlling air pollution is rooted in Antiquity. One of the reasons the tribes of early history were nomadic was to move periodically away from the stench of the animal, vegetable, and human wastes they generated.", "When the tribesmen learned to use \ufb01re, they used it for millennia in a way that \ufb01lled the air inside their living quarters with the products of incomplete combustion. Examples of this can still be seen today in some of the more primitive parts of the world. After its invention, the chimney removed the combustion products and cooking smells from the living quarters, but for centuries the open \ufb01re in the \ufb01replace caused both indoors and outdoors to be smoky. In AD 61, the Roman philosopher Seneca reported thus on conditions in Rome: As soon as I had gotten out of the heavy air of Rome and from the stink of the smoky chimneys thereof, which, being stirred, poured forth whatever pestilential vapors and soot they had enclosed in them, I felt an alteration of my disposition. Air pollution, associated with burning wood in Tut-bury Castle in Nottingham, was considered \u201cunendurable\u201d by Eleanor of Aquitaine, the wife of King Henry II of England, and caused her to move in the year 1157. One hundred sixteen years later, coal burning was prohibited in London; and in 1306, Edward I issued a royal proclamation enjoining the use of sea coal in I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.9 AIR POLLUTION AND THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION furnaces. Elizabeth I barred the burning of coal in London when Parliament was in session. The repeated necessity for such royal action would seem to indicate that coal continued to be burned despite these edicts. By 1661, the pollution of London had become bad enough to prompt John Evelyn to submit a brochure \u201cFumifugium, or the Inconvenience of the Aer, and Smoake of London Dissipated (together with some remedies humbly proposed)\u201d to King Charles II and Parliament. This brochure has been reprinted and is recommended to students of air pollution.18 It proposes means of air pollution control that are still viable in the twenty-\ufb01rst century. The principal industries associated with the production of air pollution in the centuries preceding the Industrial Revolution were metallurgy, ceramics, and preservation of animal products. In the bronze and iron ages, villages were exposed to dust and fumes from many sources. Native copper and gold were forged, and clay was baked and glazed to form pottery and bricks before 4000 BC. Iron was in common use and leather was tanned before 1000 BC. Most of the methods of modern metallurgy were known before AD 1. Early metalworkers relied on charcoal rather than coal or coke. However, coal was mined and used for fuel before AD 1000, although it was not made into coke until about 1600; and coke did not enter metallurgical practice signi\ufb01cantly until about 1700. These industries and their ef\ufb02uents as they existed before 1556 are best described in the book De Re Metallica published in that year by Georg Bauer, known as Georgius Agricola (Figure 3.14). This book was translated into English and published in 1912 by Herbert Clark Hoover and his wife.19 Combustion in kilns was problematic even before the Industrial Revolution. For example, ceramics and animal product preservation industries produced air pollution from the combustion of materials to heat kilns (see Figures 3.15 and 3.16, respectively). 3.9 AIR POLLUTION AND THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION The Industrial Revolution was the consequence of the harnessing of steam to provide power to pump water and move machinery. This began in the early years of the eighteenth century, when Savery, Papin, and Newcomen designed their pumping engines, and culminated in 1784 in Watt\u2019s reciprocating engine. The reciprocating steam engine reigned supreme until it was displaced by the steam turbine in the twentieth century. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION Steam engines and steam turbines require steam boilers, which, until the advent of the nuclear reactor, were \ufb01red by vegetable or fossil fuels. During most of the nineteenth century, coal was the principal fuel, although some oil was used for steam generation late in the century. The predominant air pollution problem of the nineteenth century was smoke and ash from the burning of coal or oil in the boiler furnaces of stationary power plants, locomotives, and marine vessels, and in home heating \ufb01replaces and furnaces. Great Britain took the lead in addressing this problem, and, in the words of Sir Hugh Beaver20:", "By 1819, there was suf\ufb01cient pressure for Parliament to appoint the \ufb01rst of a whole dynasty of committees \u201cto consider how far persons using steam engines and furnaces could work them in a manner less prejudicial to public health and comfort\u201d. This committee con\ufb01rmed the practicability of smoke prevention, as so many succeeding committees were to do, but as was often again to be experienced, nothing was done. In 1843, there was another Parliamentary Select Committee, and in 1845, a third. In that same year, during the height of the great railway boom, an act of Parliament disposed of trouble from locomotives once and for all (!) by laying down the dictum that they must consume their own smoke. The Town Improvement Clauses Act 2 years later applied the same panacea to factory furnaces. Then 1853 and 1856 witnessed two acts of Parliament dealing speci\ufb01cally with London and empowering the police to enforce provisions against smoke from furnaces, public baths, and washhouses and furnaces used in the working of steam vessels on the Thames. Smoke and ash abatement in Great Britain was considered to be a health agency responsibility and was so con\ufb01rmed by the \ufb01rst Public Health Act of 1848 and the later ones of 1866 and 1875. Air pollution from the emerging chemical industry was considered a separate matter and was made the responsibility of the Alkali Inspectorate created by the Alkali Act of 1863. In the United States, smoke abatement (as air pollution control was then known) was considered a municipal responsibility. There were no federal or state smoke I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.10 AIR POLLUTION EVENTS IN THE TWENTIETH AND TWENTY-FIRST CENTURIES abatement laws or regulations. The \ufb01rst municipal ordinances and regulations limiting the emission of black smoke and ash appeared in the 1880s and were directed toward industrial, locomotive, and marine rather than domestic sources. As the nineteenth century drew to a close, the pollution of the air of mill towns the world over had risen to a peak; damage to vegetation from the smelting of sul\ufb01de ores was recognized as a problem everywhere it was practiced. The principal technological developments in the control of air pollution by engineering during the nineteenth century were the stoker for mechanical \ufb01ring of coal, the scrubber for removing acid gases from ef\ufb02uent gas streams, cyclone, and bag house dust collectors, and the introduction of physical and chemical principles into process design. 3.10 AIR POLLUTION EVENTS IN THE TWENTIETH AND TWENTY-FIRST CENTURIES 3.10.1 Early Twentieth Century Events During the period 1900e1925 there were great changes in the technology of both the production of air pollution and its engineering control, but no signi\ufb01cant changes in legislation, regulations, understanding of the problem, or public attitudes toward the problem. As cities and factories grew in size, the severity of the pollution problem increased. One of the principal technological changes in the production of pollution was the replacement of the steam engine by the electric motor as the means of operating machinery and pumping water. This change transferred the smoke and ash emission from the boiler house of the factory to the boiler house of the electric generating station. At the start of this period, coal was hand-\ufb01red in the boiler house; by the middle of the period, it was mechanically \ufb01red by stokers; by the end of the period, pulverized coal, oil, and gas \ufb01ring had begun to take over. Each form of \ufb01ring produced its own characteristic emissions to the atmosphere. At the start of this period, steam locomotives came into the heart of the larger cities. By the end of the period, the urban terminals of many railroads had been electri\ufb01ed, thereby transferring much air pollution from the railroad right-of-way to the electric generating station. The replacement of coal by oil in many applications decreased ash emissions from those sources. There was rapid technological change in industry. However, the most signi\ufb01cant change was the rapid increase in the number of automobiles from almost none at the turn of the century to millions by 1925 (Table 3.6). The principal technological changes in the engineering control of air pollution were the perfection of the TABLE 3.6 Number of New Foreign and Domestic Trucks, Buses, and Automobiles Sold Annually in the United States.", "Sales for Years 2000, 2005, and 2010 Include Leases and Are Rounded to Nearest 1000 Year Total Vehicles 1900 4192 1905 25,000 1910 187,000 1915 969,930 1920 2,227,347 1925 4,265,830 1930 3,362,820 1935 3,971,241 1940 4,472,286 1945 725,215 1950 8,003,056 1955 9,169,292 1960 7,869,221 1965 11,057,366 1970 8,239,257 1975 8,985,012 1980 8,067,309 1985 11,045,784 1990 9,295,732 2000 14,137,000 2005 17,445,000 2010 11,772,000 Source: U.S. Census. motor-driven fan, which allowed large-scale gas-treating systems to be built; the invention of the electrostatic precipitator, which made particulate control in many processes feasible; and chemical engineering applications and the design of process equipment, which made the control of gas and vapor ef\ufb02uents feasible. 3.10.2 Events during 1925e1950 In this period, present-day air pollution problems and solutions emerged. The Meuse Valley, Belgium, episode21 occurred in 1930; the Donora, Pennsylvania, episode23 occurred in 1948; and the Poza Rica, Mexico, episode23 in 1950. Smog was \ufb01rst recorded in Los Angeles in the 1940s (Figure 3.8). The Trail, British Columbia, smelter arbitration24 was completed in 1941. The \ufb01rst National Air Pollution Symposium in the United States was held in Pasadena, California25 in I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION 1949, and the \ufb01rst United States Technical Conference on Air Pollution26 was held in Washington, DC, in 1950. The \ufb01rst large-scale surveys of air pollution were undertakendSalt Lake City, Utah27 (1926); New York City,28 (1937); and Leicester, England29 (1939). Air pollution research got a start in California. The Technical Foundation for Air Pollution Meteorology was established in the search for means of disseminating and protecting against chemical, biological, and nuclear warfare agents. Toxicology came of age. The stage was set for the air pollution scienti\ufb01c and technological explosion of the second half of the twentieth century. A major technological change was the building of natural gas pipelines, and where this occurred, there was rapid displacement of coal and oil as home heating fuels with dramatic improvement in air quality; as evidenced by the much publicized decrease in black smoke in Pittsburgh (Figure 3.17) and St. Louis. The diesel locomotive began to displace the steam locomotive, thereby slowing the pace of railroad electri\ufb01cation. The internal combustion engine bus started its displacement of the electri\ufb01ed streetcar. The automobile continued to proliferate (Table 3.6). During this period, no signi\ufb01cant national air pollution legislation or regulations were adopted anywhere in the world. However, the \ufb01rst state air pollution (A) law in the United States was adopted by California in 1947. 3.10.3 Events during 1950e1980 In Great Britain, a major air pollution disaster hit London in 1952, resulting in the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1956 and an expansion of the authority of the Alkali Inspectorate.30 The principal changes that resulted were in the means of heating homes. Previously, most heating was done by burning soft coal on grates in separate \ufb01replaces in each room. A successful effort was made to substitute smokeless fuels for the soft coal used in this manner, and central or electrical heating for \ufb01replace heating. The outcome was a decrease in \u201csmoke\u201d concentration, as measured by the blackness of paper \ufb01lters through which British air was passed, decreasing from 175 mgm 3in1958to75 mgm 3in 1968.31 During these two decades, almost every country in Europe, as well as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, experienced serious air pollution in its larger cities. As a result, these countries were the \ufb01rst to enact national air pollution control legislation. By 1980, major national air pollution research centers had been set up at the Warren Springs Laboratory, Stevenage, England; the (B) I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3.10 AIR POLLUTION EVENTS IN THE TWENTIETH AND TWENTY-FIRST CENTURIES Institut National de la Sante\u00b4 et de las Recherche Medicale at Le Visinet, France; the Rijksinstituut Voor de Volksgezondheid, Bilthoven and the Instituut voor Gezondheidstechniek-TNO, Delft, The Netherlands; the Statens Naturvardsverk, Solna, Sweden; the Institut fu\u00a8 r Wasser-Bodenund Luft-hygiene, Berlin; and the Landensanstalt fu\u00a8 r Immissions und Bodennutzungsshutz, Essen, Germany. Many air pollution research centers were established in Japan. In the United States, the smog problem continued to worsen in Los Angeles and appeared in large cities throughout the nation. In 1955, the \ufb01rst federal air pollution legislation was enacted, providing federal support for air pollution research, training, and technical assistance. Responsibility for the administration of the federal program was given to the Public Health Service (PHS) of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and remained there until 1970, when it was transferred to the new US EPA.", "The initial federal legislation was amended and extended several times between 1955 and 1980, greatly increasing federal authority, particularly in the area of control.32 Automobile ownership continued to grow, peaking in 2005 and declining substantially in 2009 and 2010, likely due to the economic recession (Table 3.6). However, the rest of the world has continued to increase vehicle ownership. Global production of motor vehicles increased from 54.4 million in 1997 to 84.4 million in 2012. In fact, China produced twice as many vehicles as either the United States or Japan in 2012 (19.3 million compared to 10.3 million in the United States and 9.9 million in Japan).33 As in Europe, air pollution research activity expanded tremendously in the United States during these three decades. The headquarters of federal research activity was at the Robert A. Taft Sanitary Engineering Center of the PHS in Cincinnati, Ohio, during the early years of the period and at the National Environmental Research Center in Triangle Park, North Carolina, at the end of the period. An International Air Pollution Congress34 was held in New York City in 1955. Three National Air Pollution Conferences were held in Washington, DC35 in 1958, 1962, and 1966. In 1959, an International Clean Air Conference was held in London. In 1964, the International Union of Air Pollution Prevention Associations (IUAPPA) was formed. Technological interest from the 1950s through the 1970s focused predominantly on automotive air pollution and its control, on sulfur oxide pollution and its control by sulfur oxide removal from \ufb02ue gases and fuel desulfurization, and on control of nitrogen oxides produced in combustion processes. Air pollution meteorology came of age, and by 1980 mathematical models of the pollution of the atmosphere were being energetically developed. The understanding of the photochemistry of air pollution began at this time and has since greatly improved, but remains a major research challenge. Air quality monitoring systems became operational throughout the world. A wide variety of measuring instruments became available. 3.10.4 The 1980s The highlight of the 1970s and 1980s was the emergence of the ecological, or total environmental, approach. Organizationally, this has taken the form of departments or ministries of the environment in governments at all levels throughout the world. In the United States, the federal EPA became well established during this time, and most states and populous counties and cities instituted and enhanced their counterpart organizations charged with responsibility for air and water quality, solid waste sanitation, noise abatement, and control of the hazards associated with radiation and the use of pesticides. This was paralleled in industry, where formerly diffuse responsibility for these areas became increasingly the responsibility of an environmental protection coordinator. Similar changes were evident in research and education. Pollution controls were being built into pollution sourcesdautomobiles, power plants, factoriesdat the time of original construction rather than later on. Also, for the \ufb01rst time, serious attention was directed to the problems caused by the \u201cgreenhouse\u201d effect of carbon dioxide and other gases building up in the atmosphere, possible depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer by \ufb02uorocarbons, long-range transport of pollution, prevention of signi\ufb01cant deterioration (PSD), and acidic deposition. 3.10.5 Recent History The most sweeping change, in the United States at least, in the 1990s was the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments36 on November 15, 1990. This was the only change in the Clean Air Act since 1977, even though the U.S. Congress had mandated that the Act be amended much earlier. The 1990s saw the emergence, in the popular media, of two distinct but closely related global environmental crises, uncontrolled global climate changes and stratospheric ozone depletion. The climate changes of concern were both the warming trends caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and cooling trends caused by PM and sulfates in the same atmosphere. Some researchers have suggested that these two trends will cancel each other. Other authors37,38 have written that the concerns about global warming have been exaggerated.37 The UN Conference of Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro during June 1992 did little to resolve the problems, but it did indicate the I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 3. THE SCIENCE OF AIR POLLUTION magnitude of the concern and the differences expressed by the nations of the world. The other global environmental problem, stratospheric ozone depletion, was less controversial and more imminent.", "The US Senate Committee Report supporting the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 states, \u201cDestruction of the ozone layer is caused primarily by the release into the atmosphere of chloro\ufb02uorocarbons (CFCs) and similar manufactured substancesdpersistent chemicals that rise into the stratosphere where they catalyze the destruction of stratospheric ozone. A decrease in stratospheric ozone will allow more UV radiation to reach earth, resulting in increased rates of disease in humans, including increased incidence of skin cancer, cataracts, and, potentially, suppression of the immune system. Increased UV radiation has also been shown to damage crops and marine resources\u201d. The Montreal Protocol of July 1987 resulted in an international treaty in which the industrialized nations agreed to halt the production of most ozone-destroying CFCs by the year 2000. This deadline was hastily changed to 1996, in February 1992, after a U.S. NASA satellite and high-altitude sampling aircraft found levels of chlorine monoxide over North America that were 50% greater than that measured over Antarctica. Global problems continue to hold sway. In the early years of the twenty-\ufb01rst century, global air pollution has taken on a greater urgency, both within the scienti\ufb01c community and the general public. Courts in the United States have mandated that carbon dioxide be considered and regulated as an air pollutant due to its radiant properties and link to global warming. The long-range atmospheric transport of persistent, bioaccumulative toxic substances (PBTs) has led to elevated concentrations in the tissues of marine and arctic mammals, as well as increased PBT levels in the mother\u2019s milk of indigenous people, such as the Inuit. Stratospheric ozone depletion is strongly suspected to have played a role in diminished biodiversity around the world. The meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power facility in Japan and the potential for attendant migration of radioisotopes created concern on the West Coast of North America. Like the PBT pollution of Inuit peoples, Fukushima served as another reminder that pollutants can travel thousands of miles in winds aloft. Wild\ufb01res in North America and biomass burning in South America have released large amounts of PM and other air pollutants. Even what would be considered water disasters, the huge oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico and around the world caused emissions of volatile organic compounds and other potential airborne contaminants. Arguably, the most visible ongoing concern of late is that of global climate change. It is also one of the most controversial. Until relatively recently, most engineers would probably agree that ensuring complete combustion is a very effective means of reducing pollution, since many very toxic and persistent air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and polycyclic aromatic compounds, are products of incomplete combustion. More recently, however, the product of complete combustion, CO2, is a major concern as a greenhouse gas. 3.11 THE FUTURE The air pollution problems of the future are predicated on the use of more and more fossil and nuclear fuel as the population of the world increases. During the lifetime of the students using this book, partial respite may be offered by solar, photovoltaic, geothermal, wind, nonfossil fuel (hydrogen and biomass), and oceanic (thermal gradient, tidal, and wave) sources of energy. Still, many of the agonizing environmental decisions of the next decades will involve a choice between fossil fuel and nuclear power sources and the depletion of future fuel reserves for present needs. Industrial pollution is a worldwide and growing problem. Hopefully, developing nations will not repeat the twentieth century problems experienced by Western nations and will apply lessons without having to suffer the consequences of side effects from economic development (see Chapter 33). Air pollution was both a sad and a promising story of recent decades. Sad, because the pollutants have brought so much premature and avoidable harm to humans and ecosystems. Promising, because science, engineering, and technologies have advanced rapidly to address and to prevent air pollution; and because society reached a consensus that air pollution was not inevitable.

Air pollution and other atmospheric data come in many forms and of highly varying quality. This includes information about the agents (air pollutants), the media (layers of the atmosphere and components of the hydrosphere), the modi\ufb01ers (physical, chemical, and biological substances that transform and transport the agents within the media), and the receptors (human individuals, human populations, and ecosystems and their components). This information must be evaluated and integrated to inform decision makers as to the best approaches for addressing the problems presented by polluted air. The myriad combinations of scienti\ufb01c and socioeconomic data make for extremely complex decisions (see Figure 4.1). As such, the fundamentals of air pollution includes both direct and indirect relationships among factors that must be understood systematically. The information in the \ufb01gure indicates that air pollution is not a single-variable, linear relationship between sources and receptors. Indeed, activities that one may assume would Energy consumpon FIGURE 4.1 Air pollution metrics compared to national socioeconomic metrics (1990e2010). During this period, US gross domestic product, total energy consumption, and total miles traveled by US vehicles increased substantially. The US population and total energy consumption increased, as did emissions of the carbon dioxide. However, emissions of criteria air pollutants (i.e. lead, tropospheric ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter) decreased markedly.

AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS increase emissions, such as increased energy consumption and vehicle miles traveled, were accompanied by substantial decreases in the emissions of criteria air pollutants. The relationships between risk from air pollutants and sources can only properly be explained systematically. That is, the harm that results from air pollution is a product of the life cycle of pollution. Air pollution is an outcome of the steps that involve energy and various types of matter, both living and nonliving. The life cycle includes not only time in the air, but also time in the water, on the land, in the soil, and within organisms. The emission of an agent is only one part of the life cycle. Indeed, it is not even the beginning, since certain processes always precede the emission. Presently, environmental and health policies are made from two broad perspectives: (1) evidence-based risk assessments and (2) precaution. The difference mainly lies in the onus of the decision. For evidence-based decisions, the onus is mainly placed on proving that a product or process causes harm, whereas in precaution-based decision making, the onus is placed on proving something is safe or will not cause harm. The precaution usually includes an element of irreversibility, i.e. even a slight chance that an agent will cause irreversible harm would lead to a decision not to allow Weeks Months Seasons Years Decades Local Regional Continental Geographic scale of effect the agent, or at least only allow it at levels below which there is strong scienti\ufb01c information showing no harm. Both evidence-based and precaution-based decisions require the analysis of substantial amounts of data. Evidence-based risk assessments require information regarding both the hazard and the likelihood of exposure to that hazard (see Chapters 7 and 8, respectively).", "Thus, if this information is scarce or unreliable, the risk assessment is useless at best and dangerous at worst, since it either underestimates or overestimates the risk. For problems that may affect large numbers of people, large geographic areas, and/or that are irreversible, precaution is in order. This is the basis for factors of safety in engineering design and prudence. Therefore, precaution applies to global-scale air pollution, such as the long-range transport of pollutants, acid rain, and climate change (see Figure 4.2). One of the arguments for taking actions to address climate change, for example, is that climate change could be irreversible (given the long wait for suf\ufb01cient evidence) and that under many predicted scenarios such change likely would lead to widespread and severe damage to public health and ecosystems (the upper right-hand portion of Figure 4.2). The ecological effects include loss of diversity and productivity. Some habitats are particularly vulnerable to irreversibility.1 In this sense, irreversibility is indirectly proportional to a system\u2019s resilience. For example, habitats shown in the lower left-hand portion of Figure 4.3 would more likely suffer severe and irreversible harm from exposure to air pollutants (e.g. SO2 and low-pH precipitation, i.e. acid rain) than those in the upper portion. Risk is commonly understood as the chance that something will go wrong or that some undesirable dependencies. Near-\ufb01eld stressors can result from a spill or emergency situation. At the other extreme, global climate change can result from chronic releases of greenhouse gases with expansive (planetary) impacts in direct proportion to signi\ufb01cant changes in global climate (temperature increases in the troposphere and oceans, shifting biomes, sea level rise, and migratory patterns).

Every time a person engages in an activity, e.g. walking, working, jogging, etc., that activity introduces risk of some adverse outcome. The person may get hurt, injure others, or even die in a mishap. The understanding of the factors that lead to a risk is called risk analysis; whereas the reduction of this risk (e.g. by wearing helmet and staying on bike paths) is known as risk management. Risk management is often differentiated from risk assessment, which comprises the scienti\ufb01c considerations of a risk. Risk management includes the policies, laws, and other societal aspects of risk.a Air pollution risk is increased in two very basic ways. The mix of substances may become inherently more harmful; or the amount of exposure to harmful substances may increase. The former is an increase in thehazardand thelatterisanincreaseinexposure. Thus, air pollution actions must be based on reliable risk analysis and assessment. They must account for the interrelationships among factors that put people at risk to provide decision makers with thoughtful studies based upon the sound application of the physical sciences.2 Air pollution engineers design systems to reduce risk and to enhance the reliability of these systems.3 Everyone to some extent, at least intuitively, assesses risks and determines the reliability of decisions every day. They desire safety, but this is a relative term. The \u201csafe\u201d label requires a value judgment and is always accompanied by uncertainties, but engineers frequently characterize the safety of a product or process in objective and quantitative terms. Air pollution safety is usually expressed by safety\u2019s opposite term, risk. 4.2 INTERPRETING DATA Events can be characterized in a number of ways. Events may be discrete or continuous. If the event is forced to occur as a \ufb01nite set of outcomes (e.g. six sides of a die) the event is discrete. However, if the event can be of any value within a domain, e.g. size of a tumor, the event is continuous. Events can also be independent or dependent.", "An event is independent if the results are not in\ufb02uenced by previous outcomes. Conversely, if an event is affected by any previous outcome then the event is a dependent event. Since air pollution usually involves numerous variables, joint probabilities are also calculated. For n mutually exclusive events as possible outcomes from E that have probabilities equal to P{Ei}, the probability of these events in a trial equals the sum of the individual probabilities: PfE1 or E2 . or Ekg\u00bcPfE1g\u00fePfE2g\u00fe . \u00fePfEkg(4.1) Further this helps us to \ufb01nd the probabilities of events ei and g1 for two independent sets of events, E and G, respectively: P ei or gi \u00bcPfeigP gi (4.2) For example, a company record book indicates that a waste site has 10 unlabeled buried chemical drums. However, the drums were originally color coded according to the vapor pressures (P ) of the contents: \ufb01ve drums that contain a low vapor pressure (P \u00bc 10 6 kPa) substance (Plow), two drums that contain a medium vapor pressure (P \u00bc 10 4 kPa) substance (Pmed), and three drums that contain a very high vapor pressure (P \u00bc 10 1 kPa) substance (Pvh). Unfortunately, the color coding is no longer visible. The plant manager is hoping to remove the Plow and Pmed drums before calling in special equip teams for the Plow drums that, if ruptured, would release the contents into the air more rapidly. The manager asks the environmental safety of\ufb01cer what is the likelihood of pulling up these drums. This can be accomplished by using joint probabilities. We can determine the probability of pulling up one of the drums that contains substances with a low or medium vapor pressure (i.e. Plow and Pmed). The two possible events (Plow drum or Pmed drum) then, are mutually exclusive and come from the same sample space; so we can use Eqn (4.1): 527 PfPlow or Pmedg\u00bcPfPlowg\u00fe PfPmedg\u00bc \u00fe \u00bc : 1010 10 Thus we have a 70% probability of pulling up a drum with a low to moderate vapor pressure substance. A nearby waste site also has 10 unlabeled, buried drums, but with known chemical formulations: three drums that contain dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and seven drums that contain trichloromethane (CHCl3). If there is a possibility that the Pmed substance could be very dangerous in the presence of CHCl3, and the need for special measures to segregate the Pmed and CHCl3, the plant manager wants to know the probability of pulling up a Pmed drum from the \ufb01rst site and a CHCl3 drum from the second site. Since the two trials are independent, we can use Eqn (4.2): PfPmed and CH2Cl2g\u00bcPfPlowg\u00fePfPmedg23 6 \u00bc\u00bc : 10 10 100 a The segregation of risk assessment (science) from risk management (feasibility) is a recent approach. One of the \ufb01rst advocates for separating the two processes was William Ruckelshaus, who twice served as the Administrator of the U.S. EPA. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4. AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS Thus we have 6% probability of extracting a medium vapor pressure substance drum and a dichloromethane drum on our \ufb01rst excavation. Since we do not know the chemical composition of the Pmed drum, we must assume that a worst case scenario, i.e. the Pmed contents are very dangerous when combined with CHCl3. Thus, there will be a 6% probability of this scenario, unless other steps are taken (e.g. conducting removals on different days). Another important concept for environmental data is that of conditional probability. If we have two dependent sets of events, E and G, the probability that event ek will occur if the dependent event g has previously occurred is shown as p{ekjg}, which is found using Baye\u2019s theorem: pfek and gg pfgjekgpfekg pfekjgg\u00bc \u00bc (4.3) n pfgg P pfgjeigpfeig i\u00bc1 A review of this equation shows that conditional probabilities are affected by a cascade of previous events. Thus, the probability of what happens next can be highly dependent upon what has previously occurred. For example, the cumulative risk of cancer depends on the serial (dependent) outcomes. Similarly, reliability can also be affected by dependencies and prior events. Thus, characterizing any risk or determining the reliability of systems are expressions, at least in part, of probability. Air pollution data can also be presented by a \u201cprobability density function\u201d (PDF) for data.", "The PDF is created from a probability density; that is, when the data are plotted in the form of a histogram, as the amount of data increases, the graph increases its smoothness, i.e. the data appear to be continuous. The smooth curve can be expressed mathematically as a function, f(x). This is the PDF. The probability distribution can take many shapes, so the f(x) for each distribution will differ accordingly. For example, in environmental matters, distributions commonly seen FIGURE 4.4 Distribution (log normal) of aerosols in the lower troposphere. Silverman L, Billings CE, First MW. Particle size analysis in industrial hygiene. New York (NY): Academic Press; 1971. Frequency (Percentage of particles by count) are normal, log-normal, and Poisson. The normal (Gaussian) distribution is symmetrical and is best known as the \u201cbell curve\u201d, given its shape (see Figure 4.4). The log-normal distribution is also symmetrical, but its x-axis is plotted as a logarithm of the values. The Poisson distribution is a representation of events that happen with relative infrequency, but regularly.4 Stated mathematically the Poisson distribution function expresses the probability of observing various numbers of a particular event in a sample when the mean probability of that event in any one trial is very small. So, the Poisson probability distribution characterizes discrete events that occur independently of one another during a speci\ufb01c period of time. This is useful for risk assessments, since exposure-related measurements can be expressed as a rate of discrete events, i.e. the number of times an event happens during a de\ufb01ned time interval, such as the frequency (times per week) that a person drives a car. The Poisson distribution describes events that take place during a \ufb01xed period of time (i.e. a rate), so long as the individual events are independent of one another. As the expected number of events or counts increases (i.e. the event rate increases), so does variability. Obviously, if we expect a count to equal 1, then an observation of 2 or 0 would be more reasonable than an observation between 500 and 0. If we expect a count to be equal to 50,000, counts of 49,700 and 50,300 are within reason. The range and variance of the latter, however, is actually larger by 100. The Poisson equation needed to compute the probability of a speci\ufb01c number of counts being observed over a de\ufb01ned time interval is pln e Pl \u00bc (4.4) n! where, l \u00bc average or expected counts or events per unit time and n \u00bc number of encounters Thus, the Poisson distribution is useful in a risk assessment to estimate exposures.

FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4.2 INTERPRETING DATA substance (e.g. the number of times per day a person living near a wood treatment facility is exposed to pentachlorophenol atmospheric concentrations above 100 ng m 3). Assuming that based on existing data, the expected number of encounters is two per day, applying Eqn (4.4) with l \u00bc 2, there is a 9% chance that an individual will have four (i.e. n \u00bc 4) encounters with pentachlorophenol concentrations above 100 ng m 3 on a given day. 4.2.1 Expressions of Air Pollution Risk Stated mathematically, an event (e) is one of the possible outcomes of a trial (drawn from a population). Risk is a probability. All probabilities, including risk, range from zero to unity, or are stated as a percentage, 0e100%. Note that risk is unitless, e.g. a one-in-\ufb01ve risk or a 20% risk. In a coin toss, we usually think of two possible outcomes, i.e. heads or tails. However, it is actually three, i.e. heads, tails, and edge. These three outcomes together form a \ufb01nite \u201csample space\u201d, designated as E \u00bc [e1, e2, es]. Thus, the sample space for any air pollution risk scenario can be stated as E \u00bc\u00bde1; e2; .; en (4.5) The edge outcome in a coin toss is a very low probability event that is often, by convention, ignored. For example, at the beginning of overtime in a football game, a tossed coin determines who will receive the ball, and thus have the \ufb01rst opportunity to score a touchdown, which results in a win. When the referee tosses the coin, there is little concern about anything other than \u201cheads or tails\u201d.", "However, the National Football League undoubtedly has a protocol for the rare event of the coin not being a discernible heads or tails. In an air pollution scenario involving a carcinogen, e could represent a case of cancer. Consider, for example, a population of 1 million people exposed to a carcinogenic air pollutant over a speci\ufb01c time period, with one additional cancer diagnosed that can be attributed to that pollutant exposure. Thus, the probability of e, i.e. p {e} \u00bc 10 6. This one-in-a-million event has the same probability as the hypothetical event of a coin landing on its edge. Even a rare event will occur in a suf\ufb01ciently large population. Risks in a population can be stated as the product of probability and an outcome. This can be stated as a frequency (F) at which the adverse outcome occurs: X F \u00bc (4.6) N where, X \u00bc number of adverse events; N \u00bc number of individuals in the population. For example, if 100 people contract a disease randomly distributed in a popula102 3 tion of 100,000, frequency of the disease is \u00bc10 ,or 105 one in a thousand. The F term is usually referred to as a probability (P). Air pollution studies often compare populations, e.g. workers exposed to a particular air pollutant compared to the general population. This comparison is known as a relative risk (RR), which is calculated as 1 Pexposed Xexposed Nexposed \u00bc (4.7) 1 Punexposed Xunexposed Nunexposed RR for air pollutants is often stated as a ratio, particularly as a standard mortality ratio or a standard morbidity ratio (both abbreviated to \u201cSMR\u201d): Dobserved Pexposed SMR \u00bc\u00bc (4.8)Dexpected Punexposed where, D \u00bc number of deaths for standardized mortality rates or number of diseases for standardized morbidity rates. For example, if 15 out of 10,000 workers who are exposed to air polluted with a metallic compound have died of a type of lung cancer that occurs at a rate of 15 per million, the SMR for this hypothetical cohort 15\u00f0104\u00de 1 of exposed workers would be \u00bc102: This 15\u00f0106\u00de 1 means that the worker\u2019s RR is 100 times that of the general population of dying from this particular type of cancer. The SMR is used as a speci\ufb01c measure of the strength of association between a population\u2019s exposure to an air pollutant and deaths that may be attributed to that exposure. The mortality rate in a community without a speci\ufb01c exposure or intervention is called the baseline rate, which represents the expected level of the mortality. Note that the denominators in Eqns (4.7) and (4.8) include \u201cunexposed\u201d in their subscripts. Actually, these populations are seldom completely unexposed. In the metallic compound example above, the workers live in the general population, so those 10,000 persons would have to be subtracted from the million. Also, unless the compound is exclusively found in the workplace, others in the general population would be exposed, albeit often at much lower concentrations. Workplaces may differ from the general environment not only in the concentrations of certain pollutants, but also in the ways people are exposed. For example, the toxic metal cadmium (Cd) is a pollutant released during the production of batteries (especially, nickel-cadmium [NiCd] types), paints, and coatings, as well as during metal work, e.g. welding, soldering, and plating. Air concentrations of Cd in the workplace can be much higher than in the general environment. As evidence, in the United States, inhalation is the major route of workplace exposure to Cd. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for Cd fumes or I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4. AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS cadmium oxide (CdO) as 0.1 mg m 3. This is \ufb01ve orders of magnitude higher than average Cd concentrations in unpolluted air (1 10 6 mg m 3) and less than four orders of magnitude higher than average Cd concentrations in urban areas (4 10 5 mg m 3). Thus, in the case of Cd, the general population can be considered to be relatively unexposed compared to that of workers in certain industries.5,b 4.2.2 Risk Factors and Confounders Another way to think about Eqns (4.7) and (4.8) is that they show the difference between what is being observed versus what is expected in terms of death and disease. That is, how do the observed population compare to the expected population (Eqn (4.8))? Thus, the denominator actually needs to be comparable from one study to the next, i.e. a \u201cstandard population\u201d or \u201creference population\u201d.", "So, the SMR is employed to compare mortality or morbidity risks of a study population to that of a standard population. Again, the standard population may or may not be an unexposed population. For most air pollutants, the standard population is indeed exposed, but usually are much lower levels than the study group. Sometimes, however, the standard population may actually be more highly exposed to certain air pollutants. For example, if a state or national exposure rate is used as the standard population, the standard population may have higher average exposures than a study group of infants for ozone (O3). Indoor concentrations of O3 are usually much lower than outdoor concentrations. Since newborns spend more time indoors than most other age groups in developed nations, their O3 exposures would be less than that of the standard population. The previous discussion of RR can be visualized as a two-by-two table (Table 4.1). The table shows that the incidence of an outcome when the risk factor is present, e.g. population exposed to Cd concentrations above PEL A ( 0.1 mg m 3)is : The incidence when the risk A\u00feB C factor is absent (e.g. Cd > 0.1mgm3)is : C\u00feD A A \u00fe B Relative risk \u00bc (4.9) C C \u00fe D The odds ratio can also be calculated from this table: \u00f0AD\u00de Odd ratio \u00bc (4.10) \u00f0BC\u00de TABLE 4.1 Two-by-two Table for Calculating Relative Risk of an Outcome When a Risk Factor is Present and Absent Outcome: Outcome: Risk Factor Disease No Disease Total Present A B A \u00fe B Absent C D C \u00fe D Total A \u00fe C B \u00fe D A \u00fe B \u00fe C \u00fe D The previous discussions point to the need for care in choosing the standard population. Smoking and other behaviors will confound the meaning of RR assessments. A confounder is an extraneous (third) variable that would in\ufb02uence the outcome of study or could be causing at least some of the outcome, instead of the variable being studied (see Figure 4.5). Thus, a confounder is a risk factor of the outcome, is associated with the exposure, is not an intermediate step in the link between the risk factor of interest and the outcome, and is not a surrogate of exposure.6 The confounder or third variable in Figure 4.5 provides an example of hypothesis testing. A hypothetical research project found that people who drive old cars appear to contract heart disease at a higher rate than the general public. Based on the crude data, there does indeed appear to be a strong association between driving an older car and cardiovascular problems, i.e. an odds ratio \u00bc 2.23. However, the common confounder of such studies is smoking, since numerous studies have shown the link between smoking and various cardiovascular problems (due in large part to the carbon monoxide inhalation and consequent decrease in oxygen carried by hemoglobin, i.e. carboxyhemoglobin, which stresses the heart and cardiovascular system). An astute researcher would look for risk factors other than the one being studied. In this case, when smoking is accounted for properly, the odds ratios drop to 1. That is, when the crude data are strati\ufb01ed by smokers and nonsmokers, driving an older car does not account for any increase in risk of cardiovascular disease. Odds ratios and RRs that equal 1 mean that the study group\u2019s risk does not differ from the standard population (e.g. the US adult population). If they are greater than 1, the study group has an apparently greater risk, and less than 1 means an apparently lesser risk. In addition to smoking, study populations are often strati\ufb01ed by age, sex, socioeconomic status, education levels, and other risk factors that would bias results and mask the real risk factors. Risk factors can be dif\ufb01cult to disentangle. In this hypothetical example, smoking may indeed be highly b See Chapter 1 for a discussion of respirators and other personal protective equipment needed to decrease exposures in the workplace. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4.2 INTERPRETING DATA correlated with driving an older car. Had the odds ratio been greater than 1, it may have been plausible to investigate the matter further. For example, older vehicles do indeed emit, on average, much large amount of PM, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and other pollutants compared to newer models. Thus, even if the odds ratios do not bear this out in this particular study, it does not mean the drivers are not actually at higher risks of cardiovascular disease.", "It could be that the drivers of older cars who do not smoke are also more careful about keeping their cars well maintained, for example. Or, it could be that smoking has such a strong signal that swamps out the smaller signal from vehicle emissions. The bottom line is that one study is usually not enough and has limitations and \ufb02aws, whether the \ufb01ndings are positive or negative. This is why science depends on numerous and varied studies of the linkage between air pollutant exposures and health effects. The SMR can be calculated for any event or case, especially across population and geographic subdivisions, such as zip codes and census tracts. Air pollution maps often show concentrations of a pollutant compared to mortality and morbidity rates. The SMR can be stated as PJ PJ dj njlj Dobserved j\u00bc1 j\u00bc1 SMR \u00bc\u00bc\u00bc (4.11) PJ PJ Dexpected njlj njlj j\u00bc1 j\u00bc1 where, dj \u00bc number of cases in the observed population across j age groups; nj \u00bc number of cases in the standard I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4. AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS population; lj \u00bc disease or death rate in the census tract; and lj \u00bc disease or death rate in the standard population. In the cadmium example, Cd exposures are much higher in certain microenvironments than in the general environment. The distinction in this case is between the workplace and the ambient air. However, exposures are driven by activities, e.g. diet and smoking. The two principal pathways for Cd exposure in the general US population differ between its nonsmokers and smokers. For the nonsmoker, the major Cd exposure pathway is ingestion of food. For the smoker, it is the inhalation of tobacco smoke.7 On average, a cigarette contains 2.0 mg Cd, of which 2e10% is transferred into smoke; accounting for twice the blood Cd in smokers than in nonsmokers.8 Any comparison of the Cd-related diseases in workers to those in the general population must consider smoking. That is, there needs to be a method for including and excluding the confounder of effect of smoking in the denominator of Eqn (4.7) or (4.8). Often, risk estimates are derived from physical, chemical, and biological factors that give rise to probabilities. Returning to our football coin \ufb02ip example, the probability of the third outcome (a coin on edge) is higher if the coin lands in grass or arti\ufb01cial turf, compared to landing on a hard \ufb02at surface. Such factors are deterministic. Thus, the physical conditions increase the relative probability of the third event. This is analogous to a person who may have the same exposure to a carcinogen as the general population, but who may be genetically predisposed to develop cancer. The exposure is the same, but the probability of the outcome is higher for this \u201csusceptible\u201d individual. Thus, risk varies by both environmental and individual circumstances. In this instance, it is important to identify subpopulations with genetic predispositions to a disease that is being investigated for its linkage to an air pollutant. 4.2.3 Causal Links between Risk Factors and Adverse Outcomes To link air pollution to adverse outcomes in anything other than a purely academic discussion, air pollution decision making must infer causality. Risk of an adverse outcome is increased when risk factors are increased in number and size. Risk factors must be present before the onset of the adverse event. However, these associations must be supported by other information in order to \ufb01nd causes. Two essential attributes of a risk factor is its strength of association and its temporality. Exposure to the air pollutant must correlate with the onset of the disease and the exposure must occur prior to the onset of the disease. The biomedical research and epidemiological communities use a number of criteria to determine the strength of an argument for causality. The \ufb01rst criteria were \ufb01rst well articulated by A. Bradford Hill as a means of linking risk factors to cancer. 9 These criteria are 1. Strength of association 2. Consistency 3. Speci\ufb01city 4. Temporality 5. Biologic gradient 6. Plausibility 7. Coherence 8. Experimentation 9. Analogy Depending on the case, some of Hill\u2019s criteria are more important than others. As mentioned, strength of association and temporality are essential. Others, like coherence and plausibility, are desirable in most cases, but could sti\ufb02e hypotheses since they resist paradigm shifts, e.g. new hypotheses for diseases.", "4.2.3.1 Strength of Association This chapter\u2019s discussion up to now has mainly addressed how to associate a particular risk factor, especially an air pollutant, with an adverse outcome. For a chemical exposure to cause an effect, the exposure must be associated with that effect. Strong associations provide more certain evidence of causality than is provided by weak associations. Common epidemiological metrics used in association include risk ratio, odds ratio, and standardized mortality ratio. Descriptive epidemiology is often a \ufb01rst step in air pollution studies. For example, even before hypotheses are made regarding what may be causing or contributing to a health problem, epidemiologists must characterize differences. Sex, race, ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic factors can show different outcomes for diseases in the same general population. Recall from the discussions of confounders that calculating RRs can be visualized as a two-by-two table 1 AC (Table 4.1), i.e. RR \u00bc : The difference in A\u00feBC\u00feD age, sex, and whether one lives in a rural versus urban area can be among the \ufb01rst descriptive comparisons conducted by epidemiologists, as in a recent study of mortality rates for diseases in the Hubei Province in China (see Table 4.2). The table shows differences between crude and standardized deaths. The standardization is accomplished by adjusting the crude death rate for differences in age composition between the study group (urban and rural) versus that of the standard population. This allows for comparisons of asymmetrical distributions within subpopulations, so that the risk factor being investigated is less in\ufb02uenced by other factors (i.e. confounders). Standardization can be accomplished in two ways, i.e. directly and indirectly. If interested in standardizing I.

Each age-speci\ufb01c mortality rate for the study group is multiplied by the number of people in the age group of the standard population. These products are summed and divided by the number of people in the standard population. An example of standardization used by US Center for Disease Control and Prevention is shown in Table 4.3. The indirect method applies age-speci\ufb01c mortality rates from the standard population to derive expected deaths in the region\u2019s population. For each age group, the age-speci\ufb01c mortality rate for the standard population is multiplied by the number of people in the age group of the study group and summed. This number of deaths in the entire study group is divided by this sum. The result is multiplied by the crude death rate. Note that the last column in Table 4.2, relative risk, includes con\ufb01dence intervals. This is an indication of the uncertainty in the estimates. The odds ratio is the probability that an event will occur divided by the probability that it will not occur. It can also re\ufb02ect the odds of an event for one group (e.g. urban dwellers) divided by the odds of a different group (e.g. rural population). Rather than presence or absence shown in Table 4.1, the information in Table 4.3 can be compared for urban and rural populations (see Table 4.4).

Since air pollution risk is a function of the pollutant\u2019s inherent hazard (e.g. cancer potency) and the exposures (e.g. inhaling air containing the pollutant), outcomes like those in the \ufb01rst column of Table 4.2 are usually low-probability events, such as the number of cancers added to what would otherwise be expected without the air pollution. Therefore, statistics are needed to express the linkages between the hazards and exposures. As mentioned, this often begins with the odds ratio for these events. The odds ratio is a key step toward linking a risk factor to the adverse outcome, since it re\ufb02ects the strength of the association between an exposure and an outcome, i.e. the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. 10 For example, the Children\u2019s Health Study in southern California used odds ratios to link indicators of respiratory problems in children with proximity to major roadways (mobile air pollutant exposure). Asthma medication usage (odds ratio \u00bc 1.50; 95% con\ufb01dence interval, 1.16e1.95), wheezing (odds TABLE 4.4 Two-by-two Table for Calculating Relative Risk of a Disease Outcome for Urban versus Rural Risk Factor Outcome: Disease Outcome: No Disease Total Urban A B A \u00fe B Rural C D C \u00fe D ratio \u00bc 1.40; 95% con\ufb01dence interval, 1.09e1.78), and lifetime asthma incidence (odds ratio \u00bc 1.29; 95% con\ufb01dence interval, 1.01e1.86) for children residing in homes within 75 m of a major road.11 The odds ratios of 1.50, 1.40, and 1.29 indicate that living near a roadway is associated with 50% more children using medication, 40% more children exhibiting wheezing, and 29% more children being diagnosed with asthma compared to those living in homes greater than 75 m from a major roadway. Note also that each odds ratio is expressed within a con\ufb01dence interval. This is a way of expressing uncertainty and variability. That is, 95% of the time, for children living <75 m from a major road, the odds ratio for asthma medication usage will fall between 1.16 and 1.95. If the lower interval were less than 1, this would mean that the exposed and unexposed were not statistically different, i.e. living near or far from a roadway would have made no statistical difference for a variable if the con\ufb01dence interval were less than 1. Recall that risk is the probability of an adverse or unwanted outcome.12 Probability is the mathematical expression that relates a particular outcome of an event to the total number of possible outcomes. Returning to our earlier coin example that \ufb02ipping it should give very nearly a 50e50 chance of either a heads or tails. Actually, however, the 50% probability depends on every physical factor on each side being equal.", "Indeed, this is not the case for most coins, since the heads side usually has a head and the tail side has something other than a head. Thus, the aerodynamics differs due to shape, ridges, and valleys on the two sides. These are I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4.2 INTERPRETING DATA deterministic features that may make the odds change ever so slightly. We must keep in mind of the very rare chance (i.e. highly unlikely, but still possible) that the coin could land on its edge, i.e. the outcome is neither a heads nor a tails. Deterministic factors may increase the probability of this rare outcome, e.g. a thicker coin is more likely than a thinner coin to land on its edge. The total probability of all outcomes must be unity, i.e. the sum of the probabilities must be 1. In the case of the coin standing on end rather than being a heads or tails, we can apply a quanti\ufb01able probability to that rare event. Let us say that laboratory research has shown that one in a million times 16 \u00bc 0:000001\u00bc 10 ; the coin lands on edge. 1;000;000 By difference, since the total probabilities must equal 1, the other two possible outcomes (heads and tails) must be 1 0.000001 \u00bc 0.999999. Again, we are assuming that the aerodynamics and other physical attributes of the coin give it an equal chance of being either heads or tails, then the probability of heads \u00bc 0.4999995 and the probability of tails \u00bc 0.4999995. Air pollution statistics are similarly affected by deterministic features. Thankfully, many of the diseases caused by air pollutants are rare. For example,additional cancersattributableto air pollutants are often considered in one-in-amillion scenarios. Scientists ask what amount of exposure would lead to 10 6 additional cancer risk in a population. As such, scientists must have objective and reliable ways to consider rare outcomes. Deterministic factors, analogous to the features on the head side of the coin, can increase the risk of diseases and damage from air pollution. For example, children and the elderly may be particularly susceptible to respiratory effects resulting from exposures to air pollutants. Thus, risk is affected by features of both the agent (e.g. pollutant concentration, potency, and bioavailability) and the receptor population (e.g. genotype, age, sex, and race). 4.2.3.2 Consistency Hill asked the question, \u201cHas [the association] been repeatedly observed by different persons, in different places, circumstances and times?\u201d9 That is, even though there may be strong weight of evidence, if this is only from one type of study, e.g. laboratory experiments, the \ufb01ndings are not yet consistent. The exposure to an air pollutant must also be consistently associated with an adverse effect under different studies using diverse methods of study of assorted populations under varying circumstances by different investigators. Such consistency strengthens the link between exposure to an air pollutant and an adverse effect, e.g. lung cancer. Consider an air pollutant that is positive for mutagenicity, is linked to cancer in mouse and Rhesus monkey experiments, and for which human epidemiological studies show increased cancer incidence. This is an example of consistency across study types. If another pollutant shows cancer only in animal studies, with just a few human studies that are inconclusive, the lack of consistency detracts from even strong associations between exposures and cancer in the animals. 4.2.3.3 Speci\ufb01city The speci\ufb01city criterion holds that the cause should lead to only one disease and that the disease should result from only this single cause. This criterion is akin to the germ theory of microbiology, where a speci\ufb01c strain of bacteria and viruses elicits a speci\ufb01c disease. This is rarely the case in studying most chronic diseases, since a chemical can be associated with cancers in numerous organs, and the same chemical may elicit cancer, hormonal, immunological, and neural dysfunctions. In addition, non-chemical stressors may elicit the same chronic effects as chemicals, such as psychological stress and genetic disorders. Thus, for air pollution studies, speci\ufb01city is not to be expected for many diseases. 4.2.3.4 Temporality Timing of exposure is critical to causality. This criterion requires that exposure to the chemical must precede the effect. For example, in a retrospective study, the researcher must be certain that the manifestation of a disease was not already present before the exposure to the chemical.", "If the disease were present prior to the exposure, it does not necessarily mean that the chemical in question is not a cause, but it does mean that it is not the sole cause of the disease (see \u201cSpeci\ufb01city\u201d above). For example, lung damage may have already begun due to exposure to tobacco smoke, but accelerates with the additional exposure to asbestos \ufb01bers. For air pollutants, the exposure begins the disease progression process (Figure 4.6). If the disease occurs before the exposure, the pollutant cannot be considered a cause of the disease. Whether the disease actually occurs and the severity of effects depend on other factors, as well, such as genetic predisposition. Although the temporality is required for causality, it does not assure causality. That is, if the exposure to the air pollutant occurred after the onset of the disease, that study cannot be used as evidence linking the air pollutant to the disease. However, if the exposure occurred prior to the disease, the study may be used, but only if other criteria support the causal link, since another agent or risk factor may be the actual cause of the disease (see the earlier discussion of confounders). I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4. AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS (A) Unexposed part of person\u2019s life (B) Presymptomac/subclinical disease 4.2.3.5 Biologic Gradient Chemical hazard is usually determined from bioassays, animal studies, epidemiology, and models that generate a biological gradient, i.e. the higher the dose the greater the effect. In fact, this is known as the \u201cdoseeresponse\u201d step in risk assessment. Doseeresponse is an essential part of an air pollutant\u2019s inherent hazard. The comparison of the dose of an air pollutant to a biological response in humans, in other organisms, or in ecosystems is an important aspect of hazard. Doseeresponse curves point to thresholds above which air pollutant exposures are expected to elicit effects (e.g. above a \u201cno observable adverse effect level\u201d). Since it is a key component in chemical hazard assessment, doseeresponse is discussed in detail in Chapter 7. Air pollution is hazardous to both human health and ecosystems, so the biological response may manifest itself as diseases and death in human populations and as damage to habitats and organisms living in ecosystems. If the concentration, intensity, duration, or total level of chemical exposure is increased, then a concomitant, progressive increase should occur in the toxic effect. 4.2.3.6 Plausibility Generally, an association needs to follow a well-de\ufb01ned explanation based on known biological systems. The association must be consistent with physical, chemical, and biological principles. This is not to say that the principles cannot be reordered to explain an observation, since the \u201cparadigm shifts\u201d in the understanding of key scienti\ufb01c concepts do change. A noteworthy example is the change in the latter part of the twentieth century of the understanding of the functioning of and interrelationships among the endocrine, immune, and neural systems, from the view that these are exclusive systems to today\u2019s perspective that in many ways they constitute an integrated chemical and electrical set of signals in an organism.13 4.2.3.7 Coherence The criterion of coherence suggests that all available evidence concerning the natural history and biology of the disease should \u201cstick together\u201d (cohere) to form a cohesive whole. By this logic, the proposed causal relationship should not con\ufb02ict or contradict information from experimental, laboratory, epidemiologic, theoretical, or other knowledge sources. For air pollution, temporal patterns of exposure and adverse effects must adhere to what is known about the associated biological effects. For example, animal data and human data (i.e. epidemiology) should support characterizations of an air pollutant. If animal data suggest that inhaling a substance leads to a respiratory effect, but human data do not, this is an example of lack of coherence. It should be noted that lack of coherence may be the result of paucity of human datac. Lack of coherence may also result from intraspecies differences for which human studies have not yet been properly designed. Lack of coherence, then, does not in itself eliminate a causal link. Conversely, if all studies are coherent, it very strongly suggests a causal link. 4.2.3.8 Experimentation Experimental evidence in support of a causal hypothesis may come in the form of community and c Usually, animal data are the \ufb01rst to suggest the link between exposure to a pollutant and a chronic disease, which later is or is not supported by human data. However, a prominent example of human data showing a link in the absence of animal data was arsenic (As).", "Occupational and other epidemiology showed a link many years before human As data supported these \ufb01ndings in the 20th century. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4.3 RARE EVENTS: PERFECT STORMS AND BLACK SWANS clinical trials, in vitro and in vivo laboratory experiments, animal models, and natural experiments. Several major problems arise for air pollution experiments. First, the relationship between an air pollutant and an adverse outcome is usually multifaceted. For example, slight differences in chemistry, physical form, and biological makeup of the receptor organism cannot usually be duplicated with well-controlled experiments. Thus, the results are usually very speci\ufb01c to the independent and dependent variables in study and not easily extrapolated to actual, real-world situations. Second, the strongest and most reliable data about human health is derived from human populations. However, large chamber studies are very expensive and burdensome to subjects. In addition, chamber studies must treat human subjects ethically, meaning that exposures to air pollutants must be at relatively low doses. Third, the association between chronic diseases and low-concentration exposures to air pollutants might be missed. Latency periods for cancer, for example, can be decades. Animal experiments usually trade dose for time, e.g. a 3-month study with suf\ufb01ciently high doses of a pollutant to elicit an effect. Acute effects could mask chronic effects. For example, if a substance is given at a dose that kills or causes an acute effect in an animal, the animal will not likely have suf\ufb01cient time to exhibit chronic effects (e.g. tumors). 4.2.3.9 Analogy The term analogy implies a similarity in some respects among things that are otherwise different. It is thus considered one of the weaker forms of evidence. In a sense, the structural activity relationship (SAR) is an example of an analogy in the physical sciences. The SAR is a system that uses molecular structure of a known chemical to estimate how a similar chemical might behave in the environment or in an organism. For example, benzene, toluene, and phenol each have a single benzene ring, with toluene having one substituted methyl group and phenol having one substituted hydroxyl group. An SAR may suggest that these three compounds will have similar af\ufb01nities for air, water, and soil. A more uncertain analogy is that the endogenous processes, e.g. metabolism, of the three compounds would be similar. Problems arise as a result of small differences, e.g. phenol\u2019s hydroxyl group makes it more polar and thus more likely to be removed in the \ufb01rst phases of metabolism compared to benzene. This does not mean that the SAR is not useful, only that caution is needed to avoid over-extrapolating absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and other biological processes from similarities in molecular structure. Another example of analogy is the highly exposed population. If a phenomenon is observed in coal miners over time, how might this phenomenon appear in the general population? For example, miners in Eastern Europe who were exposed to radon (Rn) had a much higher incidence of lung cancer compared to the general public. By analogy, if the miners have higher cancer rates because of Rn, others exposed to Rn in other scenarios may also have a similar lung cancer risk, albeit smaller (see \u201cBiological Gradient\u201d above). An analogy\u2019s disadvantage is that there is no standard available for objectively evaluating the analogy\u2019s usefulness. For example, an imaginative scientist may posit an analogy that since small children are messier than adults, messiness may explain why children are more susceptible to indoor air pollution, especially allergens. Both statements are likely true, but the analogy may not hold since a third variable (physiology) may better explain this. However, such an analogy may be useful, even if wrong for a given scenario. In this case, the \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d is an analogy that goes back to the concept of hormesis, i.e. exposures to small, incremental amounts of bacteria helps prevent future diseases. The hypothesis is an analogy of gradual adaptation (e.g. muscle growth, learning, etc.). It is best explained as immune response, i.e. the immune system increases cells to combat foreign substances (bacteria). The analogy from other gradual adaptations may well have generated this thinking in medicine by Pasteur, Paracelsus, and others. However, the homesis analogy does not usually, if ever, hold for chemical agents. Being exposed to vinyl chloride, lead, or mercury does not make one immune. To the contrary, the chronic exposure lead to health effects, including weakening immune and neural systems (actually an \u201canti-hormesis\u201d argument). 4.3 RARE EVENTS: PERFECT STORMS AND BLACK SWANS", "Two metaphors come to mind when discussing low-probability, high-impact outcomes, i.e. the black swan and the perfect storm. A \u201cblack swan\u201d event is one in which the outcome would not have been predicted from past evidence due to the low probability of a possible con\ufb02uence of events, but the event indeed occurred. A \u201cperfect storm\u201d of a con\ufb02uence of unlikely events is something that air pollution scientists and engineers must always consider, such as the combination of factors that led to the disaster from the toxic plume over Bhopal, India (see Discussion Box: The Bhopal and Lac-Me\u00b4gantic Events). Black swan events have occurred, but had not been known to occur before, nor had there been evidence that they could occur. It is an extremely low-probability event that did indeed occur. It can be argued at least in the abstract that air pollution disasters are not actually black swan events, since scientists understood I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4. AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS \u00b4 THEBHOPALAND LAC-MEGANTIC EVENTS Although the toxic plume in Bhopal, India, and the Lac-Me\u00b4gantic derailment have very different origins, they are dramatic examples of low-probability, high-impact events. A newspaper account of the Bhopal incident, one of the worst air pollution tragedies in history, was as follows: In the middle of the night of December 2-3, 1984, residents living near the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India awoke coughing, choking, gasping, and in the case of thousands, slowly dying. Half a day later, half a world away, company executives sleeping soundly near the Danbury, CT headquarters of Union Carbide Corporation awoke in the middle of the night yawning and grumbling at the sound of telephones ringing. shortcuts taken in the name of pro\ufb01t d authorized by the highest executives within the company d had just killed thousands of innocent citizens. It was the worst industrial disaster of the 20th century, forever changing the public\u2019s trust of the chemical industry. Union Carbide claimed it was sabotage by a disgruntled employee that led to the disaster, but how much did the company already know about the dangerous conditions its shortcuts and bottom-line focus had created?14 The toxic cloud that drifted over the city from the Union Carbide pesticide plant gas leak led to the death of 20,000 people and permanently injured 120,000. The event resulted from at least two types of engineering failures: (1) misapplication of science (e.g. a mathematical error and an incorrect extrapolation of a physical principle) and (2) human factors (e.g. misbehaviors, misdeeds, and mistakes). Although the Union Carbide Company was headquartered in the United States, as of 1984, it operated in 38 different countries.15a,15b It was quite large (35th largest US company), and was involved in numerous types of manufacturing, most of which involved proprietary chemical processes. The pesticide manufacturing plant in Bhopal, India, had produced the insecticides Sevin and carbaryl since 1969, using the intermediate product, methyl isocyanate (MIC) in its gas phase. The MIC was produced by the following reaction: O CH3OH O N H +CH3\u2013N=C=O (4.1) This process was highly cost-effective, involving only a single reaction step. The schematic of the MIC process is shown in Figure 4.7. MIC is highly water reactive (see Table 4.5); i.e. its reaction with water generating a very strong exothermic reaction that produces carbon dioxide. When MIC vaporizes it becomes a highly toxic gas that, when concentrated, is highly caustic and burns biological tissues. This can lead to scalding nasal and throat passages, blinding, and loss of limbs, as well as death. The acute and chronic health information is provided in Figure 4.8. On December 3, 1984, the Bhopal plant operators became concerned that a storage tank containing MIC was showing signs of overheating and began to leak. The leak rapidly increased in size, and within 1 h of the \ufb01rst leakage, the tank exploded and released approximately 80,000 lbs (4 104 kg) of MIC into the atmosphere. The human exposure to MIC was widespread, with a half million people exposed. Nearly 3000 people died within the \ufb01rst few days after the exposure, 10,000 were permanently disabled. Ten years after the incident, 12,000 death claims had been \ufb01led, along with 870,000 personal injury claims. However, only $90 million of the Union Carbide settlement agreement had been paid. As of 2001, many victims did receive compensation, averaging about $600 each, although claims were still outstanding.", "The CO2 generated by the exothermic reaction likely led to the rapid increase in pressure, which caused the release of the MIC into the atmosphere. Several human factors increased the likelihood of a disaster. The Indian government required that the plant be operated exclusively by Indian workers, so Union Carbide agreed to train them on-site at a sister plant in West Virginia. In addition, the company required that US engineering teams make periodic on-site inspections for safety and quality control, but these ended in 1982, when the plant decided that these costs were too high. So, instead, the US contingency was only responsible for budgetary and technical controls, but not safety. The last US inspection in 1982 warned of many hazards, including a number that have since been implicated as contributing to the leak and release. From 1982 to 1984, safety measures declined, attributed to high employee turnover, improper and inadequate training of new employees, and low technical savvy in the local workforce. On-the-job experiences were often substituted for reading and understanding safety I.

The refusal in part stemmed from the lack of air conditioning in this subtropical climate, where masks and gloves can be uncomfortable. Indian, rather than the more stringent US, safety standards were generally applied at the plant after 1982. This likely contributed to overloaded MIC storage tanks (company manuals cite a maximum of 60% \ufb01ll). The release lasted about 2 h, after which the entire quantity of MIC was released. The highly reactive MIC arguably could have caused much less problems if it degraded and mixed before reaching human populations. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4.3 RARE EVENTS: PERFECT STORMS AND BLACK SWANS \u00b4 THE BHOPAL AND LAC-MEGANTIC EVENTS (cont\u2019d ) However, over the years, tens of thousands of squatters had taken up residence just outside of the plant property, hoping to \ufb01nd work or at least take advantage of the plant\u2019s water and electricity. The squatters were not noti\ufb01ed of hazards and risks associated with the pesticide manufacturing operations, with the exception of signs posted by a local journalist stating: \u201cPoison Gas. Thousands of Workers and Millions of Citizens are in Danger\u201d. A \u201ccon\ufb02uence of events\u201d indeed led to this disaster. \u0081 The tank that initiated the disaster was 75% full of MIC at the outset. \u0081 A standby over\ufb02ow tank for the storage tank contained a large amount of MIC at the time of the incident. \u0081 A required refrigeration unit for the tank was shut down \ufb01ve months prior to the incident, leading to a three-to fourfold increase in tank temperatures over expected temperatures. \u0081 One report stated that a disgruntled employee unscrewed a pressure gauge and inserted a hose into the opening. \u0081 A new employee was told by a supervisor to clean out connectors to the storage tanks, so the worker closed the valves properly, but did not insert safety discs to prevent the valves from leaking. In fact, the worker knew the valves were leaking, but they were the responsibility of the maintenance staff. Also, the second-shift supervisor position had been eliminated. \u0081 When the gauges started to show unsafe pressures, and even when the leaking gases started to sting mucous membranes of the workers, they found that evacuation exits were not available. There had been no emergency drills or evacuation plans. \u0081 The primary fail-safe mechanism against leaks was a vent-gas scrubber, i.e. normally this release of MIC would have been sorbed and neutralized by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in the exhaust lines, but on the day of the disaster, the scrubbers were not working. (The scrubbers were deemed unnecessary, since they had never been needed before). \u0081 A \ufb02are tower to burn off any escaping gas that would bypass the scrubber was not operating because a section of conduit connecting the tower to the MIC storage tank was under repair. \u0081 Workers attempted to mediate the release by spraying water 100 ft high, but the release occurred at 120 ft. Thus, according to an audit, many checks and balances were in place, but the cultural considerations and human factors were ignored or given low priority such as, when the plant was sited, the need to recognize the differences in land use planning and buffer zones in India compared to Western nations or the difference in training and oversight of personnel in safety programs. Every engineer and environmental professional needs to recognize that their work is affected by geopolitical realities and a global economy. This means that we must understand how cultures differ in their expectations of environmental quality. One cannot assume that a model that works in one setting will necessarily work in another without adjusting for differing expectations. Bhopal demonstrated the consequences of ignoring these realities. In Lac-Me\u00b4gantic, a town in eastern Quebec, Canada, at approximately 01:15 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 6, 2013, a 73-car freight train carrying crude oil broke away, derailed, and the crude oil it was carrying became in\ufb02amed and exploded. Forty-two people were con\ufb01rmed dead with 5 more missing and presumed dead. More than 30 buildings, half of the downtown area, were destroyed.22 The disaster site contains high concentrations of benzene and other hydrocarbons, so that soil and water will have to be decontaminated over a period of several years.", "Although this may not appear to be a threat to air quality, one of the major concerns in cleanups is that contaminants may move from one environmental compartment to another. Given the relatively high vapor pressures of many hydrocarbons, they have likely been emitted to the atmosphere since the disaster began. The fact that the cars were carrying crude oil complicates the ongoing debates about fossil fuels and their transport. There are risk trade-offs among pipelines, ships, trucks, and rail. An estimated 140,000 carloads of crude oil were shipped in Canada by rail in 2013, whereas only 500 carloads were shipped by rail in 2009. In the \ufb01rst quarter of 2013, the United States shipped 97,000 carloads of crude oil by rail, an increase of 166% from the \ufb01rst quarter of 2012. The increase in rail shipping of crude oil has been dramatic (Figure 4.9). The risk trade-off question is whether pipelines are safer and more environmentally acceptable than rails for the movement of such large volumes of hazardous substances. From a life cycle perspective, the question is how to reduce society\u2019s overall reliance on fossil fuels for major economic sectors, including transportation, industry, and heating. In the meantime, however, transport of fossil fuels must be suf\ufb01ciently safe and reliable. Smaller versions of these types of incidents are more likely to occur. For example, two freight trains collided in Graniteville, South Carolina, just before 3:00 a.m. on January 6, 2005, resulting in the derailment of three tanker cars carrying chlorine (Cl2) gas and one tanker car carrying sodium hydroxide (NaOH) liquids. The highly toxic Cl2 (Continued ) I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4. AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS \u00b4 THEBHOPALAND LAC-MEGANTIC EVENTS (cont\u2019d) gas was released into the atmosphere. The wreck and gas release resulted in hundreds of injuries and eight deaths. In February of 2005, the District of Columbia City Council banned large rail shipments of hazardous chemicals through the US Capital, making it the \ufb01rst large metropolitan area in the United States to attempt to reroute trains carrying potentially dangerous materials. The railroad company has opposed the restrictions, arguing that they violate Constitutional protections and interstate commerce legislation and rules. Roadways and rails are in very close contact to where people live. The intersection of hazardous materials and human population has led to incidents that are not really all that rare. Seven months before the Graniteville incident, three people died after exposure to chlorine as a result of derailment in San Antonio, Texas. Fifty more people were hospitalized. One of the concerns is occupational safety, but another is community exposures. Many metropolitan areas also have areas where rail, trucks, and automobiles meet, so there is an increased risk of accidents. Most industrialized urban areas have most of the elements and contributing causes before the actual events, e.g. atmospheric inversions, chemical reactions, and some cause-and-effect relationships between pollutants and diseases. The extent and severity may not have been expected, especially in light of the many variables involved in the event. Thus, engineers and scientists must insert factors of safety to address such uncertainties for any adverse outcome, but especially for those that can lead to unacceptable harm. the problematic mix of high-density population centers, multiple modes of transport, dense rail and road networks, and rail-to-rail and rail-to-truck exchange centers. Most cities are especially vulnerable if an accident were to involve hazardous chemicals, since they are major crossroads of various forms of transport near large numbers of people. And, rerouting trains is not feasible in many regions because transcontinental lines here run through most urban areas. So, other steps can be taken to reduce shipment risks from hazardous substances like chlorine and improvements in manifest reports are immediately available to \ufb01rst responders. At present, such information is not generally available. Following the September 11, 2001, attacks, rail companies have been reticent to disclose what is being shipped. One local \ufb01re department spokesman has stated that one \u201ccould almost assume there are several cars of hazardous materials every time we see a train\u201d.23 The lessons from Bhopal, Lac-Me\u00b4gantic, and other low-probability, high-impact incidents are many. However, a major one is to be mindful that artifacts will occur. A number of these cannot be fully appreciated prospectively, so factors of safety must be built into the design. And, human factors must always be seen as design constraints. The plan is only as good as the way it is implemented. If this is sloppy, failure and, tragically, disaster can be the result.", "a Health numbers are toxicological numbers from animal testing or risk assessment values developed by EPA. b Regulatory numbers are values that have been incorporated in U.S. government regulations, while advisory numbers are non-regulatory values provided by the government or other groups as advice. OSHA numbers are regulatory, whereas NIOSH, ACGIH, and AIHA numbers are advisory.cThe NOAEL is from the critical study used as the basis for the CalEPA chronic inhalation reference exposure level. c This is an important reminder for plant and human resource managers that there is often a sharp decline in safety vigilance after training. Thus, health and safety training must be updated regularly and safety drills be conducted according to the hazards at a speci\ufb01c facility. Safety is a fundamental facet of all engineering codes of practice and ethics. As such, engineers rely on criteria that inform them when designs and projects are suf\ufb01ciently safe. Four safety criteria are applied to test engineering safety:24 1. The design must comply with applicable laws. 2. The design must adhere to \u201cacceptable engineering practice\u201d. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4.3 RARE EVENTS: PERFECT STORMS AND BLACK SWANS 3. Alternative designs must be sought to see if there are safer practices. 4. Possible misuse of the product or process must be foreseen. The \ufb01rst two criteria are usually more manageable than the latter two. The engineer can refer to handbooks and manuals for the physical, chemical, and biological factors to calculate tolerances and factors of safety for speci\ufb01c designs. Laws and regulations are promulgated to protect the public. Crossing these legal thresholds indicates the point at which the engineer has failed to provide adequate protection. Engineering practice standards go a step further. Much of the public and its lawyers would not be able to recognize this type of failure unless other engineers help to judge whether an ample margin of safety has been met. The margin is dictated by sound engineering principles and practice. Often, however, looking up answers is only the beginning. Solutions to air pollution problems also often need creativity and imagination. Like most decisions, air pollution risk management decisions consist of \ufb01ve components: 1. an inventory of relevant choices; 2. an identi\ufb01cation of potential consequences of each choice; 3. an assessment of the likelihood of each consequence actually occurring; 4. a determination of the importance of these consequences; and 5. a synthesis of this information to decide which choice is the best.25 Risk management must also address risk perceptions, which vary according to psychological, social, and environmental factors. In addition, the speci\ufb01c air pollutants being addressed in\ufb02uence risk perception. For example, whether the hazard is intense or diffuse, or whether it is natural or human induced (see Figure 4.10) can greatly in\ufb02uence public acceptance of even the most scienti\ufb01cally sound air pollution action. In general, most people are more willing to accept of hazards that are natural in origin, voluntary, and concentrated in time and space.26 Note that air pollution is in the middle of the spectrum. It is more voluntary than most accidents, e.g. one can choose not to go into a smoke-\ufb01lled room, but less voluntary than smoking, i.e. a person may chose to smoke or not to smoke. The damage from air pollution is more diffuse than rock climbing (the potential harm is very concentrated, i.e. the potential fall is part of the experience), and less concentrated than a tornado (a speci\ufb01c neighborhood in its path). And, air pollution includes both natural and human-induced pollutants. Interestingly, many of the hazards listed in the \ufb01gure are directly or indirectly related to air pollution (e.g. ruptured tanks after earthquakes and tornados release air pollutants, and industrial explosions and transport accidents cause air pollutants to be emitted). Pesticide exposure is often via inhalation. Choosing not to smoke may not protect one from tobacco smoke, i.e. environmental tobacco smoke or side stream smoke is a major source of indoor pollution. Radiation exposure can come about by airborne isotopes. Industrial accidents have exposed thousands to air toxins (see Discussion Box: The Bhopal and Lac-Me\u00b4gantic Events later in this chapter).

FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4.", "AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS What people perceive as risks and how they prioritize thoserisks areonlypartlydrivenbyscience-based,objective assessment of risk, i.e. the severity of the hazard from an air pollutant must be combined with the magnitude, duration, and frequency of the exposure to the hazard. For example, a person may be generally aware that cigarette smoke contains carcinogens and other substances that cause heart disease, but is not directly aware of what these are (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and carcinogenic metal compounds). Even after reading the conspicuous warning labels on the pack, the connection between the hazard and the self-imposed exposure may not have \u201crung true\u201d. The person may have not met anyone with emphysema or lung cancer, or may not be concerned (yet) with the effects on the unborn (i.e. in utero exposure). Psychologists have found this to be particularly problematic for adolescents contemplating high-risk activities, such as smoking, i.e. an unrealistic sense of invincibility. This is even more problematic in that the cause and effect can be separated by decades, i.e. the latency period between exposure and symptoms of cancer and other chronic diseases. Human beings can be conditioned by positive stimuli (e.g. nicotine euphoria and perception of being an adult) without immediate mental links to any negative consequences, since they are often far in the future. Another interesting aspect of risk perception is how it varies in scale and scope. The author recalls sitting in a meeting in the late 1970s among a group of highly trained engineers and scientists from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. These are the two principal federal and state agencies, respectively, charged with protecting the environment. The meeting was to determine the appropriate ways to reduce the ambient concentrations of pollutants, especially PM and carbon monoxide (CO). The meeting was held in a small room and almost every person, except the author, was smoking. It was indeed a proverbial, \u201csmoke-\ufb01lled\u201d room. Here was a technical discussion regarding the best approaches for decreasing ambient levels to the parts per million range (high by today\u2019s standards, but at detection limits in the 1970s) in a room with PM and CO concentrations that could have been reported as a percent rather than ppm. (i.e. 10 6 versus 10 2). The irony was lost on the participants, probably for good reason. They were not making personal decisions, they were making policy decisions. This is akin to saying \u201cDo as I say, not as I do\u201d. No matter how technically sound and convincing an air pollution action is to engineers and scientists, the decision may be misunderstood or even resented by those expected to bene\ufb01t. Thus, every effort must be made to make the scienti\ufb01c rationale clear and understandable to the speci\ufb01c audience. The converse is also true. The air pollution expert may be completely persuaded based upon data, facts, and models that something clearly does not cause significant harm, but those that the expert is trying to convince may disagree. They may believe the expert has a vested interest, or that they \ufb01nd the expert guilty by association with a group they do not trust, i.e. a \u201chired gun\u201d working for those with interests other than those of the community. This lack of trust is exacerbated if experts use jargon and do not clearly communicate. Managing air pollution risks consists of balancing among alternatives. Usually, an air pollution problem can be addressed in numerous ways that vary in feasibility, cost, and effectiveness. Acceptable risk \ufb02ows from decisions that ameliorate the adverse outcomes and/or decrease the chance that negative consequences will occur. 27 Indeed, \u201cacceptable risk is the risk associated with the best of the available alternatives, not with the best of the alternatives which we would hope to have available\u201d.28 Since risk involves chance, risk calculations are inherently constrained by three conditions: 1. The actual values of all important variables cannot be known completely and, thus cannot be projected into the future with complete certainty. 2. The physical and biological sciences of the processes leading to the risk can never be fully understood, so the physical, chemical, and biological algorithms written into predictive models will propagate errors in the model.", "3. Risk prediction using models depend on probabilistic and highly complex processes that make it infeasible to predict many outcomes.29 The decision to accept an air pollution action is usually based upon a \u201crisk-reward\u201d paradigm, and should be a balance between bene\ufb01ts and costs.30 This creates the need to have costs and risks substantially outweighed by societal bene\ufb01ts. The term \u201csubstantially\u201d is preferable to \u201csigni\ufb01cantly\u201d. Signi\ufb01cance has two problems: (1) the uncertainty resulting from the three constraints described above and (2) the margin between good and bad. Signi\ufb01cance is the province of statistics, i.e. it tells us just how certain we are that the relationship between variables cannot be attributed to chance. But, when comparing bene\ufb01ts to costs, we are not all that sure that any value we calculate is accurate. For example, a bene\ufb01t/cost ratio of 1.3 with con\ufb01dence levels that give at a range between 1.1 and 1.5 is very different from a bene\ufb01t/cost ratio of 1.3 with a con\ufb01dence range between 0.9 and 1.7. The former does not include any values below 1, while the latter does (i.e. 0.9). This value means that even with all the uncertainties, our calculation shows that the project could be unacceptable. This situation is compounded by the I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4.3 RARE EVENTS: PERFECT STORMS AND BLACK SWANS second problem of not knowing the proper margin of safety. That is, we do not know the overall factor of safety to ensure that the decision is prudent. Even a bene\ufb01t/cost ratio that appears to be mathematically high, i.e. well above one, may not provide an ample margin of safety given the risks involved. The likelihood of unacceptable consequences can result from exposure processes, from effects processes, or both processes acting together. So, four possible permutations can exist: 1. Probabilistic exposure with a subsequent probabilistic effect 2. Deterministic exposure with a subsequent probabilistic effect 3. Probabilistic exposure with a subsequent deterministic effect 4. Deterministic exposure with a subsequent deterministic effect31 A risk outcome is deterministic if the output is uniquely determined by the input. A risk outcome is probabilistic if it is generated by a statistical method, e.g. randomly. Thus, the accuracy of a deterministic model depends on choosing the correct conditions, i.e. those that will actually exist during a project\u2019s life and correctly applying the principles of physics, chemistry, and biology. The accuracy of the probabilistic model depends on choosing the right statistical tools and correctly characterizing the outcomes in terms of how closely the subpopulation being studied (e.g. a community or an ecosystem) resembles those of the population (e.g. do they have the same factors or will there be suf\ufb01cient confounders to make any statistical inference incorrect). A way of looking at the difference is that deterministic conditions depend on how well one understands the science underpinning the system, while probabilistic conditions depend on how well one understands the chance of various outcomes (see Table 4.6). The deterministic exposure/deterministic effect scenario is not actually a risk scenario because there is no \u201cchance\u201d involved. It would be like calculating the risk of a 50 kg anvil hitting the earth\u2019s surface after releasing it without any other forces acting on the anvil besides gravity. The \ufb01rst principles of science assure us that this will happen. The risk only comes into play when we must determine external consequences of the anvil falling. For example, if an anvil is suspended at the height of 1 m by steel wire and used by workers to perform some task (i.e. a deterministic exposure), there is some probability that it may fall (e.g. if studies have shown that the wires fail to hold one in 10,000 events, then the failure probability of 0.0001), Thus, this scenario would be an example of a deterministic exposure followed by a probabilistic effect (wire failure), i.e. permutation number two. An air pollution example TABLE 4.6 Exposure and Effect Process Risk Management Probabilistic Exposure Deterministic Exposure Probabilistic Effect Contracting the West Nile Virus Although many people are bitten by mosquitoes, most mosquitoes do not carry the West Nile virus. There is a probability that a person will be bitten and another, much lower probability that the bite will transmit the virus. A third probability of this bitten group may be rather high that once bitten by the West Nile virus-bearing mosquito that the bite will lead to the actual disease. Another conditional probability exists that a person will die from the disease.", "So, death from a mosquito bite (probabilistic exposure) leads to a very unlikely death (probabilistic effect). Deterministic Effect Death from Methyl isocyanate exposure Exposure to a toxic cloud of high concentrations of the gas methyl isocyanate (MIC) is a probabilistic exposure, which is very low for most people. But, for people in the highest MIC concentration plume, such as those in the Bhopal, India, tragedy, death was 100% certain. Lower doses led to other effects, some acute (e.g. blindness) and others chronic (e.g. debilitation that led to death after months or years). The chronic deaths may well be characterized probabilistically, but the immediate poisonings were deterministic (i.e. they were completely predictable based on the physics, chemistry, and biology of MIC). Occupational Exposure to Asbestos Exposure to asbestos from vermiculite workers is deterministic because the worker chooses to work at a plant that processes asbestos-containing substances. This is not the same as the person choosing to be exposed to asbestos, only that the exposure results from an identi\ufb01able activity. The potential health effects from the exposures are probabilistic, ranging from no effect to death from lung cancer and mesothelioma. These probabilistic effects increase with increased exposures, which can be characterized (e.g. number of years in certain jobs, availability of protective equipment, and amount of friable asbestos \ufb01bers in the air). Generating carbon dioxide from combusting methane The laws of thermodynamics dictate that a decision to oxidize methane, e.g. escaping from a land\ufb01ll where anaerobic digestion is taking place, will lead to the production of carbon dioxide and water (i.e. the \ufb01nal products of complete combustion). Therefore, the engineer should never be surprised when a deterministic exposure (heat source, methane, and oxygen) lead to a deterministic effect (carbon dioxide release to the atmosphere). In other words, the production of carbon dioxide is 100% predictable from the conditions. The debate on what happens after the carbon dioxide is released (e.g. global warming) is the province of probabilistic and deterministic models of these effects. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4. AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS would be the potential release of a small amount of a very toxic air compound. If the toxic compound is included in a release from the facility\u2019s stack due to a chain of events that cause a release of the toxic compound in one of 10,000 events), then the failure probability is 0.0001 or 10 4, i.e. the deterministic exposure to the compound could then be calculated from the likelihood that populations would come into contact with them. Furthermore, if there is a 0.01 (10 2) likelihood of contact to this compound that is in dust suspended in air, which becomes re-entrained after settling that causes dermal contact, or exposure from food or drinking water, then the overall (contingent) exposure probability of this sce 42 6 nario is 10 10 \u00bc 10 . Note that this is not the risk, but the exposure. The risk is a function of the exposure and the hazard, e.g. the effect from receiving a dose of the air pollutant. Estimating risk using a deterministic approach requires the application of various scenarios, e.g. a very likely scenario, an average scenario, or a worst case scenario. Very likely scenarios are valuable in some situations when the outcome is not life threatening or not oneof severeeffects,likecancer. Thedebatein the public FIGURE 4.11 (A) Concentrations of an air (A) No controls pollutant emitted from an industrial facility. (B) Hypothetical allowable amounts of an air health arena is often between a mean or median (50th percentile) exposure and a worst case exposure (i.e. maximally exposed and highly sensitive individuals). The latter is more protective, but almost always more expensive and dif\ufb01cult to attain. For example, lowering the emissions of PM from a power plant stack to protect the mean population of the state from the effects of PM exposures is much easier to achieve than lowering the PM emissions to protect an asthmatic child, an immunocompromised person, or an elderly person living just outside of the power plant property line (see Figure 4.11). In the hypothetical example depicted in Figure 4.11,the pollutant concentrations that would occur without controls (A) are the opposite of those needed to protect public health (e.g. a school near the industry boundary). The pollutant is diluted by dispersion, so that the concentrations fall dramatically with distance. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable population happens to attend the school near the industrial source.", "Indeed, the general population may not be adversely affected if the concentration of 10 mgm 3 is actually the level below which no adverse effects are expected. However, this is a mean value, so there would be days when the 10 mgm 3 level is pollutant based on benchmarks of health and welfare, e.g. the allowable concentrations are lower if the risks are based on a highly sensitive subpopulation (e.g. elderly, infants, and asthmatic). In this hypothetical example, the pollutant concentrations that would occur without controls (A) move in the opposite direction (lower with distance due to mixing) as those needed to protect public health (e.g. a school near the industry Industrial plant property line boundary).

FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 100% Contaminant removal efficiency 0% 100% Contaminant removal efficiency 99% 4.3 RARE EVENTS: PERFECT STORMS AND BLACK SWANS Cost FIGURE 4.12 Prototypical contaminant removal cost-effectiveness curve. In the top diagram, during the \ufb01rst phase, a relatively large amount of a substance is removed at comparatively low costs, e.g. using gravity to collect coarse particulate matter (PM). Removal and control of the remaining portion of the substance (e.g. small fraction of ultra\ufb01ne PM) increase in costs substantially. Costs increase with less bene\ufb01t. The costs increase exponentially for each unit of substance removed, until the curve nearly reaches as steady state where the increment needed to reach complete removal is very costly. The top curve does not recognize innovations that, when implemented, as shown in the bottom diagram, can make a new curve that will again allow for a steep removal of the contaminant until its cost-effectiveness decreases. This concept is known to economists as the law of diminishing returns. Ref. 3. exceeded. Also, the general population always includes vulnerable members, albeit in smaller numbers than the general population. The limits depend upon the effects elicited by the pollutant. For example, if the air pollutant is associated with cardiopulmonary effects in babies, an additional factor of safety may push the risk-based controls downward by an additional safety factor, e.g. from 10 to achieve 0.1 mgm 3 to protect the maximally exposed, sensitive population.d So, then, why not require zero risk from an air pollutant, or from any hazard for that matter? Selecting an allowable pollutant concentration is an exercise in optimization among variables and trade-offs among values. Of course, the most protective standards are best, but the feasibility of achieving them can be a challenge. The regulated standard can be very close to zero, especially if one assumes a worst case scenario for exposure and provides adequate or even more conservative factors of safety, for example, if the air pollutant causes severe health effects even at very low exposures. Stated differently, putting controls and fail-safe measures in place to prevent an accidental release 99% of the time is much more feasible than the controls and fail-safe measures needed to prevent an accidental release 99.999% of the time (see Figure 4.12). Depending on the hazard, however, even the 99.999% may not meet engineering and risk standards. Some substances are so toxic, and some biological agents so poorly understood, that prevention of their releases may require numerous redundancies. The risk reduction measures are not only dependent on initial design, but also on retro\ufb01ts, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning of air pollution control equipment (i.e. in life cycle terminology, \u201cdownstream\u201d effects). Actual or realistic values are input into the deterministic model. For example, estimating the risk of a tank explosion from one of several rail cars moving through and parked in a community would require a wide range d This also demonstrates the importance of good planning. If the industry was there before the school, then this should have not been a factor in not locating the school nearby. Conversely, if the school was there \ufb01rst, it would have been poor planning and siting to allow the industrial plant so near. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4. AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS of data about the number and size of cars, the \ufb02ammability and vapor pressure of the contents, the ambient temperature, the vulnerability of the tank materials to rupture, the likelihood of derailment, and other physicochemical, mechanical, and operational factors.", "In a semiquantitative approach, these factors would be weighted and assigned numerical values, from which the risk of explosion is calculated. A probabilistic approach would require the identi\ufb01cation of the initiating events and the plant operational conditions to be considered; analysis of the adverse outcome using statistical analysis tools, including event trees; application of fault trees for the systems analyzed using the event trees, collection of probabilistic data (e.g. probabilities of failure and the frequencies of initiating events based on past events and occurrences in similar domains); and the interpretation of results. With regard to the precautionary approach to decisions, the no-action alternative is seldom completely innocuous. An action is warranted only if it is the optimal solution to the air pollution problem if it eliminates the pollution, but also avoids unwarranted \ufb01nancial costs, does not cause unnecessary disruption to normal activities, and is implemented in a manner that is socially acceptable to the community. This optimization is needed at all scales, from choosing one control technology over another to decisions about national actions to address climate change (e.g. controls of greenhouse gas emission). Due diligence must be applied to designs and plans for manufacturing processes that 1. limit, reduce, or prevent air pollution; to ways to reduce risks in operating systems, 2. assess sites and systems for possible human exposures to hazardous and toxic substances, and 3. evaluate and devise systems to reduce or eliminate these exposures. Prevention is preferable, but an air pollution problem that already exists must be addressed to protect health, environment, and welfare. The environmental remedy process varies according to the particular environmental compartment of concern (i.e. air, water, or soil), the characteristics of contaminant of concern (e.g. toxicity, persistence in the environment, and likelihood to be accumulated in living tissues), and the speci\ufb01c legislation and regulations covering the project. However, it generally follows a sequence of preliminary studies, screening of possible remedies, selecting the optimal remedy from the reasonable options, and implementing the selected remedy (see Figure 4.13). The evaluation and selection of the best alternative is the stuff of risk management. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4.3 RARE EVENTS: PERFECT STORMS AND BLACK SWANS Sometimes organizational problems and demands put scientists and engineers in situations where the most scienti\ufb01cally sound and professional course of action is not supported by management. Working within an organization has a way of inculcating the \u201ccorporate culture\u201d into professionals. The process is incremental and can \u201cdesensitize\u201d employees to acts and policies that an outsider would readily see to be wrong. Much like the proverbial frog placed in water that gradually increases to the boiling pot, an environmental professional can work in gradual isolation, specialization, and compartmentalization that ultimately could lead to improper behavior, such as ignoring key warning signs that a decision to locate a facility in a certain area will have an unfair and disparate impact on neighborhoods, that health and safety are being compromised, and that political in\ufb02uence or the \u201cbottom line\u201d of pro\ufb01tability is disproportionately weighted in the recommendation.32 Another reason that optimization is dif\ufb01cult is that an engineer must deal with factors and information that may have not been adequately addressed during formal engineering training or even during career development. Although environmental and public health decisions must always give suf\ufb01cient attention to the toxicity and exposure calculations, these quantitative results are tempered with feasibility considerations. Thus, engineering strengths lie to the far left and right of Figure 4.13, but the middle steps, i.e. feasibility and selecting the best alternative require information that is not \u201cwell behaved\u201d in the minds of many engineers. For example, in 1980 the US Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly referred to as Superfund.33 The Superfund law authorizes the federal government to respond directly to releases or to the threat of releases of hazardous substances and enables the US EPA to take legal action to force parties responsible for causing the contamination to clean up those sites or to reimburse the Superfund for the costs of cleanup. If the responsible parties for site contamination cannot be found or are unwilling or unable to clean up a site, the EPA can use funds from the Superfund to clean up a site. Air pollution decision making is \u201cutilitarian\u201d; that is, we are called upon \u201cto produce the most good for the most people\u201d.34a,34b In addition, all engineers are duty bound to codes of ethics, design criteria, regulations, and standards of practice.", "Engineers must, to the best of their abilities, consider all possible design outcomes, planned or otherwise. But this is not easy when the most appropriate \u201cbenchmarks\u201d for success in air quality actions are moving targets. There is no consensus at the outset that even if the design is implemented to meet all speci\ufb01cations, the project could be deemed a failure. For example, in environmental decisions regarding the level of cleanup of a hazardous waste can be based on the target health risk following cleanup. This remediation target cleanup has been based on what was called the \u201cresidential standard\u201d. That is, immediately following the passage of key hazardous waste laws, regulators held the general view that a polluted site needed to be cleaned up to the point that no undue risk remained and the site could be returned to productive use, as if it had never been polluted. This closely follows the steps of hazard identi\ufb01cation, doseeresponse relationships, exposure analysis, and effects assessment to characterize risks.35a,35b In the United States, the cleanup of a hazardous waste begins with a feasibility study to address nine criteria that will determine the best approach for addressing the contamination, as well as the ultimate level of cleanup. They also directly apply to air pollution decisions: 1. Overall protection of human health and environment 2. Compliance with applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements 3. Long-term effectiveness and permanence 4. Reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment 5. Short-term effectiveness 6. Ease of implementation 7. Cost 8. State acceptance 9. Community acceptance The \ufb01rst and fourth criteria are clearly the product of a sound, quantitative risk assessment. The other criteria must also include semiqualitative and qualitative information. This illustrates the variety of data and information used in evaluating the environmental implications of air pollution. With the large list of hazardous air pollutants and variety of sources, new and improved technologies must be developed to address them. When considering the potential impacts of any emerging technology, however, concerns about downstream impacts are crucial. Possible problems may not present themselves until suf\ufb01cient time and space have been crossed. Products that contain dangerous materials like asbestos, lead, mercury, polybrominated compounds, and polychlorinated biphenyls were once considered acceptable and were even required by law or policy to protect the public safety and health, such as asbestos-containing and polybrominated materials to prevent \ufb01res, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and other persistent pesticides to kill mosquitoes in an effort to prevent disease, and methyl tert-butyl ether as a fuel additive to prevent air pollution. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 4. AIR POLLUTION DECISION TOOLS Also, as discussed in Chapter 5, downstream impacts may not involve the air pollutant of concern directly, but indirectly. The choice of end-of-life approaches can lead to the prevention or creation of an air toxin. The formation of dioxins, a highly toxic class of organic compounds, will differ according to the endof-life options, including incineration, land\ufb01ll, or reuse. At the other extreme, the choice of reactants and products during manufacturing and use can make for large amounts of dioxin precursors, such as preservatives. The amount of dioxins created is often a function of theamountofthese availableprecursorsand thetype of end-of-life measures. If the precursors are present and combustion is part of the end-of-life step in the life cycle, the likelihood of producing dioxins is increased. Predicting potential impacts of new technologies and new substances is dif\ufb01cult. Countless environmental problems are yet to be resolved and others are plagued with incomplete or nonexistent unanimity of thought as to their importance or even whether indeed they are problems, such as the cumulative health and environmental impacts of con\ufb01ned animal feeding operations on microbial populations. The trade-off in such cases may be between two competing yet legitimate societal needs, such as a reliable food source and clean water. Sometimes the two needs are mutually exclusive, but others may be met by modi\ufb01cations of one or both solutions (uncon\ufb01ned, local, and more spatially distributed animal operations, along with the public\u2019s willingness to accept higher prices for meat). The key to good environmental decision making is that it be informed with reliable information and that it be transparent. QUESTIONS 1.

What are two types of ecosystem effects from air pollution? 6. Of a temperate forest and a tropical rainforest, which ecosystem is more likely to suffer long-term, possibly irreversible damage from air pollution? Why? 7. Consider an area where 25% of the homes have slab foundations and that due to the geology and soil in this area, the unsealed slab foundations allow substantial penetration of radon (Rn) gas into the home. Studies have shown that 70% of homes in this area with slab foundations exceed recommended Rn concentration thresholds. Rn gas intrusion accounts for 90% of indoor Rn concentration, with the remaining 10% of the Rn coming from building materials (e.g. stone). What is the probability of a house in this area with a slab foundation having Rn above the recommended concentration? 8.

The history of probability theory, like much modern mathematics and science, is rooted in the Renaissance. Italian mathematicians considered some of the contemporary aspects of probability as early as the 15th Century, but did not to the need to or were unable to devise a generalized theory.", "Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat, the famous French mathematicians, developed the theory after a series of letters in 1654 considering some questions posed by the nobleman, Antoine Gombaud, Chevalier de Me\u00b4re\u00b4, regarding betting and gaming. Other signi\ufb01cant Renaissance and post-Renaissance mathematicians and scientists soon weighed in, with Christian Huygens publishing the \ufb01rst treatise on probability; De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae, which was speci\ufb01cally devoted to gambling odds. Jakob Bernoulli (1654e1705) and Abraham de Moivre (1667e1754) also added to the theory. However, it was not until 1812 with Pierre LaPlace\u2019s publication of The\u00b4orie Analytique des Probabilite\u00b4s, that probability theory was extended beyond gaming to scienti\ufb01c applications. 13.

FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5 Life Cycle Assessment of Air Pollutants 5.1 SYSTEMS CONTEXT FOR AIR POLLUTION Chapter 4 introduces the tools needed to support air pollution decision making. One increasingly useful and reliable tool is the life cycle assessment (LCA). Air pollution results from myriad sources and processes.", "As such, the fundamentals of air pollution embody not only the principles of the atmospheric sciences, but also those of many other scienti\ufb01c disciplines. Air pollution must be understood systematically and includes steps that involve energy and various types of matter, both living and nonliving. The life cycle perspective avoids arbitrary divisions among air pollution, water pollution, land pollution, and the like. Thus, to truly explore the subject of this book, consideration of an entire life cycle is needed. Certainly, the fundamentals include a sound basis for designing and selecting the appropriate air pollution control equipment or understanding the chemical reactions that lead to the emission of air pollutants. However, the fundamentals also include what happened long before the stack releases and chemical reactions and long after the emitted substances do their damage. What may be good for the air may be detrimental to the soil and vice-versa. Energy production is a major source of air pollution. Stacks and tailpipes releasing smoke and fumes are emblematic of the connections between fossil fuel combustion and air pollution. Indeed, energy concerns are at the forefront of political, policy, and scienti\ufb01c decisions. Questions loom about how to become less reliant on \ufb01nite energy sources, like fossil fuels; how to balance economic growth with environmental stewardship; and whether to employ precaution to protect the environment, including the potential for climate change, endangered species, and chronic public health impacts. To this end, this chapter provides an overview of the life cycles of energy systems and the damage incurred by the various stages, from extraction to disposala. All energy production causes insults to the environment, differing in the amount and type of pollution. 5.2 ENERGY Modern life depends on energy in all of its forms. Everyday activities rely on a mix of mechanical, thermal, chemical, acoustic, and nuclear energy. Most of the earth\u2019s available energy comes from the sun. The fusion and \ufb01ssion of the sun emits large amounts of electromagnetic radiation, some of which \ufb01nds its way to the earth. Thus, our planet has been and continues to be bombarded by the sun\u2019s electromagnetic energy, i.e. sunlight. Plants use and store this energy by photosynthesis. Animals use the stored energy for respiration. The remains of these plants and animals are deposited, and under pressure and over vast periods of time, energy is captured in minerals, known as fossil fuels. The sun is also the source of many so-called alternative energy sources. Most obvious is solar energy, in which the electromagnetic energy is used directly (e.g. to heat water) or indirectly, in photovoltaic systems that convert photons to electrons. Wind is actually a type of solar energy, since the heating of the atmosphere leads to air movements. Bioenergy systems, e.g. algae and wood, are also solar, given that they derive their energy from photosynthesis and respiration. The only \u201cnonsolar\u201d energy source on the earth is nuclear energy. Radioactive elements have unstable nuclei that emit radiation as they decay. These are also sources of fuel for energy. Indeed, uranium and other radioactive elements in minerals can be processed to reach a This chapter is adapted from: 1. Vallero, D.A. (2013). Chapter 25.

LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF AIR POLLUTANTS critical concentrations in a reactor. These reactions throw off enormous amounts of heat (i.e. nuclear energy converted to thermal energy). Choosing the best energy source is complicated. Advocates for and against various sources invoke a number of criteria for what is \u201cbest\u201d. Some argue for reliability of production. Others emphasize economics, e.g. based on acostebene\ufb01t analysis. Arguably, however, the most contentious and important are the public health and environmental impacts of the various energy sources. Unfortunately, comparisons are often dif\ufb01cult given the differences in the steps needed to provide energy to the end user. For example, an electric car may appear to be much cleaner than a gasoline-powered car, based solely on tailpipe emissions. The comparison becomes more complicated when the major source of electricity is coal that, when burned, emits large amounts of pollution from a stationary source, i.e. the power plant. Next, the impacts from extraction (coal mine versus oil well), transport (rail versus pipeline), etc. need to be considered in any proper decision.", "Thus, the best way to consider the air pollution impacts of energy production, distribution, and transport is to employ a life cycle assessment (LCA). Such analyses are only as good as the assumptions and data used. It is important to keep in mind that energy use is similar to all societal decisions in that it depends on what is valued. The value placed on an activity or material determines the costs that will be tolerated. For much of the past century in the United States, for example, much of society highly valued personal transportation based on the internal combustion engine to be highly valued, even if that has meant urban smog and other environmental impacts. If there is a switch to substantially greater numbers of electric vehicles, this may entail a change to less mobile sources of pollution, but greater FIGURE 5.1 Life cycle stages of a process must Inputs follow the conservation law, with material and energy balances.

EPA/600/R-92/245. Cincinnati (OH): Of\ufb01ce of Research and Development; 1993. Raw materials centralized, stationary sources from fossil fuel-\ufb01red and nuclear power-generating stations. Whether such a transition is better depends on what is valued. In almost every large-scale energy plan, it is not a question of one option with much pollution and the other with no pollution. It is often a matter of the type of pollutant. In the electricity versus internal combustion example, the electric car system would emit large amounts of particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and heavy metals (including mercury [Hg]) from a central source. Conversely, each gasoline-powered car would emit much smaller amounts of PM; volatile organic compounds (VOCs), like benzene; and other pollutants, but the overall emissions from millions of small mobile sources (vehicles) is what is important. Society may be willing to accept increased rates of diseases, even mortalities, as well as damage to ecosystems, if they place a higher value of what internal combustion engines provide or appear to provide (e.g. freedom of movement), versus less polluting options. Such trade-offs are common. The LCA is a tool for presenting the differences, but energy decisions depend on the willingness to make trade-offs. Incidentally, the status quo is dif\ufb01cult to change, even when facts show it to be less ef\ufb01cient and more costly than a new approach; that is, paradigms do indeed shift, but usually only after much resistance.1 5.3 ENERGY LIFE CYCLES The environmental acceptability of any energy source must be evaluated systematically. This is demonstrated by the LCA (see Figure 5.1). Consider the choice of whether to burn 100-L fuel A to manufacture 1000 kg of product Y releasing 100 kg of SO2 Outputs Water e\ufb04uents Atmospheric emissions Solid and hazardous wastes Coproducts I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5.3 ENERGY LIFE CYCLES per year versus burning 150 L of fuel B to manufacture the same amount of product Z, but releasing 300 kg of SO2 per year. If this were the only criterion, fuel A would unquestionably be the best choice. It uses 50% less fuel (more energy ef\ufb01cient) and releases one-third of the pollutant. However, looking further back into the life cycle in Figure 5.1, we \ufb01nd that fuel A requires that 1 t of earth is removed to produce 100 L of fuel A, but fuel B requires no extraction (it is generated from recycled food oils, e.g. biodiesel). It would appear that, early in the life cycle, fuel A has a much higher environmental cost (damage) than does fuel B. It could be that the extraction process does not emit a large amount of air pollutants, although such processes usually do, often in the form of fugitive dust (PM). Extraction activities almost always damage ecosystems, soil, and water systems. Furthermore, the two fuels will have different costs and bene\ufb01ts at the other levels in Figure 5.1. This demonstrates the complexity of most environmental problems. Environmental scientists and engineers are charged with providing credible information to inform decisions to address these problems. Indeed, the public has come to expect a modicum of environmental protection, placing much trust in scientists and engineers. The public evaluates the actions of industry, governments, farmers, consumers, and everyone as to how much insult the action in\ufb02icts on the environment.", "An otherwise worthy endeavor may be too distasteful for the public if it adds or appears to add too much pollution in its achieving these otherwise commendable ends. In this sense, pollution prevention and control must be both prospective and systematic. Acceptable solutions are prospective in that they must adapt to a changing set of rules, both scienti\ufb01c and societal. They are systematic in that everything in the environment affects every other entity. The \u201centity\u201d can be a material substance (e.g. a xenobiotic toxin) or an organism (both the agent and the receptor, e.g. a microbe and a human host for a contaminant or a microbe and ecosystem in a remediation project). The \u201centity\u201d may also be a process or mechanism. K.W. Miller, editor of the IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, captured this prospective, systematic perspective, adding society\u2019s expectation of scienti\ufb01c vigilance: From stone spearheads to nanotubes, our artifacts can change how we live and, ultimately, who we are. The social sig ni\ufb01cance of technological change requires us to take responsibil ity for the design, implementation, and deployment of the things we make..(I)t is clear that technology can change soci ety. But sometimes we lose sight of the idea that society can change technology.2 As technological changes come at us thick and fast, we can be overwhelmed. Either consciously or unconsciously, we may start to accept some degree of technological determinism or Chandler\u2019s inevitability thesis. The idea that technology is going to happen no matter what we do is both tempting and highly dangerous, as many have pointed out. We have to keep reminding ourselves that we not only can steer technology but also that we should. Engineers especially must remember that part of our professional responsibility is to shape technology for the bene\ufb01t of the public at large. Identifying, characterizing, controlling, and reducing risks present an apparent cacophony or symphony (depending on one\u2019s point of view) of multifaceted efforts to solve ill-posed problems. There is seldom a singular critical path to success. And, being human, even a well-designed, properly focused path to success is seldom followed as conceived, especially when living things are involved. Even the simplest of chemical compounds or the smallest of organisms does not completely behave as expected, particularly when a project is scaled up from the laboratory to the mesoscale pilot to the prototype and \ufb01nally in the real world. Error, variability, and unexpected contingent events are missed or mischaracterized in a setting with additional and changing variables, even after applying the lessons from each scale-up step. The challenge is to achieve something of importance, e.g. medical, agricultural, manufacturing, and environmental breakthroughs, without undue harm in space and time. Spatial harm occurs when a contaminant is released into the environment and causes immediate harm within a de\ufb01ned distance of the release. For example, an atmospheric plume may be transported to places where it causes additional harm. Within the plume, chemical transformation may occur by abiotic and biotic processes to form new compounds, which may be more or less reactive and toxic and which may build up in the environment after they are deposited from the atmosphere. Temporal harm can take the form of short-term impacts. A substance is released into the environment, rendering an immediate, acute impact. Such a response can range from the highly circumscribed with little impact (e.g. release of a highly reactive substance in suf\ufb01ciently low quantities and distance between the release and the receptor, so that it breaks down long before causing any harm) to disastrous (an immediate release of suf\ufb01ciently large quantities of a substance that reach the receptor and elicit effects to a large population of receptors). The insult may be either isolated or episodic (e.g. one-time event like thermal inversion during a con\ufb02uence of events, such as an explosion, where large amounts of contaminants are released and remain for a protracted time period), or it may be continuous, e.g. a water heater that releases carbon monoxide due to inadequate air-to-gas ratios, a leak from a propane tank valve into the atmosphere, or a slow release of gasoline (benzeneetolueneeethylbenzeneexylene) from an underground storage tank over decades into the groundwater and atmosphere. The simplest biochemodynamic I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF AIR POLLUTANTS approach addresses each compartment where a contaminant is found in discrete phases of air, water, soil, sediment, and biota (see Figures 5.2 and 5.3).", "The top box in Figure 5.2 includes emissions from every step in the energy life cycle, from extraction (e.g. PM from mining and volatilization of compounds from crude oil and natural gas extraction) to releases of air pollutants from re\ufb01ning and processing to emissions from vehicles and other sources during Atmosphere Chemical Airborne aerosols outflow Desorption Sorption Air emissions combustion to releases from land\ufb01lls, incinerators, recycling, and other end-of-life systems. The \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics states that the mass of the contaminant entering and the mass leaving a control volume must be balanced by what remains within the control volume. However, environmental systems are a cascade of control volumes. Within each control volume, an individual compartment may gain or lose mass of a substance, but the overall mass must balance.

FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5.3 ENERGY LIFE CYCLES FIGURE 5.3 Air pollutants include more that those directly released into the environment. For example, light (e.g. speci\ufb01c weight less than that of water) compounds may remain in the unsaturated (vadose) zone underground, with some eventually volatilizing to the atmosphere and others continuing to move in the groundwater plume. Light compounds that readily mix with water (miscible) will move further downgradient, and denser compounds may continue to \ufb02ow perpendicular to the surface until reaching an impermeable layer, whereupon they move gravitationally. Even these may become air pollutants if they are pumped to the surface and partition. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Vallero DA. Environmental Contaminants: Assessment and Control. Burlington (MA): Academic Press; 2004. ISBN: 0127100571. The generally inclusive term for these compartmental changes is known as fugacity or the \u201c\ufb02eeing potential\u201d of a substance. Fugacity is a thermodynamic term for a substance\u2019s propensity to escape from one environmental compartment to another (see Chapter 18). Combining the relationships between and among all the partitioning terms is one means of modeling chemical transport in the environment.3 Even within a single compartment, a contaminant may exist in various phases (e.g. dissolved in water and sorbed to a particle in the solid phase). Inter-phase reactions, or the physical interactions of the contaminant at the interface between each compartment, determine the amount of any substance in the environment. Within a compartment, a contaminant may remain unchanged for a designated time period, may move physically, or may be transformed chemically into another substance. The measure of temporal harm is persistence. The measure of environmentally acceptable designs and operations is sustainability. For example, a recalcitrant chemical compound will have a high measure of persistence. Certainly, all environmental decisions are technical in content, but they vary in the mix of skills and content needed. For example, both structural and mechanical engineers address the laws of motion and thermodynamics, but differ as to why. Mechanical engineers may be more interested in \ufb01nding better ways to make something move, whereas structural engineers are more likely to make sure something never moves over its designed life, or at least moves in nanometers rather than meters. Even this distinction is variable, since a mechanical engineer working on a braking system may share more in common with the structural engineer than his mechanical engineering colleagues working on increasing an engine\u2019s torque and delivering more energy to turn the wheels. Often,however,the distinctions lie with the mix of physics, chemistry, and biology. As mentioned, one of the key requirements of an energy system is that it be sustainable. More than simply meeting an environmental benchmark, a sustainable solution is one that assures that the benchmark will be met continuously for the foreseeable future. As such, engineering and science are becoming increasingly systems-oriented. Proper design must consider the raw materials, energy, labor, and other aspects of a project before extraction from the earth, manufacture, and operating life. The LCA for an energy decision should consider what is valuable about a site beyond its utility at hand. For example, how does an energy choice affect the fabric of the community, including the vitality, history, and connections within the neighborhood and the other neighborhoods to which it is connected? This is currently one of the I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF AIR POLLUTANTS key concerns with hydraulic fracturing of shale and other rock strata to obtain natural gas and other fossil fuels.", "Even a technically sound and environmentally acceptable method is unacceptable if its adverse societal impacts are unacceptable. That is, before the project is evaluated for its environmental and operational utility, it should have already undergone the review by LCA to ensure fairness. When considering the \ufb01rst canon of the engineering profession, i.e. to \u201chold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public\u201d,4 the public is often perceived to be a broad and amorphic entity. However, since engineering must always incorporate suf\ufb01cient margins of safety, good design must include the needs of persons who historically have been underrepresented. Unfortunately, the opposite has been the case all too often in the past. The path of least resistance to gain approval for infrastructures has often traversed the neighborhoods of disadvantaged neighborhoods. Entire communities have been displaced, historical treasures lost, and sacred land trampled as engineers and planners found far less resistance from these neighborhoods than from those with higher socioeconomic status (SES). Zoning has been used to pave the way and eminent domain to acquire the space for the factory, shopping center, and other private endeavors. Siting the power plant and other quasipublic projects; and selecting the best place for a land\ufb01ll, wastewater treatment plant, highway, or other public infrastructural enterprises have been much easier to attain in neighborhoods with muted voices. 5.3.1 Upstream Impacts Every energy source has upstream impacts. Obviously, coal and uranium must be mined, crude oil and natural gas drilled, and trees harvested. However, this also extends to \u201cnonemitting\u201d sources. Solar panels must be constructed of materials extracted from the earth (e.g. silica for glass and crude oil to make plastics). Wind turbines are made of steel and other metals that require extracting ores, as well as other manufactured materials (e.g. plastic insulation). After extraction, the manufacturing processes are also part of the upstream stage of the life cycle for all energy sources. This applies to decentralized systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines installed on buildings, as well as to large, centralized, stationary sources, such as the construction, operation, and decommissioning of a coal or nuclear power generating facility. The footprint of these large systems can be substantial in terms of time, materials, and energy demands. Environmental insult involves a stressor and a receptor. The stressor is a matter or energy that comes into contact with a receptor, causing harm. Most commonly for air pollution, the agent is chemical. An agent may also be biological, such as an organism (e.g. fungi, bacteria, and viruses). An agent may also be physical, including direct and indirect effects from energy exposure. For example, ultraviolet light (physical stressor) reaches human skin cells (receptor), changing the deoxyribonucleic acid and leading to skin cancer (harm). The principal upstream stressors result from mining and drilling. Mining alters habitats physically, chemically, and biologically. Physically removing large amounts of overburden completely changes the geomorphology of the mining region. This involves the removal of the soil and rocks and has caused environmental problems and sometimes loss of life. 5.3.1.1 Mining stressors Surface mining comes in many forms. Mining a seam of mineral by \ufb01rst removing a long strip of overburden is called strip mining and is often used in coal mining. It is also being used to extract the tar and oil from the sand at Athabasca in Alberta resulting in severe damage to the ecology and posing a threat to Alberta\u2019s boreal forest ecosystem. Open pit mining refers to mining from a huge open pit which can be very deep and large. This approach has been used to mine lignite in Germany and coal in Colombia.5,6 A more common and particularly physically and biologically stressful mining method is hilltop mining, i.e. stripping the overburden from the top of a mountain to expose the ore and then depositing the waste material in nearby valleys (see Figure 5.3). It seriously disturbs the ecosystem and changes the topography and even the \ufb02ow of rivers and streams. One of the major problems with mountaintop mining is that head water streams are often buried, resulting in the loss of ecosystems. This technique leads to forest destruction, loss of biodiversity, and affects many species (see Figure 5.4). I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5.3 ENERGY LIFE CYCLES Hundreds of streams near US Appalachian coal \ufb01elds have experienced: 1.", "Increased concentrations of minerals in water, e.g. zinc, sodium, selenium, and sulfate which could have an impact on the \ufb01sh and macroinvertebrates, and other streams in watersheds below valley \ufb01lls tend to have greater base \ufb02ow. 2. Wetlands destruction. 3. Forests broken into sections. 4. Impeded regrowth of trees and woody plants on regraded land in part due to compacted soils. 5. Increased populations of grassland birds and snakes on reclaimed mine, but reduced populations of amphibians. Other impacts of surface mines include aesthetics, groundwater and surface water runoff contamination, noise, air quality (dust and mining pollutants), vibration, subsidence, as well as a devastating effect on the \ufb02ora and fauna of the region.7 In addition to habitat destruction, mining activities lead to explosions, subsidence, slurry spills, and chemical pollution both above ground and through groundwater. Step 1. Layers of rock and soil above the coal (called overburden) are removed Step 2. The upper seams of coal are removed with spoils placed in an adjacent valley Step 4. Draglines excavate lower layers of coal with spoils placed in spoil piles Step 4. Re-grading begins as coal excavation continues Chemical pollution results when soil and rock are broken, allowing migration of metals and other elements from the mining area in air (i.e. fugitive dust) and in water. One of the most common results from surface coal mines is an increase in acidity, in large part due to the sulfur being leached from the coal and overburden, and being oxidized. The most direct and immediately obvious ecological effect of coal extraction has been acid mine drainage (see Figure 5.5). Acid drainage is caused by the oxidation of metallic compounds such as the mineral constituent of rocks and soils that is often present in coal mine wastes and overburden. Streams affected by coal mine drainage are typically acidic (pH 2.5e6.0) and are characterized by high iron and sulfate concentrations. In addition, the iron, as ferric hydroxide, often precipitates as a \ufb01ne \ufb02ock that may coat stream bottoms and further affect aquatic life. Acid mine drainage may also leach toxic concentrations of metals such as copper, aluminum, and zinc from rocks and soils. The oxidation, or weathering, of pyrite and other metal sul\ufb01des is a natural process that may occur spontaneously on exposure of minerals to air, or it may be mediated by bacteria.

LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF AIR POLLUTANTS Weathering of pyritic rock formations has resulted in naturally acidic streams in some localized areas of the southeast United States. By the mid-1960s, a century of US surface mining had disturbed8 about 8000 km2, including 21,000 km of streams (totaling 550 km2), 281 natural lakes (419 km2), and 168 reservoirs (168 km2). Coal mining accounted for 41% of the total disturbed lands, the bulk of pollution being from acid mine drainage in the East and the Midwest portions of the United States. Current US surface mining regulations mandate the restoration of disturbed lands. Similar surface mining contamination has been observed in other parts of the world. In addition to and exacerbated by decreasing pH, metal contamination also occurs from mining. For most metals, the chemical form determines just how toxic it is. The form also determines how readily the metal moves in the environment and how rapidly it is taken up and stored by organisms. The chemical form is determined by the oxidation state or valence of the metal. Metals form positive ions (cations), are reducing agents, have low electron af\ufb01nities, and have positive valences (oxidation numbers). Metalloids have properties of both metals and nonmetals, but two environmentally important metalloids, arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb), behave much like metals in terms of their toxicity and mobility, so they are often grouped with the heavy metals. At some concentration, all elements except those generated arti\ufb01cially by \ufb01ssion in nuclear reactors, are found in overburden and soils. This is true for toxic elements, such as the heavy metals, mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb), which are known to be neurotoxic and to cause other human health effects. The global mass balance of these metals, however, does not change; only their location and form (i.e. chemical species) can be changed.", "When concentrated and made bioavailable to humans and other organisms, such as from extraction and re\ufb01ning processes, metals and metalloids can present major threats to public health and the environment. Contamination from fossil fuel mining is not limited to surface waters, but can reach ground water, a major source of drinking water for much of the world. Indeed, both the quality and quantity of groundwater are threatened. Groundwater, surface water, and the atmosphere must be considered as a single system, with contaminants moving and transforming physically and chemically within and between each level (see Figure 5.6). For example, fugitive dust blowing off the mine will become dissolved or suspended in water vapor. Droplets return to the earth as precipitation and reach surface water and groundwater. Metals in each compartment will change valency, making them more or less mobile and more or less toxic. Photo credit: U.S. Geological Survey and Hardesty D. Underground or shaft coal mining also has environmental risks, including groundwater contamination, subsidence, and coal \ufb01res. A coal mine \ufb01re smolders, since oxygen levels are low, meaning it can burn for many years. This presents a serious problem from many aspects: economical (burning a vital commodity), environmental (emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gasesdCH4 and CO2 and mercury), dangerous subsidence, and toxicity. Underground \ufb01res are very dif\ufb01cult to extinguish since it is almost impossible to seal leaks to the surface over the entire room and pillar systems. Flooding the mines with water and slurries has been ineffective, since the \ufb01re simply follows pathways of available oxygen in the leaky underground strata. Even if technically possible, suffocating \ufb01res can introduce safety risks, e.g. miner safety and postignition \ufb01re suppression. To ensure suf\ufb01cient oxygen levels and low toxic gas concentrations, the mine\u2019s ventilation systems require methane-drainage holes to control methane at the face. In many abandoned mines, cross-measure holes (see Figure 5.7) were the most common types. These systems are one reason that oxygen remains available to these \ufb01res.9 Internationally there are probably many hundreds of coal \ufb01res presently burning. Indeed, Australia, I.

(For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Adapted from U.S. Geological Survey and Vallero DA. Environmental Contaminants: Assessment and Control. Burlington (MA): Academic Press; 2004. Canada, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, and the United States have documented details of ongoing \ufb01res. It has been estimated that these \ufb01res contribute to at least 3% of the world\u2019s annual carbon emissions. For example, \ufb01res from China\u2019s coal mines presently release about 1 109 t (metric tons) of CO2 to the atmosphere every year. Estimates put India\u2019s coal mine \ufb01re releases to be about 50 106 t per year. This accounts for as much as 1% of all carbon greenhouse gas releases. This is about the same as the CO2 emitted by all the gasoline fuel automobiles in the United States. Engineering solutions that reduce these emissions would actively improve the net greenhouse gas global \ufb02ux. Unfortunately, the problem is persistent. Some US coal mine \ufb01res have burned for more than a century. 5.3.1.2 Uranium mining Fossil fuel extraction represents the largest contribution to environmental damage. Other energy-related extractions, however, can also be substantial. Considerable amounts of uranium continue to be mined in the United States (Figure 5.8) and around the globe (Table 5.1). Uranium and its decay products, radium and radon, can be inhaled. Uranium and radium inhalation exposures are usually as PM, and radon is a gas. Uranium miners and those near mining operations and tailings (solid waste left after concentrating the ore) have the highest potential exposures. Environmental damage from uranium mining can be widespread. Most mining in the United States, predominantly in the Mountain West region, use in situ leaching, which needs large amounts of water, largely from wells and extensive pumping systems to transport ore and dissolve the minerals to concentrate the uranium content. These processes increase the risk of heavy metal and radioisotope contamination of air, soil, and water (particularly groundwater)10 due to the mechanisms shown in Figure 5.8.", "Besides uranium mining, various ore extractions are needed for other energy sources, such as copper and other metals for electronics in solar panels, wind turbines, and all heating and cooling systems; aluminum and iron extraction for numerous purposes (e.g. turbine housings for wind and hydroelectric energy); and nickel mining for batteries in electric cars and devices. The physical and chemical processes are similar to those described above. These must be included in any complete LCA. 5.3.1.3 Crude oil and natural gas drilling stressors Oil and natural gas are extracted by drilling. Drilling activities pollute the water, soil, and air. Air pollutants can be aerosols (suspended liquid and/or solid particles) or vapor phase. Aerosols are released when soil is removed to install casings and rigs, as well as from vehicular activities. Gases and vapors include VOCs, such as benzene and FIGURE 5.8 Section view of cross-measure methane-drainage holes in a coal mine ventilation system. Smith AC, Diamond WP, Organiscak JA.

N/A. 5.3 ENERGY LIFE CYCLES toluene. Both are aromatic in that they have a six-carbon ring. Benzene is carcinogenic and neurotoxic. Toluene is also neurotoxic and causes reproductive disorders. VOCs from drilling operations include numerous other aromatic and aliphatic carbon chains, which have health effects and contribute to smog (tropospheric ozone). Operations that produce these compounds include venting, \ufb02aring, and dehydration of natural gas. 11 Other drilling-related air pollutants include carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, ozone, and sulfur dioxide, which are products of incomplete combustion (PICs). Methane and hydrogen sul\ufb01de occur naturally with and in the aquifers and are released during the drilling process. Soil can be contaminated by hydrocarbons in the crude oil; soils also receive any impurities, including heavy metals, salts, and radioactive isotopes; as well as chemicals used in the development process, e.g. 2-butoxyethanol, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethanol, and nonylphenol. All three have been linked to endocrine disruption, among other health effects in humans.12 Drilling operations pollute both groundwater and surface water. Groundwater is polluted when the oil or gas enters aquifers, especially drinking water aquifers, from leaks in casings and other means of penetration, such as cracks in con\ufb01ning strata, allowing the oil, gas, and their impurities to enter other strata. Indeed, in situ releases have accounted for the largest releases of crude oil, such as the Gulf War oil spill in the Persian Gulf in 1991, Deepwater Horizon in 2010, and the Ixtoc spill in Bay of Campeche, Mexico, in 1979 and 1980. Some areas have suffered continuous releases for decades, such as the thousands of separate incidents in the Niger River Delta of Nigeria that have collectively released about 220,000 m3 of crude oil into surface waters and wetlands, including sensitive habitats.", "Historically, crude oil drilling has mainly occurred at the rigs and derricks on land and offshore. However, unique risks are being introduced with deeper extractions further away from the shore, as evidenced by the recent devastating spill in the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 5.9). The Deepwater Horizon was a dynamically positioned, semi-submersible offshore oil drilling rig, designed to drill in ultradeep waters. In dynamic positioning, the vessel is kept in place using computerized thrusters and propellers. By April 14, 2010, BP Exploration & Production Inc. (BP) had nearly completed the exploratory phase of the Macondo well, with two well operation tasks remaining: running the well casing and preparing the well to be temporarily abandoned. The Deepwater Horizon was scheduled to depart the well once these tasks were completed. By this time, BP had veri\ufb01ed the existence of a hydrocarbon reservoir but did not plan to immediately produce it; a different rig would commence completion operations for the operator at a later date.13 Casing is typically installed with two sets of cementing check valves: the \ufb02oat shoe, located on the very bottom of the casing string, and the \ufb02oat collar, usually installed from two to six casing joints above the bottom. BP\u2019s production casing design for the Macondo well called for only one cementing check device, consisting of a double valve and an auto\ufb01ll \ufb02oat collar. The window for safe drilling between the fracture gradient and the pore pressure gradient decreases with drilling depth, so keeping the correct amount of equivalent circulating density had become increasingly dif\ufb01cult. This perturbed the integrity of the well and led to \ufb02uid losses. As this safety window narrowed, BP began to change plans by reducing the well\u2019s target depth, considering changes in well casings, reducing the circulating rate below the parameters speci\ufb01ed to convert the I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF AIR POLLUTANTS \ufb02oat collar, decreasing the density of cement with nitrogen foam, using less cement, and ceasing to conduct complete bottoms-up cementing. A negative pressure test was needed to make certain that the cement would stop \ufb02owing from the oil reservoir into the well after seawater replaced the drilling mud. The test should have been a red \ufb02ag of trouble ahead; that is, the pressure readings on the drill pipe were abnormal. This should have been a warning that the cement barrier was not working. Pressure bypassed the cement and \ufb02oat equipment, so that the well was still connected to the oil formation. At the very least, this was a miscalculation, since the negative pressure test results were misinterpreted. The failure was compounded when BP decided to go ahead with the \ufb01nal displacement. The BP oil spill \ufb02owed into the Gulf for 3 months and is the largest oil spill disaster in the history of the oil industry. The explosion on the rig killed 11 men and injured 17. The oil poured out of a leak on the sea\ufb02oor bottom. It released 780,000 m3 (4.9 million barrels) of oil into the Gulf of Mexico; about 800 km (500 miles) off the coastline of Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, and Alabama was contaminated by BP oil. The spill affected every type of \ufb02ora and fauna in the area, whales and dolphins died at twice their normal rate, wetland grass and \ufb02ora died and \ufb01shing came to a halt, and an underwater plume, not visible on the surface, killed sea\ufb02oor \ufb02ora and fauna. BP admitted that it made mistakes and soon after the accident set up a $20 billion fund to compensate victims of the oil spill.14 This disaster demonstrates the risks of deepwater drilling. It is quite dif\ufb01cult to quantify these risks for comparisons to other energy options, e.g. the mining options discussed earlier. In addition, applying these comparisons to societal trade-offs may not lend itself to quanti\ufb01cation. For example, cycling is virtually free of fossil fuels, but the demand for individual and personal transportation may outweigh concerns for the environment. 5.4 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE DURING EXTRACTION As mentioned, a complete LCA consideration must include societal factors. A particularly illustrative example is justice. For example, coal, uranium, crude oil, and natural gas extraction occurs on Native American tribal land at a much higher rate than most of the North American population. Since risk is a function of hazard and exposure, all other things being equal, risks from energy extraction are disproportionally high for Native Americans and are arguably an unjust outcome of deliberate and incidental decisions and events.", "\u201cEnvironmental justice\u201d communities have two characteristics: 1. They have experienced historical (usually multigenerational) exposures to disproportionately high doses of potentially harmful substances (the environmental part). 2. They have certain speci\ufb01ed socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, including a low SES; are racial and ethnic; and are historically a disadvantaged people (the justice part). The determination of disproportionate impacts, i.e. diseases and other health endpoints, is fundamental to environmental justice. Epidemiologists look at clusters and other indications of elevated exposures and effects in populations. Certain cancers and neurological and other chronic diseases have been found to be signi\ufb01cantly higher in minority communities and in socioeconomically depressed areas. Acute diseases, as indicated by hospital admissions, may also be higher in certain segments of society, such as pesticide poisoning in migrant workers. In addition, each person responds to an environmental insult uniquely and that person is affected differently at various life stages. For example, young children are at higher risk to neurotoxins. However, subpopulations can also experience different effects than that of the whole population, meaning that genetic differences seem to affect people\u2019s susceptibility to contaminant exposure. Scientists are very interested in genetic variation, so that genomic techniques15 (e.g. identifying certain polymorphisms) are a growing area of inquiry.16 It appears that the tribes have borne disproportionate exposure to pollution and destruction of environmental resources. The disproportionate exposure demonstrates the weakness of the bene\ufb01t to cost ratio (B/C), which is often considered for large populations, akin to the statistical concept of a normal distribution (Figure 5.10). Assuming that the bene\ufb01ts and costsb in a given situation are normally distributed within a population, the option with the average, largest bene\ufb01ts versus costs would be selected. This assures that subpopulations furthest from the mean would derive the least bene\ufb01ts, and that most of the population would get the most bene\ufb01t. That is, the highest B/C ratios are those near the statistical measures of central tendency, i.e. the mean, median, and mode. b Cost can be considered to be health and ecological risks when constructing a bene\ufb01t/cost relationship. This is another weakness of the B/C, i.e. often the \u201cenvironmental services\u201d of an ecosystem are only a part of its value. This is often limited to those services valued by large segments of the population and is very anthropocentric (i.e. what good does this ecosystem provide to humans.) The distinction is often between instrumental versus inherent value, with many ecosystem service advocates most interested in the former. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5.5 FUEL CYCLE IMPACTS Central tendencies Benefit to costs ratio 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 In the case of tribal lands, the normal distribution can lead to environmental injustices; it has placed a disproportionate environmental and potential health burden on the tribes. This may also demonstrate a type of \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d.c Often, the curve is not normally distributed, but is skewed in favor of the higher socioeconomic strata (Figure 5.11). As is often the case, the energy extraction disparity is doubly unfair in that many people assuming most of the costs and risks receive the fewest bene\ufb01ts and have had little voice in the decisions as to how and where to extract the minerals. 5.5 FUEL CYCLE IMPACTS Once material is extracted, it must be converted to usable fuel. Some fuels are usable directly as extracted, e.g. natural gas and coal, but often need to be changed FIGURE 5.11 Hypothetical selection of a \u201cfair\u201d option from a utilitarian perspective when the bene\ufb01ts are normally distributed.

For example, the natural gas may be compressed for ease in cross-oceanic transport. Coal will be crushed and even pulverized, depending on the combustion requirements. Other materials will require processing and conversion. Processing uranium ore into usable fuel may require large amounts of energy, often from fossil fuels. Thus, even though the nuclear reactions themselves produce no greenhouse gases or other pollutants, the processing steps certainly will. Crude oil processing and conversion is a substantial source of environmental pollution. Depending on the end product, varying amounts of energy is needed to re\ufb01ne crude oil into gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, etc. In addition, the life cycle must also consider the other needs of the \ufb01nal product. For example, both electric and gasoline-powered (and hybrid) vehicles need c The phrase was coined by Alexis de Tocqueville and considered at some length by John Stuart Mills. In a democracy, the majority is very powerful.", "It can in\ufb02uence and even control the entire people, as what happened in Germany where elected of\ufb01cials, including Hitler gained and abused power. This was much on the mind of the framers of the United States Constitution, so that the duly elected do not become the tyrants and so that those with little power are not crushed. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF AIR POLLUTANTS lubricants for moving parts, but electric motors do not require motor oil to lubricate pistons and other parts of internal combustion engines. These lubricants are derived from crude oil, so when comparing energy demands, they must be included. Another aspect of the fuel cycle is the transport of the raw material to the various sites. In its gaseous form, natural gas is transported by pipelines. The excavation, construction, and upkeep of these lines must be considered as part of natural gas life cycle. Indeed, pipelines can have major environmental impacts on ecosystems, such as bifurcating or truncating habitats, changing migration patterns, interfering with spawning and nesting, and even changing micrometeorology (e.g. warm pipelines changing caribou migration). Pipelines also present human safety and health risks from explosion and \ufb01re, as methane (CH4) and other alkanes are highly explosive and \ufb02ammable. As mentioned, natural gas may also be compressed and shipped as a liquid in tankers. Although they do not have the risk of oil spills, such long-range shipments require energy and pose potential threats to ecosystems, e.g. bilge issues. 5.5.1 Fuel Cycle Stressors Environmental stressors introduced in the fuel cycle stages include many of those mentioned for upstream stages, since the extracted ores and substances are what are being transported and processed. Since crude oil presents very large environmental threats during TABLE 5.2 Largest Oil Spills Since 1967, Ranked by Weight of Product Spilled Position Ship Name Year Location Spill Size (t) 1 Atlantic Empress 1979 Off Tobago, West Indies 287,000 2 ABT Summer 1991 700 nautical miles off 260,000 Angola 3 Castillo de Bellver 1983 Off Saldanha Bay, South 252,000 Africa 4 Amoco Cadiz 1978 Off Brittany, France 223,000 5 Haven 1991 Genoa, Italy 144,000 6 Odyssey 1988 700 nautical miles off Nova 132,000 Scotia, Canada 7 Torrey Canyon 1967 Scilly Isles, UK 119,000 8 Sea Star 1972 Gulf of Oman 115,000 9 Irenes Serenade 1980 Navarino Bay, Greece 100,000 10 Urquiola 1976 La Coruna, Spain 100,000 11 Hawaiian Patriot 1977 300 nautical Miles off 95,000 Honolulu 12 Independenta 1979 Bosphorus, Turkey 95,000 13 Jakob Maersk 1975 Oporto, Portugal 88,000 14 Braer 1993 Shetland Islands, UK 85,000 15 Khark 5 1989 120 nautical Miles off Atlantic 80,000 coast of Morocco 16 Aegean Sea 1992 La Coruna, Spain 74,000 17 Sea Empress 1996 Milford Haven, UK 72,000 18 Nova 1985 Off Kharg Island, Gulf of Iran 70,000 19 Katina P 1992 Off Maputo, Mozambique 66,700 20 Prestige 2002 Off Galicia, Spain 63,000 35 Exxon Valdez 1989 Prince William Sound, Alaska, 37,000 USA t \u00bc ton (metric ton).

In addition, when crude oil is leaked, it can have devastating impacts on ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic. Transport by tanker and barge presents substantial environmental threats. Notorious examples of liquid spills include oil from the wrecked Exxon Valdes off the Alaskan coast and the massive release of crude oil from the breach of the Deepwater Horizon piping in the Gulf of Mexico. These are all examples of immediate releases of a contaminant. In the case of the Exxon Valdez, the release itself was from a single vessel (i.e. a ship\u2019s hull or a tank). In the case of the Deepwater Horizon spill, the release continued for months.", "The extent and duration of a leak or spill is determined by the available volume of a substance. Once the ship hull or tank is emptied, the spill itself ends, but the damage it causes can endure for decades. If the source is vast, such as the oil in rock strata under the Gulf of Mexico, the spill will end only after the pressure differential between the strata and the surface reaches equilibrium, or until the available substance is depleted. Thus, the properties of the \ufb02uid and the characteristics of the environment determine the amount and rate of a contaminant that is released in a disaster.17 There have been numerous oil spills since crude oil and oil products began to be shipped over large distances (see Table 5.2). The largest spill from a vessel at sea in terms of amount of release occurred in 1979 when the Atlantic Empress spilled 287,000 t of crude oil near Tobago in the West Indies. Oil spills result from many causes. Actually, the Exxon Valdez was the most notorious spill prior to the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. However, the Valdez stands in the 35th position in terms of weight (37,000 t). This illustrates that the amount spilled is only part of the criteria used to determine disaster status of an event. In the case of the Valdez, much of the problem had to do with where the spill occurred and the sensitivity of the habitat. Some organisms readily adapt to change, whereas other, more sensitive organisms may be irreversibly affected by very slight changes in habitat conditions. The causes of spills vary widely, but there appears to be a difference between very large and smaller spills. Equipment and hull failures account for nearly half (46%) of all spills. The difference seems to lie in where the spills occur (see Tables 5.3 and 5.4). Most large spills occur in open water, whereas for the smaller spills (less than 7 t) where the cause is known, most occur in the port, e.g. loading and discharging the \ufb02uid.18 The Exxon Valdez oil spill is arguably the most infamous tanker disaster, having changed the consciousness of the vulnerability of sensitive coastal habitats and littoral ecosystems. The supertanker loaded oil from the trans-Alaska pipeline from the Valdez terminal to deliver it to West Coast states (see Figure 5.12). On March 24, 1989, it veered out of the normal tanker channel and spilled 41.7 103 m3 (11 106 gallons) of oil after striking Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound.

Interestingly, both are greenhouse gases and both are essential to life on earth. Thus, the same substance that is essential can also be harmful, depending on its amount and location in time and space. A pollutant source can be stationary or mobile. Combustion at stationary sources, like large power plants and factories, releases CO2 and PICs. Combustion from mobile sources, such as automobiles, trucks, buses, aircraft, trains, and watercraft, also release pollutants. In fact, mobile sources can be worse than stationary sources in terms of the number of people exposed, since large populations live near roadways and other transportation routes. A relatively small number of people living near stationary sources, especially those with inadequate pollution controls, may have very high exposures relative to the general population. Thus, the environmental impacts of stationary sources versus those of mobile sources may call for decisions on whether it is worse to have a small, highly exposed subpopulation or a large, less exposed general population.d 5.7 OPERATION STAGE After extraction and fuel processing, each energy system is operated over its design life. During this life, fossil fuels are burned, nuclear reactions occur, and biota grow. The ef\ufb01ciency of these operations comprises a large component of energy use and sustainability. This is an example of the greatest good for the greatest number, a concept of utilitarian philosophy. Conversely, deontologists would hold that it is immoral to allow such exposures. The categorical imperative, for example, would hold that if the level of exposure of a few cannot be universalized, i.e. if everyone were exposed to the same pollutant at the same concentration, would this be acceptable. The answer would be \u201cno\u201d. Indeed, the \ufb01rst canon of the engineering profession is to hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public. Arguably, allowing certain groups to be exposed at high levels does not meet this canon. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF AIR POLLUTANTS 5.7.1 Combustion The largest human-induced source of many air pollutants is the combustion of fossil fuels to generate electricity. And the principal contributor to Hg, CO2, and SO2 emissions has been coal-\ufb01red power plants. Eastern and midwestern coals contain signi\ufb01cant quantities of sulfur, so their combustion reactions release large quantities of SO2, the major component of acid precipitation, to the atmosphere. Most of the high-sulfur coal consumed in the United States during this century has been used to make steel and to generate electricity in the east and midwest. From there, atmospheric pollutants responsible for acid precipitation are transported northward and eastward by prevailing winds and storms. These trends are re\ufb02ected in the geographic distribution of rainfall pH (Figure 5.14). There are a number of sources contributing to acid precipitation, including those from automotive exhausts, but emissions from coal-\ufb01red electricity-generating plants presently constitute the largest source of atmospheric SO2 in North America. FIGURE 5.14 The Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef on March 24, 1989. The map shows the expansion of oil front from day 1 through day 8.

Prince William\u2019s Oily Mess: A Tale of Recovery. http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/stories/ oilymess/oily07_time.html; 2012 [accessed 06.03.12]. Areas with underlying crystalline rock, shale, and sandstone are more prone to acidi\ufb01cation than those underlain by rock systems that buffer the acids, e.g. limestone and other carbonate-rich rock. Potentially sensitive areas are widely distributed in North America and include much of the Appalachian Mountains, whererainfallismostacidic(Figure 5.14); the Canadian Shield region of the upper Midwest (i.e. the northern parts of Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as eastern Minnesota and parts of eastern and central Canada); the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, Rocky Mountains, and Cascade Range; and parts of the Ozark and Ouachita uplands, mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain, and Florida. Buffering by ions in groundwater and constituents leached from watersheds makes large lakes and rivers at lower elevations less susceptible to acidi\ufb01cation than smaller, higher elevation lakes and streams. The interactions of ions in precipitation (i.e. H\u00fe, \u00fe22 SO4 ,NO3 ) with organic and inorganic constituents of soil and water affect toxicity. Particularly important is the leaching of potentially toxic elements, especially aluminum, from rocks and soils by acidic precipitation.", "Toxicity attributable to pH and aluminum is often episodic, occurring during high surface water discharge in the spring months. During the Spring, spawning and larvae releases occur for many aquatic organisms, making them vulnerable to reduced pH conditions. By de\ufb01nition, acid rain is rainfall with a pH lower than about 5.0; the pH of distilled water in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 is 5.6, but other atmospheric constituents tend to make rainfall more acidic even in areas unaffected by air pollution. In addition to sulfur, the combustion of coal emits other potentially toxic elements, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and selenium. Cadmium and selenium are concentrated in coal ash, from which they may be leached into surface waters and accumulated to toxic concentrations by aquatic organisms. Mercury, along with selenium, and other elements in coal are released into the atmosphere in stack emissions and can move long distances. Mercury and selenium readily bioaccumulate in birds, mammals, and predatory \ufb01shes. Mercury is generally released from pointsources,e.g.caustic soda,i.e.sodium hydroxide (NaOH) plants and paper mills. Bio-accumulation of mercury in remote lakes in the northeast seems to indicate that atmospheric transport and natural chemical processes tend to keep mercury available for accumulation by organisms. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), coal-\ufb01red electric generating plants are the greatest sources of atmospheric mercury, while other important sources include municipal and hospital waste incinerators. I. FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 5.7 OPERATION STAGE Complete or ef\ufb01cient combustion (thermal oxidation) converts hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water: \u00f0CH\u00de D O2 / CO2 D H2O (5.1) x Combustion is the combination of O2 in the presence of heat (as in burning fuel), producing CO2 and H2O during complete combustion of organic compounds, such as the combustion of octane: C8H18\u00f0l\u00de D 17O2\u00f0g\u00de / 8CO2\u00f0g\u00de D 9H2O\u00f0g\u00de (5.2) Complete combustion may also result in the production of molecular nitrogen (N2) when nitrogen-containing organics are burned, such as in the combustion of methylamine: 4CH3NH2\u00f0l\u00de D 9O2\u00f0g\u00de / 4CO2\u00f0g\u00de D 10H2O\u00f0g\u00de (5.3) D 2N2\u00f0g\u00de Incomplete combustion can produce a variety of compounds. Some are more toxic than the original compounds being oxidized, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, furans, and CO. An alert reader will note at least two observations about these categories. First, all are kinetic, as denoted by the one-directional arrow (/). Second, in the environment, many processes are incomplete, such as the common problem of incomplete combustion and the generation of new compounds in addition to carbon dioxide and water. Incomplete combustion reactions are very important sources of air pollutants. For example, these reactions generate PICs, such as carbon monoxide (CO), PAHs, dioxins, furans, and hexachlorobenzene. Consider the emissions of a 600 MW coal-\ufb01red power plant with a capacity factore of 69% and a heat ratef of 10,415. Without controls, each year this plant would release20 500 t of \ufb01ne PM (PM2.5), 14,100 t of SO2, 10,300 t of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), 220 t of VOCs (toxic and precursors to tropospheric ozone), 495 kg of arsenic (As), 370 kg of mercury (Hg), 251 kg of lead (Pb), 9 kg of cadmium (Cd), and other metals, including radioisotopes. All these emissions occur during the coal combustion stage of electricity generation from a single plant. Globally, CO2 emissions have been increasing since the Industrial Revolution, but at a faster rate in recent decades (see Figure 5.15). Energy supply contributes 26% of greenhouse gas emissions, the highest sector. Industry contributes 19%; forest and land activities, not including e Capacity factor is the frequency that a plant is operating, i.e. the amount electricity produced at continuous full power operation during that period. For example, a 600-MW power plant produces 3.63 million megawatt-hours (MWh) for a year; its capacity factor is 69% because 3.63 106 MWh \u00bc 69% of the electricity that the generator would have produced if it operated for the entire year (i.e. 106 MWh 1 year \u00bc 8760 h) without pause at full capacity (600 MW 8760 h \u00bc 5.25 106 MWh). That is 3:63 \u00bc 0:69. 5:25 106 MWh f Heat rate is thermal unit per power-time. In this case, it is the British thermal unit (BTU) per kilowatt-hour. For example, in 2011, the average operating heat rate for coal was 10,444, compared to 10,829 for petroleum, 8152 for natural gas, and 10,464 for nuclear energy.

Unfortunately, several other countries\u2019 CO2 emissions have more than compensated for the US decrease (see Figures 5.17 and 5.18 and Table 5.5). All atmospheric releases of products of complete and incomplete combustion \ufb01nd sinks throughout the biogeochemical cycles (see Part IV). Each box in Figure 5.2 below the atmosphere is a sink for substances in the atmosphere. For example, in the carbon cycle, CO2 becomes dissolved in surface waters. The largest reservoirs of surface water are the oceans, which have been dissolving increasing amounts of CO2. In turn, the oceans are experiencing decreasing pH, a worrying prospect for the earth\u2019s vast oceanic ecosystems and food sources (see Ocean Acidi\ufb01cation). 5.7.2 Operation Operation is often the only or principal consideration when comparing environmental impacts of energy choices. For example, a vehicle\u2019s tailpipe emissions and fuel economies are compared to those of other vehicles. Indeed, these are important considerations, but as the previous discussion has shown, they are only part of the life cycle. Today, for instance, most electric cars are actually \u201ccoal-\ufb01red\u201d or \u201cnuclearpowered\u201d vehicles. This will continue until alternative energy sources supplant fossil fuel and nuclear sources of electricity. OCEAN ACIDIFICATION The mean pH of ocean water has been decreasing, i.e. becoming more acidic, over recent decades, largely because of the ocean\u2019s uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. The decrease in ocean pH has co-occurred with the steady increase in the mean atmospheric concentration of CO2 over the past three centuries from 280 ppm to nearly 400 ppm. Ocean acidi\ufb01cation has potentially devastating rami\ufb01cations for all ocean life, from the smallest, single-celled algae to the largest whales.

Ocean Acidi\ufb01cation Program was of\ufb01cially established in May 2011. The OAP is an integral part of a much broader US research effort to increase our understanding about how (and how fast) the chemistry of the ocean is changing, how variable that change is by region, and what impacts these changes are having on marine life, people, and the local, regional, and national economies. NOAA is coordinating closely with other federal agencies which have strong ocean acidi\ufb01cation research or policy portfolios. These include the National Science Foundation, United States Geological Survey, National Aeronautical and Space Administration, Bureau of Energy Management, Department of State, US Fish and Wildlife Services, and the EPA.

Units have improved their energy ef\ufb01ciencies dramatically in recent decades. 5.8 DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS Evaluating the effects of energy choices must also consider the problems brought on by dismantling, decommissioning, disposing, and recycling. The key is to prevent the pollution in the \ufb01rst place. For example, if the demand for fossil fuels and other energy sources declines, less environmental damage would occur due to decreased need for extraction, fuel processing, and disposal of hazardous wastes associated with the operations. Energy conservation can go a long way to decrease the release of toxic pollutants and greenhouse gases, as well. Also, choices of materials can greatly affect downstream impacts. For example, chemicals injected underground are among the controversial aspects of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to obtain natural gas and other fossil fuels from previously unproductive strata. If safer, biodegradable chemicals are used, at least one concern would be lessened, i.e. potential contamination of water supplies. And, the problems of decommissioning fracture sites would be ameliorated if no toxic substances have been used during the useful life of the project.", "Conversely, if recalcitrant and toxic substances are used, these would have to be removed and treated during and after the project. Automobile manufacturers are increasingly being called upon to design vehicles so that nothing from that vehicle \ufb01nds its way to the land\ufb01ll. All materials must be used up, recycled, or reused. Developing nations that are increasingly extracting, re\ufb01ning, and processing ores and crude must consider the problems of developed nations only a few decades ago. Many energy activities were shortsighted, extracting and processing as much as possible, believing they would simply move on to other sites. However, abandoned and active hazardous wastes sites became more widespread and more dif\ufb01cult to clean up. Many energy companies, if they had a chance to do it over, would likely not repeat these mistakes, given the lawsuits, public health issues, and costs in the billions of dollars, not to mention the wrath of shareholders. Many are still addressing and will continue for the foreseeable future to pay the costs legally, \ufb01nancially, politically, and environmentally for these dreadful decisions. To date, air pollution science and engineering have focused mainly on emissions of pollutants during separate processes, not from a comprehensive life cycle perspective. Mining emissions were not necessarily connected to re\ufb01ning emissions. Indeed, the different companies doing the mining and the re\ufb01ning receive separate permits. The same is true for distributors of ores, crude oil, and fuel. Pipelines are regulated differently than rail, which has different requirement than trucks.

FOUNDATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION 6 Inherent Properties of Air Pollutants 6.1 INHERENCY The physical and chemical properties inherent to a molecule determine whether it is likely to be an air pollutant. The toxicity and other hazards of the molecule are also driven by these inherencies. The rates of generation, transport, transformation, and fate of an air pollutant are a function of its inherent properties. Inherent properties of a substance can be combined with the properties of the medium where it resides to estimate its fate in the environment (see Chapter 7). A distinguishing aspect of inherent properties in the environmental and biomedical sciences is that there are few \u201cabsolutes\u201d. That is, inherent properties must always be considered with respect to the substrate, matrices, and environments where the substance resides. Hazards, exposures, and risks from an air pollutant are driven by, or at least infuenced by, environmental conditions. How an air pollutant behaves in the atmosphere, in the hydrosphere, on surfaces, in tissues, and in cells is determined by physicochemical inherency and thermodynamic properties of the environment. Inherency indicates the pollutant\u2019s potential to move and change. Inherency also gives a strong clue as a pollutant\u2019s affnity for various substrates in the environment. Thus, an air pollutant will have to have some affnity for the atmosphere for at least part of its or its precursor\u2019s existence.", "If a substance\u2019s properties elicit movement to the atmosphere, it is more likely to be inhaled and, thus, present a respiratory hazard and risk. However, even if a substance has little affnity for the air, its inherent properties may still cause it to become an air pollutant. For example, a substance with a low vapor pressure but high affnity to sorb to small particles would become an air pollutant as a component of aerosols. 6.1.1 Basic Chemical Concepts Environmental chemistry is the discipline that concerns itself with how chemicals are formed, how they are introduced into the environment, how they change after being introduced, the extent to which they enter and where they end up in organisms and other receptors, and the effects they have (usually the damage they do) once they get there. To cover these concepts, environmental chemistry must address the processes in effect in every environmental compartment. This is evident by the diverse subdisciplines within environmental chemistry, including atmospheric chemistry. There are even felds such as environmental physical chemistry (such as environmental photochemistry), environmental analytical chemistry (including environmental separation sciences and chromatography), and environmental chemical engineering (including felds addressing environmental thermodynamics). When a material substance has decomposed chemically to its simplest form, it is an element, i.e. what appears on the periodic table of elements (Figure 6.1). Elements may be further broken down only by nuclear reactions, where they are released as subatomic particles. Such particles are important sources of pollution, e.g. downwind from a leaking nuclear power plant. An atom is the smallest part of an element that can enter into a chemical reaction. The molecule, which may also be an atom, is the smallest subdivision of an element that is able to exist as a natural state of matter. The nucleus of an atom, consisting of protons and neutrons (hydrogen has only one proton in its nucleus), accounts for virtually all of the atomic mass, or the atomic mass unit (amu). The term nucleon is inclusive of protons and neutrons (i.e. the particles comprising the atom\u2019s nucleus). An amu is defned as one-twelfth of the mass of carbon (C12), or 1.66 10 27 kg. The atomic weight of an element listed in most texts and handbooks is the relative atomic weight, which is the total number of nucleons in the atom. So, for example, oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of 16. The atomic number (Z) is the number of protons in the nucleus. The chemical nomenclature for atomic weight A and number of element E is in the form: A E (6.1) Z Fundamentals of Air Pollution 139 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00006-2 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS Rare earth metals However, since an element has only one atomic number, Z is usually not shown. For example, the most stable 12 form of carbon is seldom shown as C, and is usually 6 indicated as 12C. Elements may have different atomic weights if they have different numbers of neutrons (the number of electrons and protons of stable atoms must be the same). Elements having different atomic weights are known as isotopes. All atoms of a given element have the same atomic number, but atoms of a given element may contain different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. An element may have numerous isotopes. Stable isotopes do not undergo natural radioactive decay, whereas radioactive isotopes involve spontaneous radioactive decay, as their nuclei disintegrate. This decay leads to the formation of new isotopes or new elements. The stable product of an element\u2019s radioactive decay is known as a radiogenic isotope. For example, lead (Pb; Z \u00bc 82) has four naturally occurring isotopes of different masses (204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb). Only the isotope 204Pb is stable. The isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb are daughter (or progeny) products from the radioactive decay of uranium (U), while 208Pb is a product from thorium (Th) decay. Owing to the radioactive decay, the heavier isotopes of lead will increase in abundance compared to 204Pb. The kinds of chemical reactions for all isotopes of the same element are the same. However, the rates of reactions may vary. This can be an important factor, for example, in dating material. Such processes have been used to ascertain the sources of pollution (see Discussion Box: Carbon Dating). Radiogenic isotopes are useful in determining the relative age of materials.", "The length of time necessary for the original number of atoms of a radioactive element in a rock to be reduced by half (radioactive half-life) can range from a few seconds to billions (109) of years. Scientists use these \u201cradioactive clocks\u201d by the following procedurea: 1. Extracting and purifying the radioactive parent and progeny from the rock or other material. 2. Measuring variations in the masses of the parent and progeny isotopes. 3. Combining the abundances with the known rates of decay to calculate an age. Radiogenic isotopes are commonly used as tracers to indicate, the movement of substances through the environment. Radiogenic isotope tracer applications using Pb, strontium (Sr), and neodymium (Nd), among others make use of the fact that these are heavy isotopes, in a US Geological Survey. Radiogenic isotopes and the eastern mineral resources program of the US Geological Survey; 2003. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION contrast to lighter isotopes such as hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S). Heavy isotopes are relatively unaffected by changes in temperature and pressure during transport and accumulation, variations in the rates of chemical reactions, and the coexistence of different chemical species available in the environment. Chemical reactions and processes involving Pb, for example, will not discriminate among the naturally occurring isotopes of this element on the basis of atomic mass differences (204 Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb). Long-term monitoring data are frequently not available for environmental systems, so indirect methods, like radiogenic isotope calculations must be used. For example, in sediments, chronological scales can be determined by the distribution of radioactive isotopes in the sediment, based on the isotopes\u2019 halflives.1 The age of the sediment containing a radioactive isotope with a known half-life can be calculated by knowing the original concentration of the isotope and measuring the percentage of the remaining radioactive substance. For this process to work, the chemistry of the isotope must be understood, the half-life known, and the initial amount of the isotope per unit substrate accurately estimated. The change in concentration of the isotope must be entirely attributable to radioactive decay. The effective range covers approximately eight half-lives. The four isotopes which presently meet these criteria (137Cs, 7Be, 14C, and 210Pb) are being used to measure the movement (e.g. deposition and lateral transport) for the past 150 years. The following summarizes the uses and potential uses of these four radioisotopes in dating recent sediment. This process also lends itself to differentiating sources of air pollutants (e.g. that caused by recent human activities is distinguished from that of geological or biological origins, as discussed in the box below). The process is analogous to an hourglass (see Figure 6.2), where the number of grains of sand in the top reservoir represents the parent isotope and the sand in the bottom reservoir represents the progeny isotopes. A measurement of the ratio of the number of sand grains in the two reservoirs will give the length of time that the sand has been fowing, which represents the process of radioactive decay. For II.

As the particles and plant life are subsecounting begins when the aerosol is deposited so quently buried, the parent isotope decays to the that the carbon or other element is taken up into the progeny products. SOURCE APPORTIONMENT, RECEPTOR MODELS, AND CARBON DATING When the results of air pollution measurements are interpreted, one of the frst questions asked by scientists, engineers, and policy makers is where did it come from? Sorting out the various sources of pollution is known as source apportionment. A number of tools are used to try to locate the sources of pollutants. A widely used approach is the \u201csourceereceptor model\u201d or as it is more commonly known, the receptor model. Receptor models are often distinguished from the atmospheric and hydrologic dispersion models. For example, dispersion models usually start from the source and estimate the extent of mixing and the distance that the plume and its contaminants will travel. Conversely, receptor models are based on measurements taken in the ambient environment and from these observations, make use of algorithms and functions to determine pollution sources. One common approach is the mathematical \u201cback trajectory\u201d model. Often, chemical co-occurrences are applied.", "So, it may be that a certain fuel is frequently contaminated with a conservative and, hopefully, unique element. Some fuel oils, for example, contain trace amounts of the element vanadium. Since there are few other sources of vanadium in most ambient atmospheric environments, its presence is a strong indication that the burning of fuel oil is a most likely source of the plume. The model, if constructed properly, can even quantify the contribution. So, if measurements show that sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations are found to be 10 mgm 3inan urban area, and vanadium is also found at suffcient levels to indicate home heating systems are contributing a certain amount of the SO2 to the atmosphere, the model will correlate with the amount of SO2 coming from home heating systems. If other combustion sources, e.g. cars and power plants, also have unique trace elements associated with their SO2 emissions, further SO2 source apportionment can occur, so that the total may look something like in Table 6.1. Receptor models need tracers that are suffciently sensitive and specifc to identify sources. We also mentioned that they be \u201cconservative\u201d. This, perhaps, needs some explanation. A conservative tracer is a chemical that strongly resists chemical reactions but has transport properties similar to those of other, more reactive chemicals (i.e. the contaminant of concern). A good tracer is one that moves exactly with the fuid (i.e. the air), so if a chemical is reactive, its mass diminishes and does not allow direct interpretation of the advective movement of the plume in an air mass. A conservative tracer also makes for a suffciently stable compound to sample from the atmosphere and to analyze it in the laboratory.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION SOURCE APPORTIONMENT, RECEPTOR MODELS, AND CARBON DATING (cont\u2019d) Since combustion involves the oxidation of organic matter, which always contains carbon, it stands to reason that if there were a way to distinguish \u201cold carbon\u201d from \u201cnew carbon\u201d this would provide a reliable means of differentiating fossil fuels from biogenic hydrocarbon sources (e.g. volatile organic carbons released from coniferous trees, including pinene). As the name implies, fossil fuels are made up of carbon deposited long ago and until now the carbon has been sequestered. During that time, the ratio of the isotopes of carbon has changed. So, the ratios refect whether the carbon being measured had been frst sequestered a few years ago or many thousands of years ago. Naturally occurring radioactive carbon (14C) is present at very low concentrations in all biotic (living) matter. The 14C concentrations result from plants\u2019 photosynthesis of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), which contains all of the natural isotopes of carbon. However, no 14C is found in fossil fuels since all of the carbon has had suffcient time to undergo radioactive decay. Studies now can take advantage of this dichotomy in ratios. For example, they can address an elusive contributor to particulate matter (PM), i.e. biogenic hydrocarbons. In the summer months, biogenic aerosols are formed from gas-to-particle atmospheric conversions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are emitted by vegetationb. Reliable methods for estimating the contribution of biogenic sources of VOCs and PM are needed because current estimates of the importance of biogenic aerosols as contributors to total summertime PM have very large ranges (from negligible to dominant). There are large uncertainties in both the conversion mechanisms, and the amount and characteristics of biogenic VOC emissions. Direct experimental estimates can be ascertained by measuring the quantity of 14C in a PM sample. The carbon in a sample that originated from nonfossil (i.e. biogenic) sources. So, for samplec X: 14C=13C X pMC \u00bc 100 (6.2) x 14C=13C 0:95$ SRM4990B where the numerator is the ratio measured in the PM2.5 sample, and the denominator is the ratio measured using the method specifed by the National Institute of Standards and Testing for modern carbon.d Further: \u00bc 0 (6.3) pMCFossilfuel Thus, for a sample X, the biogenic fraction is: pMC x %Biogenic Cx \u00bc 100 (6.4)pMCBiogenic", "The 0.95 correction is needed to address the increase in radiocarbon due to nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s (see Figure 6.3) and to calibrate the measurements with the standard used for radiocarbon dating method depends on the nearly constant fraction of 14C relative to ordinary carbon (12C) in all living and recently living material, and its absence in fossil fuels. The fne fraction of PM (PM2.5) summertime samples are available from numerous locations in the United States, from which 14C measurements, can be conducted. Some recent studies have shown that the carbonaceous biogenic fraction may be contributing as much as one-half of the particles formed from VOCs. The method for measuring and calculating the isotope ratios is straightforward. The percent of modern carbon (pMC) equals the percentage of 14C in a sample of unknown origin relative to that in a sample of living material, and this pMC is about equal to the percentage of 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Year FIGURE 6.3 Biospheric 14C enhancement of atmospheric modern carbon as a result of radiocarbon additions from nuclear testing and nuclear power generation. The plot indicates the time record of 14C in the biosphere.

The ratios are calculated according to the National Bureau of Standards, Oxalic Acid Standard Reference Method SRM 4990B. 6.1.2 Expressions of Chemical Characteristics The gravimetric fraction of an element in a compound is the fraction by mass of the element in that compound. This is found by a gravimetric (or ultimate) analysis of the compound. The empirical formula of a compound provides the relative number of element in the compound, and dividing all of the gravimetric fraction-to-atomic weight ratios by the smallest ratio. d National Bureau of Standards, Oxalic Acid Standard Reference Method SRM 4990B. e The defned reference standard for 14C is 0.95 times the 14C specifc activity of the original NBS Oxalic Acid Standard Reference Material (SRM 4990B), adjusted to a 13C delta value of 19.09&.

Due to the anthropogenic release of radiocarbon from nuclear weapons testing and nuclear power generation, oxalic acid from plant material grown after World War II is used currently to standardize 14C measurements contains more 14C than 1890 wood. atoms in the compound. The empirical formula is found by dividing the gravimetric fractions (percent elemental composition) by atomic weights of each EMPIRICAL FORMULA DEVELOPMENT EXAMPLE An air sampling stainless steel canister was evacuated by the local fre department and brought to the environmental laboratory for analysis. The person who brought in the sample said that the sample was taken near a site where a rusty 55-gallon drum was found by some children in creek near their school. The children and neighbors reported an unpleasant smell near the site where the drum was found. The gravimetric analysis of the gas in the canister indicated the following elemental compositions: Carbon: 40.0% Hydrogen: 6.7% Oxygen: 53.3% Solution First, divide the elemental percentage compositions by the respective atomic weights: 40:0 C : \u00bc 3:3 12 6:7 H : \u00bc 6:7 1 53:3 O : \u00bc 3:3 16 Next, divide every ratio by the smallest ratio (3.3): 3:3 C : \u00bc 1 3:3 6:7 H : \u00bc 2 3:3 3:3 O : \u00bc 1 3:3", "So, the empirical formula is CH2O or HCHO. This is formaldehyde, a toxic substance. Preliminary Interpretation The challenge of formaldehyde, however, is that it comes from many sources, including emissions from factories and automobiles, and even natural sources. However, since the drum seems to be a likely source, the liquid contents should be analyzed (and a search for additional drums should begin immediatelydthe illegal dumping often is not limited to a single unit). The frst likelihood is that the liquid is formalin, a mixture that contains formaldehyde. The high vapor pressure of the formaldehyde may be causing it to leave the solution and move into the air. Since children are in the area and there may be a relatively large amount of the substance, steps must be taken to prevent exposures and to remove the formaldehyde immediately. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6.1.2.1 The Periodic Table The periodic table (Figure 6.1) follows the periodic law, which states that the properties of elements depend on the atomic structure and vary systematically according to atomic number. The elements in the table are arranged according to increasing atomic numbers from left to right. An element shares many physicochemical properties with its vertical neighbors, but differs markedly from its horizontal neighbors. For example, oxygen (O) will chemically bind and react similarly to sulfur (S) and selenium (Se), but behaves very differently from nitrogen (N) and fuorine (F). Elements in the horizontal rows, known as periods, grow increasingly different with the distance moved to the left or right. So, O differs physically and chemically more from boron (B) than O does from F, and O is a very different from lithium (e.g. O is a nonmetal and Li is a light metal). The groups (vertical columns) are designated by numerals (often Roman numerals). For example, O is a group VIA element and gold (Au) is in group IB. The A and B designations are elemental families. Elements within families share many common characteristics. Within families, elements with increasing atomic weights become more metallic in their properties. Metals (elements to the left of the periodic table) form positive ions (cations), are reducing agents, have low electron affnities, and have positive valences (oxidation numbers). Nonmetals (on the right side of the periodic table) form negative ions (anions), are oxidizing agents, have high electron affnities, and have negative valences. Metalloids have properties of both the metals and nonmetals. However, two environmentally important metalloids, arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) are often addressed as heavy metals in terms of fate, transport, treatment and control technologies, and toxicity. Some common periodic table chemical categories are: \u0081 Metals: Every element except the nonmetals \u0081 Heavy metals: Metals near the center of the table \u0081 Light metals: Groups I and II \u0081 Alkaline earth metals: Group IIA \u0081 Alkali metals: Group IA \u0081 Transition metals: All Group VIII and B families \u0081 Actinons: Elements 90e102 \u0081 Rare earths: Lanthanons (Lanthanides), Elements 58e71 \u0081 Metalloids: Elements separating metals and nonmetals, Elements 5, 14, 32, 33, 51, 52, and 84 \u0081 Nonmetals: Elements 2, 5e10, 14e18, 33e36, 52e54, 85, and 86 \u0081 Halogens: Group VIIA \u0081 Noble gases: Inert elements, Group 0 Every element in the table has environmental relevance. In fact, at some concentration, every element except those generated artifcially by fssion in nuclear reactors is found in the environment, especially in soils, in varying concentrations. Thus, it would be absurd to think of how to \u201celiminate\u201d them. This is a common misconception, especially with regard to heavy metal and metalloid contamination. For example, mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) are known to be important contaminants that cause neurotoxic and other human health effects and environmental pollution. However, the global mass balance of these metals does not change, only their locations and forms (i.e. speciation). So, protecting health and ecological resources is a matter of decreasing and eliminating exposures and changing the form of the compounds of these elements so that they are less mobile and less toxic. The frst place to potential air pollutants is to consider the oxidation states, or valence, of elements. 6.1.3 Electromagnetic Radiation, Electron Density, Orbitals, and Valence According to quantum mechanics, the energy of a photon of light can cause an electron to change its energy state, so that the electron is disturbed from its original state. Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is related to atomic structure.", "Much that is known about atomic structure, especially an atom\u2019s arrangement of electrons around its nucleus, is from what scientists have learned about the relationship between matter and different types of EMR. One principle is that EMR has properties of both a particle and a wave. Particles have a defnite mass and occupy space (i.e. they conform to the classic description of matter). Waves have no mass but hold energy with them as they travel through space. Waves have four principle characteristics, i.e. speed (v), frequency (n), wavelength (l), and amplitude. These are demonstrated in Figure 6.4. Measuring n in cycles per second (hertz, Hz) and l in meters, the product gives the velocity of the wave moving through space: v \u00bc nl (6.5) For example, if a certain light\u2019s l is10 7mandits n is 1015 Hz, then the velocity of that light is 108 ms 1. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION Most of the time, when someone mentions the term \u201cenvironmental contaminant\u201d, it calls to mind some chemical compound. However, contaminants may also come in the form of biological or physical agents. Biological contaminants may be pathogenic bacteria or viruses that adversely affect health, or introduced species (e.g. the zebra mussel or kudzu) that harm ecosystems. Physical agents are often the least likely to come to mind. A common physical contaminant is energy. Life depends on energy, but like most resources, when it comes in the wrong form and quantity, it may be harmful. EMR is comprised of wave functions that are propagated by simultaneous periodic variations in electrical and magnetic feld intensities (see Figure 6.3). Natural and many anthropogenic sources produce EMR energy in the form of waves, which are oscillating energy felds that can interact with an organism\u2019s cells. The waves are described according to their wavelength and frequency, and the energy that they produce. Wave frequency is the number of oscillations that passes a fxed point per unit of time, measured in cycles per second (cps). 1 cps \u00bc 1 hertz (Hz). Thus, the shorter the wavelength, the higher is the frequency. For example, the middle of the amplitude modulated radio broadcast band has a frequency of one million hertz (i.e. 1 megahertz \u00bc 1MHz) and a wavelength of about 300 m. Microwave ovens use a frequency of about 2.5 billion hertz (i.e. 2.5 GHz) and a wavelength of 12 cm. So, the microwave, with its shorter wavelength has a much higher frequency. An EMR wave is made of tiny packets of energy called photons. The energy in each photon is directly proportional to the frequency of the wave. So the higher the frequency, the more energy there will be in each photon. Biological tissue and cellular material is affected in part by the intensity of the feld and partly by quantity of energy in each photon.f At low frequencies EMR waves are known as electromagnetic felds and at high frequencies EMR waves are referred to as electromagnetic radiations. Also, the frequency and energy determines whether an EMR will be ionizing or nonionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation consists of high frequency electromagnetic waves (e.g. X-rays and gamma rays), having suffcient photon energy to produce ionization (producing positive and negative electrically charged atoms or parts of molecules) by breaking bonds of molecules. The general term nonionizing radiation is for the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum where photon energies are not strong enough to break atomic bonds. This segment of the spectrum includes ultraviolet (UV) radiation, visible light, infrared radiation, radio waves, and microwaves, along with static electrical and magnetic felds. Even at high intensities, nonionizing radiation cannot ionize atoms in biological systems, but such radiation has been associated with other effects, such as cellular heating, changes in chemical reactions and rates, and the induction of electrical currents within and between cells. Of course, not every EMR effect causes harm to an organism; such as when a mammal may respond to EMR by increasing blood fow in the skin in response to slightly greater heating from the sun. Life as we know it depends on various EMR wavelengths and frequencies, including the conversion of visible and UV wavelengths to infrared by the earth\u2019s surface which warms the planet. Photosynthesis depends on the incoming light. EMR also induces positive health effects, such as the sun\u2019s role in helping the body to produce vitamin D. Unfortunately, certain direct or indirect responses to EMR may lead to adverse effects, including skin cancer.", "The data supporting UV as a contaminant are stronger than those associated with more subtle fears that sources, like high-energy power transmission lines and cell phones, may be producing health effects. The World Health Organization (WHO) is addressing the health concerns raised about exposure to radio frequency (RF) and microwave felds, intermediate frequencies (IF), extremely low frequency (ELF) felds, and static electric and magnetic felds. IF and RF felds produce heating and the induction of electrical currents; so it is highly plausible that this is occurring to some extent in cells exposed to IF and RF felds. Fields at frequencies above about 1 MHz primarily cause heating by transporting ions and water molecules through a medium. Even very low energy levels generate a small amount of heat, but this heat is carried away by the body\u2019s normal thermoregulatory processes. However, some studies indicate that exposure to felds too weak to cause heating may still produce adverse health consequences, including cancer and neurological disorders (i.e. memory loss). Since, electrical currents already exist in the body as a normal part of the biochemical reactions and metabolic process, the fear is that additional energy from electromagnetic felds could induce suffciently high currents to overload the system and engender adverse biological effects. ELF electric felds exist when a charge is generated, but almost none of the electric feld penetrates into the human body. At very high feld strengths they can feel like one\u2019s skin is \u201ccrawling\u201d or their hair is raised. Some studies, however, have associated low-level ELF electric felds with elevated incidence of childhood cancer or other diseases, whereas other studies have not been able to establish a relationship. The WHO is recommending that more focused research be conducted to improve health risk assessments. ELF magnetic felds also exist whenever an electric current is fowing. However, unlike the ELF II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION (cont\u2019d) electric felds, magnetic felds readily penetrate an organism\u2019s tissue with virtually no attenuation. Again the epidemiology is mixed, with some studies associating ELF felds with cancer, especially in children, and others fnding no such association. The primary action in biological systems by these static electrical and magnetic felds is by inducing electrical and magnetic energy, However, there is a paucity of reliable data to come to any conclusions about chronic effects associated with long-term exposure to static magnetic felds at levels found in the working environment. The challenge of EMR is similar to that of chemical contamination. The exposure and risks associated with this hazard is highly uncertain. The key decision is whether suffcient scientifc evidence exists to encourage limits on certain types of activities (either as an individual choice or regulated by a public agency) where adverse effects may be occurring. Almost anywhere in the world, one can observe a number of people using cell phones. Many neighborhoods have visible overhead power lines. EMR sources are ubiquitous. The challenge is deciding what level of evidence linking EMR to adverse effects would be suffcient to require actions to protect public health. f Photons are also extremely important in air pollutant transformation, since many contaminants and free radicals in the atmosphere owe their existence, at least in part, to photochemical reactions. Like other mechanisms, photochemical reactions are also benefcial, such as in photosynthesis, endogenous process (e.g. vitamin D formation), and the formation of the ozone layer in the stratosphere. Quantummechanicsisthebasisfornumerouschemical analyses (e.g. mass spectrometry) of air pollutants. An atom\u2019s electrons occupy orbitals where the electrons contain various amounts of energy. Electrons vary in the spatial orientations and average distances from the nucleus, so that electrons occupying inner orbitals are closer to the nucleus (see Figure 6.5). The electron\u2019s velocity or position changes. If we can measure the electron\u2019s position we will not know its velocity, and if we measure the electron\u2019s velocity, we will not be able to know its position. We are uncertain about the electron\u2019s simultaneous position and velocity. This is the basis for the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the more that is Amplitude Peak High frequency 0 1 2 s p d 1\u00c5 Outer sphere of electron density (wave trough) y 4\u00c5 x Inner sphere of Trough electron density t 0 s t 1 s z (wave peak) Low frequency FIGURE6.4 EMR.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS known about the electron\u2019s position, the less that can be known about its velocity. Further, to keep an electron from escaping from an atom, the electron must maintain a minimum velocity, which corresponds back to the uncertainty of the electron\u2019s position in the atom. Since, the uncertainty of the position is actually the whole atom, i.e. the electron can be anywhere in the atom, chemists refer to an electron as a \u201ccloud of electron density\u201d within the atom rather than describing an electron as a fnite particle. So, the electron orbitals are envisioned as regions in space where the electrons are statistically most likely to be located. We do not know where an electron is, but we know where it might be; that is, somewhere in the electron cloud.g The Schro\u00a8dinger model applies three coordinates to locate electrons, known as quantum numbers. The coordinates are principal (n), angular (l), and magnetic (ml)quantum numbers. These characterize the shape, size, and orientation of the electron cloud orbitals of the atom. The principal quantum number n gives the size of the orbital. A relative size of n \u00bc 2 is larger than a cloud with the size n \u00bc 1. Energy is needed to excite an electron to make it move from a position closer to the nucleus (e.g. n \u00bc 1) to a position further from the nucleus (n \u00bc 2, 3, or higher). So, n is an indirect expression of an orbital\u2019s energy level. The angular quantum number l maps the shape of the cloud. A spherical orbital has an l \u00bc 0. Polar shaped orbitals have l \u00bc 1. Cloverleaf orbitals have l \u00bc 2. See Figure 6.4 for renderings of these shapes. The magnetic quantum number ml describes the orientation of the orbital in space. Orbitals with the same value of n form a shell. Within a shell, orbitals are divided into subshells labeled by their l value. The commonly used two-character description of shells (e.g. 2p or 3d) exemplifes the shell and subshell. For example, 2p indicates the shell (n \u00bc 2) and the subshell (p). Subshells are indicated by: s: l \u00bc 0 p: l \u00bc 1 d: l \u00bc 2 f: l \u00bc 3 g: l \u00bc 4 h: l \u00bc 5 The number of subshells in any shell will equal the n for the shell. So, for example, the n \u00bc 2 shell contains two subshells (i.e. 2s and 2p) and n \u00bc 5 shell contains fve subshells (i.e. 5s,5p,5d,5f, and 5g orbitals). The electrons occupying the outermost shell are known as valence electrons. Valence is the numberof bonds that an element can form, which is related to number of electrons in the outermost shell. The arrangement of the electrons inthe outermost (i.e.valence) banddeterminestheultimate chemical behavior of the atom. The outer electrons become involved in transfer to and sharing with shells in other atoms, i.e. forming new compounds and ions. Note that the number of valence electrons in an \u201cA\u201d group in the periodic table (except helium, whose shell is flled with 2) is equal to the group number. So, sodium (Na), a Group 1A element, has one valence electron. Carbon (C) is a Group 4A compound, so it has four valence electrons. Chlorine (Cl), fuorine (F), and the other halogens of Group 7A have seven valence electrons. The noble gases, except He, in Group 8A, have eight valence electrons. The noble gases are actually the only elements that exist as individual atoms, because the noble gases have no valence electrons. Conversely, carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell, so it has just as many electrons to gain or to lose (i.e. 4 is just as close to 8, for a newly flled shell, as it is to 0, for the loss of a shell), so there are many ways for it to reach chemical stability.", "This is one of the reasons that so many subtly, but profoundly different carbon-based compounds, i.e. organic compounds, are in existence. Most atoms combine by chemical bonding to other atoms, creating molecules. Thus, the outermost electrons explain how readily an element will engage in a chemical reaction and the type of reaction that will occur. The oxidation number is the electricalchargeassignedtoanatom. Thesumoftheoxidationnumbersis equalto thenetcharge. Table 6.2 shows the oxidation numbers of certain atoms that form contaminants and nutrients in the environment. Table 6.3 gives the oxidation numbers for environmentally important radicals, i.e. groups of atoms that combine and behave as a single chemical unit. An atom will gain or lose valence electrons to form a stable ion that has the same number of electrons as the noble gas nearest the atom\u2019s atomic number. For example, Na with a single valence electron and a total of 11 electrons, will tend to lose an electron to form Na\u00fe, the sodium cation. This ion has the same number of electrons (eight) as the nearest noble gas, neon (Ne). Fluorine, with 7 valence electrons and 9 total electrons, tends to gain (accept) an electron to form a 10-electron fuorine anion, F that, like the sodium ion, has the same number of electrons as Ne (eight). Noble gases have an octet (i.e. group of eight) of electrons in their valence shells, meaning that the tendency of an atom to gain or to lose its valence electrons to form ions in the noble gas arrangement is called the \u201coctet rule\u201d.h g Note that this confguration is very different from the popular depiction of an atom, which is still shown even in the logos of nuclear agencies and warning labels. This depiction is the Rutherford atom, after Ernest Rutherford direction of the work by Hans Geiger and Ernest Madsen. The model was refned by Niels Bohr using quantum theory to visualize the electron cloud. h Obviously, for the atoms near He, it is the \u201cduet rule\u201d. II.

Elements combine to form compounds. Two-element compounds are known as binary compounds. Three-element compounds are ternary or tertiary compounds. The representation of the relative numbers of each element is a chemical formula. Compounds are formed according to the law of defnite proportions. That is, a pure compound must always be composed of the same elements that are always combined in a defnite proportion by mass. Also, compounds form in accordance with the law of multiple proportions, which states that when two elements combine to make more than one compound, the combining mass of each element must always exist as small integer ratios to one another. The sum of all oxidation numbers must equal zero in a stable, neutral compound. The simplest example is water. Oxygen\u2019s 2 valence is balanced by the two hydrogen\u2019s \u00fe1 valences. II.

Incidentally, lead (II) compounds are suspected human carcinogens, based on experiments conducted on laboratory animals. Lead acetate is also very acutely toxic and may be fatal if swallowed, and is harmful if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Like other lead compounds, long-term exposure may harm the central nervous system, blood, and gastrointestinal tract. into groups that have the same number of chlorine atoms attached to the furan or dioxin ring. Each form varies in its chemical, physical, and toxicological characteristics (see Figure 6.6). Dioxins are highly toxic compounds that are created unintentionally during combustion processes. The most toxic form is the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin (TCDD) isomer. Other isomers with the 2,3,7,8 confguration are also considered to have higher toxicity than the dioxins and furans with different chlorine atom arrangements (see Table 6.4). What is currently known about the conditions needed to form these compounds has been derived from studying full-scale municipal solid waste incinerators, and the experimental combustion of fuels and feeds in the Is PbC2H3O2 a valid compound? Answer Consulting Tables 6.2 and 6.3, we fnd that lead (Pb) has two common oxidation numbers (\u00fe2 and \u00fe4), and that acetate (C2H3O2) has an oxidation number of 1, so the molecular formula given is not valid. Lead acetate is Pb(C2H3O2)2. Two atoms of acetate are needed to balance the \u00fe2 valence of Pb. The molecule is 6.1.3.1 Physicochemical Processes in the Formation of Air Toxics Atoms and molecules combine in many ways, according to the reactions described in this chapter. Let us consider some of the important processes under which selective toxic compounds are formed. 6.1.3.1.1 COMBUSTIONS REACTIONS Dioxins and furans are important air pollutants. Dioxin formation is illustrative of the complex set of combustion reactions that can generate toxic air pollutants. Chlorinated dioxins have 75 different forms and there are 135 different chlorinated furans, simply by different number and arrangement of chlorine atoms in the molecules.

Bottom structure is of the most toxic dioxin congener, tetrachlorodibenzo-pdioxin (TCDD), formed by the substitution of chlorine for hydrogen atoms at positions 2, 3, 7, and 8 on the molecule. The toxic forms of dioxins and furans often are chlorinated, but may also include other halogen substitutions, especially bromine. laboratory. Most of the chemical and physicalmechanisms identifed by these studies can relate to combustion systems in which organic substances combusted in the presence of chlorine (Cl). Incinerators of chlorinated wastes are the most common environmental sources of dioxins, accounting for about 95% of the volume. The emission of dioxins and furans from combustion processes may follow three general physicochemical pathways. The frst pathway occurs when the feed material going to the incinerator contains dioxins and/or furans and a fraction of these compounds survives thermal breakdown mechanisms, and pass through to be emitted from vents or stacks. This is not considered to account for a large volume of dioxin released to the environment, but it may account for the production of dioxin-like, coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The second process is the formation of dioxins and furans from the thermal breakdown and molecular rearrangement of precursor compounds, such as the chlorinated benzenes, chlorinated phenols (such as pentachlorophenol), and PCBs, which are chlorinated aromatic compounds with structural resemblances to the chlorinated dioxin and furan molecules.", "Dioxins appear to form after the precursor has condensed and adsorbed onto the surface of particles, such as fy ash. This is a heterogeneous process, where the active sorption sites on the particles allow for the chemical reactions, which are catalyzed by the presence of inorganic chloride compounds and ions sorbed to the particle surface. The process occurs within the temperature range, 250e450 C, so most of the dioxin formation under the precursor mechanism occurs away from the high-temperature zone in the incinerator, where the gases and smoke derived from combustion of the organic materials have cooled during conduction through fue ducts, heat exchanger and boiler tubes, air pollution control equipment or the vents and the stack. The third means of synthesizing dioxins is de novo within the so-called \u201ccool zone\u201d of the incinerator, wherein dioxins are formed from moieties different from those of the molecular structure of dioxins, furans, or precursor compounds. Generally, these can include a wide range of both halogenated compounds like polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and nonhalogenated organic compounds like petroleum products, nonchlorinated plastics (polystyrene), cellulose, lignin, coke, coal, and inorganic compounds like particulate carbon, and hydrogen chloride gas. No matter which de novo compounds are involved, however, the process needs a chlorine donor (a molecule that \u201cdonates\u201d a chlorine atom to the precursor molecule). This leads to the formation and chlorination of a chemical intermediate that is a precursor. The reaction steps after this precursor is formed can be identical to the precursor mechanism discussed in the previous paragraph. De novo formation of dioxins and furans may involve even more fundamental substances than those moieties mentioned above. For example, dioxins may be generatedi by heating of carbon particles absorbed with mixtures of magnesiumealuminum silicate complexes when the catalyst copper chloride (CuCl2) is present (see Table 6.4 and Figure 6.7). The de novo formation of chlorinated dioxins and furans from the oxidation of carbonaceous particles seems to occur at around 300 C. Other chlorinated benzenes, chlorinated biphenyls, and chlorinated naphthalene compounds are also generated by this type of mechanism. The three processes that lead to the formation of dioxins and furans are also found in the formation of numerous other air pollutants by thermal mechanisms. Thus, air pollution engineers must take care to ensure that conditions in reactors, stacks, and other processes are not generating byproducts that will be released. Indeed, pollution control equipment itself may create conditions that would otherwise not generate these pollutants, e.g. injection of sorbing materials, ignorance of precursor compounds in carrier air, and operating temperatures in regions of the equipment that induce i Stieglitz L, Zwick G, Beck J, Bautz H, Roth W.

Other processes generate dioxin pollution. A source that has been greatly reduced in the last decade is the paper production process, which formerly used chlorine bleaching. This process has been dramatically changed, so that most paper mills no longer use the chlorine bleaching process. Dioxin is also produced in the making of PVC plastics, which may follow chemical and physical mechanisms similar to the second and third processes discussed above. Like many other halogenated organic compounds, dioxin and dioxin-like compounds are lipophilic and persistent, which means that they often readily accumulate in soils, sediments, and organic matter where they can persist for decades.j These compounds are also semi-volatile, so they may migrate away from these sites and be transported in the atmosphere either as aerosols (solid and liquid phase) or as gases (the portion of the compound that volatilizes). Therefore, great care must be taken during removal and storage of sludge, fltrate, and other materials collected from air pollution control equipment, as well as during, remediation efforts to avoid unwittingly emitting these contaminants via volatilization or aerosolization, as well as via perturbations, such as from ash piles and pits. Dioxin demonstrates the complexity of air pollution\u2019s physicochemical processes. At the most basic level only a few types of chemical reactions dominate in the environment. These include ionization, acide base, precipitation, and oxidationereduction (redox).", "6.1.3.1.2 IONIZATION When a salt is dissolved in water, it dissociates into ionic forms. Notwithstanding their variability in doing so, under the right conditions all complexes can become dissolved in water, e.g. in droplets in the atmosphere. Ions that are dissolved in a solution can react with one another, and can form solid complexes and compounds. Strictly speaking, a salt compound does not exist in water. For example, when the salts calcium sulfate and sodium chloride are added to water, it is commonly held that CaSO4 and NaCl are in the water. However, what is really happening is that the metals and nonmetals are in chemical equilibrium: CaSO4\u00f0s\u00de4Ca2\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feSO2 4 \u00f0aq\u00de (6.6) and NaCl\u00f0s\u00de4Na\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feCl \u00f0aq\u00de (6.7) Thus, all four of the dissociated ions are free and no longer associated with each other. That is, the Na, Ca, Cl, and SO4 ions are \u201cunassociated\u201d in the water. The Na and the Cl are no longer linked to each other as they were before the compound was added to the water. Even though atoms are neutral, in the process of losing or gaining electrons, they become electrically charged, i.e. they become ions. An atom that loses one or more electrons is positively charged, and is known as a cation. For example, the potassium atom loses one electron and becomes the monovalent potassium cation: Ke /K\u00fe (6.8) j For discussion of the transport of dioxins, see Koester CJ, Hites RA. Wet and dry deposition of chlorinated dioxins and furans. Environ Sci Technol 1992;26:1375e82; and Hites RA.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION Hydration Hydration FIGURE 6.8 Ion pairs. Evangelou V. Environmental soil and water chemistry: principles and applications. New York (NY): John Wiley & Sons; 1998. When the mercury atom loses two electrons, it becomes the divalent mercury cation: Hg 2e /Hg2\u00fe (6.9) When the chromium atom loses three electrons it becomes the trivalent chromium cation: Cr 3e /Cr3\u00fe Conversely, an atom that gains electrons becomes a negatively charged ion, and is known as an anion. For example, when chlorine gains an electron it becomes the chlorine anion: Cl \u00fee /Cl\u00fe (6.10) When sulfur gains two electrons, it becomes the divalent sulfde anion: S \u00fe2e /S2 (6.11) Note that the Greek prefx (mono-, di-, tri-, etc.) denoting the valence is the number of electrons by which the ion differs from neutrality. Reactions between ions, known as ionic reactions, frequently occur as ions of water-soluble salts that can react in aqueous solution to form salts that are nearly insoluble in water. This causes them to separate into insoluble precipitates: \u00f0Ions in Solution 1\u00de\u00fe\u00f0Ions in Solution 2\u00de/Precipitate \u00feUnreacted ions (6.12) 6.1.3.1.3 SOLUBILITY AND ELECTROLYTES The aqueous solubility of contaminants ranges from completely soluble in water to virtually insoluble. Solubility equilibrium is the phenomenon that keeps molecules dissolved in a solvent. Solubility and precipitation are in a way, two sides of the same coin. There is truth in the old chemists\u2019 pun, \u201cIf you\u2019re not part of the solution, you are part of the precipitate!\u201d Solubilities typically are quantitatively expressed as mass of solute per volume of solvent (e.g. mg l 1), and sometimes expressed by the adjectives \u201csoluble\u201d, \u201cslightly soluble\u201d, or \u201cinsoluble\u201d. In the solid phase, a salt is actually a collection of ions in a lattice, where the ions are surrounded by one another. However, when the salt is dissolved in water, the ions become surrounded by the water, rather than by the other ions. Each ion now has its own coordinating water envelope or \u201chydration sphere\u201d, i.e. a collection of water molecules surrounding it. An ion-association reaction is an ioneion interaction between the ions in an electrolyte (i.e. ion-containing) solution.k So, when the salt lattice enters the water, the ions assemble into couplets of separate oppositely charged ions, i.e. cations and anions, the so-called \u201cion pairs\u201d. The pairs are held together by electrostatic attraction. Ion association is the reverse of dissociation where the ions separate from a compound into free ions. Ions (or molecules) surrounded by water exist in the aqueous phase. So, ionic compounds that are soluble in water break apart (i.e. dissociate) into their ionic components, i.e. anions and cations (see Figure 6.8). Solutions may contain nonelectrolytes, strong electrolytes, and/or weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes do not ionize. They are nonionic molecular compounds that are neither acids nor bases. Sugars, alcohols, and most other organic compounds are nonelectrolytic. Some inorganic compounds are also nonelectrolytes.", "Weak electrolytes only partially dissociate in water. Most weak electrolytes dissociate less than 10%, i.e. k The Swedish chemist, Svante Arrhenius, is credited with establishing the relationship between electrical and chemical properties of molecules. He observed that particular chemical compounds (later to be known as electrolytes) conduct electricity when they are dissolved in water, while other chemicals do not. He also saw that certain chemicals are involved in seemingly instantaneous reactions, while others took much longer to react. Finally, he observed that particular chemical compounds showed extremely strange colligative properties while others were consistent with Raoult\u2019s Law, which states that the solvent\u2019s vapor pressure in an ideal solution is equal to the product of the mole fraction of the solvent and the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. The four colligative properties of solutions are the elevation of boiling point, the depression of freezing point, the decreasing of vapor pressure, and osmotic pressure. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS greater than 90% of these substances remain undissociated. Organic acids, such as acetic acid, are generally weak electrolytes. An example of dissociation is strontium carbonate dissolved in water: SrCO3\u00f0S\u00de/Sr2\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feCO2 \u00f0aq\u00de (6.13) 3 Conversely, the reverse reaction forms a solid; that is, it returns from the solution to re-form the lattice of ions surrounding ions. This is a precipitation reaction. In our Sr example, the carbonate species is precipitated: Sr2 \u00f0aq\u00de\u00feCO2 \u00f0aq\u00de/SrCO3\u00f0s\u00de (6.14) 3 The ionic product (Q) is a measure of the ions present in the solvent. The solubility product constant (Ksp) is the ionic product when the system is in equilibrium. So, solubility is often expressed as the specifc Ksp, the equilibrium constant for dissolution of the substance in water. Since Ksp is an expression of chemical equilibrium, it is a quantitative way of describing the balance of opposing reversible chemical reactions which proceed at constant and equal rates, thus resulting in no net change in the system (hence the symbol, 4). Like sorption, Henry\u2019s law and other equilibrium constants that are discussed in detail in Chapter 18, solubility follows Le Chatelier\u2019s Principle, which states that in a balanced equilibrium, if one or more factors change, the system will readjust to reach equilibrium. Ksp values and the resulting solubility calculations for four important compounds are shown in Table 6.5. Ksp constants for many compounds can be found in engineering handbooks. Since SrCO3 is a highly insoluble salt (aqueous solubility \u00bc6 10 3 mg l 1), its equilibrium constant for the reaction is quite small: 9 Ksp \u00bc Sr\u00fe2 CO23 \u00bc1:6 10 (6.15) TABLE6.5 Solubility Product Constant versus Solubility for Four Types of Salts Salt Example Solubility Product (Ksp) Solubility (S) AB CaCO3 \u00bdCa2\u00fe \u00bdCO3 \u00bc4:7 10 9 )1/2(Ksp\u00bc6.85 10 5 M AB2 Zn(OH)2 2\u00bdZn2\u00fe \u00bdOH 17\u00bc4:5 10 /4)1/3(Ksp\u00bc2.24 10 6 M AB3 Cr(OH)3 3\u00bdZn3\u00fe \u00bdOH 31\u00bc6:7 10 (Ksp/27)1/4 \u00bc1.25 10 8 M A3B2 Ca3(PO4)2 2\u00bdCa2\u00fe 3\u00bdPO3 4 32\u00bc1:3 10 (Ksp/108)1/5 \u00bc1.64 10 7 M The small Ksp value of the constant refects the low concentration of dissolved ions. So, as the number of dissolved ions approaches zero, the compound is increasingly insoluble in water. This does not mean that that an insoluble product cannot be dissolved, but it will require additional chemicals to induce solubility. In this case, strontium carbonate requires the addition of an acid to solubilize the Sr\u00fe2 ion. To precipitate a compound, the product of the concentration of the dissolved ions in the equilibrium expression must exceed the value of the Ksp. The concentration of each of these ions does not need to be the same. For example, if [Sr\u00fe2]is1 10 5 M, the carbonate ion concentration must exceed 0.0016 M for precipitation to occur because (1 10 5) (1.6 10 4) \u00bc1.6 109 (i.e. the Ksp for strontium carbonate). DISSOCIATION AND PRECIPITATION REACTION EXAMPLE An environmental analytical chemist adds 100 ml of 0.050 M NaCl to 200 ml of 0.020 M Pb(NO3)2. Will the lead chloride that is formed precipitate from the 300 ml sample? Solution Calculate the ion product (Q) and compare it to the Ksp for the reaction: PbCl2\u00f0s\u00de/ Pb2\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00fe2Cl \u00f0aq\u00de When the two solutions are mixed, the unassociated ions are formed as: 22 Pb2\u00fe\u00bc0:2l 2:0 10 M0:3l \u00bc1:310 M and Cl \u00bc0:1l 5:0 10 2M0:3l \u00bc1:7 10 2M The value for the ion product is calculated as: 22 22 Q \u00bc Pb2\u00fe Cl \u00bc 1:310 1:7 10 7 \u00bc3:8 10 The Ksp for this reaction is 1.6 10 5.", "Q < Ksp, so no precipitate will be formed. If the ion product were greater than the Ksp a precipitate would have been formed. Environmental conditions can affect solubility. One such instance is the common ion effect. Comparedtoa solution in pure water, an ion\u2019s solubility is decreased in an aqueous solution that contains a common ion Source: US Army Corps of Engineers. Engineering and design: precipitation/ coagulation/focculation. Chapter 2, EM 1110-1-4012; 2001. (i.e. one of the ions that make up the compound). II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION This allows a precipitate to form if the Ksp is exceeded. For example, soluble sodium carbonate (Na2CO3)in solution with strontium ions can cause the precipitation of strontium carbonate, since the carbonate ions from the sodium salt are contributing to their overall concentration in solution and reversing the solubility equilibrium of the \u201cinsoluble\u201d compound, strontium carbonate: Na2CO3\u00f0s\u00de/2Na\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feCO2 \u00f0aq\u00de (6.16) 3 2\u00fe SrCO3\u00f0s\u00de/Sr\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de CO2 \u00f0aq\u00de (6.17) 3 Also, a complexing agent or ligand may react with the cation of a precipitate, enhancing the solubility of the compound. In addition, several metal ions are weakly acidic and readily hydrolyzed in solution. For example, hydrolyzing ferric ion (Fe31) forms a hydroxide and hydrogen ion: 2\u00fe\u00feH\u00fe Fe3\u00fe\u00feH2O/Fe\u00f0OH\u00de (6.18) When such metal ions hydrolyze, they produce a less soluble complex. The solubility of the salt is inversely related to the pH of the solution, with solubility increasing as the pH decreases. The minimum solubility is found under acidic conditions when the concentrations of the hydrolyzed species approach zero. 6.1.3.2 Environmental Acid and Base Chemistry For many air pollution situations, an acid is considered to be any substance that causes hydrogen ions to be produced when dissolved in water. Conversely, a base is any substance that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water. Acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors (this is known as the Bro\u00a8nstedeLowry model). Acids are electron-pair acceptors and bases are electron-pair donors (following the Lewis model). Actually, the H\u00fe is a bare proton, having lost its electron, so it is highly reactive. In reality, the acid produces a hydronium ion: H\u00fe\u00f0H2O\u00de\u00bcH3O\u00fe (6.23) When acids react with bases, a double-replacement reaction takes place, resulting in neutralization. The products are water and a salt. One mole of acid neutralizes precisely 1 mol of base. Being electrolytes, a strong acid dissociates and ionizes 100% into H3O\u00fe and anions. These anions are the acid\u2019s specifc conjugate base. A strong base also dissociates and ionizes completely. The ionization results in hydroxide ions and cations, known as the base\u2019s conjugate acid. Weak acids and weak bases dissociate less than 100% into the respective ions. There are four strong acids that are important in air pollution. These are hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitric IONIZATION EXAMPLE What exactly is the pH scale? Why do pH values range from 0 to 14? Answer Water ionizes. It does not exist only as molecular water (H2O), but also includes hydrogen (H1) and hydroxide (OH ) ions: H2O 4 H\u00fe\u00feOH (6.19) The negative logarithm of the molar concentration of hydrogen ions, i.e. [H1] in a solution (usually water in the environmental sciences), is referred to as pH. This convention is used because the actual number of ions is extremely small. Thus pH is defned as: 1 pH \u00bc log H\u00fe\u00bclog H\u00fe (6.20) 10 10 The brackets refer to the molar concentrations of chemicals, and in this case it is the ionic concentration in moles of hydrogen ions per liter. The reciprocal relationship of molar concentrations and pH means that the more hydrogen ions in solution the lower the pH value will be. Likewise, the negative logarithm of the molar concentration of hydroxide ions, i.e. [OH ] in a solution is pOH: 1 pOH \u00bc log10 OH \u00bclog10 OH (6.21) The relationship between pH and pOH is constant. At 25 C, this constant is: 14 K \u00bc H\u00fe OH \u00bc10 (6.22) When expressed as a negative log, one can see that the pH and pOH scales are reciprocal to one another and that they both range from 0 to 14. Thus, a pH 7 must be neutral (same number of hydrogen ions as hydroxide ions). Upon further investigation, the log relationship means that for each factor pH unit change there is a factor of 10 change in the molar concentration of hydrogen ions. Thus, a pH 2 solution has 100,000 times more hydrogen ions than neutral water (pH 7), or [H\u00fe] \u00bc1012 versus [H\u00fe] \u00bc107, respectively. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6.", "INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS acid (HNO3), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and perchloric acid (HClO4). Many weak acids are particularly important, such as carbonic acid, acetic acid, and phosphoric acid. Strong bases include sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH). Weak bases include ammonia (NH3), which dissolves in water to become ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and organic amines (i.e. compounds with the radical: eNH). Nonmetal oxides, such as carbon dioxide (CO2)and sulfur dioxide (SO2), are generally acidic (forming carbonic acid and sulfuric acid, respectively in water), while metal oxides like those of calcium (e.g. CaO) and magnesium (e.g. MgO), are generally basic. These two metal oxides, for example, form calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2]and magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2]in water,respectively. The principal environmental metric for acidity and basicity in assessing and controlling air pollution is pH. As mentioned, the \u201cp\u201d in pH represents the negative log and the \u201cH\u201d represents the hydrogen ion or hydronium ion molar concentration: pH \u00bc log H\u00fe and H\u00fe\u00bc10 pH (6.24) The autoionization of water into its hydrogen ion and hydroxide ions is an equilibrium constant, i.e. the water dissociation equilibrium constant (Kw). At 25 C, the molar concentration of the product of these ions is 1.0 10 14. That is: 14 Kw \u00bc H\u00fe OH \u00bc1:0 10 (6.25) Thus, pH ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Values below 7 are acidic and values above 7 are basic. STRONG ACID/BASE EXAMPLE 1 An air pollution analytical laboratory is using an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, which is 0.05 M. What is the hydrogen ion and chloride ion molar concentration of the solution? Answer Since this is a strong acid, it should ionize and dissociate completely. Thus: [H\u00fe] \u00bc0.05 and [Cl ] \u00bc0.05, so none of the associ ated acid remains. STRONG ACID/BASE EXAMPLE 2 What is the pH of the solution in the earlier example? What is the [OH ] of the solution in the earlier example? Answer Since [H\u00fe] \u00bc0.05, and pH \u00bc log[H\u00fe] \u00bc log 0.05 M \u00bc1.3. Also, recall that: 14 Kw \u00bc H\u00fe OH \u00bc1:0 10 Kw 10 14 13So, \u00bdOH \u00bc\u00bc \u00bc2:0 10 \u00bdH\u00fe 0:05 Thus, even with a very high relative concentration of hydrogen ions in the acidic solution, there is still a small amount of hydroxide ion concentration. Characterizing an acid or base as strong or weak has nothing to do with the concentration (i.e. molarity) of the solution, and everything to do with theextenttowhich theacidorbase dissociates when it enters water. In other words, whether at a concentration of 6.0 M or at 0.00001 M, sulfuric acid will completely ionize in the water, but acetic acid will not completely ionize at any concentration. To demonstrate this, Table 6.6 shows the pH for a number of acids and bases, all with the same molar concentration. The strongestacids areatthe topand thestrongest bases are at the bottom. The weak acids and bases are in themiddleofthe table. Most acidebase reactions in the atmosphere involve weak substances. In fact, the amount of ionization in most environmental reactions, especially those in the ambient air (as opposed to those in chemical engineering and laboratory reactors), are quite weak, usually well below 10% dissociation.l So, for every 1000 molecules of a weak acid, only a few, say 50, molecules of the acid will dissociate into hydronium ions in the water. Thus, taking acetic acid as an example, the acidebase equilibrium reaction is: CH3COOH\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feH2O\u00f0l\u00de4H3O\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de \u00feCH3COO \u00f0aq\u00de (6.26) l Note that by this defnition, water itself is a weak acid in that it autoionizes into 10 14 molar concentration of ions, which means that some of the water ionizes into hydroxide and hydronium ions. Hydronium is the hydrogen ion bound to a water molecule. The importance of water\u2019s ionization in virtually all biological processes should not be underestimated. At 25 C, there are 55.35 mol water 1:0 10 MH3O\u00fe per liter. So, since half of the ions are hydronium ions in neutral water, this means there are: 7 \u00bc1:8 10 9 hydronium 55:35 M H2O ions per water molecule. Even this small ratio provides enough H\u00fegiven the amount of water available in the hydrological cycle and the highly reactive nature of each hydrogen ion. II.

Because the reaction is in equilibrium with all four species, another equilibrium constant can be established for acid reactions, i.e. the acid constant (Ka): Ka \u00bc H3O\u00fe CH3COO \u00bdCH3COOH (6.27) At 25 C, the Ka for acetic acid is 1.8 10 5 (see Table 6.7). If the percent dissociation in an acid reaction is known, the product of this percentage and the initial acid concentration will give the molar concentration of hydrogen ions, [H\u00fe]. For example, if 0.1 M solution of cyanic acid (HOCN) is 2.8% ionized, the [H\u00fe] can be found. We know that HOCN is a weak acid because the percent ionization is less than 100. In fact, it is well below 10%.

Remember that all equilibrium constants are temperature dependent. Weak bases follow precisely the same protocol as weak acids, with a base equilibrium constant, Kb. Some important acid and base equilibrium constants are provided in Tables 6.7 and 6.8. Because the atmosphere contains relatively large amounts of carbon dioxide (on average about 350 ppm), the CO2 becomes dissolved in surface water and in soil water (because CO2 is a common soil gas). Thus, one of the most important environmental acidebase reactionsm is the dissociation of CO2: CO2 \u00fe H2O4H2CO3 (6.28) The asterisk (*) denotes that this compound is actually the sum of two compounds, i.e. the dissolved CO2 and the reaction product, carbonic acid H2CO3. Since the carbonic acid that is formed is a diprotic acid (i.e. it has two hydrogen atoms), an additional equilibrium step reaction occurs in water. The frst reaction forms bicarbonate and hydrogen ions: H2CO34HCO3 \u00fe H\u00fe Followed by a reaction that forms carbonate and hydrogen: HCO3 4CO2 \u00fe H\u00fe (6.29) 3 Each of the two-step reactions has its own acid equilibrium constant (Ka1 and Ka2, respectively), as shown in Table 6.8. For a triprotic acid, there would be three unique constants. Note that the constants decrease substantially with each step.", "In other words, most of the hydrogen ion production occurs in the frst step. Numerous reactions can be predicted from the relative strength of acids and bases, since their strength results from how well the protons via the hydronium ion are transferred from the acid and the electrons are transferred via the hydroxide ion from the base. If an acid is weak, its conjugate base must be strong, and if an acid is strong, its conjugate base must be weak. Likewise, if a base is weak, its conjugate acid must be strong, and if the base is strong, its conjugate acid must be weak. The tables show actual Ka and Kb constants; however, many sources publish values for pKa and pKb. Since the \u201cp\u201d denotes negative logarithm, the larger the pKa, the weaker the acid, and the larger the pKb, the weaker the base. An example of how the Ka is an indicator of relative strength of reactants and products is that of hydrocyanic acid (HCN): Stronger base Weaker base HCN OH CN H2O (6.30) Stronger acid Weaker acid 10) 16) (Ka 6.2 10 (Ka 1.8 10 The ratio of the Ka constant values of the two acids is a direct way to quantify the equilibrium. In the m For an excellent discussion of carbon dioxide equilibrium in water see Hemond HF, Fechner-Levy EJ. Chemical fate and transport in the environment. San Diego (CA): Academic Press; 2000. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 10 10 hydrocyanic acid instance above, the ratio is 6:2 1:8 10 16 y4 106: This large quotient indicates that the equilibrium is quite far to the right. So, if HCN is dissolved in a hydroxide solution (e.g. NaOH), the resulting reaction will produce much greater amounts of the cyanide ion (CN ) than the amount of both the hydroxide ion (OH ) and molecular HCN. Conversely, for an aqueous solution of sodium cyanide (NaCN), the water will only react with a tiny amount of CN . Among the properties of water, one of the most environmentally important is that it can behave as either an acid or a base, i.e. water is an amphoteric compound. That is one of the reasons that water is sometimes shown as HOH. When water acts as a base its pKb \u00bc 1.7. When water acts as an acid its pKa \u00bc15.7. Many air pollution reactions occur in water (e.g. in droplets, on aerosols, and even in the water within organisms), so the relationship between conjugate acidebase equilibrium and pH is important. The Hendersone Hasselbalch equation states this relationship: \u00bdHA pKa \u00bcpH \u00felog (6.31) \u00bdA Thus, HendersoneHasselbalch tells us that when the pH of an aqueous solution equals the pKa of an acidic component, the concentrations of the conjugate acids and bases must be equal (since the log of 1 \u00bc0). If pH is 2 or more units lower than pKa, the acid concentration will be greater than 99%. Conversely, when pH is greater than pKa by 2 or more units, the conjugate base concentration will account for more than 99% of the solution.n This means that mixtures of acidic and nonacidic compounds can be separated with a pH adjustment, which has strong implications for the design and operation of air pollution control equipment. The application of this principle is also important to the transformation of environmental contaminants in the form of weak organic acids or bases, because these compounds in their nonionized form are much more lipophilic, meaning they will be absorbed more easily through the skin than when they exist in ionized forms. As a general rule, the smaller the pKa for an acid and the larger the pKb for a base, the more extensive will be the dissociation in aqueous environments at normal pH values, and the greater compound\u2019s electrolytic nature. 6.1.3.2.1 HYDROLYSIS All of the acidebase reactions involve chemical species reacting with water. It is worth noting that even some so-called neutral compounds have acidic or basic properties. For example, metalo acetates ((MeC2H3O2)x) can dissolve in water and actually react with the water to form weak acids and hydrogen ions. The resulting solutions are generally slightly basic (pH <7), since the acetate ion is conjugate base of the weak acid. This process is known as hydrolysis (i.e. lysis or breaking apart water molecules). Likewise, some compounds produce weak bases when dissolved in water. For example, when ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is dissolved in water, the solu \u00fe tion becomes more acidic.", "The NH4 cation serves as the conjugate base of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), or molecular ammonia (NH3) is the conjugate base of \u00fe the NH4 cation. Oxide gases (e.g. carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide) can be hydrolyzed to form hydronium ions and anions: CO2\u00f0g\u00de\u00feH2O\u00f0l\u00de4H3O\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feHCO3 \u00f0aq\u00de (6.39) and, SO2\u00f0g\u00de\u00feH2O\u00f0l\u00de4H3O\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feHSO3 \u00f0aq\u00de (6.40) These reactions also take place in organic compounds, where the organic molecule, RX, reacts with water to form a covalent bond with OH and cleaves the covalent bond of the leaving group (X) in RX, which displaces X with the hydroxide ion and an ion formed from the leaving group: RX \u00feH2O/ROH \u00feH\u00fe\u00feX (6.41) Amides, epoxides, carbonates, esters, organic halides, nitriles, urea compounds, and esters of organophosphate compounds are functional groups that are susceptible to hydrolysis. The process involves an electron-rich nucleus seeker (i.e. a nucleophile) attacking an electron-poor electron seeker (i.e. an electrophile) to displace the leaving group (such as a halogen). This is why hydrolysis is one of the methods of dechlorination, a detoxifcation process for hazardous chlorinated hydrocarbons. Environmental engineers use hydrolysis to eliminate or to reduce the toxicity of hazardous contaminants by n US Environmental Protection Agency.

Rather than listing every metal, the chemical formulae will display Me. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS ACID RAIN EXAMPLE Acidebase reactions are demonstrated by the acid rain problem. Dissolved CO2 causes most rainfall to be slightly acidic: CO2\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feH2O\u00f0l\u00de4H\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feHCO3 \u00f0aq\u00de (6.32) Ka \u00bc4:3 107 Acidic precipitation, popularly known as \u201cacid rain\u201d contains the strong acids H2SO4 and HNO3, mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels that contain sulfur (the air contains molecular nitrogen that is oxidized during internal combustion in engines, i.e. \u201cmobile sources\u201d and in any high temperature furnaces, like those in power plants). The sulfuric acid is stepped process. Recall that the contaminant released from stacks is predominantly sulfur dioxide when the elemental sulfur is oxidized: S \u00feO2/SO2\u00f0g\u00de (6.33) The sulfur dioxide in turn is oxidized to sulfur trioxide: Surface waters have a natural buffering capacity, especially in regions where there is limestone which gives rise to dissolved calcium (e.g. central Kansas is less at risk of acid rain\u2019s effects than are the Finger Lakes of New York). What is the reaction of a minute amount of acid rain containing sulfuric acid reaching a lake containing carbonate (CO32 ) ions? Solution pH 3.7 Since, pH \u00bc log [H\u00fe], then [H\u00fe] \u00bc10 10 2.0 10 4 M in aqueous solution at 25 C. The sulfurous acid proton donation reaction is: H2SO3\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feH2O\u00f0l\u00de4HSO3 \u00f0aq\u00de\u00feH3O\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de (6.36) H3O\u00feis the stronger acid (i.e. Ka\u00fe< 1) and HSO3 is the stronger base. Regarding the buffered water system, CO32 is the conjugate base of the weak acid HCO3 ,so the former can SO2\u00f0g\u00de\u00fe1 2 O2\u00f0g\u00de/SO3\u00f0g\u00de (6.34) The sulfur trioxide then reacts with atmospheric water (vapor, clouds, on particles) to form sulfuric acid: SO3\u00f0g\u00de\u00feH2O/H2SO4\u00f0aq\u00de (6.35) The net result is to increase the acidity of the rain, which is a threat to aquatic life, and metallic and carbonate materials (including artwork, statues, and buildings). Near pollution sources, rainwater pH can be found to be less than 3 (i.e. 10,000 times more acidic than neutral). What are the molar concentrations of [H\u00fe] and [OH ]of rainwater at pH 3.7 at 25 C? When SO2 dissolves in water, sulfurous acid (H2SO3, Ka1 \u00bc1.7 10 2, Ka2 \u00bc6.4 10 8)is formed. What is the reaction when sulfurous acid donates a proton toawater molecule?What are the Bro\u00a8nstedeLowry acid and base in this reaction? react with the strong acid H3O in the sulfuric acid solution: CO2 \u00f0aq\u00de\u00feH3O\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de4HCO3 \u00f0aq\u00de\u00feH2O\u00f0l\u00de (6.37) 3 The K \u00bc1/Ka2 of H2CO3 (making for a large K). Similarly HSO4 also reacts with CO32 : CO2 \u00f0aq\u00de\u00feHSO4 \u00f0aq\u00de4SO2 \u00f0aq\u00de\u00feHCO3 \u00f0aq\u00de (6.38) 34 The K \u00bc(Ka2 of H2SO4)/(Ka2 of H2CO3)(thus, large K). So, an HCO3 /CO32 buffer is produced. An excess of acid rain will consume all the CO32 and HCO3 , converting all to H2CO3 (and completely eliminating the buffer). These are important and representative reactions of the challenging global problem of acid rain. abiotic transformation and biotransformation, especially bacterial.", "For example, the highly toxic methyl isocynate, infamous as the contaminant that led to loss of life and health effects in the Bhopal, India incident, can be transformed hydrolytically. Two factors are particularly enhancing to hydrolysis. Microbial mediation, including enzymatic activity can catalyze hydrolytic reactions. This occurs both in the ambient environment, such as the hydrolysis of inorganic and organic compounds by soil bacteria, as well as in engineered systems, such as acclimating those same bacteria to the treatment of chlorinated organic compounds in solid and liquid wastes. The second factor is pH. Hydrolysis can be affected by specifc acid and base catalysis. In acid catalysis, the H\u00fe ion catalyzes this reaction; and in base catalysis the OH ion serves as the catalyst. The effect of temperature on hydrolysis can be profound. Each 10 C incremental temperature increase results in a hydrolysis rate constant change by a factor of 2.5.p p Knox R, Sabatini D, Canter L. Subsurface transport and fate processes. Boca Raton (FL): Lewis Publishers; 1993. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION Metal (Me) hydrolysis is a special case. Cations in water act like Lewis acids in that they are prone to accept electrons, while water behaves like a Lewis base because it makes its oxygen\u2019s two unshared electrons available to the cations. When strong wateremetal (acidebase) interactions take place, H1 dissociates and hydronium ions form in a prototypical reaction: Men\u00fe\u00fe H2O4MeOH\u00f0n\u00fe1\u00de\u00fe H\u00fe (6.42) Although reactions such as these have obvious applications to contaminant transformations in surface water, soil water, and ground water, they occur in any medium where water is present. Water is present in the atmosphere, so hydrolysis occurs in clouds and fog, as well as in the water fraction hygroscopic nuclei. Water is also present in all living things, so hydrolysis is a common process in metabolism (particularly in the frst phase, as discussed later) and other organic processes. Thus, hydrolysis is important in numerous environmental and toxicological processes. 6.1.3.2.2 PHOTOLYSIS The sun\u2019s EMR at UV and visible wavelengths can induce chemical reactions directly and indirectly. Direct photolysis is the process where sunlight adds activation energy needed to transform a compound. Indirect photolysis is the process by which an intermediate compound is energized, which in turn transfers energy to another compound. Contaminants are photochemically degraded in both atmospheric and aquatic environments. Photolysis can combine or interchange with other processes, such as in the degradation pathways for chlorinated organic contaminants. For example, the degradation pathway for 1,4-dichlorobenzene in air is a reaction with photochemically generated OH radicals and oxides of nitrogen. However, in soil and water, the degradation is mainly microbial biodegradation, leading to very different end products (see Figure 6.9). 6.1.3.2.3 PRECIPITATION REACTIONS Dissolved ions may react with one another to form a solid phase compound under environmental conditions of temperature and pressure. Salts are compounds that form when metals react with nonmetals, such as sodium chloride (NaCl). They may also form from cation and anion combinations, such as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). Precipitation is both a physical and chemical process, wherein soluble metals and inorganic compounds change into insoluble metallic and inorganic salts. In other words, the dissolved forms become solids. Such reactions in which soluble chemical species become insoluble products are known as \u201cprecipitation reactions\u201d.

It can bond to itself and to other elements in a myriad of ways. In fact, it can form single, double, and triple bonds with itself. This makes for millions of possible organic compounds. An organic compound is a compound that includes at least one carbon-to-carbon or carbon-to-hydrogen cova lent bond. The majority of air pollutants are organic.q Organic compounds can be further classifed into two basic groups: aliphatics and aromatics. Hydrocarbons are q This is true in terms of the actual number of chemical compounds. By far, most contaminants are organic. However, in terms of total mass of reactants and products in the biosphere, inorganic compounds represent a greater mass. For example, most hazardous waste sites are contaminated with organic contaminants, but large-scale waste represented by mining, extraction, transportation, and agricultural activities have larger volumes and masses of metals and inorganic substances. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION the most fundamental type of organic compounds. Unsubstituted hydrocarbons contain only the elements carbon and hydrogen. Aliphatic compounds are classifed into a few chemical families. Each carbon normally forms four covalent bonds. Alkanes are hydrocarbons that form chains with each link comprised of the carbon. A single link is CH4, methane. The carbon chain length increases with the addition of carbon atoms. For example, ethane\u2019s structure is: HH H CCH HH And the prototypical alkane structure is: HH HC CH HH The alkanes contain a single bond between each carbon atoms, and include the simplest organic compound, methane(CH4), and its derivative \u201cchains\u201d such as ethane (C2H6) and butane (C4H10). Alkenes contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms. For example, 1,3-butadiene\u2019s structure is CH2eCHeCHeCH2.The numbers \u201c1\u201d and \u201c3\u201d indicate the position of the double bonds. The alkynes contain triple bonds between carbon atoms, the simplest being ethyne, CH^CH, which is commonly known as acetylene (the gas used by welders). The aromatics are all based on the six-carbon confguration of benzene (C6H6). The carbonecarbon bond in this confguration shares more than one electron, so that benzene\u2019s structure allows for resonance among the double and single bonds, i.e. the actual benzene bonds fip locations. Benzene is the average of two equally contributing resonance structures. The term \u201caromatic\u201d comes from the observation that many compounds derived from benzene are highly fragrant, such as vanilla, wintergreen oil, and sassafras. Aromatic compounds, thus, contain one or more benzene rings. The rings are planar, that is, they remain in the same geometric plane as a unit. However, in compounds with more than one ring, such as the highly toxic PCBs, each ring is planar, but the rings that are bound together may or may not be planar. This is actually a very important property for toxic compounds. It has been shown that some planar aromatic compounds are more toxic than their nonplanar counterparts, possibly because living cells may be more likely to allow planar compounds to bind to them and to produce nucleopeptides that lead to biochemical reactions associated with cellular dysfunctions, such as cancer or endocrine disruption. Both the aliphatic and aromatic compounds can undergo substitutions of the hydrogen atoms. These substitutions render new properties to the compounds, including changes in solubility, vapor pressure, and toxicity. For example, halogenation (substitution of a hydrogen atom with a halogen) often makes an organic compound much more toxic. Thus, trichloroethane is a highly carcinogenic liquid that has been found in drinking water supplies, whereas nonsubstituted ethane is a gas with relatively low toxicity. This is also why one of the means for treating chlorinated hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds involves dehalogenation techniques. The important functional groups that are part of many organic compounds are shown in Table 6.9. Structures of organic compounds can induce very different physical and chemical characteristics, as well TABLE 6.9 Structures of Organic Compounds Chemical Class Alkanes Functional Group C C Alkenes C C Alkynes C C Aromatics Alcohols C OH Amines C N Aldehydes O C H Ether C O C Ketones C O C C (Continued) II.

For example, the differences between the estradiol and a testosterone molecule may seem small but they cause signifcant differences in the growth and reproduction of animals. The very subtle differences between an estrogen and an androgen, female and male hormones respectively, can be seen in these structures. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION But look at the dramatic differences in sexual and developmental changes that these compounds induce in organisms! Incremental to a simple compound, such as substituting chlorine atoms for three hydrogen atoms on the ethane molecule, can make for large differences (see Table 6.10). Replacing two or three hydrogen atoms with chlorine atoms makes for differences in toxicities between the nonhalogenated form and the chlorinatedform. Thesameistruefor thesimplest aromatic, benzene. Substituting a methyl group for one of the hydrogen atoms forms toluene. The lessons here are many. There are uncertainties in using surrogate compounds to represent whole groups of chemicals (since a slight change can change the molecule signifcantly). However, this points to the importance of \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d and computational chemistry, as tools to prevent dangerous chemicals reaching the marketplace and the environment before they are manufactured. Subtle differences in molecular structure can render molecules safer, while maintaining the characteristics that make them useful in the frst place, including their market value. 6.1.4.1 Isomers Isomers are compounds with identical chemical formulas, but different structures. They are very important in air pollution chemistry, because even slightly different structures can evoke dramatic differences in chemical and physical properties. So, isomers may exhibit different chemodynamic behavior and different toxicities. For example, the three isomers of pentane (C5H12) are shown in Figure 6.14. The difference in structure accounts for signifcant physical differences. For example, the boiling points for n-pentane, isopentane, and neopentane at 1 atm are 36.1, 27.8, and 9.5 C, respectively. Thus, neopentane\u2019s lower boiling point means that this isomer has a lower vapor pressure, which makes it is more likely to enter the atmosphere than the other two isomers under the same environmental conditions. Optical isomers or chiral forms of the same compound are those that are mirror images to each other. These differences may make one, e.g. the left-handed form, virtually nontoxic and easily biodegradable, yet the right-handed form may be toxic and persistent.

If aqueous solubilities, which is expressed as elog P0,of n-butane, n-hexane, n-octane, and n-nonane are, respectively, 3.0, 3.8, 5.2, and 5.9 mol l 1, what effect does the substitution of a hydroxyl functional group for the hydrogen atom have on an alkane\u2019s polarity? Can this effect also be observed in aromatics?", "(Hint: Compare S for benzene, toluene to phenol in the table in #1 above; and recall that phenol is a hydroxylated benzene.) Answer There is a direct relationship (see Figure 6.12) between the increase in polarity and hydrophilicity when alkanes are hydroxylated into alcohols. This is why alcohols are miscible in water. This can be an important fact, especially in anaerobic treatment processes where microbes reduce organic compounds and in the process generate alcohols (and ultimately methane and water). Hydroxylation of an aromatic, as indicated by comparing the solubilities of benzene and phenol, also increases polarity and hydrophilicity. 6.9 5.9 4.9 3.9 2.9 1.9 0.9 \u22120.1 log S FIGURE 6.12 Aqueous solubility of selected aliphatic compounds. It should be noted that solubility may be modifed in environmental systems by using compounds known as \u201csurfactants\u201d (see Figure 6.13). Surfactants can be very effective in solubilizing adsorbed hydrophobic compounds in soils. The increased solubility and dispersion of hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds with very low aqueous solubility enhances desorption and bioavailability. Unfortunately, a widely used group of surfactants, i.e. alkylphenolethoxylates (APEs) have been banned in Europe because their breakdown products can be very toxic to aquatic organisms. The APEs have been particularly of concern because of their hormonal effects, particularly their estrogenicity. So, one must keep in mind not only the physical and chemical advantages of such compounds, but also any ancillary risks that they may introduce. This is a classic case of competition among values (i.e. easier and more effective cleanup versus additive health risks from the cleanup chemical). Nonpolar compounds (e.g. aromatics) R Head R Tail Polar compounds (e.g. alchohols) FIGURE 6.13 Structure of a surfactant prototype. The head of the molecule is relatively polar and the tail is relatively nonpolar, so in the aqueous phase the more hydrophilic compounds will react with the surfactant molecule at the head position, while the more lipophilic compounds will react at the tail position. The result is that a greater amount of the organic compounds will be in solution when surfactants are present. Vallero D. Engineering the risks of hazardous wastes.

Air pollution chemistry represents the subset of these atmospheric chemical processes which have a direct impact on human beings, vegetation, and surface water bodies. Classifcation of atmospheric chemical processes as either human made (anthropogenic) or natural is useful but not precise. For example, the trace gases nitric oxide (NO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) have CH2 CH2 CH3 n-Pentane CH3 CH3 Isopentane CH3 H3C C CH3 CH3 Neopentane FIGURE 6.14 Isomers of pentane. Although the chemical composition is identical, the different molecular arrangements result in molecules that exhibit very dissimilar physical, chemical, and biological properties. Vallero D. Environmental contaminants: assessment and control. Burlington (MA): Academic Press; 2004. CH3 CH CH2 CH3 CH2 both anthropogenic and natural sources, and their atmospheric behavior is independent of their source. A vivid example was the 1980 Mt. St. Helen\u2019s volcanic eruption in Washington, a gigantic point source for SO2 and PM in the atmosphere. This natural source was of such magnitude as to become frst a regional air pollution problem and subsequently a global atmospheric chemical problem. 6.1.5.1 Types of Atmospheric Chemical Transformations The chemical transformations occurring in the atmosphere are best characterized as oxidation processes. Reactions involving compounds of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) are of most interest. The chemical processes in the troposphere involve oxidation of hydrocarbons, NO, and SO2 to form oxygenated products such as aldehydes, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). These oxygenated species become the secondary products formed in the atmosphere from the primary emissions of anthropogenic or natural sources (Figure 6.15).", "Solar radiation infuences the chemical processes in the atmosphere by interacting with molecules that act as photoacceptors. Free radicals are formed by the photodissociation of certain types of molecules. Free radicals are neutral fragments of stable molecules and are very reactive. Examples are O, atomic oxygen; H, atomic hydrogen; OH, the hydroxyl radical; and HO2, the hydroperoxy radical. In areas with photochemical smog, the principal photoacceptors are aldehydes, NO2, nitrous acid (HNO2), and ozone. The II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS FIGURE 6.15 Precursoreproduct relationship of atmospheric chemical reactions. Sunlight (h\u03bd) photodissociation process is energy dependent, and only photons with suffcient energy are capable of causing photodissociation. The wavelength dependence of solar radiation is discussed in Chapter 5. The reactivity of chemical compounds will differ because of their structure and molecular weight. Hydrocarbon compounds have been ranked according to their rate of reaction with various types of oxidizing species such as OH, NO3, and O3.r The role of hydrocarbons, along with oxides of nitrogen, in the formation of ozone is very complex. Ozone formation is a function of the mixture of hydrocarbons present and the concentration of NOx, [NOx](][NO] \u00fe [NO2]). The concept of an incremental reactivity scale permits accessing the increment of ozone formation per incremental change in a single hydrocarbon component.s Incremental reactivity is determined by calculating the ozone formation potential in a baseline scenario using a simple mixture of hydrocarbons representing an urban atmosphere. Then for each hydrocarbon species of interest, the ozone formation is recalculated with incremental hydrocarbons added to the mixture. From this approach, the D[O3]/ D[HC] values represent the impact of a specifc hydrocarbon on urban photochemical smog formation. The vapor pressure of a compound is important in determining the upper limit of its concentration in the atmosphere. High vapor pressures will permit higher concentrations than low vapor pressures. Examples of organic compounds are methane and benzo[a]pyrene. Methane, with a relatively high vapor pressure, is always present as a gas in the atmosphere; in contrast, benzo[a]pyrene, with a relatively low vapor pressure, is adsorbed on PM and is therefore not present as a gas. Vapor pressure also affects the rate of evaporation of organic compounds into the atmosphere and the r conversion of atmospheric gases to PM, e.g. SO2 to the aerosol H2SO4.t Atmospheric chemical reactions are classifed as either photochemical or thermal. Photochemical reactions are the interactions of photons with species which result in the formation of products. These products may undergo further chemical reaction. These subsequent chemical reactions are called thermal or dark reactions. Finally, atmospheric chemical transformations are classifed in terms of whether they occur as a gas (homogeneous), on a surface, or in a liquid droplet (heterogeneous). An example of the last is the oxidation of dissolved sulfur dioxide in a liquid droplet. Thus, chemical transformations can occur in the gas phase, forming secondary products such as NO2 and O3; in the liquid phase, such as SO2 oxidation in liquid droplets or water flms; and as gas-to-particle conversion, in which the oxidized product condenses to form an aerosol. 6.1.5.2 Role of Solar Radiation in Atmospheric Chemistry The time required for atmospheric chemical processes to occur is dependent on chemical kinetics. Many of the air quality problems of major metropolitan areas can develop in just a few days. Most gas-phase chemical reactions in the atmosphere involve the collision of two or three molecules, with subsequent rearrangement of their chemical bonds to form molecules by combination of their atoms. Consider the simple case of a bimolecular reaction of the following type: B \u00fe C/products (6.44) Rate of reaction \u00bc k\u00bdB \u00bdC (6.45) Pitts Jr JN, Winer AM, Darnall KR, Lloyd AC, Doyle GJ.

For the frst three reactions between molecular species, Ea > 100 kJ, but for the last three reactions Ea < 10 kJ. The last three reactions involve the participation of free radical or atomic species. The activation energies of reactions involving atomic or free radicals are very small, permitting chemical transformations on a short timescale.

Urban atmospheres are characterized as complex mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. Table 6.13 show the hydrocarbons identifed in the urban air of St. Petersburg, Florida.v The interactions among this large number of compounds can be understood by studying simpler systems. Figure 6.16 shows the diurnal patterns of NO, NO2,and O3 for St. Louis, Missouri.w These diurnal patterns are interrelated. The concentration profles of Figure 6.16 are the result of a combination of atmospheric chemical and meteorological processes. To uncouple this combination of factors, laboratory (smog chamber) studies such as those of the propeneeNOx system (Figure 6.17)have been undertaken.x These profles show chemical transformations separated from meteorological processes. Similar chemical steps occur in the ambient air and in laboratory smog chamber simulations. Initially, hydrocarbons and nitric oxide are oxidized to form nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and other oxidation products such as peroxyacyl nitrate (PAN) and aldehydes. The complete process is very complicated, with many reaction steps. The principal components of atmospheric chemical processes are hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur, oxygenated hydrocarbons, ozone, and free radical intermediates. Solar radiation plays a crucial role in the generation of free radicals, whereas water vapor and temperature can infuence particular chemical pathways. Table 6.14 lists a few of the components of each of these classes. Although more extensive tabulations may be found in Atmospheric Chemical Compounds,y those listed in Table 6.14 are suffcient for an understanding of smog chemistry. The major undesirable components of photochemical smog are NO2,O3,SO2,H2SO4, PAN, and aldehydes. Air quality standards have been established in several countries for SO2,NO2,and O3;H2SO4 contributes to acidic deposition and reduction in visibility; and PAN and aldehydes can cause eye irritation and plant damage if their concentrations are suffciently high. v Lonneman WA, Seila RL, Bufalini JJ.

Upon examination, one sees that the concentration of ozone is dependent on the ratio NO2/ NO for any value of k1. The maximum value of k1 is dependent on the latitude, time of year, and time of day. In the United States, the range of k1 is from 0 to 0.55 min 1. Table 6.15 illustrates the importance of the NO2/ NO ratio with respect to how much ozone is required for the photostationary state to exist. The conclusion to be drawn from this table is that most of the NO must be converted to NO2 before O3 will build up in the atmosphere. This is also seen in the diurnal ambient air patterns shown in Figure 6.15 and the smog chamber simulations shown in Figure 6.16.Itis apparent that without hydrocarbons, the NO is not converted to NO2 effciently enough to permit the build up of O3 to levels observed in urban areas (Table 6.16). The cycle represented by Eqns (6.52e6.54) is illustrated by the upper loop (a) in Figure 6.17. In this fgure, the photolysis of NO2 by a photon forms an NO and an O3 molecule. If no other chemical reaction is occurring, these two species react to form NO2, which can start the cycle over again. In order for the O3 concentration to build up, oxidizers other than O3 must participate in the oxidation of NO to form NO2. This will permit the NO2/ NO ratio to build up and steady-state O3 concentrations as represented by Eqn (6.60) to achieve typical ambient values. The other oxidizers in the atmosphere are free radicals. In the lower loop (b) of Figure 6.17, a second pathway for NO oxidation is shown, with free radicals participating. These free radicals are derived from the participation of hydrocarbons in atmospheric chemical reactions. 6.1.5.3.3 ROLE OF HYDROCARBONS The important hydrocarbon classes are alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and oxygenates. The frst three classes are generally released to the atmosphere, whereas the fourth class, the oxygenates, is generally formed in the atmosphere. Propene will be used to illustrate the types of reactions that take place with alkenes. Propene reactions are initiated by a chemical reaction of OH or O3 with the carbonecarbon double bond. The chemical steps that follow result in the formation of free radicals of several different types which can undergo reaction with O2, NO, SO2, and NO2 to promote the formation of photochemical smog products. 6.1.5.3.3.1 OZONE REACTION WITH PROPENE A schematic diagram of the O3 reaction with propene (Figure 6.19) is based on the work of Atkinson and Lloyd.z The molozonide formed by addition of ozone to the double bond decomposes to form an aldehyde and an energy-rich (z) biradical. In the case of propene, two sets of products are formed. Along the pathway on the right, approximately 40% of the biradicals (HCHOO\u2219)z form a thermalized biradical (CH2OO\u2219).A The remainder undergo rearrangement to form energy-rich formic acid (HCOOH)z, which subsequently decomposes to form H2O, CO, CO2,H2, H, and HCO2 radicals with percentages assigned to each pathway. _ The larger biradical (CH3CHOO\u2219)z follows a slightly different pathway. Approximately 40% forms a thermal _ ized biradical (CH3CHOO\u2219). Of the remaining 60%, a portion decomposes to CH4 and CO2 and two additional energy-rich species (CH3COOH)z and (CHOOCH3)z. These two unstable species decompose as shown to form CH3, OH, H, HCO, CH3O, CO, and CO2. Alkyl radicals, R, react very rapidly with O2 to form alkylperoxy radicals. H reacts to form the hydroperoxy radical HO2. Alkoxy radicals, RO, react with O2 to form HO2 and R0CHO, where R0 contains one less carbon. This formation of an aldehyde from an alkoxy radical ultimately leads to the process of hydrocarbon chain shortening or clipping upon subsequent reaction of the aldehyde.", "This aldehyde can undergo photodecomposition forming R, H, and CO; or, after OH attack, forming CH(O)OO, the peroxyacyl radical. z Atkinson R, Lloyd AC.

The remaining carbon atom has an unpaired electron which combines with molecular oxygen, forming an RO2 radical. There are two types of RO2 radicals labeled C3OHO2 in Figure 6.20. Each of these RO2 radicals reacts with NO to form NO2, and an alkoxy radical reacts with O2 to form formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and HO2. 6.1.5.3.3.3 ALDEHYDE PHOTOLYSIS AND REACTIONS Aldehydes undergo two primary reactions: photolysis and reaction with OH radicals. These reactions lead to formation of CO, H, and R radicals. 6.1.5.3.3.4 RADICAL REACTIONS WITH NITRIC OXIDE AND NITROGEN DIOXIDE Alkylperoxy (RO2) and peroxyacyl (RC(O)OO) radicals react with NO to form NO2.

The peroxyacyl radical reacts with NO2 to form PAN-type compounds, which also decompose thermally. 6.1.5.3.3.5 RADICAL OXIDATION OF SULFUR DIOXIDE Sulfur dioxide is oxidized in the atmosphere eventually to form sulfate compounds.

Both OH and HO2 oxidize SO2 to reactive intermediates such as HSO3 and SO3.B These intermediates combine rapidly with water vapor in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid aerosol. This type of process is dependent on atmospheric conditions. In urban areas with existing photochemical smog problems, 6.1.6 Heterogeneous Reactions Heterogeneous reactions are defned as those involving the gaseliquid or gasesolid phases. The chemistry of NO2 and SO2 has a heterogeneous component in the atmosphere. Heterogeneous reactions involve the dissolving of NO2 and SO2 in water droplets, with subsequent chemical reactions occurring to form HNO3 and H2SO4 in the liquid phase. The heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 in liquid droplets and water flms is also a major pathway for conversion to sulfate in wet plumes and during humid or foggy conditions. 6.1.7 Scavenging and Removal from the Atmosphere The atmosphere is a dynamic system, with gases and PM entering, undergoing transformation, and leaving. Atmospheric chemical processes of oxidation transform gases into more highly oxidized products, e.g. NO to NO2 to HNO3, hydrocarbons to aldehydes, and SO2 to sulfate particles. The removal of material from the atmosphere involves two processes: wet and dry deposition. B Calvert JG, Su F, Bottenheim JW, Strausz OP. Atmos Environ 1978;12:197e226. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6.2 VAPOR PRESSURE The water solubility of gases infuences the extent of removal by wet versus dry deposition. Gases such as SO2 and NO2 are suffciently soluble to dissolve in water associated with in-cloud formation of rain droplets. These soluble gases may be removed by wet deposition of liquid droplets in the form of rain or fog. Less soluble gases such as O3 and hydrocarbon vapors are removed by transport to the surface of the earth, where they diffuse to vegetation, materials, or water bodies (see Chapter 14). 6.2 VAPOR PRESSURE For most air pollutants, vapor pressure is arguably their most important inherent property. Air pollutants exist in various physical states under environmental conditions. In particular, substances of low molecular weight and certain molecular structures have suffciently high vapor pressures that they can exist in either the liquid or gas phase under environmental conditions. The vapor pressure (P0) of a contaminant in the liquid or solid phase is the pressure that is exerted by its vapor when the liquid and vapor are in dynamic equilibrium (see Figure 6.21). Although vapor pressure is indeed an inherent property, the P0 value itself is an expression of the partial pressure of a chemical substance in a gas phase that is in equilibrium with the nongaseous phases. Thus, it is both an inherent and partitioning property. For many vapors under environmental conditions, a fraction of the molecules will be in liquid phase and a fraction in the gaseous phase. Thus, under identical conditions, if molecule A has a P0 higher than the P0 of molecule B, molecule A\u2019s liquid:gas ratio will be less than molecule B\u2019s liquid:gas ratio. With the caveats given in Chapter 1, gases are often assumed to behave according to the ideal gas law. The thermodynamic \u201cequation of state\u201d expresses the relationships of pressure (p), volume (V), and thermodynamic temperature (T) in a defned quantity (n)of a substance. For gases, the ideal gas law states this relationship as: pV \u00bc nRT (6.61) where R is the universal gas constant or molar gas constant \u00bc 8.31434 J mol 1 K 1. The ideal gas law can be used to convert P0 into moles of vapor per unit volume: nP0 \u00bc (6.62) V RT where V is the volume of the container; n, number of moles of the chemical; R, molar gas constant; Vn , the gas phase concentration (mol l 1) of the chemical. The P0 that is published in texts and handbooks is an expression of a chemical in its pure form; that is, P0 is expressed as the force per unit area exerted by a vapor in an equilibrium state with its pure solid, liquid, or Closed bioreactor tank Closed bioreactor tank Gas molecules Liquid molecules Vaporiza on Vapor pressure at equilibrium FIGURE 6.21 Reactor vapor pressure of a \ufb02uid during vaporization and at equilibrium. A portion of a substance in an evacuated, closed container with limited headspace will vaporize.", "The pressure in the space above the liquid increases from zero and eventually stabilizes at a constant value. This value is what is known as the vapor pressure of that substance. Substances not in a closed container (i.e. infnitely available headspace) will also vaporize, but will continue to vaporize until all of the substance has partitioned to the gas phase.

This situation is seldom encountered in the real world of environmental engineering, so adjustments have to be made to estimates based on the published P0 values. Note that the ideal gas law only applies to ideal gases, those that are made up of molecules taking up negligible space, with negligible spaces between the gas molecules. So, for real gases, the equilibrium relationship is: \u00f0p \u00fe k\u00de\u00f0V nb\u00de\u00bc nRT (6.63) where K is the factor for the decreased pressure on the walls of the container due to gas particle attractions; nb, volume occupied by gas particles at infnitely high pressure. Further, the van der Waals equation of state is: 2 na k \u00bc (6.64) V2 where a is a constant. Gas reactions, therefore, depend upon partial pressures. The gas equilibrium Kp is quotient of the partial pressures of the products and reactants, expressed as: zw CD Kp \u00bc p py (6.65) x pp AE Thus, Kp can also be expressed as: Kp \u00bc Keq\u00f0RT\u00deDv (6.66) where Dv is defned as the difference in stoichiometric coeffcients. Therefore, P0 is a measure of a substance\u2019s propensity to evaporate (Figure 6.1), increasing exponentially with an increase in temperature (see Figure 6.22), which means that a statement of P0 must always be accompanied by a temperature for that P0. For example,2 the P0 of trichloroethene at 21.0 C is about 7.5 kPa, but at 25.5 C rises to about 9.5 kPa. As such, P0 is a component of partitioning coeffcients and volatilization rate constants. VOCs have P0 values greater than 10 2 kPa; semi-volatile organic compounds have P0 values between 10 5 and 10 2 kPa, and the so-called \u201cnonvolatile organic compounds\u201d have P0 values less than 10 5. Any substance, depending upon the temperature, can exist in any phase. However, in many environmental contexts, many compounds can be excluded from certain phases. For example, molecular nitrogen (N2) certainly exists in a liquid phase; however, it must be cooled below its boiling point ( 196 C). Nowhere on earth do ambient conditions meet this temperature requirement, so N2 will be considered an atmospheric gas. Conversely, a vapor is a substance that is in its gas phase but under typical environmental conditions exists as a liquid or solid under a given set of conditions. Although the pressure in the closed container in Figure 6.21 is constant and below the boiling point, molecules of the vapor will continue to condense into the liquid phase and molecules of the liquid will continue to evaporate into the vapor phase. However, the rate of these two processes is equal, meaning no net change in the amount of vapor or liquid. This is an example of dynamic equilibrium, or equilibrium vapor pressure. At the boiling point temperature, a liquid\u2019s vapor pressure is equal to the external pressure. Generally, as vapor pressure increases for substances, boiling points II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6.2 VAPOR PRESSURE 177 Closed bioreactor tank Closed bioreactor tank FIGURE 6.22 Reactor vapor pressure increases in direct proportion with increasing temperature.", "Readings of vapor pressure values must always be accompanied by the temperature at which each measured vapor pressure is occurring. Gas molecules Liquid molecules Low temperature High temperature Refrigerated to T = 5\u00b0 C Heat source: T = 150\u00b0 C at a given pressure decrease. So, compounds with high vapor pressures are classifed as \u201cvolatile\u201d. Volatility is a measure of the propensity of a substance to form concentrations of vapor above the liquid. C This means that volatile compounds are potential air pollutants when they are stored in tanks, etc. and it also means that they can present problems to the frst responders. For example, if a volatile compound is also fammable, there is a fre and explosion hazard higher than if the substance were less volatile. This is one of the reasons that lower explosive limits are so important for frst responders, since volatile compounds that may have been released can concentrate in the air (e.g. inside a confned space or room) to a point where they are dangerously close to exploding. Volatility can combine with other inherent properties of a substance, which is important to know in air pollution source characterization. For example, ground water can be contaminated with nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) of varying densities. Light NAPLs (LNAPLs) are more likely to remain in the upper reaches of aquifers than dense NAPLs (DNAPLs). The contaminated soil and ground water can become an air pollution source if an LNAPL includes a relatively insoluble substance that distributes between liquid and gas phases (see Figure 6.23). The LNAPL can infltrate and move along the water table near the top of the zone of saturation, just above the capillary fringe. However, some of the contaminant fuid lags behind the plume and slowly solubilizes in the pore spaces of the soil and unconsolidated material. These more soluble forms of the fuid fnd their way to the zone of saturation and move with the general ground water fow. The higher vapor pressures of portions of the plume will lead to upward movement of volatile compounds in the gas phase. Thus, a water contamination scenario becomes an air pollution scenario as a result of the interplay of inherent properties, i.e. vapor pressure, solubility, and density of the fuid components. As always, the extent and severity of the pollution must also account for environmental conditions, including temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, soil type (e.g. more permeable C This is an important aspect in chromatography, as well. The lower boiling point compounds, i.e. the VOCs, usually come off the column frst. That is, as the gas chromatograph\u2019s oven increases the temperature of the column, the more volatile compounds leave the column frst, and they hit the detector frst, so their peaks show up before the less volatile compounds. Other chemical factors such as halogenation and sorption affect this relationship, so this is not always the case, but as a general rule, a compound\u2019s boiling point is a good frst indicator of residence time on a column. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS Source of light, immisicble fluid soil allows increased contaminant transfer), concentration of pollutant, and presence of other substances. For example, if surfactants are present, the organic contaminant may have more affnity of the water and be less likely to escape to the atmosphere. 6.2.1 Henry\u2019s Law The Henry\u2019s Law constant (KH) can be more powerful than simple vapor pressures for predicting an air pollutant entry of compounds into the atmosphere. It is the ratio at equilibrium of the gas phase concentration to the liquid phase concentration of a gas. Since it is an equilibrium relationship, it is discussed in detail in Chapter 17. However, it is also an inherent property of chemical compounds, since it combines two inherent properties, i.e. vapor pressure and solubility to estimate the likelihood that a substance will be exchanged between air and a liquid, especially water. Thus, under prescribed conditions of pressure and temperature, the vapor pressure and solubility in water of a compound can be known. However, the method used to calculate KH affects the estimate. For example, the KH for benzene for solubility in water at 298.15 K has varied from 0.12 to 0.22 mol kg 1 bar 1, with even more variability using a temperature dependent method, i.e. 2200e5300 (unitless Henry\u2019s Law Constant).3 6.3 SOLUBILITY The measure of the amount of chemical that can dissolve in a liquid is called solubility.", "It is usually expressed in units of mass of solute (that which is dissolved) in the volume of solvent (that which dissolves). Usually, when scientists use the term \u201csolubility\u201d without any other attributes, they mean the measure of the amount of the solute in water, i.e. aqueous solubility. Otherwise, the solubility will be listed along with the solvent, such as solubility in benzene, solubility in methanol, or solubility in hexane. Solubility may also be expressed in mass per mass or volume per volume, represented as parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb), or parts per trillion (ppt). Occasionally, solubility is expressed as a percent or in parts per thousand; however, this is uncommon for contaminants, and is usually reserved for nutrients and essential gases (e.g. percent carbon dioxide in water or ppt water vapor in the air). The solubility of a compound is very important to the extent and type of pollutant transport. The inherent solubility is also a reasonably reliable indication of a compound\u2019s affnity for various substrates, e.g. in precipitation. As such, solubility in water and other solvents is an indication of where one is likely to fnd the compound in the environment. For example, the most toxic form of dioxin, TCDD, has low aqueous solubility and very high solubility in organic solvents (see Table 6.18). Based on these solubility differences, if a source is releasing dioxins, one would expect TCDD to have a much greater affnity for PM that contains organic compounds. After being emitted, it may precipitate sorbed to PM. After deposition, it may strongly bond to lipophilic compounds in sediment, organic particles, and the organic fraction of soils. Low aqueous solubility indicates that dissolved TCDD in the water column should be at only II.

But, as will be seen in the discussion regarding co-solvation, for example, other processes may override any single process, e.g. dissolution,inanenvironmental system. A number of physicochemical characteristics of a substance come into play in determining its solubility. A principal property is a substance\u2019s polarity. The polarity of a molecule is its unevenness in charge. Since the water molecule\u2019s oxygen and two hydrogen atoms are aligned so that there is a slightly negative charge at the oxygen end and a slightly positive charge at the hydrogen ends, and since \u201clike dissolves like\u201d, polar substances have an affnity to become dissolved in water, and nonpolar substances resist being dissolved in water. Increasing temperature, i.e. increased kinetic energy, in a system increases the velocity of the molecules, so that intermolecular forces are weakened. With increasing temperature, the molecular velocity becomes suffciently large so as to overcome all intermolecular forces, so that the liquid boils (vaporizes). Intermolecular forces may be relatively weak or strong. The weak forces in liquids and gases are often called van der Waals forces. The same air pollutant exists in various physical states under environmental conditions. In particular, substances of low molecular weight and certain molecular structures have high enough vapor pressures that they can exist in either the liquid or gas phase under environmental conditions. Volatilization, solubility, and other inherent properties of a chemical compound lead to net partitioning. A contaminant\u2019s physical properties may make for an affnity for a suspended particle, but the particle may consist of organic compounds with their own properties. The net result is that sorption, the organic-aqueous phase partitioning, and bioconcentration all taking place at the same time. These and other partitioning factors are discussed in Chapter 17. The net result of the inherent properties may be that the contaminant remains in and on the particle. Researchers are interested in the fraction of these and other mechanisms that accounts for the fugacity. In the real-life environment, however, it often suffces to understand the net effect. That is why there are so many \u201cblack boxes\u201d in environmental models.", "There is often only incomplete understanding of reason the fugacity is occurring, but relatively high confdence that the frst principles of science as expressed by the partitioning coeffcients will occur unless there is some yet to be explained other factors affecting them. In other words, we will have to live with an amount of uncertainty, but scientists are always looking for ways to increase certainty. Models are important tools for estimating the movement of contaminants in the environment. They do not obviate the need for sound measurements. In fact, measurements and models are highly complementary. Compartmental model assumptions must be verifed in the feld. Likewise, measurements at a limited number of points depend on models to extend their meaningfulness. Having an understanding of the basic concepts of a contaminant transport model, we are better able to explore the principle mechanism for the movement of contaminants throughout the environment. 6.4 PERSISTENCE The inverse of a molecule\u2019s reactivity is its persistence. The more persistent the air pollutant, the more likely it will come into contact with humans and other receptors. Persistent compounds are slow to degrade, i.e. breakdown into simpler compounds, in the environment. This includes residence time not only in the atmosphere but also in other parts of the environment which serve as sources and reservoirs of air pollutants. For example, if a compound is persistent, its rate of build up in soil equals the rate of deposition onto and into soil particles minus its degradation rate. The soil, water, and other media can become air pollutant reservoirs over time. For example, if mean rate of deposition of benzo(a)pyrene to the soil is 100 ng kg 1 year 1and its mean degradation rate is 10 ng kg 1 year 1the mean accumulation rate for benzo(a)pyrene concentrations would be 90 ng kg 1 year 1. This means that if the soil in this area already contains 200 ng kg 1, in 10 years, the soil will contain 1100ngkg 1or1.1 mgkg 1. To complete the understanding of a reservoir, the rate at which benzo(a)pyrene exits II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS the soil would also need to be known. For example, a chemical compound leaves the soil to the atmosphere in two basic ways, by volatilization and by particle entrainment. Indeed, many persistent compounds are lipophilic, i.e. highly soluble in fats and oils, which means that they bind tightly to the organic soil matter and resist volatilization and dissolution. However, the soilD may become dislodged, emitted into the atmosphere and transported. Since the compounds are persistent, they can remain suspended for long distances. Fugacity and other such partitioning are discussed in Chapter 17. A chemical compound\u2019s ability to resist reactions, i.e. persist, especially photochemical reactions, dictates in large part its half-life, i.e. the time required to degrade one-half of the mass of a compound.4 6.4.1 Photochemical Reactivity The two principal photochemical reactions in the atmosphere are photodissociation and photo-oxidation. Photodissociation is a chemical reaction that degrades compounds by bombarding the molecule with photons. Photolysis is the type of photodissociation wherein a compound is decomposed by light or other forms of radiant energy. During photo-oxidation in the atmosphere, photodissociation combines with oxidation to breakdown chemicals in the presence of sunlight. The oxidation reactions involve the exchange of electrons between the pollutant molecule and other reactive compounds. If the only concern for air pollutants were the pollutant\u2019s residence time in the atmosphere, the degradation processes would mainly be photolysis and photo-oxidation. However, since the life cycle of the air pollutant includes most environmental compartments, other processes need to be discussed, especially redox, biodegradation, and hydrolysis (see Figure 6.24). 6.4.2 ReductioneOxidation Potential Oxidation, i.e. loss of electrons, and reduction, i.e. gain of electrons, occur simultaneously as a redox reaction. The amount of electrons shared defnes the oxidation state or oxidation number. As discussed earlier in this chapter, a pure element has an oxidation number \u00bc 0. For example, Hg0 is known as \u201celemental\u201d mercury or \u201czero valent\u201d mercury. Monatomic ions, i.e. those of a single element, have oxidation numbers that are the charge of the ion. For example, the oxidation number of mercury (II) chloride or mercuric chloride (HgCl2)is \u00fe2, since it must have a positive charge of 2 to match 2 of the two chorine (Cl ) ions. Note that this is an inorganic form of mercury, since it lacks any carbon-to-carbon or carbon-to-hydrogen bond.", "An example of organic mercury is methylmercuric chloride (CH3HgCl), which has an oxidation number of \u00fe2 to match the total of the for the methyl (CH3 ) and the 1 for Cl . These different oxidation states completely change the physical and chemical characteristics of the compound. For example, the aqueous solubility of Hg0 \u00bc 5.6 10 5gl 1at25 C. The aqueous solubility5 is higher for CH3HgCl at 0.10 g l 1 at 21 C; and much higher for HgCl2 at 69gl 1 \u00bc 5.6 10 5gl 1 at 20 C. In addition, the organic forms of Hg are readily absorbed by tissue, making their direct health and environmental impacts greater than elemental and inorganic forms. 6.4.3 Biodegradation Molecules, especially organic compounds, are broken down by organisms, usually involving catalysis by enzymes. This degradation is most often associated with microorganisms, especially bacteria and fungi. Aerobic biodegradation occurs when microbes decompose complex organic compounds in the presence of oxygen and use the liberated energy for reproduction and growth. Anaerobic biodegradation occurs when microorganisms use a chemical other than oxygen as an electron acceptor. Common substitutes for oxygen are nitrate, sulfate, iron, carbon dioxide, and other organic compounds (fermentation). Compounds vary in their ability to resist the different types of biodegradation. For example, some compounds break down. Metabolism can occur incidentally when a microbe breaks down another substance to obtain carbon, which makes for degradation that is catalyzed by an enzyme that is fortuitously produced by the organisms for other purposes. The microbe does not directly beneft from the degradation of the compound.6 In fact, the biotransformation of the compound could actually be harmful or can inhibit the growth and metabolism of the microbe. Engineers take advantage of this process, known as cometabolism, in biological treatment of persistent compounds. By adding additional carbon sources (e.g. unsubstituted alkanes) biodegradation of the targeted pollutant (e.g. a more resistant chlorinated alkane) is stimulated. This process has been used successfully to degrade halogenated compounds that are inherently more recalcitrant than their nonhalogenated counterparts by stimulating soil bacteria with the addition of O2 and CH4 to the subsoil strata. D Persistent compounds behave similarly in sediment in surface waters, i.e. bind to the organic fraction, but are released into water through various mechanisms. II.

The different chemical species vary in persistence. Note that vinyl chloride accumulates as a result of anaerobic digestion, i.e. reductive dechlorination of a degradation product, i.e. 1,2-DCE. Environmental Security Technology Certifcation Program. White paper: bioaugmentation for remediation of chlorinated solvents: technology development, status, and research needs. Prepared by GeoSyntec Consultants; 2004. Cometabolism has been used to treat other toxics, like trinitrotoluene (TNT). Obviously, the compound degrades extremely fast when ignited, i.e. the explosion from the addition of oxygen in the presence of a heat source. This extremely rapid oxidation produces CO2, H2O, and oxides of nitrogen. Scientists also observed that in the environment TNT can be reduced slowly. In laboratory studies, the majority of the TNT degrades to monoaminodinitrotoluene and diaminonitrotoluene isomers within a few days (see Figure 6.25). The persistence of TNT in the environmental systems is quite different. When released into the atmosphere it is degraded by predominantly direct photolysis, with an estimated atmospheric half-life ranging from 18.4 days to 184 days.6 These T1/2 estimates are based on the expected reactions with hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere. The transformation of TNT in surface waters by microbial metabolism is much slower than photolysis. Under anaerobic and aerobic environments, the predicted biodegradation T1/2 of TNT in surface water ranges between 1 and 6 months.7 II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS These rates do not represent environmental biodegradation, however, since environmental fate depends on more than mere abiotic chemistry. In addition to redox reactions, the TNT is sorbed to clay and organic molecules (e.g. humic acid) in the soil, with the intermediate degrades formed along the way. That is, TNT initially undergoes oxidation to form a variety of reduction products, culminating in the formation of triaminotoluene, which can be irreversibly adsorbed to soil\u2019s clay and organic matter content (see Figure 6.26). These chemical and physical mechanisms, i.e. redox and soil binding, call for a series of aerobic, and then anaerobic degradation processes (see Figure 6.27)to completely remove and degrade TNT when it is in soil.7", "The reduction of one nitro (eNO2)group of TNT is quite fast by aerobes. Conversely, the reduction of 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene requires a lower redox potential, and reduction of 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene requires a very low redox potential (i.e. < 200 mV), due to the electron-donating properties of the amino (eNH2) group\u2019s decreasing the electron defciency of the molecule.8 CH3 CH3 NO2 NO2 O2N O2N NO2 NO2 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene II.

Most reactions are catalyzed by nonspecifc NAD(P)H dependent nitroreductases. The last reduction steps to produce triaminotoluene occur only under anaerobic conditions catalyzed by enzymes in Desufovibrio spp., Clostridium pasteurianum, and Moorella thermoacetica. These nitro group reductions are also catalyzed by purifed xenobiotic reductase enzyme. McFarlan S, Yao G. Anaerobic trinitrotoluene pathway map. University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database; 2009. TNT is biodegraded aerobically by a number of organ-serving as H2 donors. Complex substrates can be fer-isms, including fungi (Phanerochaete chryosporium and mented by microorganisms in a bacterial consortium, Irpex lacteus), yeasts (Candida and Geotrichum spp.), thus generating H2 as one of the products, which in and bacteria (e.g. Actinomycetes spp., Pseudomonas spp. turn becomes available to the TNT degrading bacteria.11 and Alcaligenes 1e15), and anaerobically by bacteria (e.g. Methanococcus spp. B strain,9a,9b Desufovibrio spp., Clostridium pasteurianum and Moorella thermoacetica10). 6.4.4 Hydrolysis Incidentally, cometabolism appears to enhance TNT\u2019s degradation rates (see Table 6.19).

A hydrolyzed compound degrades into compounds that are less toxic. Conversely, it may be transformed to more toxic metabolites, a process known as bio-activation. Figure 6.28A illustrates the forms that the pesticide methyl parathion can take after it is released into the environment, and Figure 6.28B shows the metabolism of methyl parathion in rodents, including pathways that produce compounds that may be more toxic than the parent compound. The latter is known as bioactivation. FIGURE 6.28 (A) Proposed pathway of (A) methyl parathion in water. Environmental factors, including pH, available oxygen and water, determine the pathway. (B) Sometimes, chemicals become more toxic as a result of an organism\u2019s (in this instance, rodents) metabolism. For example, methyl parathion\u2019s O toxicity changes according to the degradation pathway. During metabolism, the biological catalysts (enzymes) make the molecule more polar by hydrolysis, oxidation and other reactions. Bioactivation (pathway 1) renders the metabolites more toxic than the parent compound, while detoxifcation (pathways 2 and 3) produces less toxic metabolites. The degradation product, methyl paraoxon may be metabolized in the same pathways as those for methyl parathion. World Health Organization, International Programme on Chemical Safety. (1993) Environmental health criteria 145: 6.5 PHYSICAL PHASE In air pollution science, the two \u201cphases\u201d of concern are particles and gases. Particle-phase substances include both liquid and solid phases. Gas phase substance includes gases and vapors; the latter are generally considered substances that are not gases at standard temperature and pressure, i.e. atmospheric conditions at 1 atm pressure (760 mm Hg) and 25 C (298.15 K).12 The term \u201caerosol\u201d is often used synonymously with PM. An aerosol can be a suspension of solid or liquid particles in a gas. In environmental sciences this gas is usually air, but not always. For example, liquid and gas phase pollutants of concern can be suspended in reactors, stacks, and fue gases. Generally, regulators usually consider a substance to be a \u201cpotential air pollutant\u201d until it reaches the air. The amount exiting the stack, vent, or fue is what is usually regulated as stack emissions. And, the amount of a pollutant actually in the atmosphere is what is measured by pollution control agencies at the local, state, provincial, and federal levels. Once in the atmosphere, it is an actual air pollutant.", "Thus, the class of S CH3O PO NO2 CH3O methyl parathion, Geneva (Switzerland); Bourquin AW, Garnas RL, Pritchard PH, Wilkes FG, Cripe CR, Rubinstein NI.

PM is an important vector for pollutant transport (e.g. moved by advection, or dissolved in or sorbed to aerosols). Although the regulations are oriented toward emissions and ambient concentrations of pollutants, recent trends toward green engineering and pollution prevention should serve as impetus for addressing potential air pollutants more aggressively. Using different reagents in a reactor, changing pressure, temperature, and other operational conditions in industrial processes, other mechanisms are optimized; the potential air pollutants could be eliminated or greatly reduced. As such, the actual air pollutant would never exist. For example, adjusting operational conditions could greatly reduce the formation of particulates or change the size of the PM, allowing it to be more easily captured and/or treated. The gases and vapors in air exist as individual molecules in random motion. Each gas or vapor exerts its proportionate partial pressure. The particles are aggregates of many molecules, sometimes of similar molecules, often of dissimilar ones. They age in the air by several processes. Some particles serve as nuclei upon which vapors condense. Some particles react chemically with atmospheric gases or vapors to form different compounds. When two particles collide in the air, they tend to adhere to each other because of attractive surface forces, thereby forming progressively larger and larger particles by agglomeration. The larger a particle becomes, the greater its weight and the greater its likelihood of falling to the ground rather than remaining airborne. The process by which particles fall out of the air to the ground is called sedimentation. Washout of particles by snowfakes, rain, hail, sleet, mist, or fog is a common form of agglomeration and sedimentation. Still other particles leave the air by impaction onto and retention by the solid surfaces of vegetation, soil, and buildings. The particulate mix in the atmosphere is dynamic, with continual injection into the air from sources of small particles; creation of particles in the air by vapor condensation or chemical reaction among gases and vapors; and removal of particles from the air by agglomeration, sedimentation, or impaction. Air pollution is generally associated with industry, transportation, energy production, and other human activities, i.e. anthropogenesis. However, many harmful substances are natural in origin. For example, particles are emitted into the atmosphere from both human activities and natural sources. Particulate forms emitted naturally include condensed water vapor; the condensed and reacted forms of natural organic vapors; salt particles resulting from the evaporation of water from sea spray; wind-borne pollen, fungi, molds, algae, yeasts, rusts, bacteria, and debris from live and decaying plant and animal life; particles eroded by the wind from beaches, desert, soil, and rock; particles from volcanic and other geothermal eruption and from forest fres started by lightning; and particles entering the troposphere from outer space. The precise, prehuman (unpolluted) background concentrations of PM and other airborne substances can only be estimated indirectly. By the time humans started measuring PM levels in the air, they had already been polluting the atmosphere with particles resulting from their presence on earth for several million years. The best that can be done now is to assume that the particulate levels at remote placesdthe middle of the sea, the poles, and the mountaintopsdapproach the true background concentrations. The debate over what the air quality may have been is a less meaningful benchmark than comparing PM concentrations, or those of any air pollutant, to health and environmental benchmarks.", "That is, how close is a given measurement to a safe level of exposure? Another important consideration is of trends. Are concentrations improving and at what rate? Particulates are measured on a dry basis, thereby eliminating from the measurement not only water droplets and snowfakes but also all vapors, both aqueous and organic, that evaporate or are desiccated from the PM during the drying process. Since different investigators and investigative processes employ different drying procedures and defnitions of dryness, it is important to know the procedures and defnition employed when comparing data. Although many of the air pollutants discussed in this book are best classifed by their chemical composition, particles are frst classifed according to their physical properties. PM is a common physical classifcation of particles found in the air, such as dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets.4 Unlike other US criteria pollutants [O3, CO, SO2,NO2, and lead (Pb)], PM is not a specifc chemical entity but is a mixture of particles from different sources and of different sizes, compositions, and properties. However, the chemical composition of PM is very important and highly variable. In fact, knowing the chemical composition of a particle can indicate its source, e.g. receptor models use chemical composition and morphology of particles as a means to trace pollutants back to the source. The chemical composition of tropospheric particles includes inorganic ions, metallic compounds, elemental carbon, organic compounds, and crustal (e.g. carbonates and compounds of alkali and rare earth elementals) substances. For example, the mean 24 h PM2.5 concentration measured near Baltimore, Maryland in 1999 was composed of 38% sulfate, 13% ammonium, 2% nitrate, 36% organic carbon, 7% elemental carbon, and 4% crustal matter.5 In addition, some atmospheric particles can be hygroscopic, i.e. they contain particle-bound water. The organic fraction can be particularly diffcult to II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS characterize, since it often contains thousands of organic compounds. Unless a particle is spherical its actual, i.e. physical, diameter is the same as its \u201caerodynamic diameter\u201d. However, this is seldom the case, since particles vary in morphology (e.g. platy, irregular, etc.) and density (e.g. solid versus hollow). The aerodynamic diameter is an adjustment from the spherical shape and normalized density, i.e. the diameter of the sphere at a specifed density (usually 1000 kg m 3), with the same settling velocity as the irregularly shaped particle. These features are discussed in detail in Chapters 30 and 31. Throughout this text, unless otherwise noted, particle diameter is assumed to be aerodynamic diameter. The size of a particle is determined by how the particle is formed. For example, combustion can generate very small particles, while coarse particles are often formed by mechanical processes. If particles are suffciently small and of low mass, they can be suspended in the air for long periods of time. Larger particles (e.g. 0.10 mm aerodynamic diameter) are found in smoke or soot, while very small particles (2.5 mm) may be apparent only indirectly, such as the manner in which they diffuse, diffract, absorb, and refect light. Sources of particles are highly variable. They may be emitted directly to the air from stationary sources, such as factories, power plants, and open burning, and from moving vehicles (known as \u201cmobile sources\u201d), frst by direct emissions from internal combustion engines, but also when these and other particles are re-entrained due to the movement of vehicles (e.g. in a \u201cnear-road\u201d situation). Area or nonpoint sources of particles include construction, agricultural activities such as plowing and tilling, mining, and forest fres. Particles may also form from gases that have been previously emitted, such as when gases released from burning fuels react with sunlight and water vapor. A common production of such \u201csecondary particles\u201d occurs when gases undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving O2 and water vapor (H2O). Photochemistry can be an important step in secondary particle formation, resulting when chemical species like ozone (O3) are involved in step reactions with radicals, e.g. the hydroxyl (,OH) and nitrate (NO3 ,) radicals. Photochemistry also occurs in the presence of air pollutant gases like sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and organic gases emitted by anthropogenic and natural sources. In addition, nucleation of particles from low-vapor pressure gases emitted from sources or formed in the atmosphere, condensation of low-vapor pressure gases on aerosols already present in the atmosphere, and coagulation of aerosols can contribute to the formation of particles.", "The chemical composition, transport, and fate of particles are directly associated with the characteristics of the surrounding gas. 6.5.1 Particulate Matter Size and Mass Since very small particles may remain suspended for some time, they are/can be particularly problematic from a pollutant transport perspective because their buoyancy allows them to travel longer distances. Smaller particles are also challenging because they are associated with numerous health effects (mainly because they can penetrate more deeply into the respiratory system than larger particles). Generally, the mass of PM falling in two size categories is measured, i.e. <2.5 mm diameter, and >2.5 mm and <10 mm diameter. These measurements are taken by instruments with inlets using size exclusion mechanisms to segregate the mass of each size fraction (i.e. \u201cdichotomous\u201d samplers). Particles with diameters >10 mm are generally of less concern, since these particles rarely travel long distances; however, they are occasionally measured if a large particulate emitting source (e.g. a coal mine) is nearby. Mass can be determined for a predominantly spherical particle by microscopy, either optical or electron, by light scattering and Mie theory, by the particle\u2019s electrical mobility, or by its aerodynamic behavior. However, since most particles are not spherical, PM diameters are often described using an equivalent diameter, i.e. the diameter of a sphere that would have the same fuid properties. Another term, optical diameter, is the diameter of a spherical particle that has an identical refractive index as the particle. Optical diameters are used to calibrate the optical particle sizing instruments, which scatter the same amount of light into the solid angle measured. Diffusion and gravitational settling are also fundamental fuid phenomena used to estimate the effciencies of PM transport, collection, and removal processes, such as in designing PM monitoring equipment and ascertaining the rates and mechanisms of how particles infltrate and deposit in the respiratory tract. Only for very small diameter particles is diffusion suffciently important that the Stokes diameter is often used. The Stokes diameter for a particle is the diameter of a sphere with the same density and settling velocity as the particle. The Stokes diameter is derived from the aerodynamic drag force caused by the difference in velocity of the particle and the surrounding fuid. Thus, for smooth, spherical particles, the Stokes diameter is identical to the physical or actual diameter. The aerodynamic diameter (Dpa) for all particles greater than 0.5 mm can be approximated6 as the product of the Stokes particle diameter (Dps) and the square root of the particle density (rp): p\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03 Dpa \u00bc Dps rp (6.67) The units of the diameters are in mm and the units of density are in g cm 3. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6.5 PHYSICAL PHASE 187 Fine particles (<2.5 mm) generally come from industrial combustion processes and from vehicle exhaust. As mentioned, this smaller sized fraction has been closely associated with increased respiratory disease, decreased lung functioning, and even premature death, probably due to their ability to bypass the body\u2019s trapping mechanisms, such as cilia in the lungs, and nasal hair fltering. Some of the diseases linked to PM exposure include aggravation of asthma, chronic bronchitis, and decreased lung function. In addition to health impacts, PM is also a major contributor to reduced visibility, including near national parks and monuments. Also, particles can be transported long distances and serve as vehicles on which contaminants are able to reach water bodies and soils. Acid deposition, for example, can be as dry or wet precipitation. Either way, particles play a part in acid rain. In the frst, the dry particles enter ecosystems and potentially reduce the pH of receiving waters. In the latter, particles are washed out of the atmosphere and, in the process, lower the pH of the rain. The same transport and deposition mechanisms can also lead to exposures to persistent organic contaminants like dioxins and organochlorine pesticides, and heavy metals like mercury that have sorbed in/on particles. Particles can function as vehicles for transporting and transforming chemical contaminants. For example, compounds that are highly sorptive (e.g. those with large Koc partitioning coeffcients) can use particles as a means for long-range transport. Also, charge differences between the particles and ions (particularly metal cations) will also make particles a means by which contaminants are transported. There are ways of measuring PM other than by weight per unit volume of air.", "They include a count of the total number of particles in a unit volume of air, a count of the number of particles of each size range, the weight of particles of each size range, and similar measures based on the surface area and volume of the particles rather than on their number or weight. Some particles in the air are so small that they cannot be seen by an optical microscope, individually weighing so little that their presence is masked in gravimetric analysis by the presence of a few large particles. The mass of a spherical particle is 4 3 u \u00bc p$r$r (6.68) 3 where u is the particle mass (g), r is the particle radius (cm), and r is the particle density (g cm 3). The size of small particles is measured by its diameter in microns (mm). One micron is one-millionth of a \u00b0 meter or 10,000 A (angstrom units)dthe units used to measure the wavelength of light (visible light is between 3000 and 8000 A \u00b0 ). Compare the weight of a 10-mm particle near the upper limit of those found suspended in the air and a 0.1-mmdiameterparticlewhich is near the lower limit. If both particles have the same density (p), the smaller particle will have one-millionth the weight of the larger one. This is because the radius term is cubed. The usual gravimetric procedures can scarcely distinguish a 0.1-mmparticlein the presence of a 10-mm particle. To measure the entire size range of particles in the atmosphere, several measurement techniques must therefore be combined, each one most appropriate for its size range (Table 6.20). Thus, the smallest particlesdthose only slightly larger than a gas moleculedare measured by the electric charge they carry and by electron microscopy. The next larger size range is measured by electron microscopy or by the ability of these particles to act as nuclei upon which water vapor can be condensed in a cloud chamber. (The water droplets are measured rather than the particles themselves.) The still larger size range is measured by electron or optical microscopy; and the largest size range is measured gravimetrically, either as suspended particles separated from the air by a sampling device or, with sedimentation, particles falling out of the air into a receptacle. Particles can form from gases that have been previously emitted, such as when gases released from burning fuels react with sunlight and water vapor. A common production of such \u201csecondary particles\u201d occurs when gases undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving O2 and water vapor (H2O). An aerosol can be a suspension of solid or liquid particles in air, and aerosol concentration is often described as the mass of the particles suspended in the total volume of vapor or gas phase components of air. As mentioned, fne aerosol particles are problematic because they may remain suspended and the buoyancy allows them to travel longer distances, and because these particles are associated with numerous health effects (mainly because they can penetrate more deeply into the respiratory system than larger particles). Generally, the mass of PM is currently regulated as either fne or coarse particles. In North America and Europe, the distinction is between particles with diameters <2.5 mm and particles with diameters >2.5 mm and <10 mm. These measurements are taken by instruments (see Figure 6.29) with inlets using size exclusion mechanisms to segregate the mass of each size fraction (i.e. \u201cdichotomous\u201d samplers). Particles with diameters >10 mm are generally of less concern, since these particles rarely travel long distances; however, they are occasionally measured if a large particulate emitting source (e.g. a coal mine) is nearby, since these particles that are emitted at suffciently high altitudes (e.g. from tall II.

If so, sampling devices with inlets larger than 10 mm would be needed. If spherical, the mass of a particle can be estimated using microscopy, either optical or electron, by light scattering and Mie theory, by the particle\u2019s electrical mobility, or by its aerodynamic behavior. However, since most particles are not spherical, PM diameters are often described using an equivalent diameter, i.e. the diameter of a sphere that would have the same fuid properties. The optical diameter is the diameter of a spherical particle that has an identical refractive index as the physical particle. Optical diameters are used to calibrate the optical particle sizing instruments, which scatter the same amount of light into the solid angle measured. Diffusion and gravitational settling are also fundamental fuid phenomena used to estimate the effciencies of PM transport, collection, and removal processes, such as in designing PM monitoring equipment and ascertaining the rates and mechanisms of how particles infltrate and deposit in the respiratory tract. A typical means of indirect measurement of PM is by light scattering. A nephelometer includes a light source (lamp) that sends light through a lens after which an aperture focuses the light waves to a specifc wavelength. The light that passes unscattered is assumed to contain no PM, and the light that is scattered at some angle (e.g. 90 ) is detected by the instrument detector. The amount of scattering is calibrated against known PM concentrations, e.g. collocating one of the direct-measurement instruments with the nephelometer and comparing results. The concentration of particulates is proportionate to the amount of scattering detected, which means that the effectiveness of the instrument as an indirect measure of PM2.5 concentration can be determined by a ratio of scattering to PM2.5 concentrations compared at several sites and over time. Environmental conditions, especially relative humidity, can increase variability and uncertainty. Also, nephelometers do not collect PM, so analysis of particles for chemical composition is not possible, as it is for direct measurements of PM using flters.13 6.5.2 Fibers Generally, when environmental scientists discuss particles, they mean those that are somewhat spherical or angular like soil particles. Particles that are highly elongated are usually differentiated as \u201cfbers\u201d. Such elongation is expressed as a particle\u2019s aspect ratio, i.e. the ratio of the length to width. Fibers generally have aspect ratios greater than 3:1. Environmentally important fbers include fberglass, fabrics, and minerals (see Figures 6.30 and 6.31). Exposure to fberglass and textile fbers is most commonly found in industrial settings, such as it has been associated with the health problems of textile workers exposed to fbrous matter in high doses for many years. For example, chronic exposure to cotton fbers has led to the ailment, II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6. INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS US Environmental Protection Agency, 2004.

Conner, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. byssinosis, also referred to as \u201cbrown lung disease\u201d, which is characterized by the narrowing of the lung\u2019s airways. However, when discussing fbers, it is highly likely that frst contaminant to come to mind is asbestos, a group of highly fbrous minerals with separable, long, and thin fbers. Separated asbestos fbers are strong enough and fexible enough to be spun and woven. Asbestos fbers are heat resistant, making them useful for many industrial purposes. Because of their durability, asbestos fbers that get into lung tissue will remain for long periods of time.

Photo courtesy of T. Conner, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 6.5.2.1 Asbestos: The Fiber of Concern There are two general types of asbestos, amphibole and chrysotile. Some studies show that amphibole fbers stay in the lungs longer than chrysotile, and this tendency may account for their increased toxicity. Generally, health regulations classify asbestos into six mineral types: chrysotile, a serpentine mineral with long and fexible fbers; and fve amphiboles, which have brittle crystalline fbers. The amphiboles include actinolite asbestos, tremolite asbestos, anthophyllite asbestos, crocidolite asbestos, and amosite asbestos (see Figure 6.32). II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6.5 PHYSICAL PHASE 191 Typical ambient air concentrations of asbestos fbers longer than 5 mm range from about 10 5 to 10 4 fbers per milliliter (fbers ml 1), depending on the location. Human exposure to concentrations much higher than 1024 1 fbers ml is suspected of causing health effects.14 Asbestos fbers are very persistent and resist chemical degradation (i.e. they are inert under most environmental conditions) so their vapor pressure is nearly zero. The fbers not only resist volatilization but also have extremely low aqueous solubility. This could erroneously indicate that exposure is unlikely. Indeed, segments of fbers do enter the air and water as asbestos-containing rocks and minerals that are weathered naturally or when extracted during mining operations. One of the most important exposures is when manufactured products (e.g. pipe wrapping and fre-resistant materials) begin to wear down. Small diameter asbestos fbers may remain suspended in the air for a long time and be transported advectively by wind or water before sedimentation. Like lower aspect ratio (more spherical) particles, heavier fbers settle more quickly. Asbestos seldom moves substantially via soil. The fbers are generally not broken down to other compounds in the environment and will remain virtually unchanged over long periods. Although most asbestos is highly persistent, chrysotile, the most commonly encountered form, may breakdown slowly in acidic environments. Asbestos fbers may break into shorter strands and, therefore, increase number of fbers, by mechanical processes (e.g. grinding and pulverization). Inhaled fbers may become trapped in the lungs and with chronic exposures build up over time. Some fbers, especially chrysotile, can be removed from or degraded in the lung with time. 6.5.2.2 Particulate Morphology Generally, when environmental scientists discuss particles, they mean those that are somewhat spherical or angular like soil particles. As mentioned, particles that are highly elongated are usually differentiated as fbers. Note that the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for particulates only designates size (<2.5 and <10 micron aerodynamic diameter). The standards do not consider the shape of the particles. This does not mean that shape is not considered. Indeed, one of the most important groups of regulated particles from a health perspective is asbestos, which is regulated elsewhere in the Clean Air Act (Section 112, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutant, NESHAPS) and several other laws. 6.5.2.3 Particle Characteristics and Air Pollution Technology Numerous physical processes are at work in the formation of particles in the troposphere. These processes give clues both to ways to measure PM, as well as to how to control particle emissions. By measuring each portion of the particle size spectrum by the most appropriate method, a composite diagram of the size distribution of the atmospheric aerosol can be produced. Figure 3.6 indicates that particle size distributions vary according to the number, surface area, and volume (or mass) of the particles. The volume (mass) distribution is called bimodal because of its separate maxima at about 0.2 and 10 mm, which result from different mechanisms of particle formation. The mode with the 0.2-mm maximum results from coagulation and condensation formation mechanisms. These particles are created in the atmosphere by chemical reaction among gases and vapors. They are called fne particles to differentiate them from the particles in the 10-mm maximum mode, which are called coarse. These fne particles consist primarily of sulfates, nitrates, organics, ammonium, and lead compounds. The mode with the 10-mm maximum is made up of particles introduced to the atmosphere as solids from the land and sea surfaces of the earth, plus particles from the coagulationecondensation mode which have grown larger and moved across the saddle between the modes into the larger size mode. These consist primarily of silicon, iron, aluminum, sea salt, and biogenic (e.g. detritus, pollen, cysts, and spores) particles. Thus, there is a dynamism that creates II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 6.", "INHERENT PROPERTIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS small particles, allows them to grow larger, and eventually allows the large particles to be scavenged from the atmosphere by sedimentation (in the absence of precipitation), plus washout and rainout when there is precipitation. Understanding these mechanisms is the key to controlling air pollution. Designing and operating pollution control equipment effectively must account for the number, surface characteristics, volume, and shape of particles. The majority of particles in the atmosphere are spherical in shape because they are formed by condensation or cooling processes or they contain core nuclei coated with liquid. Liquid surface tension draws the material in the particle into a spherical shape. Other important particle shapes exist in the atmosphere, e.g. asbestos is present as long fbers and fy ash can be irregular in shape. The methods just noted describe the physical characteristics of atmospheric PM but not chemical composition. One can seek this kind of information for either individual particles or all particles en masse. Analysis of particles en masse involves analysis of a mixture of particles of many different compounds. How much of each element or radical, anion, or cation is present in the mixture can be determined. Specifc organic compounds may be separated and identifed. Individual particles may be analyzed by electron microscopy. Much of the concern about PM in the atmosphere arises because particles of certain size ranges can be inhaled and retained by the human respiratory system. There is also concern because PM in the atmosphere absorbs and scatters incoming solar radiation. After passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, the U.S. EPA required measurements of total suspended particulates (TSP) based on particle collection using a high volume sampler, i.e. a device that collected a large range of sizes of particles (aerodynamic diameters up to 50 mm). Smaller particles are more likely to be inhaled than larger particles, so in 1987 the U.S. EPA changed the standard for PM from TSP to PM10, i.e. particle matter 10 mm diameters. The NAAQS for PM10 became a 24-h average of 150 mgm 3 (not to exceed this level more than once per year), and an annual average of 50 mgm 3 arithmetic mean. However, subsequent research showed the need to protect people breathing even smaller PM in air, since most of the particles that penetrate deeply into the aireblood exchange regions of the lung are very small (see Chapter 9). Thus, in 1997, the U.S. EPA added a new fne particle (diameters 2.5), known as PM2.5.15 Aerosols are collected using equipment that separates out the size fraction of concern. Filtration is an important technology in every aspect of environmental engineering, i.e. air pollution, waste water treatment, drinking Electrostatic impaction FIGURE 6.33 Mechanical processes involved in collecting particulate matter.

Basically, fltration consists of four mechanical processes: (1) diffusion; (2) interception; (3) inertial impaction; and (4) electrostatics (see Figure 6.33). These physical mechanisms are applied in the design and operation of air pollution control equipment, as discussed in detail in Chapters 29 and 30. Diffusion is important only for very small particles ( 0.1 mm diameter) because the Brownian motion allows them to move in a \u201crandom walk\u201d away from the air stream. Interception works mainly for particles with diameters between 0.1 and 1 mm. The particle does not leave the air stream but comes into contact with the flter medium (e.g. a strand of fberglass). Inertial impaction collects particles that are suffciently large to leave the air stream by inertia (diameters 1 mm). Electrostatics consist of electrical interactions between the atoms in the flter and those in the particle at the point of contact (Van der Waal\u2019s forces), as well as electrostatic attraction (charge differences between particle and flter medium). Other important factors affecting fltration effciencies include the thickness and pore diameter of the flter, the uniformity of particle diameters and pore sizes, the solid volume fraction, the rate of particle loading onto the flter (e.g. affecting particle \u201cbounce\u201d), the particle phase (liquid or solid), capillarity and surface tension (if either the particle or the flter media are coated with a liquid), and characteristics of air or other carrier gases, such as velocity, temperature, pressure, and viscosity.", "As mentioned, aerosol measurement is an expression of the mass of a particle size range, so collection devices must be selective and include only the particles within a specifed size range. This is accomplished using differently sized inlets. Figure 6.34 II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION shows an inlet of the PM2.5 sampler that is designed to extract ambient aerosols from the surrounding air stream, remove particles with aerodynamic diameters >10 mm, and move the remaining smaller particles to the next stage. Figure 6.35 illustrates the impactor and flter assembly for removing those particles less than 10 mm but greater than 2.5 mmin diameterbut allows particles of 2.5 mm in diameter to pass and be collected on a flter surface. Particles <10 mmbut <2.5 mmare removed downstream from the inlet by a single-stage, single-fow, single-jet impactor assembly. Aerosols are collected on flters which are weighed before and after sampling. This system uses 37 mm diameter glass flters immersed in low volatility, low viscosity diffusion oil. The oil is added to reduce the impact of \u201cbounce\u201d, i.e. particle hit the flter and are not reliably collected.15 This chapter introduced the properties of gas-phase and particle-phase pollutants. These inherent properties provide the basis for the potential for substances to become air pollutants. The following chapters discuss how these inherent properties combine with the atmospheric and environmental conditions that lead to the transport, transformation, and fate of these substances. II.

Ziganshin AM, Naumov AV, Suvorova ES, Naumenko EA, Washington (DC). 7 Air Pollutant Hazards 7.1 HAZARDS The \ufb01rst step in assessing air pollution risk is to identify the hazard. The hazards associated with air pollution are generally differentiated as to whether the agent causes harm to human health, impairs ecosystems, or damages socially important resources, such as monuments, buildings, and infrastructure. As discussed in Chapter 3, air pollutants are divided into the so-called criteria pollutants and hazardous air pollutants. Both types are \u201chazardous\u201d, but the criteria pollutants are those that are used to designate the air quality of a region.", "That is, the amounts measured in ambient air determine whether a region is meeting air quality standards, i.e. is in \u201cattainment\u201d status. Conversely, hazardous air pollutants, known as \u201cair toxics\u201d, are chemical compounds suspected of causing cancer and other chronic ailments in humans, even at very low doses. These are usually found in highest concentrations near particular industries, roadways, and other speci\ufb01c sources. Air pollutant hazard primarily focuses on the toxicity of a chemical compound. For example, a compound that causes cancer or elicits respiratory problems in rats would be suspected of doing the same in humans, albeit at lower doses and over longer time frames than what laboratory rats have been exposed. However, toxicity to humans is not the only hazard that must be identi\ufb01ed. The toxicity to other species is also of concern. For example, some species are sensitive to substances that may have low human toxicity, e.g. copper compounds can be highly toxic to \ufb01shes. Ecosystem toxicity, i.e. ecotoxicity, is the hazard that a compound may cause to various species within an ecosystem. For example, a substance may have low toxicity to a particular \ufb01sh species, but high toxicity to an organism on which the \ufb01sh feeds. This would not kill the \ufb01sh directly, but would diminish the abundance and diversity of \ufb01sh species in the ecosystem. Besides toxicity, chemical hazards include other potential harm, including \ufb01re hazard, explosiveness, corrosivity, and chemical reactivity. Hazards may also be biological (biohazards) and physical (e.g. radioactive). Air pollution experts are primarily interested in chemical hazards, but must be aware of these other hazards, particularly in \ufb01rst response and emergency situations. Indeed, spills and accidents may at \ufb01rst be physical hazards, e.g. a highly reactive compound leaking from a ruptured tank. The reactions may form highly toxic vapors and gases that threaten human populations. In addition to stopping the leak, the immediate actions may be to evacuate nearby residences to prevent exposures to these toxic gases. Health of\ufb01cials and occupational and environmental scientists and engineers often refer to thresholds of chemical compounds. The threshold level is the lowest amount needed to induce harmful effects in an organism. In addition to this inherent toxicity of the compound (e.g. cyanide and dioxin are highly and acutely toxic, whereas the metal iron is usually only acutely toxic in high doses), the hazard is also in\ufb02uenced by factors such as a chemical\u2019s mobility in environmental media and tissues (how quickly does it move through the environment or across cellular membranes), its persistence or recalcitrance (remaining in the environment for years without being altered, e.g. a chlorinated compound is inherently more dif\ufb01cult to break down than its nonhalogenated counterpart), and its likelihood to accumulate in living tissue (e.g. mercury and lead can build up in tissue over years and decades with longterm exposures). 7.1.1 Chemical Hazards The traditional risk assessment paradigm for chemicals in the environment (Figure II.1) is generally a stepwise process. It begins with the identi\ufb01cation of a hazard, which is composed of a summary of an agent\u2019s physicochemical properties and routes and patterns of exposure and a review of toxic effects. The tools for hazard identi\ufb01cation take into account the chemical structures that are associated with toxicity, metabolic and pharmacokinetic properties, short-term animal and cell tests, long-term animal (in vivo) testing, and human Fundamentals of Air Pollution 197 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00007-4 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 7. AIR POLLUTANT HAZARDS studies (e.g. epidemiology, such as longitudinal and caseecontrol studies). These comprise the core components of hazard identi\ufb01cation; however, additional hazard identi\ufb01cation methods have been emerging that increasingly provide improved reliability of characterization and prediction. Biological information is useful in identifying hazards since it will appear before tissue damage. Hazard identi\ufb01cation is also being advanced by computational chemistry. This enhances the understanding of hazards resulting from slight differences in molecular structures. Even similar substitutions on molecules (e.g. one versus two methyl groups, methyl versus ethyl substitutes, or halogenations (Cl versus F) can lead to quite different hazards. Computational tools based on structureeactivity relationships (SARs) known as quantitative SARs are increasingly used to model hazards. They also provide clues to subtle and presymptomatic hazard information akin to the biomedical sciences\u2019 increasing focus on a person\u2019s entire life, rather than the presence or absence of diseases. 1 Numerous new methods are being developed to identify and to characterize air pollutant hazards. Regulatory agencies generally distinguish cancer from noncancer hazard and risk.", "Cancer hazards, i.e. carcinogens, are classi\ufb01ed according to the extent to which sound science supports or rejects a chemical compound\u2019s link to cancer (see Table 7.1). Thus, carcinogen classi\ufb01cations combine the amount of certainty and quality of the dose-response information, the type of information (e.g. animal versus human) and the potency of the carcinogen. Unlike the cancer dose-response curve, which has no threshold, noncancer hazard is generally based on a dose above which there is a potential for an adverse outcome (e.g. neurological damage, reproductive and developmental disorder, and endocrine disruption). This threshold is known as the no observable adverse effect concentration (NOAEC),a which is discussed under the Section 7.2. As a precaution, it is generally assumed in cancer risk assessments that there is no safe level of exposure, i.e. there is no \u201cthreshold\u201d below which an exposure is acceptable. In addition to the NOAEC, the \u201clowest observed adverse effect concentration\u201d (LOAEC) is the area of the doseeresponse curve where studies have actually linked a dose to an effect. Thus, the precautionary principle renders the NOAEC and LOAEC irrelevant to cancer risk. Instead, cancer slope factors (CSFs) are used to calculate the estimated probability of increased cancer incidence over a person\u2019s lifetime (the so-called excess lifetime cancer risk). Like the reference doses and concentrations (RfDs and RfCs, respectively; TABLE 7.1 Cancer Classi\ufb01cations in the United States Cancer Classi\ufb01cation Description A The chemical considered to be a human carcinogen B The chemical is a probable human carcinogen, with two subclasses B1 Chemicals that have limited human data from epidemiological studies supporting their carcinogenicity B2 Chemicals for which there is suf\ufb01cient evidence from animal studies but for which there is inadequate or no evidence from human epidemiological studies C The chemical is a possible human carcinogen D The chemical is not classi\ufb01able as to human carcinogenicity E There is evidence that the chemical does not induce cancer in humans Carcinogens fall into the above-mentioned classes (strength in descending order based on type and certainty of weight of evidence). U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. see Section 7.2), slope factors follow exposure pathways, i.e. they will differ based on whether they are ingested, inhaled, or come into contact with the skin. CSFs are discussed in detail in Chapter 11. 7.1.2 Biological Hazards Although most air pollutants discussed in this book address chemical hazards, there is a growing concern about nonchemical air pollutants, especially biological agents. These may include microbial organisms, e.g. viruses, bacteria, and fungi. They may also include parts of larger organisms, e.g. pet dander and insect antigens (as triggers for asthma), as well as pollen and spores. The concern has recently grown to include genetically modi\ufb01ed organisms (GMOs). Risks and hazards from biological agents are often different from those posed by chemicals, so the risk assessment process is commensurately different. As evidence, the Safety in Biotechnology Working Party of the European Federation of Biotechnology1 has identi\ufb01ed four risk classes for GMOs: Risk class 1: No adverse effect, or very unlikely to produce an adverse effect. Organisms in this class are considered to be safe. Risk class 2: Adverse effects are possible but are unlikely to represent a serious hazard with respect to the a The NOAEC is used for inhalation, so is most appropriate for air pollutants. For dermal, ingestion, and other exposure pathways, no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) is commonly used as the threshold. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION value to be protected. Local adverse effects are possible, which can either revert spontaneously (e.g. owing to environmental elasticity and resilience) or be controlled by available treatment or preventive measures. Spread beyond the application area is highly unlikely. Risk class 3: Serious adverse local effects are likely with respect to the value to be protected, but spread beyond the area of application is unlikely. Treatment and/or preventive measures are available. Risk class 4: Serious adverse effects are to be expected with respect to the value to be protected, both locally and outside the area of application. No treatment or preventive measures are available. These classes indicate that even the safest genetic modi\ufb01cations carry some risk and that with more uncertainty about an organism, one cannot assume it to be safe. Thus, risk scenarios include not only the effects resulting from the intended purpose of the environmental application but also downstream and side effects that are not part of the desired purpose.", "The biological agent risk classes are analogous to the hazard classes of various human health risk paradigms, e.g. carcinogen listings or extremely hazardous designations. Thus, a genetically modi\ufb01ed microbe can be assigned to the appropriate risk class based on its physical, chemical, and biological properties, \u201cindependent of the technique used to select or generate the particular variant, and then scoring it against a set of values to be protected\u201d.1 Like the hazard identi\ufb01cation process for chemicals, the microbe is classi\ufb01ed according to its inherent properties. It is in the next stage that environmental conditions are taken into account, i.e. the characterization of administered dose to various responses in different populations. Both the hazard identi\ufb01cation and doseeresponse information are based on research that is used in the risk analysis. For microbes, the highest score for any one determines the overall risk class for environmental application. Another similarity of the risk classi\ufb01cation of microbes to the chemical hazard identi\ufb01cation processes is that it is not uncommon to extrapolate from available knowledge to other microbes with similar characteristics or to yet untested, but similar environmental conditions (e.g. a \ufb01eld study\u2019s results in one type of \ufb01eld extrapolated to a different agricultural or environmental remediation setting). In chemical hazard identi\ufb01cation, this is accomplished by SARs. 7.1.3 Ecological Hazards In the United States, ecological risk assessment paradigms have differed from human health risk assessment paradigms. The ecological risk assessment framework (see Figure II.2) is based mainly on characterizing exposure and ecological effects. Both exposure and effects are considered during problem formulation.2 Increasingly, human risk assessment is following the ecological risk framework. The process shown in the inner circle of Figure II.2 actually does not target the technical analysis of risk so much as it provides coherence and connections between risk assessment and risk management. As mentioned, in the early 1980s there was confusion and mixing of the two processes. For example, a share of the criticism of the federal response to environmental disasters, such as those in Love Canal, New York, and Times Beach, Missouri, related to the mixing of scienti\ufb01cally sound studies (risk assessment) and decisions whether to pursue certain actions (risk management). This led to actual and perceived political and \ufb01nancial motivations for buyouts and remediation, in the absence of or, worse, in spite of sound science. In fact, the \ufb01nal step of the improved risk assessment process is referred to as \u201ccharacterization\u201d to mean that \u201cboth quantitative and qualitative elements of risk analysis, and of the scienti\ufb01c uncertainties in it, should be fully captured by the risk manager\u201d.3 In particular, the process allows for an integration of research with risk assessment, which could underpin risk management decisions. The problem formulation step in the ecological framework has the advantage of providing an analyticedeliberative process early on. That is, it combines sound science with input from various stakeholders inside and outside of the scienti\ufb01c community. The looming threat of this integration, however, is the risk of repeating the previous problems of biasing of sound science. The ecological risk framework calls for the characterization of ecological effects instead of hazard identi\ufb01cation used in human health risk assessments. This is because the term \u201chazard\u201d has been used in chemical risk assessments to connote either intrinsic effects of a stressor (chemical inherency)or a margin of safety by comparing an ecological effect with an estimate of exposure concentration. In the latter connotation of hazard, the hazard is at a level in the environment that could be expected to induce adverse outcome. Consider a hypothetical compound that is found at 10 ppm to reduce the ability of a species to reproduce, which in turn changes the predatoreprey aspects of the ecosystem, leading to diminished biodiversity. This is an example of an ecological hazard. However, the threshold concentration denoting the hazard would not simply be 10 ppm, due to uncertainties in the data and science (e.g. measurement and modeling error and variability) underlying this hazard threshold. With an ample margin of safety, the hazard threshold is adjusted lower, e.g. to 5 ppm, to account for these uncertainties. Another aspect of ecological hazard is that of the food chain, which incorporates human health and ecosystem condition. A hazard to an ecosystem must be considered II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 7. AIR POLLUTANT HAZARDS FIGURE 7.1 Systems cascade of exposuree response processes. In this instance, scale and levels of biological organization are used to integrate exposure information with biological outcomes.", "The stressor (chemical or biological agent) moves both within and among levels of biological organization, reaching various receptors, thereby in\ufb02uencing and inducing outcomes. The outcome can be explained by physical, chemical, and biological processes (e.g. toxicogenomic mode-of-action information). Ref. 5. at multiple levels of biological organization (see change physicochemical forms to become more hazard-Figure 7.1).4 The food chain or web is, therefore, a means ous, such as the methylation of mercury (Figure 7.2). by which an ecological hazard becomes a human health Although biological hazards are more complicated hazard. It is also the means by which a hazard can than purely chemical hazards, similar thresholds could Tools Biochemodynamics II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION exist. For example, an introduced species may overwhelm another species in an ecosystem if introduced at some air pollution level (e.g. number of seeds, spores, or cysts). In such cases, the biological hazard would be identical to chemical hazard approach. As mentioned, human risk assessment is becoming less sequential and stepwise, and more systematic. As such, human hazards are being approached more like ecosystem hazards. 7.2 DOSE-RESPONSE Usually, the health hazard of a chemical compound is expressed as a gradient of the damage that can be caused by that compound, i.e. the dose. Dose is the amount (often mass) of a chemical administered to an organism (so-called applied dose), the amount of the chemical that enters the organism (\u201cinternal dose\u201d), the amount of the chemical that is absorbed by an organism over a certain time interval (\u201cabsorbed dose\u201d), or the amount of the chemical or its metabolites that reach a particular \u201ctarget\u201d organ (\u201cbiologically effective dose\u201d), such as the amount of a hepatotoxin (liver damaging chemical) that reaches the liver. Increasing the concentration of a substance in an organism should also increase the severity of the expected adverse outcome. The classic demonstration of this gradient is the so-called doseeresponse curve (Figure 7.3). If one increases the amount of the substance, a greater incidence of the adverse outcome would be expected. The three curves in Figure 7.3 represent those generally found for hazardous wastes. Curve A is the classic Cancer Adverse effect Hazard concentration or dose FIGURE 7.3 Prototypical dose response curve for a carcinogen, essential nutrient, and noncancer hazard. Note the cancer dosee response curve (solid line) has no safe level of exposure, i.e. it is a \u201cno-threshold\u201d curve. The essential substance (dotted line) has two regions separated by an optimal dose region. The region of de\ufb01ciency is found at concentrations below the optimal dose and closer to zero. Above the optimal range is the range of toxicity. The noncancer dose response curve (dashes and dots) represents toxicity above a certain threshold, i.e. the NOAEC is the concentration below which no response is expected. Adapted from Vallero DA. Environmental contaminants: assessment and control. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic Press; 2004. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) cancer doseeresponse curve. Regulatory agencies generally subscribe to the precautionary principle that any amount of exposure to a cancer-causing agent may result in an expression of cancer at the cellular level. Thus, the curve intercepts the x-axis at 0. Metals can be toxic at high levels, but several are essential to the development and metabolism of organisms. Thus, curve B represents an essential chemical (i.e. a \u201cnutrient\u201d) that will cause dysfunction at low levels (below the minimum intake needed for growth and metabolism) and toxicity at high levels. The segment of curve B that runs along the x-axis is the \u201coptimal range\u201d of an essential substance. The extent to which a metal is toxic or essential depends on its oxidation state and is speci\ufb01c to each metallic compound. Curve C is the classic noncancer doseeresponse curve. The steepness of the three curves represents the potency or severity of the toxicity. For example, curve C is steeper than curve A, so the adverse outcome (disease) caused by the chemical in curve C is more potent than that of the chemical in curve A. This simply means that the response rate is higher. However, if the diseases in question are cancer (curve A) and a relatively less important disease for curve C, such as short-lived headaches, the steepness simply represents a higher incidence of the disease, not greater importance. The shape and slope of the curve are formed according to available data. There are a number of uncertainties associated with these data.", "Often, the doseeresponse relationship is based on comparative biology from animal studies. These are usually high-dose, short-duration (at least compared to a human lifetime) studies. From these animal data, models are constructed and applied to estimate the doseeresponse that may be expected in humans. Thus, the curve may be separated into two regions: observed dose and modeled dose. When environmental exposures do not fall within the range of observation, extrapolations must be made to establish a dose relationship. Generally, extrapolations are made from high to low doses, from animal to human responses, and from one route of exposure to another. The \ufb01rst step in establishing a doseeresponse relationship is to assess the data from empirical observations. To complete the doseeresponse curve, extrapolations are made either by modeling or by employing a default procedure based on information of the chemical\u2019s biochemical characteristics. Doseeresponse models may biologically based with parameters calculated from curve-\ufb01tting of data. If data are suf\ufb01cient to support a biologically-based model speci\ufb01c to a chemical, and signi\ufb01cant resources are available, this is usually the model of choice. Biologically-based models require large amounts of data. Case-speci\ufb01c models employ model parameters and information gathered from studies speci\ufb01c to a particular chemical. Often, however, neither the biologically-based II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION FIGURE 7.4 The greater the potency or severity of response (i.e. steepness of the slope) of doseeresponse curve, the smaller the range of toxic response (90 percentile range shown in bottom graph). Also, note that both curves have thresholds and that curve B is less acutely toxic based on all three 7. AIR POLLUTANT HAZARDS 100 95% of dosed animals dead 95% of dosed animals dead reported lethal doses (LD5,LD50, and LD95). In fact, risk is calculated by multiplying the slope of the doseeresponse curve by the actual contact with the substance, i.e. expo sure. If either term is zero, the risk is zero. The risk of even the most toxic substance is zero if there is no exposure. If there is an extremely toxic substance on the planet Saturn, one\u2019s risk on the earth is zero. The risk will only increase if the substance \ufb01nds its way to the earth or if we \ufb01nd our way to Saturn. Indeed, when the \ufb01rst man walked on the Moon, he changed the exposure paradigm for the planet earth. Never before was it possible to be exposed to lunar sub stances. However, if the substance were brought to the earth within or on the spacecraft, what was a zero risk of lunar substances became greater than zero risk, not because the substance\u2019s inherent toxicity changed, but because the exposure to the substance increased from zero. Percent Mortality Percent Mortality 50 5% of dosed 5% of animals dosed dead animals dead 0 Dosage 100 AB 50 0 Curve A 90 percentile range nor the case-speci\ufb01c model is selected because the stateof-the-science is unsuf\ufb01cient, the necessary data are not available, or the signi\ufb01cant costs cannot be justi\ufb01ed. Curve \ufb01tting is another approach used to estimate doseeresponse relationships for chemicals. Such models are used when response data in the observed range are available. A so-called point of departure for extrapolation is estimated from the curve. The point of departure is a point that is either a data point or an estimated point that can be considered to be in the range of observation, without the need for much extrapolation. The dose at which 10% of the test organisms die (LD10)in Figure 7.4 conceptually represents the lower 95% con\ufb01dence limit on a dose associated with 10% extra risk. This is an example of such a point and, in fact, is often the standard LD5 LD50 LD95 LD5 LD50 LD95 Curve B 90 percentile range point of departure. Other hazard metrics are also used, e.g. estimates of increased adverse response, such as the ED10 (the estimate of a 10% increased response), which indicates a relative hazard and potency ranking. The policies of many regulatory agencies and international organizations treat cancer differently than non-cancer effects, particularly in how the doseeresponse curves are drawn. As discussed in the doseeresponse curves, there is no safe dose for carcinogens. Cancer doseeresponse curve is almost always a nonthreshold curve, i.e. no safe dose is expected, while, theoretically at least, noncancer outcomes can have a dose below which the adverse outcomes do not present themselves. So, for all other diseases, safe doses of compounds can be established. If the substance is inhaled, the safe II.", "THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION dose is known as the reference concentration (RfC). For other exposure pathways, it is the reference dose (RfD). These references are calculated from thresholds below which no adverse effect is observed in animal and human studies. If the models and data were perfect, the safe level would be the threshold, i.e. RfC \u00bc NOAEC. Incidentally, the term \u201cnoncancer\u201d has a completely different meaning than the term \u201canticancer\u201d or \u201canti-carcinogens\u201d. Anticancer procedures include radiation and drugs used to attack tumor cells. Anticarcinogens are chemical substances that work against the processes that lead to cancer, such as antioxidants and essential substances that help the body\u2019s immune, hormonal, and other systems to prevent carcinogenesis. Any hazard identi\ufb01cation or doseeresponse research is never perfect, which means that the data derived from these investigations are often beset with various forms of uncertainty. The chief reasons for this uncertainty include variability among the organisms and between nonhuman and human organisms being tested. Interspecies uncertainties are the result of differences in response to the compound by different species (e.g. one mammal may have decreased adrenal gland activity, while another may show thyroid effects). Although interspecies uncertainty is usually associated with chemical risk, these uncertainties can also be part of microbial data sets. For example, certain immunocompromised subpopulations may respond adversely to microbial exposures that are below thresholds for the general population. Another source of uncertainty occurs when studies only indicate the lowest concentration of a contaminant that causes the effect, i.e. the LOAEC, but the NOAEC is unknown. If the LOAECisused, oneislesscertain howclose this is to a safe level where no effect is expected. Often, there is temporal incongruence, since most of the studies take place in a shorter timeframe than in the real world. Thus, in lieu of long-term human studies, hazards and risks may have to be extrapolated from acute or subchronic studies of the same or similar agents. In a sense, dose replaces time (e.g. chronic exposure in a human over 30 years is estimated from high doses administered to hundreds of animals over a few months). Likewise, routes and pathways of exposure used to administer the agent to subjects may differ from the likely real-world exposures. For example, if the dose of substance in a research study is administered orally, but the pollutant is more likely to be inhaled by humans, this route-to-route extrapolation adds uncertainty. Finally, the hazard and exposure data themselves may be weak because the studies from which they have been gathered lack suf\ufb01cient quality or the precision, accuracy, completeness, and representativeness, or they may not be directly relevant to the risk assessment at hand. b LOAEC if NOAEC has not been established. The factors underlying the uncertainties are quanti\ufb01ed as speci\ufb01c uncertainty factors (UFs). The uncertainties in the RfD are largely due to the differences between results found in animal testing and expected outcomes in human population. As in other bioengineering operations, a factor of safety must be added to calculations to account for UFs. For air pollution risk analyses and assessments, the safe level is expressed in RfC, or in air the RfC. This is the dose or concentration below which regulatory agencies do not expect a speci\ufb01c unacceptable outcome. Thus, all the UFs adjust the actual measured levels of no effect (i.e. NOAECs and LOAECs) in the direction of a zero concentration. This is calculated as: NOAEC RfC \u00bc (7.1) UFinter UFintra UFother The \ufb01rst of the three types of uncertainty is the previously mentioned difference between the response to a pollutant in the species tested versus in Homo sapiens (UFinter). Humans may be more or less sensitive than the tested species to a particular compound. The second UF is associated with the fact that certain human subpopulations are more sensitive to the effects of a compound than the general human population. These are known as intraspecies uncertainty/variability factors (UFintra). The third type of uncertainties (UFother) results when the available data and science is lacking. The UFs are generally 10-fold, default factors used in operationally deriving the RfD and RfC from experimental data. The main classi\ufb01cations of UFs include: (1) accounting for variation in susceptibility among the members of the human population (i.e. intraspecies variability); (2) addressing the uncertainty in extrapolating animal data to humans (i.e. interspecies uncertainty); (3) accounting for the uncertainty in extrapolating from data obtained in a study with less-than-lifetime exposure (i.e. extrapolating from subchronic to chronic exposure); (4) uncertainty in extrapolating from an LOAEC rather than an NOAECdi.e.", "data show a dose at which an effect is observed, but the \u201cno effect\u201d threshold has to be extrapolated; and (5) accounting for the uncertainty associated with extrapolation when the database is incomplete.5 Since the NOAECb is the numerator and the UFs are in the denominator, the larger the uncertainty, the closer the safe concentration (i.e. RfC) is to zero. Note what occurs in Figure 7.5 as the UFs decrease, i.e. with better data and knowledge about the hazard. The UF values decrease. If all three UF values equal 1, i.e. complete certainty, the NOAEC and RfC become equal. Conversely, with very large uncertainties, the RfC approaches zero, i.e. the only \u201csafe\u201d dose is no dose. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 7. AIR POLLUTANT HAZARDS FIGURE 7.5 Reference concentrations (RfCs) on the noncancer doseeresponse curve (Figure 7.3), showing the movement of the RfC with improved scienti\ufb01c certainty. Adapted from Vallero DA. Environmental contaminants: assessment and control. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic Press; 2004. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) A hazard may be particularly severe for children, since they are growing and tissue development is much more proli\ufb01c than in older years. To address these sensitivities, the Food Quality Protection Act includes what is known as the \u201c10X\u201d rule. This rule requires that the RfD for products regulated under FQPS, e.g. pesticides, must include an additional factor of 10 of protection of infants, children, and females between the ages of 13 and 50 years. This factor is included in the RfD denominator along with the other three UF values. The RfD that includes the UFs and the 10X protection is known as the population-adjusted dose (PAD). A risk estimate that is less than 100% of the acute or chronic PAD does not exceed the regulatory agency\u2019s risk concern. An example of the use of an RfD as a factor of safety can be demonstrated by the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s reregistration process for the organophosphate pesticide, chlorpyrifos. The acute dietary scenario had an NOAEL of 0.5 mg kg 1day 1 and the three UF values equaled 100. Thus, the acute RfD \u00bc 5 10 3 mg kg 1day 1 but the more protective acute PAD \u00bc 5 10 4 mg kg 1day 1. The chronic dietary scenario is even more protective, since the exposure is long term. The chronic NOAEL was found distinction to be 0.03 mg kg 1day 1. Thus, the chronic RfD for chlorpyrifos \u00bc 3 10 4 mg kg 1day 1 and the more protective acute PAD \u00bc 5 10 5 mg kg 1day 1. Therefore, had the NOAEL threshold been used alone without the safety adjustment of the RfD, the allowable exposure would have been three orders of magnitude higher.6 7.3 AIR POLLUTION HAZARDS Every hazard mentioned thus far in this chapter can be an air pollution hazard. Chemicals and microbes can be airborne and reach receptors, causing diseases and other harm. Physical hazards can result from air pollution, such as increased incidence of melanoma due to larger ultraviolet light exposures as a result of air pollutants that \ufb01nd their way to the stratosphere and react with ozone. The Clean Air Act and other laws around the world make a distinction between hazardous air pollutants and criteria air pollutants. This distinction is a bit misleading, since all air pollutants are hazardous, i.e. they contain some potential for harm. The difference, as previously mentioned, is that \u201chazardous air pollutants\u201d cause or are suspected to cause cancer or other serious, chronic health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, as well as substantial adverse ecological damage. These substances are differentiated from the criteria air pollutants, which are widespread air pollutants reasonably expected to harm the public health or welfare. Criteria pollutants are commonly used to indicate overall ambient air quality, based on common standards; whereas hazardous air pollutants are usually restricted spatially to \u201chot spots\u201d, such as industrial and urban areas. These distinctions are drawn further in the following sections. 7.4 AIR TOXICS Hazardous air pollutants are often called \u201cair toxics\u201d. The US EPA is required to control 187 hazardous air pollutants listed in Table 7.2. They are found in numerous settings, such as benzene in gasoline, perchloroethlyenec (\u201cperc\u201d) in dry cleaning, and methylene chloride in paint strippers.", "Most air toxics are anthropogenic, emitted from both stationary and mobile sources, as well as in local microenvironments, e.g. in indoor air pollutants from building materials, solvents, and cleaning products. A number of air toxics are also released from indoor sources (e.g. some building materials and cleaning solvents). c The pre\ufb01x \u201cper\u201d means that a compound contains the maximum about possible of an element. In this case, perchloroethylene is the result of complete substitution of the four H atoms of the ethylene molecule with four Cl atoms. Thus, it is also known as tetrachloroethylene. II.

A joint resolution to remove hydrogen sul\ufb01de, which was inadvertently included in the original Section 112(b)(1) list, was passed by the Senate on August 1, 1991 (Congressional Record page S11799), and the House of Representatives on November 25, 1991 (Congressional Record pages H11217H11219). The Joint Resolution was approved by the President on December 4, 1991. Hydrogen sul\ufb01de is included in Section 112(r) and is subject to the accidental release provisions. For all listings above that contain the word \u201ccompounds\u201d and for glycol ethers, the following applies: unless otherwise speci\ufb01ed, these listings are de\ufb01ned as including any unique chemical substance that contains the named chemical (i.e. antimony, arsenic, etc.) as part of that chemical\u2019s infrastructure. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 7. AIR POLLUTANT HAZARDS A few air toxics are also released from natural sources such as volcanic eruptions and forest \ufb01res.7 For example, a recent study in South Queensland, Australia, found that 61.2% of the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in that region came from biogenic sources (e.g. releases from tree leaves) and another 5.7% from bush \ufb01res and biomass burning.8 Several air toxics are VOCs; their relatively high vapor pressures (usually > 0.01 kPa) mean that they are likely to be found in the troposphere. Stationary air toxic sources include industrial factories, re\ufb01neries, and fossil fuel-burning electric generating facilities, and are categorized as either major or area sources. \u0081 \u201cMajor\u201d sources emit at least 10 tons per year of any of the listed toxic air pollutants, or at least 25 tons per year of a mixture of air toxics. \u0081 \u201cArea\u201d sources are smaller facilities that emit less than 10 tons per year of a single air toxic or less than 25 tons per year of a combination of air toxics. The major problem with area sources is that even small amounts of very toxic compounds become increasingly hazardous with increasing numbers of sources, i.e. the cumulative increase in hazard due to the collective emissions of air toxics.9 The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) also included the means to address the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Section 112 requires that the US Environmental Protection Agency work with state, local, and tribal governments to reduce releases of these speci\ufb01c toxic air pollutants. 7.4.1 Maximum Available Control Technology After the 1990 amendments to the CAA, the U.S. EPA published a list of source categories and issued Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for each category over a speci\ufb01ed timetable. The next step after MACT standards is now underway. This is to address chronic health risks that would still be expected if the sources meet these standards. This is known as residual risk reduction. The \ufb01rst step was to assess the health risks from air toxics emitted by stationary sources that emit air toxics after technology-based (MACT) standards are in place. The residual risk provision sets additional standards if MACT does not protect public health with an \u201cample margin of safety\u201d, as well as additional standards if they are needed to prevent adverse environmental effects. The \u201cample margin of safety\u201d applies to airborne carcinogens (see Figure 7.6). Best available and maximum available control technologies are not necessarily risk based. The difference between using these technologies and the risk posed by the remaining air pollution is known as \u201cresidual risk\u201d. That is, if a source can demonstrate that it will not contribute to a de\ufb01ned risk goal (e.g. <10 6 cancer risk), then this may provide an ample margin of safety requirements for that particular air toxic. The ample margin might also apply to noncancer toxins, such as neurotoxins. This would involve the application of the hazard quotient (HQ).", "The HQ is the ratio of the potential exposure to the substance and the level at which no adverse effects are expected. An HQ < 1 means that the exposure levels to a chemical should not lead to adverse health effects. Conversely, an HQ > 1 means that adverse health effects are possible. Due to uncertainties and the feedback that is coming from the business and scienti\ufb01c communities, the ample margin of safety threshold is presently ranging from HQ \u00bc 0.2e1.0. So, if a source can demonstrate that it will not contribute to greater than the threshold (whether it is 0.2, 1.0, or some other level established by the federal government) for noncancer risk, it meets the ample margin of safety requirements for air toxics. 7.4.2 Coke Oven Emissions: A Complex Hazardous Air Pollutant Class The air toxics list in the United States includes many more compounds than the listing in Table 7.3 may imply. For example, the list includes coke oven emissions.10ae10f Coke is a solid fuel widely used in heavy industry, e.g. steel and other metal processing. Coke is produced by 10\u20136 10\u20134 Increasing populaon risk FIGURE 7.6 Ample margin of safety to protect public health and adverse environmental effects from an air pollutant.

Washington, DC; 2013. the pyrolysis of coal, i.e. by blending and heating bituminous coals to 1000 e 1400 C in the absence of oxygen. This drives off the most volatile compounds (those with the highest vapor pressures), leaving a much purer fuel than the original coal. However, from an air pollution perspective, it is this large fraction of volatile compounds that are the major concern. Coke oven emissions include both vapor and aerosol phases, i.e. they are determined by measuring the benzene-soluble fraction of total particulate matter (PM) generated during coke production. Tars and light oils are distilled out of the coal, and gases are generated during this process. The emissions contain varying amounts of mixtures of particles, vapors, and gases that typically include organic compounds, such as phenol and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), VOCs (e.g. acrolein, aliphatic aldehydes, and formaldehyde), as well as inorganic compounds (e.g. ammonia, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides). The emissions also include metals (e.g. cadmium, arsenic, and mercury) and their compounds.11 Thus, the single coke oven emission chemical listing includes many different compounds that make up coal tar, creosote, and coal tar pitch. As much as 1.6 million kg of coke oven emissions are generated annually in the United States.12 Byproducts are collected in most coke-making operations, so the volatile compounds generally do not exit through the stack. However, the pollutants escape at various points in the coking process through openings due to structural defects around the doors or charging lids, improper controls, poor operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment, and operator error. 13 Coke oven emissions include more than 60 organic compounds, notably more than 40 PAHs. One metric ton of coal yields approximately 545e635 kg (1200 to 1400 lb) of coke, 45e90 kg (100e200 lb) of coke breeze (large coke particulates), 7e9 kg (15e20 lb) of ammonum sulfate, 27.5e34 l (7.3e9.8 gal) of coke oven gas tar, 55e135 l (14.5e35.7 gal) of ammonia liquor, and 8e12.5 l (2.1e3.3 gal) of light oil.", "About 20e35% of the initial coal charge is emitted as gases and vapors, most of which are collected in by-product coke production. Coke oven gas includes hydrogen, methane, ethane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ethylene, propylene, butylene, acetylene, hydrogen sul\ufb01de, ammonia, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coke oven gas tar includes pyridine, tar acids, naphthalene, creosote oil, and coal tar pitch. Benzene, xylene, toluene, and solvent naphthas may be extracted from the light oil fraction. The chronic human health effects of coke oven emissions include disorders of the skin, respiratory, liver, and digestive systems. Human and animal data indicate that exposure to coke oven emissions leads to cancer of the lung, trachea, bronchus, kidney, prostate, and other sites. Indeed, these emissions are classi\ufb01ed as known human carcinogens14 (see Figure 7.7). 7.5 CRITERIA POLLUTANTS The ambient air\u2019s concentrations of the criteria pollutants, i.e. PM, tropospheric ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead, indicate the quality of the air in a region. The hazards posed by each are discussed below. 7.5.1 Particulate Matter Particle pollution includes inhalable coarse particles, with aerodynamic diameters >2.5 mmbut <10 mmand \ufb01ne particles with diameters 2.5 mm. PM varies in size and shape (see Chapter 3). Primary particles are emitted directly from a source, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, \ufb01elds, smokestacks, or \ufb01res. Secondary II.

Concentration (mg m\u22123) 1 0.1 particles are generated by reactions in the atmosphere between sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, and other compounds. Most \ufb01ne PM are secondary particles. Smaller diameter particles pose the greatest human health problems, as they penetrate deeply into lungs. Ecosystem hazards include decreased visibility due to haze caused by \ufb01ne particles. 7.5.2 Tropospheric Ozone The mix of VOCs and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) reacting in sunlight (i.e. photochemical reactions) leads to the formation of ozone (O3). These reactions occur in the lowest layer of the atmosphere, i.e. the troposphere. Since humans and other organisms live and breathe in the troposphere, ground-level ozone presents health problems in humans and causes damage to vegetation and wildlife. Regulatory, advisory numbersb NIOSH REL (coke oven emissions) (0.5 \u2013 0.7 mg m\u22123) OSHA PEL, ACGIH TLV (coal tarpitch volatiles) (0.2 mg m\u22123) (0.15 mg m\u22123) Lung intake of elevated concentrations of O3 in air makes it dif\ufb01cult to breathe deeply and vigorously, leading to coughing, shortness of breath, and pain when taking a deep breath. These are short-term (acute) problems. Longer term problems include in\ufb02ammation and damage to airways and lungs, leading to asthma, emphysema, bronchitis, and other chronic respiratory diseases. Increasing ambient O3 concentrations are associated with an increase in the frequency of asthma attacks, as well as increased susceptibility to infections. Lung damage may continue after symptoms subside.15 Although most incidents of elevated O3 occur as urban smog on warm, sunny days, the pollutant can also be transported advectively (i.e. with the movement of an air mass) from one region to another. Thus, O3 levels can be elevated in areas of cooler, overcast regions if it is transported from where the pollutant was produced. Local communities use air quality indices (AQIs) to warn residents of possible health conditions. These are II.", "THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 7.5 CRITERIA POLLUTANTS of this book.) reported online and in media, e.g. newspaper (see Figure 7.8). In the summer, for example, the AQI can be strongly in\ufb02uenced by ozone concentrations. For example, on June 18, 2013, an area east of Palm Springs, California, reported an AQI value for ozone of 111, with a forecast for nearby San Bernardino of 137 the following day (see Figure 7.8(B)). Both scores are considered to be unhealthy for sensitive groups. 7.5.3 Nitrogen Dioxide and Oxides of Nitrogen Nitrogen will be discussed in detail in Chapter 22. Nitrogen is a part of three of the six criteria pollutants, i.e. PM, NO2, and O3. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)isa criteria pollutant under National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Although the sum of nitric oxide (NO) and NO2 is commonly called nitrogen oxides or NOx, other oxides of nitrogen including nitrous acid and nitric acid are included in the oxides of nitrogen category. In addition, oxides of nitrogen play a major role in the formation of PM, when NOx reacts with ammonia and other compounds in the presence of water vapor to form \ufb01ne aerosols. From the perspective of direct health effects, NO2 is the NOx compound of greatest concern. Short-term exposure to NO2 (i.e. <24 h) can lead to respiratory effects, such as increased number and severity of asthma episodes and airway in\ufb02ammation in healthy individuals. Inhalation of elevated short-term NO2 concentrations has been associated with increased hospital emergency room visits for respiratory distress.16 Driversandotherswhospendtimeonornearmajorroadwayscanexperienceshort-termNO2 exposures considerably higher than measured by the current network. Approximately 16% of US housing units are located within 300 ft of a major highway, railroad, or airport (approximately 48 million people). This population likely includes a higher proportion of nonwhite and economically disadvantaged people. Exposure to II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 7. AIR POLLUTANT HAZARDS elevated NO2 concentrations near roadwaysd is of particular concern for susceptible individuals, including people with asthma, children, and the elderly. Thus, near-road environments present environmental justice issues, as well as threats to vulnerable populations. 7.5.4 Sulfur Dioxide and Oxides of Sulfur Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a criteria pollutant under NAAQS in the United States. Exposure to SO2 can lead to health effects. SO2 and other oxides of sulfur form acids in the atmosphere, especially sulfuric acid (H2SO4) which is a key component of acid rain. SO2 also causes crop and material damage when acidic aerosols (liquid and solid) are deposited. These result from oxides of sulfur in stack emissions followed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Controlling emissions of SO2 and other oxides of sulfur (SOx) provides an example of the need to think systematically about air pollutants. One solution following the passage of the CAA of 1970 in the United States was to increase the height of stacks, so that the sulfur compounds would not deposit near the source. Certain industrial operations emit SOx, particularly those using sulfur-laden fuels for combustion processes. Notably sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a respiratory irritant, damages crops (foliar stress), and causes visibility problems, especially when sulfate particulates are suspended in the atmosphere. In the middle of the twentieth century, damage to crops was seen near facilities, like power plants. The paint of vehicles parked in the facilities\u2019 lots was commonly oxidized and damaged. People living near the facilities complained of respiratory problems and crop damage. Thus, a seemingly rational engineering solution was to increase the height of the stacks emitting SO2. Historically, the biggest decline in sulfur pollution was achieved simply by dispersion of pollutants from increasingly taller stacks (i.e. point of release is higher, so there is greater three-dimensional dispersion of the pollutant).17 In fact, this seemed to work so well in terms of local crop and material damage, that when the Clean Air Act of 1970 required states to develop plans to meet the new standards, some states required that tall stacks at certain facilities to dilute the local concentrations of SO2,as well as oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Unfortunately, the taller stacks did more than disperse and dilute these pollutants. They allowed them to be captured by winds aloft and to reach higher regions of the troposphere. Moving advectively in these air streams, the pollutants can be transported long distances (hundreds and even thousands of kilometers). After release from mid-Western coal-\ufb01red power plants, the pollutants had suf\ufb01cient time and atmospheric conditions, particularly the presence of water vapor, to generate acids.", "Thus, the taller stacks became a contributing factor to the acid rain problems in Northeastern states, Canada and Europe. 7.5.5 Carbon Monoxide Carbon monoxide (CO) is a product of incomplete combustion. Carbon monoxide elicits various health effects by binding and interfering with heme proteins (See Chapter 10). The amount of CO bound to hemoglobin as carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) is the key marker for health effects. The best studied health effect associated with CO levels of concern is reduced oxygen availability (i.e. hypoxia) as a result of the blood\u2019s increased COHb concentrations. That is, when COHb forms, it displaces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and decreases the release of oxygen to tissues. Vulnerable populations, e.g. persons with impaired cardiovascular systems are at greater risk to this hazard than the general public. Other potential effects include damage to the central nervous system, reproduction and prenatal development, and the respiratory system. Of course, at suf\ufb01ciently high concentrations, exposures to CO can be fatal. 7.5.6 Lead The principal direct hazard from Pb exposure is neurotoxicity. However, the original reason for removing lead (Pb) from gasoline is that it fouled catalytic converters, which presented an indirect smog hazard as a result of higher ambient concentrations of oxides of nitrogen and VOCs than would not have been released if Pb were absent in the fuel. Measures that were put in place to prevent the use of lead gasoline d According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, NO2 concentrations in vehicles and near roadways are generally much higher than average measurements. In-vehicle concentrations can be two to three times higher than measured at nearby area-wide monitors. Within 50 m of roadways, concentrations of NO2 have been found to be 30e100% higher than at upwind locations. Thus, Individuals who spend time on or near major roadways can experience elevated short-term NO2 exposures. Approximately 16% of US housing units are located within 300 ft of a major highway, railroad, or airport (approximately 48 million people). Near-roadway neighborhoods have greater numbers of nonwhite and economically disadvantaged people than the US average. Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2013). Nitrogen oxide. http://www.epa.gov/oaqps001/nitrogenoxides/index.html; [accessed 01.10.13]. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION in vehicles equipped with catalytic converters worked well. To meet mobile source emission standards beginning in the 1970s, older vehicles were continuously being replaced by newer ones that burned only lead-free gasoline. In addition to helping to lower atmospheric concentrations of criteria air contaminants, measurements of near-road environments also began to show a precipitous decline in Pb concentrations in soil and air. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported a 78% decrease in mean blood lead levels from 12.8 to 2.8 mgdl 1 between the 5-year period from 1976 to 1980 and the 5-year period from 1988 to 1991.18a,18b This drop in blood lead levels has been attributed to the reduction of leaded gasoline and to the removal of lead from soldered cans. The removal of Pb from gasoline in the \ufb01rst place to address CO, NOx, and hydrocarbons, not Pb per se, was a fortuitous in decreasing Pb emissions in the air and the concomitant decrease in Pb in blood. This chain of events led to the addition of Pb as the sixth criteria air pollutant in 1978. The current NAAQS standard for lead is 1.5 mgm 3, maximum arithmetic mean during a calendar quarter.19 In 1985, US federal mandates began to require reductions in the lead content of gasoline. The standard for lead content in gasoline was 0.1 g Pb gal 1 on January 1, 1986, with the complete ban on Pb in gasoline effective January 1, 1996. The hazardous and criteria pollutants are discussed in greater detail in later chapters, including their health effects and methods of measuring and treating them. Chapter 8 provides information and examples of how to combine the hazard information with exposure estimates to characterize risk. QUESTIONS 1. What is a criteria air pollutant? 2.

II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8 Air Pollutant Exposures 8.1 EXPOSURE Thus far, we have considered hazard, which is half of what needs to be known to determine risk. As indicated in Figures II.1 and II.2, a complete characterization of the risk needs to be a complement of both the hazard of the pollutant and the extent and intensity of exposure of a receptor to the pollutant. The dominant focus of air pollution prevention and control has been on human health. There is no clear consensus on the meaning of many risk assessment terms, and exposure assessment is one of those where researchers, engineers, and the general public use varying de\ufb01nitions. One de\ufb01nition of exposure assessment tracks closely with that of the World Health Organization (WHO): The process of estimating or measuring the magnitude, frequency and duration of exposure to an agent, along with the number and characteristics of the population exposed. Ideally, it describes the sources, pathways, routes, and the uncertainties in the assessment.1 Unfortunately, the de\ufb01nition twice embeds the word being de\ufb01ned, i.e. exposure. Again, tracking with the WHO de\ufb01nition, a good working de\ufb01nition within the realm of air pollution is: The contact between an agent and a target. Such contact occurs at an exposure surface over an exposure period.1 Exposure scientists characterize and predict the contact of an agent with a receptor for a speci\ufb01c duration of time.2 This exposure is quanti\ufb01able. An air pollutant is an example of an agent, but it may be any chemical, biological, or physical entity that contacts a receptor, i.e. a biological entity that receives an exposure or dose. The contact between an agent and a receptor occurs at an exposure surface over an exposure period. An exposure surface is the surface on a receptor where an agent is present. Examples of exposure surfaces include the exterior of the skin and eyeball, as well as a virtual outer surface, such as the interface surface over the nose and open mouth. Virtual surfaces are not physical surfaces, but are two-dimensional areas across which the \ufb02ux of an agent traverses. Examples of inner exposure surfaces include the linings of the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and urinary tract. Many of the features of exposure apply to organisms other than humans and even systems of organism, e.g. ecosystems and their subdivisions. When a receptor is exposed to a speci\ufb01c agent or stressor from all sources across all routes and pathways, it is known as an aggregate exposure. For example, if a person is exposed to lead (Pb) by ingesting food and breathing air, this is an aggregate Pb exposure. The total exposure to multiple agents and/or stressors that causes a common toxic effect to human health by the same, or similar, sequence of major biochemical events is known as a cumulative exposure. For example, if a population is exhibiting neurological effects, it could be due to cumulative exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), Pb, mercury (Hg), and other neurotoxic substances. The exposures would be via inhalation, ingestion of food and nonfood substances, dermal contact through the skin, and nasal exposures almost directly to the brain. Exposure assessment is the process of characterizing, estimating, measuring, and modeling the magnitude, frequency, and duration of contact with an agent as well as the number and characteristics of the population exposed. The assessment must consider not only the concentrations of an agent in the air and other media but also the factors related to human behavior and characteristics that help to determine an individual\u2019s exposure to an agent. These are known as exposure factors. An exposure pathway is the course taken by an agent from the source to the receptor. The exposure route is the way an agent enters a receptor after contact (e.g. by ingestion, inhalation, dermal application). The time Fundamentals of Air Pollution 215 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00007-4 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 8. AIR POLLUTANT EXPOSURES of continuous contact between the agent and receptor is known as the exposure duration. Exposure can be envisaged as a number of steps after an agent has been released into the environment and before it elicits harm. This is a source-to-outcome framework (Figure 8.1). Agents are released into the environment from a source.", "The actual exposure can be to the emitted air pollutant or a different compound that has been transformed by the environment. Contaminants or their transformation products move through the atmosphere and other compartments in the environment and can be found in many types of environmental media. Exposure results from the transfer of a contaminant from an environmental medium to a receptor. An exposure becomes a dose when the contaminant is taken up into the receptor. The endpoint for exposure science is the dose received endogenous site where the adverse health effect can occur. For example, the exposure endpoint for a neurological agent is the central or peripheral nervous system, whereas the exposure endpoint for a respiratory agent is the lung and/or other sites in the respiratory system. This endpoint serves as the starting point for the health effects discussed in the next chapters.3 As mentioned, an exposure is any contact between a receptor and an agent. The receptor can be human, other species, ecosystems, or even inanimate objects, e.g. buildings and monuments (see Chapter 15). For chemical and biological agents, this contact can come about from a number of exposure pathways (e.g. air, water, and soil) and routes (e.g. inhalation, ingestion, dermal, nasal). Physical agents, such as ionizing, ultraviolet (UV), and electromagnetic radiation, may also come in contact via these pathways, but the exposure often has to be extrapolated from the energy that the radiation imparts to tissues. The absorbed dose is the amount of energy absorbed per unit weight of tissue. One gray dose is equivalent to 1 J radiation energy absorbed per kilogram of organ or tissue weight. For chemicals, dose is the amount of agent that enters a target organ within a speci\ufb01ed period of time after crossing a contact boundary. An exposure does not necessarily lead to a biologically effective dose. Conversely, there can be no dose without an exposure. Thus, the chemical undergoes two steps. First, the receptor is exposed, i.e. comes into contact with the agent. Next, an agent entering the body may or may not \ufb01nd its way to the target organ. The exposure process begins with the release of a substance. As mentioned, the substance may be an air pollutant when it is released or it may become one during its path toward the receptor. Thus, there are three possibilities after release: (1) an air pollutant is released and remains an air pollutant when it reaches the receptor; (2) a nontoxic substance is released but due to physical, chemical, and biological conditions in the atmosphere is transformed into an air pollutant; and (3) an air pollutant is released but due to physical, chemical, and biological conditions in the atmosphere is transformed into a nontoxic substance. Although its FIGURE 8.1 Source-to-dose continuum. Exposure occurs after an agent is released into the environment until an adverse effect occurs (e.g. disease and disruption).

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, adapted from National Research Council. 1997. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION primary pathway is air, the pollutant may spend time in other environmental compartments like surface waters and soil before becoming re-entrained in the air and reaching the receptor. The primary route of air pollutant exposure is inhalation, but other routes are often involved. For example, suspended dust may be inhaled, but settled dust may be ingested when it deposits on food, or semivolatile air pollutants may sorb to surfaces whereupon a person\u2019s skin, eyes, and nose come into contact with what was previously an air pollutant. Historically, air pollution exposure has often been assumed to be proportional to the chemical concentration of the pollutant. Certainly, if the chemical concentration is zero, there is no exposure. However, the concentration of the pollutant must always be combined with a person\u2019s activity pattern to determine the magnitude, frequency, and duration of the exposure. The amount of pollutant that crosses an absorption barrier (e.g. skin, lungs, and gut) is known as the absorbed dose.", "Following absorption, the chemical is distributed by the circulatory and other systems to various sites in the organism where it will be metabolized to obtain energy and to build cells. A substance may completely avoid metabolism, become less toxic, or become more toxic as a result of biochemical reactions. When the parent compound or its metabolites interact with a target tissue, this is the dose that leads to the adverse health outcome (e.g. headache, lung damage, liver damage, or cancer).4 Populations can be exposed. Individuals can be exposed. The science and statistics needed to estimate and predict exposures varies by the receptor of interest, That is, very different methods are needed to determine the extent to which a population is exposed versus one of its subpopulation\u2019s exposures versus an individual\u2019s personal exposure. Thus, exposure science must take into account every step of the life cycle of an air pollutant from its source to its ultimate fate (i.e. a target organ, e.g. liver). Exposure results from sequential and parallel processes in the environment, from release to environmental partitioning to movement through pathways to uptake and fate in the organism (see Figure 8.2). The substances often change to other chemical species as a result of the body\u2019s metabolic and detoxi\ufb01cation processes. Thus, the air pollutant emitted from a stack, II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8. AIR POLLUTANT EXPOSURES tailpipe, or other source may very well not be the chemical compound of exposure. The transformation products, i.e. the new substances, can be degradation products from abiotic processes (e.g. hydrolysis, redox, and photolysis) or metabolites that occur in the exposed organisms that are produced as their cells use the parent compounds as food and energy sources. Metabolism may also occur among different organisms, such as when bacteria and other microbes convert air pollutants, e.g. one species may be exposed and in turn metabolizes the parent compound into compounds with different chemical properties. Humans will then be exposed to these newly formed compounds, which may be more toxic and/or more readily bioaccumulated than the parent compounds. Mercury, for example, is a highly toxic air pollutant, causing neurological and other health effects. However, like other metals the form of Hg determines its toxicity and ability to accumulate in tissue. Mercury is present in trace concentrations in coal, but so much coal is burned that coal-\ufb01red power generation contributes at least 60% of all Hg emissions. Since mercury is readily vaporized during combustion, there is a direct correlation of Hg concentrations in \ufb02ue gas with the precombustion Hg concentrations in coal. A recent study5 at one power plant in China found that coal Hg content of about 10 mgkg 1 correlated with Hg emissions of about 2 mgm 3,150 mgkg 1 correlated with Hg emissions of about 10 mgm 3, 250 mgkg 1 correlated with Hg emissions of about 20 mgm 3, and, 400 mgkg 1 correlated with Hg emissions of about 27 mgm 3. The actual emissions will vary depending on the type of coal (e.g. anthracite releases greater Hg concentrations than does bituminous, when normalized), as well as combustion conditions, such as the amount and types of catalysts and \ufb02y ash concentrations. However, these and other studies show a direct correlation between Hg concentrations in fuel and Hg emission rates. When combusted, Hg in the coal vaporizes and is released as elemental mercury (Hg0). Even before leaving the stack, however, the Hg again changes forms as it is oxidized in the hot \ufb02ue gases, which contain acidic compounds (e.g. hydrochloric acid (HCl)) and oxides (e.g. sulfur dioxide (SO2)) that can react heterogeneously on particulate matter (\ufb02y ash) thermochemically.5 This changes some of mercury\u2019s valence to 2\u00fe, but some Hg0 and Hg aerosols may also be present in varying proportions. When organisms come into contact with the Hg, they will often alkylate the Hg into organic forms (e.g. dimethyl mercury). These organic forms are often much more toxic with greater bioaccumulation potentials. For example, anaerobic or facultative bacteria may reduce the oxidized Hg in methylated forms, which accumulates in the food chain. So, recent concerns about \ufb01sh and shell\ufb01sh mercury contamination is likely more of an air pollution than a water pollution problem, even though the exposure pathway is food and the exposure route is ingestion of the food. Physical agents, such as electromagnetic radiation, UV light, and noise, do not follow this pathway exactly.", "Contact with these sources of energy can elicit a physiological response that may generate endogenous chemical changes that behave somewhat like the metabolites discussed earlier. For example, UV light may in\ufb01ltrate and damage skin cells. UV light helps to promote skin tumor formation by activating the transcription factor complex activator protein-1 (AP-1) and enhancing the expression of the gene that produces the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2). Noise, i.e. acoustical energy, can also elicit physiological responses that affect an organism\u2019s chemical messaging systems, i.e. endocrine, immune, and neural systems. The exposure pathway also includes the manner in which humans and other organisms can come into contact with the agent. The pathway has \ufb01ve parts: 1. The source of contamination (e.g. release from stack or vent). 2. An environmental medium and transport mechanism (e.g. pharmaceutical substrate or soil with water moving through it). 3. A point of exposure (such as a well used for drinking water). 4. A route of exposure (e.g. inhalation, dietary ingestion, nondietary ingestion, dermal contact, and nasal). 5. A receptor population (those who are actually exposed or who are where there is a potential for exposure). If all \ufb01ve parts are present, the exposure pathway is known as a completed exposure pathway. The exposure may be short-term, intermediate, or long-term. Short-term contact, also known as an acute exposure, occurs as a single event or for only a short period of time (up to 14 days). An intermediate exposure is one that lasts from 14 days to less than 1 year. Long-term or chronic exposures are greater than 1 year in duration. Determining the exposure for a neighborhood can be complicated. For example, even if all the contaminants of concern and its possible source are properly identi\ufb01ed, the extent to which the receptor population has come into contact with these contaminants (steps 2 through 4) may be highly uncertain. Thus, assessing exposure involves not only the physical sciences but also the social sciences, e.g. psychology and behavioral sciences. People\u2019s activities greatly affect the amount and type of exposures. That is why exposure scientists use a number of techniques to establish activity patterns, such as asking potentially exposed individuals to keep diaries, videotaping, and using telemetry to monitor vital information, e.g. heart and ventilation rates. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION General ambient measurements, such as those obtained using air pollution monitoring equipment located throughout cities, are often not good indicators of actual population exposures. For example, metals and their compounds comprise the greatest mass of toxic substances released into the US environment. This is largely due to the large volume and surface areas involved in metal extraction and re\ufb01ning operations. However, this does not necessarily mean that more people will be exposed at higher concentrations or more frequently to these compounds than to others. A substance that is released or even that resides in the ambient environment is not tantamount to its coming in contact with a receptor. Conversely, even a small amount of a substance under the right circumstances can lead to very high levels of exposure (e.g. handling raw materials and residues). A study by the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory demonstrates the importance of not simply assuming that the released or even background concentrations are a good indicator of actual exposure.6 The researchers were interested in how sorption may affect microenvironments, so they set up a chamber constructed of typical building materials and furnished with actual furniture like that found in most residential settings. A number of air pollutants were released into the room and monitored (see Figure 8.3). With the chamber initially sealed, the observed decay of xylene, a volatile organic compound (VOC), in vapor phase concentrations results from adsorption onto surfaces (walls, furniture, etc.). The adsorption continues for hours, with xylene concentrations reaching a quasisteady state. At this point the chamber was \ufb02ushed with clean air to free the vapor phase xylene. The xylene concentrations shortly after the \ufb02ush began to rise again Gas phase xylene concentration (\u03bcg l\u20131) 400 300 200 100 0 until reaching a new steady state. This rise must be the result of desorption of the previously sorbed xylene, since the initial source is gone. Sorption is one of the biochemodynamic processes that must be considered to account for differences in the temporal pattern of microenvironmental (e.g. occupational) and ambient concentrations. The simplest quantitative expression of exposure is: 1 E \u00bc Dt (8.1) where E \u00bc human exposure during the time period, t", "[units of concentration (mass per volume) per time] (mg (kg-day) 1) D \u00bc mass of pollutant per body mass (mg kg 1) t \u00bc time (day) Usually, to obtain D the chemical concentration of a pollutant is measured near the interface of the person and the environment, during a speci\ufb01ed time period. This measurement is sometimes referred to as the potential dose (i.e. the chemical has not yet crossed the boundary into the body, but is present where it may enter the person, such as on the skin, at the mouth, or at the nose). Expressed quantitatively, exposure is a function of the concentration of the agent and time. It is an expression of the magnitude and duration of the contact. That is, exposure to a contaminant is the concentration of that contact in a medium integrated over the time of contact: t\u00bct2 Z E \u00bc C\u00f0t\u00dedt (8.2) t\u00bct1 where, E \u00bc exposure during the time period from t1 to t2 and C(t) \u00bc concentration at the interface between the organism and the environment, at time t. Since the amount of a chemical agent that penetrates from the ambient atmosphere into a control volume affects the concentration term of the exposure equation, a complete mass balance of the contaminant must be understood and accounted for; otherwise exposure estimates will be incorrect. The mass balance consists of all inputs and outputs, as well as chemical changes to the contaminant: Accumulation or loss of contaminant A FIGURE 8.3 Concentrations of xylene measured in its vapor \u00bc Mass of A transported in phase in a chamber sealed during adsorption and desorption Mass of A transported out Reactions (8.3) periods. Ref. 6. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8. AIR POLLUTANT EXPOSURES Often the reaction term is considered a loss term, i.e. only a negative sign. This assumes that there are no other compounds in the control volume. However, the reactions may be either those that generate substance A (i.e. sources) or those that destroy substance A (i.e. sinks). For example, if contaminant A is a hydrocarbon, it may actually be produced in the control volume by larger organic compounds degrading to this simpler hydrocarbon. Thus, the amount of mass transported in is the in\ufb02ow to the system that includes pollutant discharges, transfer from other control volumes, and other media (e.g. if the control volume is a cubic meter parcel of air, additional mass of the pollutant may enter the parcel from adjacent parcels of soil; water and biota outdoors; and painted walls, carpet, and adjacent rooms indoors). The contributed mass of chemical A, therefore, may come from adjacent sources and the formation of chemical A by abiotic chemistry and biological transformation. Conversely, the out\ufb02ow is the mass transported out of the control volume, which includes uptake, by biota; transfer to other compartments (e.g. volatilization to the atmosphere); and abiotic and biological degradation of chemical A. Thus, the rate of change of mass in a control volume is equal to the rate of chemical A transported in less the rate of chemical A transported out, plus the rate of production from sources, and minus the rate of elimination by sinks. Stated as a differential equation, the rate of change for contaminant A is: d\u00bdAd\u00bdAd d\u00bdA \u00bc v$ \u00fe G$ r (8.4) dt dx dx dx where v \u00bc \ufb02uid velocity t0 t compound exiting the control volume is decreased by x the amount of reactivity. This is usually true for the parent compound, although some may be generated in the control volume by the synthesis and degradation of other simpler and larger compounds, respectively. However, it is important to keep in mind that these mass balance equations are only providing information about the parent compound and not the compounds created. Each of these has its own control volume with its own unique mass balance equation, e.g. if chemical A0 is produced during the r process for chemical A, its mass balance would be: d\u00bdA0 d\u00bdA0 dd\u00bdA0 \u00bc v$ \u00fe G$ r (8.5) dt dx dx dx These equations would occur for each compound generated, either from the parent compound A or from its degradation products and their own degradation products as shown in Figure 8.4. These processes occur in the atmosphere and other environmental media, as well as within an organism. Those that occur within an organism are known as pharmacokinetics.", "The pharmacokinetic mass balance equations are often accompanied by enzymes, i.e. biological catalysts, and other biochemical and biomechanical processes, such as the distribution of the chemical from one organ to another in the body or clearance from the blood (i.e. half-life, t1/2). Another challenge of the r term is that reactive compounds can be particularly dif\ufb01cult to measure. For example, many VOCs in the air can be measured by \ufb01rst collecting air in stainless-steel canisters and analyzed by chromatography in the laboratory. However, some of these compounds, like the carbonyls (notably aldehydes like formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) are prone to react inside the canister, meaning that by the time the sample is analyzed a portion of the carbonyls are degraded (under-reported). Therefore, other methods must be used when sampling for reactive vapors, such as trapping the compounds with dinitrophenylhydrazine-treated silica gel tubes that are frozen until being extracted for chromatographic analysis. The purpose of the measurement is to see what is in the air, water, soil, sediment, or biota at the Time within control volume FIGURE 8.4 Hypothetical degradation of parent compound A and its degradation products, A0 and A00 . As compound A degrades in the control volume, the mass of its degradation product, compound A0 increases. However, A0 has its own degradation product A00 . The mass of A00 increases as it is produced by the degradation of A0.At tx, the mass of A has almost reached steady state and the mass of A0 begins to decline at the expense of A00 . This illustrates that the reaction variable in mass balance equations applies only to each compound at a speci\ufb01c time within the control volume.

EDA \u00bc ethylenediamine time of sampling, so any reaction before the analysis gives measurement error. Remember that the chemical that is released may or may not be the one that ultimately needs to be measured. If the released chemical is reactive, some or all of it may have changed into another form (i.e. speciated) by the time it is measured. Even relatively nonreactive compounds may speciate between when the sample is collected (e.g. in a water sample, an air canister, a soil core, or a bag) and when the sample is analyzed. Infact, each contaminant has unique characteristics which vary according thetypeofmedia in whichitexists, andextrinsic conditions like temperature and pressure. Sample preservation and holding times for the anions according to Environment Protection Agency Method 300.1, Determination of Inorganic Anions in Drinking Water by Ion Chromatography, are shown in Table 8.1.These methods vary according to the contaminant of concern and the environmental medium from which it is collected. 8.2 EXPOSURE CALCULATIONS duration of the contact. Exposure occurs immediately when the agent contacts the receptor at a single point in time and space.7 Note in Eqn 8.2 that dividing the time-integrated exposure by the exposure duration, results in the time-averaged exposure. For example, if the time-integrated exposure for benzene in a workshop is E \u00bc 100 mgm 3 for a person who has been exposed 2 per day for 100 days (t2 t1 \u00bc (2/24) 100 \u00bc 8.33 days), the time-averaged exposure is 100 mgm 3 8.33 day \u00bc 833 mg 1 31 benzene (m3-day) or 833 mgm day benzene exposure. The target may be the receptor (e.g. the amount of the contaminant applied or absorbed by a person). The target may also be an organ or other tissue in the receptor (e.g. the amount of the contaminant that reaches the bloodstream). It may be indicated by a biomarker, such as the concentration of benzene in urine.", "For example, if benzene is found in urine, this is the amount that has been eliminated following intake, absorption, distribution, and metabolism. The biomarker is not the exposure, but is merely an indicator of exposure. A hypothetical, oversimpli\ufb01ed example would be that if the only exposure route in the above benzene example were by inhalation, the losses to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) must be considered. Assuming that 50% of the benzene is absorbed, 10% of the benzene is sequestered in bone and other organs during distribution, and 10% is metabolized, the percentage that is eliminated is 70%. Assuming that half of the 30% that is excreted is in the urine, the biomarker would only receive 15% of the exposure amount. In our example, the time-averaged benzene exposure of 833 mgm 3 d 1 would appear as 833 0.15 \u00bc 125 mgm 3 d 1 benzene in the urine. That is, the ADME urine normalizing factor for benzene in this case would be 6.7 (i.e. urine biomarker measurements would have to be multiplied by 6.7 to address the losses to ADME). Dose canbeanintakedoseoranabsorbeddose.8 Dose equations can be derived by applying a general integral equation for exposure and de\ufb01ning boundary assumptions.4 Onesuchdosemetricisthe average daily dose (ADD) which is often used for noncancer effects, averages exposures, and doses during exposure duration periods. The ADD is ascertained by averaging an intake dose according to body weight and an averaging time: I ADD \u00bc (8.6)Wtaveraging Exposure can be calculated by multiplying the con-where I is theintakedose, W is the body weight (kilocentration of the agent (e.g. air pollutant) by the grams), and taveraging is the averaging time (days). For II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8. AIR POLLUTANT EXPOSURES inhalation, I equals the concentration of the air pollutant times the inhalation rate (IR) times the exposure duration. Thus, if the concentration of the pollutant is 10 mgm 3,the IR is 20 m 3day 1,and the exposure duration is 500 days, the intake dose is 10 20 500 \u00bc 105 mgm 3. Note that the concentration is the mass of the agent in the medium (air, food, soil, etc.) per unit volume contacting the body and has units of mass/volume or mass/mass. For air pollutants, this is generally mass per volume (e.g. mgm 3). The intake rate is expressed differently for the various routes, i.e. it can be the rate of inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact. It is important to keep in mind that inhalation is the dominant exposure route for air pollutants (the intake rate is that at which contaminated air is inhaled), but is not the only route. For example, after particulate matter settles on food, ingestion becomes a very important route of exposure (see Figure 8.5). For ingestion, the intake rate is simply the amount of contaminated food ingested by a person during some speci\ufb01c time period (units of mass/time). This is true for both dietary and nondietary ingestion, since the concentration in the food includes the total amount of the contaminant. For example, if the concentration of pesticide A in lettuce at the time it is brought home from the grocery store is 10 ng kg 1 butinahousethatrecentlysprayed thesamepesticide, theindoors havea concentrationof50 ng kg 1 when it is eaten, the additional 40 ng kg 1 would be part of the total 50 ng kg 1 in the intake dose calculation. Similarly, people can also be exposed dermally to air pollutants that deposit onto surfaces (including factorssuchasskinsurface area andestimates of the amount of solids that adhere to the skin, \ufb01lm thickness of liquids that adhere to the skin, transfer of residues, and skin thickness and chemical-speci\ufb01c absorption factors (AFs)). The exposure duration is the length of time of contact with an agent, which is more complicated than in the examples above. A thorough exposure duration value includes many time-related activity factors, such as the length of time a person lives in an area, frequency of bathing, time spent indoors versus outdoors, and time spent in various microenvironments. When the above parameter values IR and ED remain constant over time, they can be substituted directly into the dose equation. When they change with time, calculations of dose must apply a summation approach. In both situations, however, the exposure duration is the length of time exposure occurs at the concentration and the intake rate speci\ufb01ed by the other variables in the equations above. Age groupings call for separate ADDs to be calculated for each age group that is exposed.", "Rather than a single average population value and/or a lifetime average value, this allows for chronic exposures to be calculated by summing across each life stage-speci\ufb01c ADD. As mentioned in Chapter 7, cancer risks have traditionally been calculated using a linear nonthreshold model. This assumes in terms of lifetime probabilities by utilizing dose values presented in terms of lifetime average daily doses (LADDs).8 Exposure can be expressed for an individual, for certain groups (e.g. neighborhoods or children living in a county), or for entire populations. For example, one may want to calculate the exposure to a hazardous air pollutant for a geographic area, which includes the FIGURE 8.5 Differences in exposure route in homes where a pesticide has been recently applied versus other homes. Exposure pathway contributions to annual average daily permethrin dose for 3-to 5-year-old children (simulated, i.e. including those residing in permethrin use and nonuse households) in the US population; based on means, the major contributing exposure route in use and nonuse homes was found to be nondietary ingestion at 41%, but this increased to 61% in use homes. Inhalation also increased from 5 to 8% in use homes. Nondietary ingestion includes household dust. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.)

Thus, a child\u2019s mean daily exposures by setting are: \u0081 Indoors: 0.5 0.4 18 \u00bc 3.6mgday 1 \u0081 Outdoors near home: 0.4 0.5 4 \u00bc 0.8mgday 1 \u0081 In car: 0.2 0.4 1 \u00bc 0.08 mg day 1 \u0081 Other outdoors: 0.7 0.5 1 \u00bc 0.35 mg day 1 TABLE 8.2 Information Needed to Calculate Formaldehyde Daily Exposures in Four Hypothetical Settings Outdoors In Car Near While Other Setting Indoors Home Driving Outdoors Formaldehyde concentration 3(mg m ) 0.5 0.4 0.2 0.7 Child mean 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.5 inhalation rate (IR) 1(m3 h ) Adult mean IR 1(m3 h ) 0.6 0.7 0.5 0.8 Time spent in setting by child 1(h day ) 18 4 1 1 Time spent in setting by adult 1(h day ) 16 4 1 3 Thus, the mean daily exposure of children in the census tract, based on the measurements would be the sum of these microenvironmental exposures: 1 3:6 \u00fe 0:8 \u00fe 0:08 \u00fe 0:35 \u00bc 4:83 mg day The calculated adult mean daily exposure is: \u0081 Indoors: 0.5 0.6 16 \u00bc 4.8mgday 1 \u0081 Outdoors near home: 0.4 0.7 4 \u00bc 1.12 mg day 1 \u0081 In car: 0.2 0.5 1 \u00bc 0.1mgday 1 \u0081 Other outdoors: 0.7 0.8 3 \u00bc 1.68 mg day 1 Thus, the mean daily exposure of children in the census tract, based on the measurements would be the sum of these microenvironmental exposures: 1 4:8 \u00fe 1:12 \u00fe 0:1 \u00fe 1:68 \u00bc 7:7mgday The adult exposures appear to be higher than those of children. These daily estimates are expressed as mass per time, but exposure is usually normalized by body weight.", "The normal exposure units are mg kg 1 day 1. Thus, assuming the mean body weight of children in this census tract is 20 kg and that of adults is 80 kg, the exposures would be: Children: 4.83 mg day 1/20 kg \u00bc 0.24mgkg 1day 1 Adults: 7.7 mg day 1/80 kg \u00bc 0.10mgkg 1day 1 Thus, children\u2019s body-weight normalized exposure is more than twice as high as that of adults in this community. Note that these hypothetical examples are based on very limited data and imprecise designations of settings and activities. For example, the IRs would need to represent more speci\ufb01c age groups, such as those in Table 8.3. This is because respiration rates are much lower for very young children. Also, infants and very young children are much more vulnerable to pollution and their exposures need to be known to determine risks to this vulnerable subpopulation. Body weight is another very important exposure factor. For a given amount of contaminant intake, the lower the body weight, the larger the dose will be. The example of normalizing for body weight for children and adults was much too broad. As was true for IRs, body weight by age estimates are also available (see Table 8.4). Decision makers can use the types of exposure estimates in these examples to evaluate the potential effects of locating a facility that would be a source of a pollutant. For example, the exposure estimates for children in this hypothetical scenario appear high. However, most of the exposure is indoors at home. This can mean either that substantial amounts of formaldehyde are penetrating the home from outdoors or that there are large indoor sources. In this case, the \u201coutdoor II.

The substance may directly affect the respiratory tract. This is known as point-of-entry effect. The substance may also enter the bloodstream after being transferred from the air to the lungs so that it can harm other systems of the body. This is known as target organ effect. Generally, inhalation exposure is assumed to equal \u201cdose\u201d for gases, aerosols, and respirable particulate matter (<2.5 mm). Larger particles are less likely to reach the alveoli, i.e. the lowest parts of the lung. These can be removed by upward movement of cilia in the lungs and swallowed. Thus, estimating dose from inhaled air pollutant estimates is complicated.9 Inhalation exposure for a given exposure event is equal to the average chemical concentration in the air at the person\u2019s breathing zone multiplied by the IR10: Einh \u00bc Ca$kinh (8.8) where, Einh is the inhalation exposure (mass per time), Ca is the airborne concentration of the air pollutant contacted (mass of pollutant per volume of air in the breathing zone), and kinh is the IR (volume of air per unit time). Thus, a person engaged in physical work breathing at a rate of 20 m3 day 1 in air that contains 5 mg carbon monoxide per cubic meter would have an inhalation exposure of 100 mg day 1. Irrespective of the type of risk assessment, the general exposure Eqn (8.2) must be rewritten to address each route of exposure, accounting for chemical concentration and the activities that affect the time of contact.", "In numerous regulatory and cleanup situations, the exposure calculated from these equations is actually the chemical intake (I) in units of concentration (mass per volume or mass per mass) per time, which is mgkg 1day 1: C$CR$EF$ED$AF I \u00bc (8.9) BW$AT where C \u00bc chemical concentration of contaminant (mass per volume) CR \u00bc contact rate (mass per time) EF \u00bc exposure frequency (number of events, dimensionless) ED \u00bc exposure duration (time) These factors are further speci\ufb01ed for each route of exposure and for different durations of exposure, such as the LADD, which is a maximum, chronic, long-term exposure for an individual (see Table 8.5).

Indeed, exposure to many persistent, bioaccumulating air pollutants comes through routes other than inhalation (e.g. ingestion and dermal). Acute and subchronic exposures require different equations, since the ED is much shorter. For example, instead of LADD, acute exposures to non-carcinogens may use maximum daily dose to calculate exposure. Nevertheless, even these exposures follow the general model given in Eqn (8.8).The discussion box, Exposure Calculation Example, provides a hypothetical example of an exposure to a toxic air pollutant. EXPOSURE CALCULATION EXAMPLE In the process of synthesizing pesticides over an 18-year period, a polymer manufacturer has contaminated the soil on its property with vinyl chloride. The plant closed 2 years ago but vinyl chloride vapors continue to reach the neighborhood surrounding the plant at an average concentration of 1 mg m 3. Assume that people are breathing at a ventilation rate of 0.5 m3 h 1 (about the average of adult males and females are older than 18 years11). The legal settlement allows neighboring residents to evacuate and sell their homes to the company. However, they may also stay. The neighbors have asked for advice on whether to stay or leave, since they have already been exposed for 20 years. Vinyl chloride is highly volatile, so its phase distribution will be mainly in the gas phase rather than in the aerosol phase. Although some of the vinyl chloride may be sorbed to particles, use only vapor phase LADD equation, since the particle phase is likely to be relatively small. Also, assume that outdoor concentrations are the exposure concentrations. This is unlikely, however, since people spend commonly spend less time outdoors compared to indoors, so this may provide an additional factor of safety. To determine how much vinyl chloride penetrates living quarters, indoor air studies would have to be conducted. Likewise, to compare exposures, indoor air measurements should be taken.

Absorption rates are published by the US EPA and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s Risk Assessment Information System (http://risk.lsd.ornl. gov/cgi-bin/tox/TOX_select?select\u00bcnrad). Vinyl chloride is well absorbed, so for this exercise assume that AF \u00bc 1. Also assume that the person staying in the neighborhood is exposed at the average concentration 24 h day 1 (EL \u00bc 24), and that a person lives the remainder of the entire typical lifetime exposed at the measured concentration. Although the ambient concentrations of vinyl chloride may have been higher when the plant was operating, the only measurements we have are those taken recently. Thus, this is an area of uncertainty that must be discussed with the clients. The common default value for a lifetime is 70 years, so assume the longest exposure would be is 70 years (25,550 days). Table 8.6 gives some of the commonly used default values in exposure assessments.

Recall that even though the predominant pathway is air and that inhalation is the major exposure route, other exposure pathways and routes contribute to total exposure to a pollutant, especially as exposure duration increases. For a persistent pollutant, which may build up in fats or other tissue, the aggregate exposure must be considered, i.e. every route and pathway by which a person is exposed to the same chemical agent. Body burden is an important exposure consideration, especially for toxic chemicals that are suf\ufb01ciently persistent and that can bioaccumulate (see Chapter 19). These compounds include metals, e.g. lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd); metalloids, II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8.3 CHEMICAL INTAKE AND EXPOSURE Naphthalene Anthracene Pyrene Benz(a)anthracene Benzo(a)pyrene e.g. arsenic (As); and organic compounds. Two important classes of persistent, bioaccumulating organic compounds are the products of incomplete combustion and compounds with halogen substitutions. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (see Figure 8.6) are some of the most toxic and bio-accumulating organic products of incomplete combustion. Persistent and bioaccumulating halogenated aromatic compounds include PCBs, polybrominated biphenyls, and the organochlorine pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Consider a 100-kg person who is exposed to DDT over 20 years, predominantly as an air pollutant as a result of years of occupational exposure, but who is also exposed by ingesting food and dermal exposure from applying the compound as an insecticide against mosquitos.a If the exposure is 325 ng 100 kg 1 year 1 from inhaling air, 25 ng 100 kg 1 year 1 from ingesting food, and 50 ng 100 kg 1 year 1 from contact through skin, the person\u2019s total accumulation of for the 20 year period would be: (325 \u00fe 25 \u00fe 50) ng 20 \u00bc 700 ng. This person\u2019s body would have built up 7 mg of DDT over this 20-year span. However, to know the actual DDT dose during that period, the toxicokinetics need to be considered (see Figure 8.7). The AF in Eqn (8.9) indicates this. In fact, toxicokinetics includes not only the absorption rate but also the distribution, metabolism and elimination rates.", "From 70% to 80% of ingested DDT is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.14 The extent of inhalation absorption seems to depend on the particulate characteristics of the DDT aerosol. Often, the aerosol is coarse, which means that inhalation is not as important compared to ingestion and dermal routes. However, if the particulates are \ufb01ne, they can penetrate deeply and become absorbed. The particles may be cleared by the mucociliary mechanisms, with much of this subsequently ingested. DDT is stored in adipose tissue. The actual body burden, however, is determined by the amount of a substance that is absorbed and the amount that is cleared. Assuming that on an average 80% of the DDT is absorbed after exposure and that 90% of this amount is cleared from the person\u2019s body each year, the net amount is the product of the accumulated amount, the absorption rate, and the remaining amount after clearance (i.e. 1 clearance rate): 7 mg 0.8 (1 0.9) \u00bc 0.56 mg. Thus, the person has 0.56 mg per 100 kg of DDT body burden after 20 years of exposure. Of course, this calculated body burden would increase if the absorption rate increased. The body burden would decrease if the clearance rate increased. The high Kow of DDT (log Kow \u00bc 6.9; see Chapter 18) and its metabolites would suggest a strong potential for accumulation in lipid-rich tissues. Thus, the clearance rate could be decreased in proportion to the amount of a compound that is stored in lipids, i.e. lipophilic compounds generally have much longer half-lives than hydrophilic compounds in mammals. A nonpersistent, nonbioaccumulating compound would have a 100% clearance rate, i.e. none of the compound is stored. However, this does not necessarily mean that the person has no risk. Indeed, many nonpersistent compounds are highly acutely toxic, so the long-term exposure to a toxic compound could be causing incremental harm. Secondly, even if the body burden of the parent compound is zero, its metabolites may accumulate and must be considered in exposure calculations. The person exposed to DDT would have a Although the use of DDT has been banned in the United States, Canada, and much of Europe, it continues to be used in countries, especially in tropical and subtropical countries where mosquitoes are the principal vector for malaria. Reliable insecticides have been dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd as substitutes for DDT. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8. AIR POLLUTANT EXPOSURES a body burden of not only the parent DDT but also its metabolites, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) which are also persistent and bioaccumulate. In fact, the metabolite body burden may be much higher than that of the parent compound (see Figure 8.8), Incidentally, these metabolites have their own toxicities, e.g. DDE is highly disruptive to the endocrine system (i.e. antiandrogenic), that may differ from the parent. Indeed, the metabolites can be more toxic and otherwise problematic than the parent compound to which a person is exposed. As mentioned, another important group of persistent, bioaccumulating compounds are the PAHs. In fact, these may be more illustrative of an inhalation exposure than the organochlorine pesticides, since the major pathway for PAHs is the air and the major route of exposure is inhalation. Like the organochlorine compounds, PAHs are highly soluble in lipids and are absorbed from the lung, gut, and skin of mammals and seem to be readily cleared from the lungs (e.g. rat studies show clearance in days). The PAH clearance process involves two phases, i.e. a biphasic process involving the vapor and particulate phases. PAHs are predominantly adsorbed onto particles. After these are deposited in the airways, they can be eliminated by bronchial clearance. PAHs may then be partly desorbed from the particles during transport on the ciliated mucosa. From there, the PAHs may penetrate into the bronchial epithelium cells, whereupon metabolism begins.15 The chemical class of PAHs consists of compounds with two or more aromatic rings which are fused together when a pair of carbon atoms is shared between them (see Chapter 6). The difference between PAHs and other aromatic compounds is that the aromatic rings of PAHs are fused (Figure 8.9), whereas most other aromatic compounds are linked by bonds (compare Figures 8.8 and 8.9). These fused rings increase environmental persistence, as indicated by their II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8.3 CHEMICAL INTAKE AND EXPOSURE very low vapor pressures and aqueous solubilities (see Table 8.7).", "The major PAH of concern to air pollution is arguably benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), which is also the PAH most studied and, thus, is associated with the highest quality data for exposure and toxicity. When BaP is adsorbed on particles, the respiratory uptake rate is subdued because the particles are retained for an extended period of time in the respiratory tract.16 The initial clearance is rapid, with about half of the BaP mass removed in less than 1 h. However, the second, long-term clearance can be slow (e.g. animal studies have indicated 18 days to clear half of the BaP mass).17 Once the BaP and other PAHs reach the gastrointestinal tract they are readily absorbed. The absorption is facilitated by liver excretions.18a,18b As is true for DDT and other halogenated organic compounds, dermal exposure must always be considered to be an important route for PAHs, since absorption through human skin has also been demonstrated.19 Also, like DDT and other persistent organic compounds, the PAH metabolites have their own physicochemical properties and toxicities. Indeed, BaP metabolites are thought to be the main triggers for cancer. That is, the parent compound is less carcinogenic than the compound formed from mammalian metabolism. It becomes even more toxic by a process known as biological activation (see Figure 19.20). H2 H2 FIGURE 8.9 Structures of select polycyclic aro C C matic hydrocarbons known to be air pollutants.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8.4 EXPOSURE DATA 231 8.4 EXPOSURE DATA Exposure assessments are only as good as the data upon which they are based. The data must meet several criteria20: 1. Data must be sound: extent to which the scienti\ufb01c and technical procedures, measures, methods, or models generate the information are reasonable for and consistent with the intended application. 2. Data must be relevant: extent to which the information applies to the intended use. 3. Data and metadata must be clear and complete: the degree of clarity and completeness of documentation of the data, assumptions, methods, quality assurance process, sponsoring organizations, and analyses to generate the information. 4. Data must be accompanied with stated uncertainty and variability: the extent to which the uncertainty and variability (quantitative and qualitative) in the information or in the procedures, measures, methods, or models are evaluated and characterized. 5. Data must be evaluated and reviewed: the extent of independent veri\ufb01cation and validation of the exposure information. Data quality objectives express the minimum performance and acceptance criteria. For example, air pollution sampling might be conducted as part of a network to track pollution trends, but these data can also represent exposure concentrations.", "During a \ufb01eld study and its analysis, blank samples and duplicates need to be collected and used in data validation. Blank samples (e.g. \ufb01eld blanks, laboratory blanks) are samples known to be free of contamination that are carried through the sampling program. Contamination in these blanks during analysis indicates that sampling or analytical procedures are not meeting good \ufb01eld and laboratory practice. Duplicate samples, i.e. two samples collected in one location using identical sampling techniques, are expected to provide two samples that yield identical analytical results. In reality, analysis results are rarely identical, since instrument variability and error are never zero. However, the duplicates should meet comparability criteria, i.e. be near enough to the known value as to fall within the acceptable range. All analytical methods have sensitivity limitations. Detection limit (DL), quanti\ufb01cation limit, method DL, and reporting limit are common expressions of sensitivity standards. Analytical chemistry data sets should have some indication of all values that are lower than limits deemed reliable enough to report as numerical values (i.e. nondetects). These values should not be expressed as \u201czero\u201d. Indeed, the actual concentration is unknown. Nondetects can be addressed using simple substitution methods, distributional methods, and robust methods.21 Simple substitution methods use a single value as a surrogate, e.g. the DL or half the DL, for each nondetect value. These methods can introduce biases into the data, particularly if zero is chosen, since measures of central tendencies would be skewed toward lower concentrations. For example, consider the following data set from a \ufb01eld sample of an air pollutant (mgm 3),withaDL of 10 mgm 3 and the air quality standard of 12 mgm 3: Concentration as Concentration in Reported in Concentration in L3 mgm when L3 mgm (ND L3 mgm when Nondetects Date [ nondetects) Nondetects [ 0 [ 0.5 DL 10/1 15 15 15 10/2 ND 0 5 10/3 25 25 25 10/4 ND 0 5 10/5 ND 0 5 10/6 20 20 20 10/7 17 17 17 Mean for Unknown 11 13 the week If the nondetects are treated as 0, the standard is met. If the nondetects are treated as one-half of the DL, the standard is not met. This is particularly important for air toxics that are associated with adverse effects at very low concentrations, e.g. chronic diseases like cancer associated with concentrations in the parts per billion range. Distributional methods are a type of internal approach that uses the detected values from which to extrapolate values for the nondetects. Statistics such as log-probit analysis are available to extrapolate data. The data set needs a suf\ufb01cient number of data points above the DL to de\ufb01ne the distribution function (e.g. log-normal) for exposure values with an acceptable degree of con\ufb01dence. Regression is used to derive the non-detect values. These methods only assume that data below the DL follow a de\ufb01ned distribution, not the whole data set. Data sets cannot always be combined. Metadata are crucial, including the circumstances under which each set of data were collected (e.g. target population, sampling design, location, and time) and quality (e.g. precision, accuracy, representativeness, and completeness). II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8. AIR POLLUTANT EXPOSURES This applies to both measurements and data sets derived from models. 8.4.1 Environmental Data Needed for Air Pollution Exposure Calculations Environmental data are used to characterize either chemical concentrations of an agent in a medium (e.g. particulate matter in a plume) or at an exposure point (e.g. VOCs in the breathing zone). Environmental data also describe the physical media in which an agent is present (e.g. stability of an atmospheric layer, inversion characteristics, and relative humidity). Environmental data are used throughout an exposure assessment process. During the planning and scoping stage, they can direct the development of a conceptual model by providing information about the chemical source, types of releases, and potential transport mechanisms through the environment. Exposure assessors also use environmental data when quantitatively estimating exposure. These data serve as fundamental inputs, either directly as exposure concentrations or indirectly in exposure models that estimate likely exposure concentrations. For example, the concentration of a solvent in a drinking water supply could directly represent an exposure concentration for the population served by the water supply. The concentration of a solvent detected in ground water that is upgradient of a drinking water well, on the other hand, could serve indirectly as an input value for a model used to predict potential contamination based on parameters such as ground water \ufb02ow, well pumping rates, and ground water velocity.", "8.4.1.1 Biomonitoring Data Biomarkers are becoming increasingly reliable for exposure assessment, especially for body burden information. These are cellular, biochemical, analytical, or molecular measures of chemical exposure. Measurements are taken from samples of various biological media, e.g. tissues, cells, and \ufb02uids, which is known as biomonitoring. Bio-markers are used for both effects (see Chapter 7) and exposure. The difference is that exposure biomarkers record the concentration of the chemical or its metabolites in biological media, but effect biomarkers are indications of damage or other cellular, biochemical, or molecular changes that have resulted from the exposure to the chemical.22 To be useful for exposure assessments, the biomarker must be suf\ufb01ciently sensitive, speci\ufb01c, biologically relevant, and feasible to collect and analyze (e.g. have unique and identi\ufb01able chromatographic peaks). Its toxicokinetics must allow for the substance to persist in the body long enough to be detected.23 Figure 8.10 shows some of the variability in the residence time of a parent compound or its metabolite in human tissue after a single exposure. Any of the biomarkers in Figure 8.10 can be used, depending on the residence time of the body burden. For example, if daily changes in chemical exposure are needed, any of the biomarkers will suf\ufb01ce, so long as they are collected, stored, and analyzed properly. However, if biomonitoring is conducted every 150 days, the blood toxicant/metabolite test would be the only reliable biomarker (i.e. fewer nondetects and higher concentrations). This points to the problem of \u201cfalse negatives\u201d in biomonitoring. If a person is exposed periodically, many biomarkers would not detect the exposure because the chemical would have been cleared between the exposure and the test. If this is interpreted as \u201czero exposure\u201d, this error is known as a false negative. Biomonitoring studies help to close data gaps associated with possible exposures, baseline conditions, and internal chemical or metabolite concentrations. Biomonitoring II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8.4 EXPOSURE DATA 233 data alone usually cannot link a chemical in the environment with an effect, but they are quite useful complements to environmental datain estimating exposure, especially as inputs to exposure models. These data are useful in establishing a baseline and reference concentration for air pollutants. They give indications of the prevalence of people\u2019s chemical body burdens, and highlight those above established toxicity benchmarks. They can be strati\ufb01ed to estimate the extent to which exposures are higher among certain life stages (e.g. Are children exposed differently than adults or are certain socioeconomic classes differentially exposed?). As mentioned, biomonitoring data have several limitations. Chemical analytical methods are available only for some chemicals. Exposure estimates may be dif\ufb01cult to calculate due to background concentrations, confounding coexposures (see Chapter 4), metabolic uncertainties (e.g. \u201cblack boxes\u201d in metabolic pathways), and limited information needed to correlate exposures to chemical concentrations of parent and metabolite. Many biomarkers are nonspeci\ufb01c, i.e. they are triggered by several different chemicals and various endogenous processes. Indeed, biomarkers range from highly speci\ufb01c, such as an enzyme of the heme pathway, i.e. the inhibition of aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, which indicates previous Pb exposure. Some biomarkers are collectively speci\ufb01c, e.g. for a whole class of compounds, such as the inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AChE), which is a speci\ufb01c biomarker for organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate pesticides. However, this biomarker cannot indicate the exposure to a speci\ufb01c pesticide, e.g. chlorpyrifos. Even more nonspeci\ufb01c are changes in the immune system or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that could result from a wide range of agents (chemical and biological). The less-speci\ufb01c biomarkers that indicate exposures to classes of chemicals can actually be quite useful. Often, the speci\ufb01c chemical is less important than the class. For example, enzyme activity can be present in numerous tissues, but AChE inhibition generally is determined from blood samples (whole blood or plasma) and the brain. This makes a biomarker useful not only in human exposure and toxicology but also for ecological exposure and toxicology. These AChE inhibitions occur in mammals, birds, and aquatic biota. With algorithms and models, these biomarkers can be used to predict internal body residues of classes of organic and metallic compounds in various species, e.g. OP pesticides in sentinel species like earthworms, Eisenia fetida and Lumbricus terrestris (see Figure 8.2 and Discussion Box: Bioindicators of Ecosystem Exposures). These species are used to indicate overall exposures and stressors in habitats. BIOINDICATORS OF ECOSYSTEM EXPOSURES", "The presence, condition, and diversity of plants, animals, and other living things can be used to assess air pollutant exposures in an ecosystem, such as a stream, lake, estuary, wetland, or forest. Such organisms are referred to as biological indicators or bioindicators. An indicator is in a sense an \u201cintegrating\u201d tool that incorporates highly complex information in an understandable manner. The iconic bioindicator is the famous canary in the coal mine. Miners were aware that if they hit a vein that contained \u201ccoal gas\u201d (actually high concentrations of methane and carbon monoxide) they had little time to evacuate before inhalation of the gas would lead to death. However, they realized that due to its small mass, a smaller animal would succumb to the toxic effects before a human would be affected. The miners did not really care so much how it worked (i.e. the doseeresponse relationships and routes of exposure); they only cared that it worked. Actually the canary is an example of a bioassay, which is a test of toxicity or other adverse effect on one or a few organisms to determine the overall expected effect on a system. Using an indicator or sentry organism can uncover a cumulative effect that occurs from relatively low-dose, chronic exposures, which are more common and realistic than laboratory studies that rely on short-duration, high-dose administrations to a relatively small number of test species, from which the results must be mathematically modeled. Living organisms, as natural biological integrators, represent numerous locations (wherever the organism has been) and realistic behaviors (what the organism ordinarily does, so long as the sensor is not disruptive). In biomonitoring, a \ufb02uid or tissue sample reveals thecontaminantstowhich thesepeoplehavebeen exposed, as well as to the metabolites produced by pathways yielding breakdown products. In addition, an organism\u2019s endogenous chemicals respond to the exposure to the parent and breakdown products. Thus, there is a combination of the xenobiotic compound and its metabolites, as well as a change in the concentrations of the chemicals that are always produced by the organism. Metabolonomics measures the metabolic status of the whole organism, connecting (Continued ) II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8. AIR POLLUTANT EXPOSURES BIOINDICATORS OF ECOSYSTEM EXPOSURES (cont\u2019d) genomics and proteomics (genetic and cellular responses to the xenobiotic exposure, respectively) with histopathology (i.e. the tissue damage). This reveals a \u201c\ufb01ngerprint\u201d of the organism\u2019s response to the uptake and metabolism of a substance. In other words, the \u201comics\u201d tools characterize the expected chemical progeny of the parent compound and the pro\ufb01le of the organism\u2019s own endogenous compounds as a response to the exposure to the parent xenobiotic compound and its degradation products. In addition, these omics tools can be used at the population and higher trophic levels, so they may be applied in biological indication studies. Indicators of effects are also available. Biological effects at the cellular level range from acute cellular toxicity to changes in the cellular ribonucleic and DNA structures, leading to cellular (and tissue) mutations, including cancer. The cells are also homes to chemical signaling processes such as those in the stimuluseresponse systems in microbes and plants, as well as the endocrine, immune, and neural systems in animals. The presence of enzymes and other chemicals can indicate stress at various biological levels. Metabolonomics is also a valuable computational tool for effects studies. An ecological indicator can be a single measure, an index that embodies a number of measures, or a model that characterizes an entire ecosystem or components of that ecosystem. An indicator integrates the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of ecological condition. It is used to determine the status and to monitor or predict trends in environmental conditions and possible sources of contamination and stress on systems. Biocriteria are metrics of a system\u2019s biological integrity. A system must be able to support communities of organisms in a balanced manner. 24 One means of determining biological integrity is to compare the current condition of an ecosystem to that of pristine or undisturbed conditions. The threshold is the condition below which a system suffers from dysfunction or impairment. A reference condition is frequently associated with biological integrity. However, few systems have not been in some way affected by humans, so the \u201cpristine\u201d system is rare indeed. So the environmental scientist will more often refer to a reference system as one that is \u201cminimally impaired\u201d, i.e. one with high biological integrity.", "Ecosystems and environmental compartments can be degraded by chemical contamination, as well as by physical changes that alter habitats, such as the withdrawal of irrigation water from aquifers and surface waters, over\ufb01shing and overgrazing, and introduction of opportunistic exotic species. Biota are selectively sensitive to all forms of pollution. Estimating ecosystem condition requires the application of direct or indirect evaluations of a system\u2019s attributes. Indirect evaluations can have the advantage of being cheaper than the direct approaches, but will not often be as robust. An attribute of natural systems to be protected, e.g. a \ufb01sh population, is an example of an assessment endpoint, whereas an attribute that is quanti\ufb01ed with actual measurements, e.g. age classes of the \ufb01sh population, is known as a measurement endpoint. Reliable and representative assessment and measurement endpoints are needed to re\ufb02ect a system\u2019s biological integrity (see Table 8.8). An ecosystem\u2019s condition follows the hierarchy of a system\u2019s organization, including its various structures and functions. The metabolism of individual organisms is at one extreme. Population processes, e.g. reproduction, recruitment, dispersal, and speciation, are the next level. The highest level of organization, i.e. the communities or ecosystems, processes include nutrient cycling, interspecies interactions, and energy \ufb02ows. Only a representative amount of biota needs to be sampled. Such selections must aggregate an optimal number of attributes with suf\ufb01cient precision and sampling ef\ufb01ciency, to provide robust indicators of ecosystem well-being. Biosensors make use of biological principles to give information about physicochemical agents that may be present. Such devices can be designed to detect the presence and, with calibration, concentrations of contaminants, or they may be used to sense certain physicochemical properties (solubility, polarity, partitioning, and bioavailability) of a whole sample. Compared to conventional methods, biosensors can improve sensitivity (i.e. the biosensor reliably indicates when the agent or class of compounds is present).

II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8.4 EXPOSURE DATA 235 BIOINDICATORS OF ECOSYSTEM EXPOSURES (cont\u2019d) Biosensors can also be speci\ufb01c (only respond to a stimulus elicited by a single or well-de\ufb01ned set of contaminants) and portable (e.g. results known in the \ufb01eld, with no need to collect samples and return to the laboratory for \u201cwet chemistry\u201d at the bench). In contrast with chemical or physical analyses, elaborate and expensive instrumentation is not usually necessary when using biosensors. To date, enzymes, antibodies, subcellular components, and microbes have dominated the types of biological components in biosensors. Enzymes tend to be unstable and expensive to use, so enzyme-based biosensors are more common in medical applications than in environmental biotechnology. Whole microbes are showing promise, as the biological component of biosensors, owing to their diversity and rapid reproduction, in addition to their well-understood culture collections. Whole-cell biosensors also take advantage of the biological integration that a microorganism undergoes. As such, the whole cell represents numerous enzymatic reactions, including those involved in cellular respiration and fermentation.25 The chemical being detected is transported in a sample to a sensor (e.g. O2 electrode), from which the biological response is ascertained. This molecular response is what makes biosensor. The transducer simply provides a speci\ufb01c response to the biochemical activity (see Figure 8.11).26 Biomonitoring generally is not very helpful in identifying and apportioning air pollution sources of exposure, given the number of transport and transformation steps in the environment and within the organism (see Figures 8.1 and 8.7). Finally, the data on biologically equivalent doses that result in toxic effects are limited, making the comparisons necessary to assess health risks dif\ufb01cult. The simplicity of this design provides good speci\ufb01city, sensitivity, and portability, eliminating the need for expensive instrumentation, except for calibrations at the laboratory bench. Several types of whole-cell bacterial biosensors using recombinant DNA technology are now available. The bacteria are genetically engineered to respond to the presence of chemicals or physiological stresses by synthesizing a reporter protein, such as b-galactosidase, or green \ufb02uorescent protein.25 A biosensor is evaluated on the basis of its: 1. Sensitivity: response of the sensor to per unit change in analyte concentration. 2. Selectivity: ability of the sensor to respond only to the target analyte; that is, lack of response to other interfering chemicals is the desired feature. 3.", "Range: concentration range over which the sensitivity of the sensor is good (also referred to as dynamic range or linearity). 4. Response time: time needed for the sensor to indicate a certain percentage of its \ufb01nal response due to a step change in analyte concentration. 5. Reproducibility: accuracy with which the sensor\u2019s output is obtained. 6. DL: lowest concentration of the analyte to which there is a measurable response. 7. Useful life: time period over which the sensor can be used without signi\ufb01cant deterioration in performance characteristics. 8. Stability: change in its baseline or sensitivity over a \ufb01xed time period.26 Biosensors have been used for some time. Immunoassays, in particular, have been used in environmental applications. The improvements to these biotechnologies will allow for improved environmental and public health assessments. 8.4.2 Exposure Factors Exposure factors are those that relate to human behavior and characteristics that are used to quantify a person\u2019s exposure to an agent in their environment. One of the most comprehensive compilations of these factors is the Exposure Factors Handbook.27 The handbook summarizes the available data on a range of exposure factors, II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8. AIR POLLUTANT EXPOSURES including consumption of drinking water; breast milk intake; consumption of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, grain products, beef, and \ufb01sh; soil ingestion; IRs; skin surface area; soil adherence; body weight; residential building characteristics; and consumer product use. Exposure factors also include data related to people\u2019s average body weight, age, and other physical characteristics. A key set of exposure factors is activity pattern (or time use) data, which are a person\u2019s activities, length of time spent performing various activities, locations where a person spends time, and length of time spent within those various environments. Activity data include the types of activities, the length of time people practice the activity, and where and when the activity occurs. Activity patterns can be derived from timeeactivity diaries, electronic devices (e.g. global positioning systems), questionnaires, or surveys. Exposure scenarios can be developed using these factors combined with activity patterns. As in this chapter\u2019s examples above, exposure factors are also used to estimate contact rates for different media, e.g. the amount of air inhaled in a breath and breathing rates. 8.4.3 Observational Studies Observational human exposure measurement studies quantify people\u2019s exposures to agents in their environments during their normal daily activities. This requires measurements of chemical, biological, or physical agents or other stressors in environmental media; collection of information about the study participants and their homes, work environments, and activities; and collection of personal exposure and biomarker samples.28 Observational human exposure measurement studies are used to identify the stressors to which people are exposed; exposure concentrations; important sources, routes, and pathways of exposure; and the factors that have the greatest impact on exposure. In addition, results from observational human exposure measurement studies are used to determine whether mitigation measures have been successful and whether regulatory standards have been exceeded. Data generated in observational human exposure measurements can be used as inputs to exposure and dose models. Unfortunately, these studies are often complex and costly, so large observational data sets are less likely to be conducted than in recent decades. Thus, other means of acquiring exposure data are needed. 8.4.4 Acquiring Data for an Exposure Assessment The data needed for an exposure assessment may be available from existing resources. Table 8.9 provides information on a variety of data sources that can be used in an exposure assessment. It contains examples of sources for exposure factor, epidemiologic (e.g. health conditions, risk behaviors), demographic, activity, toxicological, physiochemical, observational human exposure (including occupational), environmental, and meteorological data. Sources from other government agencies, international and professional organizations, and peer-reviewed scienti\ufb01c literature are included, along with US EPA databases. Each of the data types in Table 8.9 has unique characteristics that need to be evaluated and matched to a particular exposure assessment. These include environmental sampling, biomonitoring, compiling exposure factor information, and conducting questionnaires, surveys, and observations. Environmental data are collected for many reasons, using a variety of sampling methods. Sources of environmental data include location-speci\ufb01c environmental sampling; regional or national monitoring databases; regulatory submittals for new and/or existing products; local, state and federal agency studies; and peer-reviewed scienti\ufb01c literature. Table 8.10 illustrates a number of aspects of common environmental data measurements, including typical measurement objectives, target media, and examples of sources of existing data. Environmental sampling may be needed to \ufb01ll data gaps associated with chemical concentrations or exposure point concentrations; and physical conditions (e.g. terrain).", "These data can help to de\ufb01ne an exposure point concentration (e.g. personal monitoring in the breathing zone) and to support modeling to characterize possible exposure routes. 8.4.4.1 Evaluation of Environmental Data For an exposure assessment, evaluation of environmental data focuses primarily on the spatial and temporal conditions that affect how well the existing data represent the conditions addressed in the exposure assessment. These include the location of data collection, environmental conditions under which the data were collected, temporal variation in concentrations, and representativeness of microenvironmental data. These evaluation questions are discussed in detail below. The exposure assessor needs to consider whether the data were collected close to an exposure point of concern in space and time. Media measurements that were collected close to the point of contact for the population or individual in space and/or time are preferable to measurements far removed geographically and/or temporally. The certainty with which the data represent the point of contact tends to decrease as the distance in space and/or time from the point of contact increases. For example, an outdoor air measurement alone cannot adequately characterize indoor exposure. Likewise, shelf studies of consumer products or market basket studies of foods that use regional or national sample groups can provide only a limited understanding of II.

The NTP website presents NTP technical reports on toxicological and carcinogenic studies. The NTP also has compiled answers to frequently asked questions from the public. An HHE is a report on whether workers are exposed to hazardous materials or harmful conditions at a particular workplace. It can include interviews or surveys of employees, measurements of exposures and medical testing. http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/ fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/5837/ report/F http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/ 2000TTY7.TXT?ZyActionD\u00bcZyDocument& Client\u00bcEPA&Index\u00bc1986 \u00fe Thru\u00fe1990&Docs\u00bc &Query\u00bc&Time\u00bc&EndTime\u00bc&SearchMethod\u00bc 1&TocRestrict\u00bcn&Toc\u00bc&TocEntry\u00bc&QField\u00bc &QFieldYear\u00bc&QFieldMonth\u00bc&QFieldDay\u00bc &IntQFieldOp\u00bc0&ExtQFieldOp\u00bc0&XmlQuery\u00bc &File\u00bcD%3A%5Czy\ufb01les%5CIndex%20Data %5C86thru90%5CTxt%5C00000009%5C2000TTY7. txt&User\u00bcANONYMOUS&Password\u00bcanonymous& SortMethod\u00bch%7C-&MaximumDocuments\u00bc 1&FuzzyDegree\u00bc0&ImageQuality\u00bcr75g8/ r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display\u00bcp%7Cf& DefSeekPage\u00bcx&SearchBack\u00bc ZyActionL&Back\u00bcZyActionS&BackDesc\u00bc Results%20page&MaximumPages\u00bc 1&ZyEntry\u00bc1&SeekPage\u00bcx&ZyPURL http://www.epa.gov/tri/ http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/ 8.4 EXPOSURE DATA 241 II.

The environmental conditions under which the data were collected are important. Data characterizing environmental conditions (e.g. ground water \ufb02ow, soil composition, prevailing wind direction) are more representative when measured closer to the point of contact. Again, as the distance from the point of contact or location increases, the uncertainty about how well the data represent local conditions also increases. For instance, an aquifer might have an overall \ufb02ow to the east, but local topography (e.g. streams, hills) might alter the direction of the \ufb02ow. The chemical concentrations vary over space and time. Chemical concentrations can vary considerably from place to place, seasonally and over time because of changing use patterns, degradation and migration. Changes are of particular concern when the measured data will be used to extrapolate trends over long time periods, such as a lifetime. Exposure assessors frequently use transport and dispersion models to understand how chemical concentrations vary over space and time. If data were collected from a microenvironmental study, representativeness must be assured. Microenvironmental measurement approaches de\ufb01ne speci\ufb01c zones that are thought to be relatively homogeneous and then characterize conditions in that zone. For example, microenvironments include the whole or parts of the home, of\ufb01ce or other indoor settings as well as a moving vehicle. Microenvironments can also be divided into time segments (e.g. garage-day, garage-night). This approach can produce measurements that are closely linked with the point of contact in both location and time. Because these studies represent a very limited environment, exposure assessments must ensure that measurements are representative of the population of interest. An exposure assessment can have many sources of data uncertainty and variability (see Table 8.11). Care must be taken to consider how data uncertainty and variability can impact the outcome of the exposure assessment. The assessment needs to use only the data that are adequate for the decision being made and to state whether further data collection is necessary. Uncertainties include exposure scenario uncertainty, sampling or measurement uncertainty, and observational or modeling uncertainty. Scenario uncertainty is the uncertainty that the exposure scenario being used is consistent with the scope and purpose of the assessment. Exposure scenario uncertainty results when information regarding the exposure scenario is limited or inadequate. For example, using an exposure assessment relying on information from a study conducted in the southwestern United States may not apply directly to activity patterns in the Midwestern United States. Sampling or measurement uncertainty is associated with data collection or analysis methods. Sample location, sample number, and analysis methods each can add to sampling uncertainty. As a result of these sources of uncertainty, sampling methods and analyses are unlikely to produce the same results II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 8. AIR POLLUTANT EXPOSURES TABLE 8.11 Types of Uncertainty and Contributing Errors Type of Error Causing Type of Uncertainty Uncertainty Description or Example Exposure scenario Misclassi\ufb01cation Failure to adequately identify exposure routes, exposure media, and exposed population Sampling or measurement Measurement: random Random errors in analytical devices (e.g. imprecision of continuous (parameter uncertainty) monitors that measure stack emissions) Measurement: systemic Systemic bias (e.g. estimating inhalation from indoor ambient air without considering the effect of volatilization of contaminants from hot water during showers) Surrogate data Use of alternate data for a parameter instead of direct analysis of exposure (e.g. use of population \ufb01gures as a surrogate for population exposure) Misclassi\ufb01cation Incorrect assignment of exposures of subjects in historical epidemiologic studies resulting from faulty or ambiguous information Random sampling error Use of a small sample of individuals to estimate risk to exposed workers Nonrepresentativeness Developing exposure estimates for a population in a rural area based on exposure estimates for a population in a city Observational or modeling Relationship errors Incorrectly inferring the basis of correlations between environmental concentrations and urinary output Oversimpli\ufb01cation Misrepresentations of reality (e.g. representing a three-dimensional aquifer with a two-dimensional mathematical model) Incompleteness Exclusion of one or more relevant variables (e.g. relating a biomarker of exposure measured in a biological matrix without considering the presence of the metabolite in the environment) Surrogate variables Use of alternate variables for ones that cannot be measured (e.g. using wind speed at the nearest airport as a proxy for wind speed at the facility site)", "Failure to account for Not accounting for correlations that cause seemingly unrelated events to correlations occur more frequently than expected by chance (e.g. two separate components of a nuclear plant are missing a particular washer because the same newly hired assembler put them together) Model disaggregation Extent of (dis)aggregation used in the model (e.g. separately considering subcutaneous and abdominal fat in the fat compartment of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model) Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Sampling uncertainty is also introduced when surrogate data are used to represent an exposure or when data are not representative of the exposures.30 This is sometimes called parameter uncertainty. Observational or modeling uncertainty represents gaps in the scienti\ufb01c theory that are required to make predictions on the basis of causal inferences. Every data set adds variability to an exposure assessment by all data sets. For example, environmental data represent a sample of the range of chemical concentrations that exist in the environment, and activity information represents a sample of the range of possible activities that can occur in a population. Air pollution data vary temporally, i.e. seasonally (i.e. intra-annually) and year-to-year (interannually), as well as spatially (e.g. latitudinal, winds aloft, and land cover). Metadata, i.e. qualitative or quantitative information about the level of uncertainty and variability associated with a data set, are not always available with the data sets. Unavailable metadata can be addressed somewhat by statistical analyses, such as standard deviations (SDs) and upper con\ufb01dence limit calculations, to represent uncertainty and variability quantitatively. A larger SD is associated with a greater level of uncertainty or variability in the data. Computational techniques are increasingly being used to address model data uncertainty and variability. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION QUESTIONS 1. What is the difference between aggregate and cumulative exposure? 2. What is the difference between dose and exposure? 3. A monitoring station at the intersection of 18th and Vine Streets shows CO concentrations of 8 ppm for July 4. The local newspaper says that people are being exposed to 8 ppm in the town. Is this statement correct? Support your answer. 4. What are the major routes of air pollutant exposure? 5. Numerous activities change exposures to air pollutants. For example, showering can increasing inhalation exposure to chlorinated compounds. A water sample is taken from a shower in a bathroom on January 2, with 50 mg L 1 EDA added immediately after collection and stored at 4 C. It is analyzed on January 12 to determine chloride and chlorite ions as part of an indoor volatile organic compound study. Is this likely to be a reliable sample for laboratory analysis? 6. The home uses a cistern to collect rainwater. There is a phosphate fertilizer plant 2 km upwind from the home, so the technician collected a sample on January 2 and sent it to the lab for analysis on January 12. Can the sample be analyzed for ortho-phosphate-P? 7. A canister collects air samples from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm (day) and 6:00 pm to 6:00 am (night) each day for three days, with the following results: June 1, Day: Benzene \u00bc 1.2 ppbv; 1,3butadiene \u00bc 0.15 ppbv June 1, Night: Benzene \u00bc 0.10 ppbv; 1,3butadiene \u00bc ND June 2, Day: Benzene \u00bc 2.2 ppbv; 1,3butadiene \u00bc 0.39 ppbv June 2, Night: Benzene \u00bc 0.15 ppbv; 1,3butadiene \u00bc 0.03 ppbv June 3, Day: Benzene \u00bc 2.5 ppbv; 1,3butadiene \u00bc 0.47 ppbv June 3, Night: Benzene \u00bc ND; 1,3butadiene \u00bc 0.03 ppbV What are the time-integrated exposures to benzene (ND \u00bc not detected)? 8. Suggest possible sources of the two compounds above. 9. Should the ND values be used to calculate concentrations and exposures? If so, how? 10. Why is cotinine a better indicator of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke than nicotine? 11. Give two differences between human exposure and ecosystem exposure. 12. If a sensor can reliably measure total volatile organic compounds at concentrations greater 5 ppm and another sensor can detect benzene at 1 ppm, what can be said about the sensitivity and speci\ufb01city of these two sensors? 13. Why is biomonitoring limited in identifying and apportioning sources of air pollutants? 14. Give some reasons that the mean inhalation rates for 6-to 11-year olds are about the same as those over 81-year olds. 15.", "The mean air exchange rate for building in the U.S. is 0.45 air exchanges per hour; whereas the 10th percentile is 0.18 air exchanges per hour. What factor would put a building into this lower exchange rate category? 16. In the U.S., the mean time waiting at a bus or train stop varies by race, age, educational level, part-time vs full-time work schedule, and other factors. How should such information be used in estimating possible exposures to air pollutants, as well as how to reduce these exposures? 17. If the measurement objective is to estimate emission rates to the atmosphere from sources, what types of monitoring can be used? 18. If the measurement objective is to assess personal exposures to air pollutants, what types of monitoring can be used? 19. A study to determine the total amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons inhaled by people in townhomes omits the amount released from the carpet. Also, the classi\ufb01cation of whether a home is a townhome is based on home size and whether the street address has a letter in it (e.g. 210A, Carson Street or 1212D Wilson Drive). What types of error are contributing to the uncertainty in this study? 20. If a power plant burns coal that has 10 mgHgkg 1 emits 2 mgm 3 and later burns coal with 150 mgHg kg 1 emits 10 mgm 3, estimate the emissions at this power plant for coal containing 400 mgHg kg 1. What important assumptions must you make for this estimate? References 1. World Health Organization.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 9 Respiratory Effects of Air Pollutants 9.1 RESPIRATION IN HUMANS In the previous chapter, the discussion of exposure to air pollutants began with two equations for the inhalation route of exposure, which re\ufb02ect the two major respi ratory phases, particulate and vapor: \u00f0C\u00de$\u00f0PC\u00de$\u00f0IR\u00de$\u00f0RF\u00de$\u00f0EL\u00de$\u00f0AF\u00de$\u00f0ED\u00de$ 10 6 E \u00bc \u00f0BW\u00de$\u00f0TL\u00de (9.1) \u00f0C\u00de$\u00f0IR\u00de$\u00f0EL\u00de$\u00f0AF\u00de$\u00f0ED\u00de E \u00bc \u00f0BW\u00de$\u00f0TL\u00de (9.2) The \ufb01rst equation addresses inhalation of particulate matter (PM) and the second equation the inhalation of vapors and gases.a Both equations include an inhalation rate (IR). In addition, Eqn (9.1) includes a respirable fraction, since exposure to particles needs to re\ufb02ect the amount that actually penetrates into the respiratory system. Equation (9.2) lacks this term. Vapors do not need this fractionation because vapors are assumed to be completely respirable, given the gas laws. Thus, respiration is arguably the most important means by which humans and other breathing animals encounter air pollutants. By extension, respiratory effects are the most direct health outcomes associated with air pollutants. The human body and other biological systems have a tremendous capacity for the uptake of myriad types of chemicals; thereafter either utilizing them for some bodily function or eliminating them from the body. As analytical capabilities have improved, increasingly lower concentrations of chemicals have been observed in various parts of the body. Some of these chemicals enter the body by inhalation. The primary function of the human respiratory system is to deliver O2 to the bloodstream and to remove CO2 from the body. These two processes occur concurrently as the breathing cycle is repeated. Air containing O2 \ufb02ows into the nose and/or mouth and down through the upper airway to the alveolar region, where O2 diffuses across the lung wall to the bloodstream. The counter\ufb02ow involves transfer of CO2 from the blood to the alveolar region and then up the airways and out the nose and mouth. Because of the extensive interaction of the respiratory system with the surrounding atmosphere, air pollutants or trace gases can be delivered to the respiratory system. The anatomy of the respiratory system is shown in Figure 9.1. This system may be divided into three regions: the nasal, tracheobronchial, and pulmonary. The nasal region is composed of the nose and mouth cavities and the throat. The tracheobronchial region begins with the trachea and extends through the bronchial tubes to the alveolar sacs. The pulmonary region is composed of the terminal bronchi and alveolar sacs, where gas exchange with the circulatory system occurs. Figure 9.1 illustrates the continued bifurcation of the trachea to form many branching pathways of increasingly smaller diameter through which air moves to the pulmonary region. The trachea branches into the right and left bronchi. Each bronchus divides and subdivides at least 20 times; the smallest units, bronchioles, are located deep in the lungs. The bronchioles end in about 3 million air sacs, the alveoli.", "The behavior of particles and gases in the respiratory system is greatly in\ufb02uenced by the region of the lung in which they are located.1 Air passes through the upper region and is humidi\ufb01ed and brought to body temperature by gaining or losing heat. After the air is channeled through the trachea to the \ufb01rst bronchi, the \ufb02ow is divided at each subsequent bronchial bifurcation until very little apparent \ufb02ow is occurring within the alveolar sacs. Mass transfer is controlled by molecular diffusion in this \ufb01nal region. Because of the very different \ufb02ows in the various sections of the respiratory region, particles suspended in air and gaseous air pollutants are treated differently in the lung. Particle behavior in the lung is dependent on the aerodynamic characteristics of particles in \ufb02ow streams. In contrast, the major factor for gases is the solubility of a See Chapter 8 for de\ufb01nitions of these terms. Fundamentals of Air Pollution 247 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00009-8 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 9. RESPIRATORY EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS Body wall Bronchus Pleura covering the lung Alveoli Space occupied by heart Right lung Left lung cut open the gaseous molecules in the linings of the different re gions of the respiratory system. The aerodynamic prop 1.0 erties of particles are related to their size, shape, and 0.90 density. The behavior of a chain type or \ufb01ber may also 0.80 be dependent on its orientation to the direction of \ufb02ow. The deposition of particles in different regions of the res piratory system depends on their size. The nasal open ings permit very large dust particles to enter the nasal region, along with much \ufb01ner airborne PM. Particles in the atmosphere can range from less than 0.01 mmto Deposition fraction 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 more than 50 mm in diameter.b The relationship between 0.20 the aerodynamic size of particles and the regions where they are deposited is shown in Figure 9.2. Larger parti-0.10 cles are deposited in the nasal region by impaction on the hairs of the nose or at the bends of the nasal passages. Smaller particles pass through the nasal region and are deposited in the tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions. Particles are removed by impacts with the walls of the bronchi when they are unable to follow the gaseous streamline \ufb02ow through subsequent bifurcations of the bronchial tree. As the air\ufb02ow decreases near the terminal bronchi, the smallest particles are removed by Brownian motion, which pushes them to the alveolar membrane. The respiratory system has several mechanisms for removing deposited aerosols. The walls of the nasal and tracheobronchial regions are coated with a mucous \ufb02uid. Nose blowing, sneezing, coughing, and swallowing help to remove particles from the upper airways. 0.01 0.050.1 0.51.0 5 10 50100 Mass median diameter (\u00b5m) FIGURE 9.2 Particle deposition as a function of particle diameter in various regions of the lung.

Task group on lung dynamics. Health Phys 1996;12:173. The tracheobronchial walls have \ufb01ber cilia, which sweep the mucous \ufb02uid upward, transporting particles to the top of the trachea, where they are swallowed. This mechanism is often referred to as the mucociliary escalator. In the pulmonary region of the respiratory system, foreign particles can move across the epithelial lining of the alveolar sac to the lymph or blood systems, b Particles larger than 50 mm deposit soon after emission, so are seldom found in ambient measurements. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 9.2 LUNG KINETICS 249 or they may be engulfed by scavenger cells called alveolar macrophages. The macrophages can move to the mucociliary escalator for removal. For gases, solubility controls removal from the airstream. Highly soluble gasessuchasSO2 are absorbed in the upper airways, whereaslesssoluble gasessuchasNO2 and ozone (O3) may penetrate to the pulmonary region. Irritant gases are thought to stimulate neuroreceptors in the respiratory walls and cause a variety of responses, including sneezing, coughing, bronchoconstriction, and rapid, shallow breathing. The dissolved gas may be eliminated by biochemical processes or may diffuse to the circulatory system. Since the location of particle deposition in the lungs is a function of a particle\u2019s aerodynamic diameter and density, changing the characteristics of aerosols can greatly affect their likelihood to elicit an effect. Larger particles (>5 mm) tend to deposit before reaching the lungs, especially being captured by ciliated cells that line the upper airway.", "Moderately sized particles (1e5 mm) are more likely to deposit in the central and peripheral airways and in the alveoli but are often scavenged by macrophages. Particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 1 mm remain suspended in air and are generally exhaled. Recent studies have shown that large drug particles may be able to evade macrophages past the ciliated cells of the upper respiratory tract and deep into the lungs. Air pollution respiration can be viewed as the opposite of drug delivery. That is, it is desirable to limit and eliminate the respiratory transport of an air pollutant into the lungs, whereas it is desirable to maximize the amount of a drug\u2019s respiratory transport. Thus, characteristics that are desirable from a drug delivery perspective, e.g. small aerodynamic diameter, are undesirable for an air pollutant. Drug delivery attempts to avoid processes that override and pass by anatomical and physiological mechanisms. Optimal particle slip, shape, and density, as well as porosity of the particles have been changed to deliver drug aerosols suf\ufb01ciently large to evade macrophages past the ciliated cells of the upper respiratory tract, so that the drug may penetrate deeply into the lungs.2 Pharmaceutical aerosol design has usually sought a standard size range of 1e5 mm, but a recent study used particles of nonstandardized density and aerodynamic diameter. Speci\ufb01cally, the researchers expect that large porous particles would have the mass and dynamics of smaller particles but since they are bigger they would more effectively evade scavenging macrophages in the alveoli. Thus, doses would be less frequent, since more of the medicine would penetrate to the desired, deeper locations in the lungs.3 Air pollutant particles with these properties would have to be removed since they are so bioavailable. 9.2 LUNG KINETICS Respiratory pharmacokinetics is complex. Absorption is essential to drug delivery, but needs to be avoided in air pollution (e.g. respirators to prevent intake and absorption). The same is true for distribution. Distribution of more drug and less pollutant is desirable. However, metabolism is not so binary. For drugs, metabolism is only desirable for drugs that are designed to break down in target tissue, but earlier metabolism is to be avoided since less of the drug can \ufb01nd its way to the target. Also, metabolism at sites other than the target tissue can produce toxic products, e.g. side effects. For pollutants, metabolism is usually desirable since the \ufb01rst phases often increase aqueous solubility of pollutants, which increases elimination. However, metabolism may also lead to bioactivation, i.e. producing a metabolite that is more toxic than the parent or a previous metabolite. The lung is quite capable of biologically transforming compounds in an attempt to detoxify them. In some instances, the biotransformation of a compound can result in producing more chemically reactive metabolites of rather persistent molecules. Unfortunately, this lung metabolism sometimes produces metabolites that are more toxic than the parent compound. Indeed, lung tissue is known to activate procarcinogens, i.e. compounds that only become carcinogenic after being metabolized. These include the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and N-nitrosamines. The reactive intermediate metabolites increase the formation of DNA adducts. The adduct is a part of the DNA molecule that becomes covalently bonded to a cancer-causing compound, which is the initiation of a cancer cell. As mentioned in Chapter 8, DNA adducts are used as exposure biomarkers. Bioactivation in the lungs occurs by the expression of enzymes to break down air pollutants that enter. Prominent among the enzymes is the cytochrome P450 enzyme, which catalyzes oxidative metabolism in many organic compounds, but can also induce bio-activation of certain classes, including substances that promote cancer, i.e. procarcinogens. Cytochrome P450 is the most prominent member of the superfamily (CYP)ofalargeand assorted groupofenzymes (i.e. biological catalysts that accelerate oxidation of organic compounds). These reactions usually involve metabolic intermediates, e.g. lipids and steroidal hormones, as well as toxic chemicals that have entered an organism. CYPs account for about three-fourths of the total number of different metabolic reactions.4 The most common reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450 is the insertion of an oxygen atom from molecular oxygen into an organic substrate (RH) while reducing II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 9. RESPIRATORY EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS the other oxygen atom (i.e. a monooxygenase reaction): RH D O2 D NADPH D H D / ROH D H2O D NADP D (9.3) NADP is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, which is a coenzyme occurring in most living cells. It is similar to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, i.e. another coenzyme that also exists in cells.", "Both are oxidizing or reducing agents involved in various metabolic processes, but generally for different classes of organic compounds. A coenzyme is an organic molecule that binds with the protein molecule to form the active enzyme. NADPH is the reduced form of NADP. Pollutant-metabolizing P450 enzymes are expressed in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, Clara cells, type II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages.5 Metabolism occurs in three phases (see Figure 9.3): 1. Phase IdModi\ufb01cation 2. Phase IIdConjugation 3. Phase IIIdAdvanced modi\ufb01cation and excretion Phase I includes the CYP reactions mentioned above. Phase I reactions include oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen, and other reactions assisted by mixed-function oxidases. If the metabolites of phase I reactions are suf\ufb01ciently polar, they may be readily excreted directly after phase I. However, many phase I products are slowly metabolized and need a subsequent reaction whereby the endogenous FIGURE 9.3 Metabolic transformation of an inhaled lipophilic pollutant. The process moves from right to left. Phase I modi\ufb01es the compound chemically by oxidation, reduction, and/or hydrolysis, which increases the reactivity of metabolites so that they can be conjugated in phase II. This may be followed by additional processes that increase the metabolite\u2019s aqueous solubility, yet less chemically reactive metabolites that are more easily eliminated. However, these steps can also yield more toxic metabolites, i.e. bioactivation occurs. GST, glutathione S-transferase; UGT, UDP-glucuronyltransferase; EH, epoxide hydrolase; ST, sulfotransferase; NAT, N-acetyltransferase. Ref. 5. substrate combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly polar conjugate. These enzymatic reactions add or expose functional groups, e.g. eOH, eSH, eNH2,or eCOOH, to organic compounds. These are the sites at which further reactions can occur, which is analogous to a hook on which numerous items can be attached. For example, p-nitroanisole is converted to p-nitrophenol by exposing the molecule to attack at the more polar eOCH2OH site (see Figure 9.4). Another common phase I reaction is by oxidation via conversion of a CeH bond to a CeOH, such as forming phenol during phase I metabolism of benzene (Figure 9.5). Thus, phase I metabolism consists of slight changes in molecular weight and increased polarity, setting up the molecule for subsequent phase II reactions.6 In subsequent phase II metabolism, enzymatic reactions result in the conjugation of large water-soluble, charged (polar) biomolecules. This occurs at a functional group site on either the parent compound or its phase I metabolite. These reactions are catalyzed by broadly speci\ufb01c transferases that enhance metabolism of lipophilic compounds with nucleophilic or electrophilic groups. The four primary phase II enzymes are glucuronosyltransferase, sulfotransferase, glutathione S-transferase and acetyltransferase. Their properties and mechanisms are similar to the CYP and other phase I enzymes. An example of phase II II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 9.3 AIR POLLUTANT PROPERTIES IMPORTANT TO RESPIRATION metabolism is shown in Figure 9.6. Following phase II, the conjugates may be further metabolized and excreted from cells in phase III. 9.3 AIR POLLUTANT PROPERTIES IMPORTANT TO RESPIRATION The properties of air pollutants greatly in\ufb02uence their potential for respiration and the rate of exposure. For particulates, size, soluble fraction, and density are very important. For gaseous pollutants, vapor pressure, density, and solubility are key. For example, ultra\ufb01ne particles (diameter <100 nm) can penetrate very deeply into the lungs. Air pollutants with high vapor pressures are more likely to stay aloft since they will be more likely to remain in the vapor phase compared to lower vapor pressure compounds. Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor in a con\ufb01ned space. Similarly vaporization is the change of a liquid or solid to the vapor phase. So, if a substance vaporizes it can enter a plume. Thus, a principal means of a substance being released as a plume is volatilization, which is a function of the concentration of a contaminant in solution and the contaminant\u2019s partial pressure. Henry\u2019s law states that the concentration of a dissolved gas is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution: pa \u00bc KH\u00bdc (9.4) where, KH \u00bc Henry\u2019s law constant pa \u00bc Partial pressure of the gas [c] \u00bc Molar concentration of the gas or, pA \u00bc KHCW (9.5) where CW is the concentration of gas in water. As is discussed in detail in Chapter 18, Henry\u2019s law is an expression of this proportionality between the concentration of a dissolved contaminant and its partial pressure in the headspace (including the open atmosphere) at equilibrium.", "A dimensionless version impor tant to respiration is the airewater partitioning coef\ufb01cient (KAW): CAKAW \u00bc CW (9.6) where CA is the concentration of a gas or vapor in air. The relationship between the air/water partition coef\ufb01cient and Henry\u2019s law constant for a substance is KH KAW \u00bc (9.7) RT 2 11 where R is the gas constant (8.21 10 l atm mol K ) and T is the temperature (K). Henry\u2019s law presents a limiting factor for systems where a substance\u2019s partial pressure is approaching zero. At very high partial pressures, (e.g. 30 Padhigh by ambient atmospheric standards) or at very high contaminant concentrations (e.g. >1000 ppm), Henry\u2019s law assumptions cannot be met. Such vapor pressures and concentrations are seldom seen in ambient environmental situations, but may be seen in industrial and other source situations. Thus, in modeling and estimating the tendency for a substance\u2019s release in vapor form, Henry\u2019s law is a useful metric and is often used in compartmental transport models to indicate the fugacity from the water to the atmosphere. Fugacity, the tendency for a substance to leave one compartment (e.g. water) and join another (e.g. air), will be discussed in detail in Chapter 18. It should be noted that air pollution is dynamic and that air pollutants are continuously undergoing physical and chemical changes. Indeed, the \ufb01rst two equations in this chapter may imply that pollutants are either particulate or vapor. Actually, the same substance can be both, as indicated by Henry\u2019s law. Some of the substance will be in liquid or solid phase and some in vapor phase. In the opposite phase partitioning, the vapor phase substance can be deposited or undergo aerosolization. In air pollution engineering and the environmental sciences, the use of the term \u201cphase\u201d is nuanced from that of physics. In atmospheric sciences the most important phase distribution is that of vapor versus particulate phase. The distinction between gases and vapors has to do with the physical phase that a substance would be under environmental conditions, e.g. at standard temperature and pressure. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 9. RESPIRATORY EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS PM is inclusive of all particles, whether liquid or solid. An aerosol is a liquid or solid particle that is suspended in a gas; in environmental sciences this gas is usually air, but in reactors, stacks, and other nonambient conditions, this can be various \ufb02ue gases. Standard atmospheric conditions can be de\ufb01ned as 1 atm pressure (760 mmHg) and 25 C (298.15 K).7 PM is an important vector for pollutant transport (e.g. moved by advection, or dissolved in or sorbed to aerosols). As mentioned, in the United States, the Clean Air Act established the ambient standard (National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)) for PM. In 1971, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) required measurements of total suspended particulates (TSP) as measured by a high-volume sampler, i.e. a device that collected particles of a large range of sizes (aerodynamic diameters up to 50 mm). Smaller particles are more likely to be inhaled than larger particles, so in 1987 the US EPA changed the standard for PM from TSP to PM10, i.e. particle matter 10 mm diameter. The diameter most often used for airborne particle measurements is the \u201caerodynamic diameter\u201d. The aerodynamic diameter (Dpa) for all particles greater than 0.5 mm can be approximated as the product of the Stokes particle diameter (Dps) and the square root of the particle density (rp): p\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03 Dpa \u00bcDps rp (9.8) If the unit of the diameters is micrometers, the unit of density is grams per cubic centimeter. The Stokes diameter Dps is the diameter of a sphere with the same density and settling velocity as the particle. The Stokes diameter is derived from the aerodynamic drag force caused by the difference in velocity Electrostatic impaction of the particle and the surrounding \ufb02uid. Thus, for smooth, spherical particles, the Stokes diameter is identical to the physical or actual diameter. Following the passage of the Clean Air Act, the NAAQS for PM10 was set as a 24 h average of 150 mgm 3 (not to exceed this level more than once per year), and an annual average of 50 mgm 3 arithmetic mean. However, subsequent research showed the need to protect people breathing even smaller PM in air, since most of the particles that penetrate deeply into the aireblood exchange regions of the lung are very small.", "Thus, in 1997, the US EPA added a new \ufb01ne particle (diameters 2.5), known as PM2.5.8 Gases \ufb02ow with the air, but aerosols deposit differentially within the airway by mechanical processes: (1) diffusion; (2) interception; (3) inertial impaction; and (4) electrostatics (see Figure 9.7). These same processes are at work in the respiratory system after the aerosol is inhaled. 9.4 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM TRANSPORT AND FLUID DYNAMICS Air pollutants can damage the \ufb02uid dynamics in the respiratory system either directly (e.g. airway in\ufb02ammation) or indirectly (e.g. by altering its immune response). Susceptibility to air pollutants differs among individuals, as exempli\ufb01ed by several diseases and conditions (e.g. asthma), but the \ufb02uid dynamics are the same, i.e. disruption of the movement of air into the lungs to provide oxygen. The motion of air and gases in the respiratory system follow fundamental \ufb02uid dynamics theory.9 The motion of these \ufb02uids is governed by the conservation of mass (continuity) equation and conservation of momentum (NaviereStokes) equation. Under most conditions, the \ufb02ow of air in the respiratory airways is assumed to be incompressible. For incompressible \ufb02ow, the continuity equation is expressed as V$V \u00bc0 (9.9) And, the continuity equation is vV \u00fe\u00f0V$V\u00deV \u00bcrf Vp \u00femV2V (9.10) vt where V is a gradient operator; V2 is a Laplacian operator; V is velocity; r is \ufb02uid density; m is absolute \ufb02uid viscosity; p is the hydrodynamic density; and f is a volumetric force that is applied externally, e.g. gravity. For cylindrical pro\ufb01les like bronchi, the gradient operator V can be expressed in cylindrical coordinates: surement short course.

Equations can be tailored to these conditions or idealized velocity pro\ufb01les can be assumed for the cascade of generations. These include parabolic \ufb02ow (laminar fully developed), plug \ufb02ow (laminar undeveloped), and turbulent \ufb02ow.10 For example, the upper tracheobronchial airways may be assumed to be turbulent, but in the pulmonary region, plug and parabolic pro\ufb01les may be assumed. The right and left lungs are connected via their primary bronchi to the trachea and upper airway of the nose and mouth (see Figure 9.1). From there, the bronchi, i.e. airways, subdivide into a branching network of many levels. Each level, called a generation, is designated with an integer. The trachea are generation n \u00bc0, the primary bronchi are generation n \u00bc1, and so forth. Thus, theoretically there are 2n airway tubes at generation n. For generations 0 n 16, known as the conducting zone, gas \ufb02ow is restricted to entry and exit in the airway.11 That is, air is moving, but there is no aireblood gas exchange of O2 and CO2. The generations n > 16 comprise the respiratory zone, where air exchange takes place. Generations 17 n 19 are where air sacs (alveoli), which range from 75 to 300 mm in diameter, become present on the airway walls. Alveoli are thin-walled and owing to the rich capillary blood supply are designed for gas exchange. These are the respiratory bronchioles.", "For generations 20 n 22, the walls of the tubes or ducts consist entirely of alveoli. At generation n \u00bc23, terminal alveolar sacs are made up clusters of alveoli. Two principal factors relevant to gas exchange are the airway volume (Vaw) and airway surface area (Aaw), which are proportional to the size of the person. Air exchange increases in proportion to Aaw. The Vaw (millili ters) for children is proportional to height and is 12approximated as Vaw \u00bc1:018 Height\u00f0cm\u00de 76:2 (9.18) Vaw (milliliters) can be estimated for adults by adding the ideal body weight (pounds) plus age in years.13 For example, a 40-year-old adult whose ideal body weight is 160 pounds has an estimated Vaw of 200 ml.14 Alveoli are abundant in the lung, i.e. the average lung has from 300 to 500 million of these air sacs. In an average adult lung, the total alveolar surface area is II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 9. RESPIRATORY EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS 70 m2. This large Aaw allows not only for ef\ufb01cient gas exchange to supply O2 for normal respiration but also for large increases in gas exchange needed when a person is stressed (e.g. during exercise, injury, or illness). The Reynolds number (see Chapters 1 and 6) varies by generation (very high in the trachea, but low in the alveoli).11 Airways have liquid lining, with two layers in the \ufb01rst generations (up to about n \u00bc 15). A watery (Newtonian), serous layer is next to the airway wall. This layer has cilia that pulsate toward the mouth. Atop the serous layer is a mucus layer that possesses several non-Newtonian \ufb02uid properties, e.g. viscoelasticity, shear thinning, and a yield stress. Alveolar cells produce surfactants that orient at the aireliquid interface and reduce the surface tension signi\ufb01cantly. Air pollutants can adversely affect the surfactant chemistry, which can make the lungs overly rigid, thus hindering in\ufb02ation.11 A pulmonary surfactant is a surface-active lipoprotein complex (phospholipoprotein) produced by type II pneumocytes also called alveolar type II cells. These pneumocytes are granular and comprise 60% of the alveolar lining cells. Their morphology allows them to cover smaller surface areas than type I pneumocytes. Type I cells are highly attenuated, very thin (25 nm) cells that line the alveolar surfaces and cover 97% of the alveolar surface. Surfactant molecules have both a hydrophilic head and a lipophilic tail. Surfactants adsorb to the airewater interface of the alveoli with the hydrophilic head in the water, while the hydrophobic tail is directed toward the air. The principal lipid component of surfactant, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, is responsible for the decreasing surface tension. The actual surface tension decrease depends on the surfactant\u2019s concentration on the interface. This concentration\u2019s saturation limit depends on temperature and the presence of other compounds in the interface. Surface area of the lung varies during compliance (i.e. lung and thorax expansion and contraction) during ventilation. Thus, the surfactant\u2019s interface concentration is seldom at the level of saturation. During lung expansion (inspiration), the surface increases, opening space for new surfactant molecules to join the interface mixture. During expiration, lung surface area decreases, compressing the surfactant and increasing the density of surfactant molecules, thus further decreasing the surface tension. Therefore, surface tension varies with air volume in the lungs, which protects the lungs from atelectasis at low air volume and tissue damage at high air volume.15ae15c The size of the particle is indirectly proportional to its depth of lung penetration. Aerosol measurement is usually an expression of the mass of a particle and size of particle. Prior to 1997, the primary (health) standard for PM10 was a 24 h average of 150 mgm 3 (not to exceed this level more than once per year), and an annual average of 50 mgm 3 arithmetic mean. However, this standard did not provide suf\ufb01cient protection for people breathing PM-contaminated air, since most of the particles that penetrate deeply into the aireblood exchange regions of the lung are quite small, with aerodynamic diameters much smaller than 10 microns (see Figure 9.9). The smallest particles, known as the respirable fraction, required additional attention. Thus, in 1997, the US EPA added a new \ufb01ne particle (diameter 2.5), known as PM2.5.8 FIGURE 9.9 Three regions of the respiratory system 100% where particle matter is deposited. The inhalable fraction remains in the mouth and head area.", "The thoracic fraction is the mass that penetrates the airways of the respiratory sys tem, while the smallest fractions, i.e. the respirable particu lates, are those that can in\ufb01ltrate most deeply into the alveolar region. Percent aerosols found in region 0% 1 10 10 Particle aerodynamic diameter (\u03bcm) II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION Basically, lung \ufb01ltration consists of four mechanical processes:c (1) diffusion; (2) interception; (3) inertial impaction; and (4) electrostatics (see Figure 9.7). Diffusion is important only for very small particles ( 0.1 mm diameter) because the Brownian motion allows them to move in a \u201crandom walk\u201d away from the airstream. Interception works mainly for particles with diameters between 0.1 and 1 mm. The particle does not leave the airstream but comes into contact with matter (e.g. lung tissue). Inertial impaction collects particles suf\ufb01ciently large to leave the airstream by inertia (diameter 1 mm). Electrostatics consist of electrical interactions between the atoms in a surface and those in the particle at the point of contact (Van der Waal\u2019s force), as well as electrostatic attraction (charge differences between particle and surface). Other important factors affecting lung \ufb01ltration are surface stickiness, uniformity of particle diameters, the solid volume fraction, the rate of particle loading onto tissue surfaces, the particle phase (whether liquid or solid), capillarity and surface tension, and characteristics of air in the airway, such as humidity, velocity, temperature, pressure, and viscosity. 9.5 RESPIRATORY HEALTH EFFECTS Air pollutants cause many respiratory diseases, both acute and chronic. Acute diseases include a range from mild irritations to in\ufb02ammation to allergic reactions to impaired lung function to complete respiratory failure depending on the level of exposure. Chronic diseases include chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), cardiovascular diseases, asthma, and lung and other cancers. Oxidative stress initiated by air pollutants appears to play a large role in such chronic diseases. Principal vapor phase air pollutants that are associated with non-cancer effects of the respiratory system include ozone, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, as well as PM. Numerous organic compounds, e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, have been linked to respiratory system cancers (e.g. lung cancer). PM in various forms has been associated with cancer, including the organic fraction of the aerosol. Asbestos and other \ufb01bers have been linked to long-term effects, including mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis. Dust from coal has been associated with pneumoconiosis (so-called black lung disease). Dust from crushing silica-containing rocks has been linked to silicosis. Textile \ufb01ber exposures have led to byssinosis (so-called brown lung disease), which may result from bacteria in cotton (thus, a combined physicalechemicalebiological air pollutant). Exposure to elevated concentrations of tropospheric (ground-level) ozone is particularly harmful to people with asthma or lung disease and children who are more likely than adults to have asthma, which is aggravated by ozone. Chronic, continuous exposure to ozone for even short periods may cause children to have more breathing problems as adults. Older adults are more susceptible to lung disease. People engaged in heavy work or exercise are also at risk, since their ventilation rates and thus respiratory exposure doses are elevated. Infants are particularly vulnerable since their lungs continue to develop after birth and proli\ufb01c tissue is more easily affected by air pollutants. Tobacco smoke has been identi\ufb01ed as a key factor in North America and Europe in the development and progression of COPD. Numerous air pollutants in the home and workplace can be synergistic with one another and with genetic factors and respiratory infections to increase the incidence and severity of COPD. In developing nations, indoor air quality plays a large role in the development and progression of COPD.16 Both conventional pollutants and air toxins are associated with respiratory effects. In addition to effects in the respiratory system, the conveyance and distribution of air pollutants and their metabolites lead to problems in other parts of the body, especially cardiovascular problems. These are the subject of the next chapter. QUESTIONS 1. Highlight the differences between Equation 9.1 and Equation 9.2. 2.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 10 Cardiovascular Effects of Air Pollutants 10.1 HUMAN CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Chapter 9 describes the mechanisms by which the respiratory system (Figure 9.1) provides oxygen to the body. All air-breathing animals need oxygen for metabolism. After intake, the molecular oxygen (O2) must be distributed throughout the body for energy exchange and building cells. This is the purpose of the cardiovascular system. In a way, all the effects discussed in Chapter 9 also damage the cardiovascular system. Reduced O2-carrying capacity, e.g. increased carboxyhemoglobin and decreased hemoglobin levels resulting from CO, damages the cardiovascular system generally and the heart speci\ufb01cally. Also, toxicity to lung and other respiratory system cells and tissue from hazardous air pollutants cause additional damage to the cardiovascular system. This chapter addresses speci\ufb01c types of cardiovascular damage caused by air pollutants. However, it should be kept in mind that every system within an organism is interrelated. Thus, damage to the respiratory, endocrine, neurological, reproductive, and immunological systems will often be accompanied by effects in the cardiovascular system. 10.2 CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND AIR POLLUTION ASSOCIATIONS Rigorous studies of the association of short-term cardiovascular effects in human populations can be traced to a number of episodes in industrialized urban areas in the twentieth century (see Discussion Box: Infamous Air Pollution Episodes). This led to the passage of legislation and regulations around the world to address air pollution, notably the Clean Air Act of 1970 in the United States. Recent decades have seen a growth in the evidence and number of studies linking air pollution to cardiovascular diseases.1,2 INFAMOUS AIR POLLUTION EPISODES Meuse Valley, Belgium During the period December 1e5, 1930, an intense fog occupied the heavily industrialized Meuse Valley between Liege and Huy (about 24 km apart) in eastern Belgium.3 Several hundred persons had respiratory attacks primarily beginning on December 4, with 63 persons dying on December 4 and 5 after a few hours of sickness. On December 6, the fog dissipated; the respiratory dif\ufb01culties improved and, in general, rapidly ceased. The fog began on December 1 under anticyclonic conditions. What little air motion occurred was from the east, causing air to drift up-valley, moving smoke from the city of Lie\u00b4ge and from the large factories southwest of it into the narrow valley. The valley sides extend to about 100 m, and the width of the valley is about 1 km. A temperature inversion extended from the ground to a height of about 90 m, transforming the valley essentially into a tunnel deeper than the height of the stacks in the valley, which were generally around 60 m tall. Much of the particulate matter (PM) had 2e6 mm aerodynamic diameters, i.e. readily respirable (see Chapter 7). The fog was cooled by radiation from the top and warmed by contact with the ground. This caused a gentle convection in the \u201ctunnel\u201d, mixing the pollutants uniformly and resulting in nearly uniform temperature with height. The symptoms of the \ufb01rst patients began on the afternoon of December 3 and seemed to occur simultaneously (Continued) Fundamentals of Air Pollution 257 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00010-4 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 10. CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS INFAMOUS AIR POLLUTION EPISODES (cont\u2019d) along the entire valley. Deaths took place only on December 4 and 5, with the majority at the Liege end of the valley. Those affected were primarily elderly persons who had lung or heart problems. However, some previously healthy persons were among the seriously ill. There were no measurements of pollutants during the episode, but the \ufb01ve Lie\u00b4ge University professors who participated in the subsequent inquiry indicated that part of the sulfur dioxide was probably oxidized to sulfuric acid. Of the 27 factories in the area, 15 were capable of releasing gaseous \ufb02uorine compounds and suggested that the release of these compounds was of signi\ufb01cance.4 During the 30 years prior to the episode, fogs lasting for more than 3 days had occurred only \ufb01ve times, always in winter, in 1901, 1911, 1917, 1919, and 1930. Some respiratory problems were noted in 1911. Industrial activity was at a low level in 1917 and 1919.", "J. Firket,3 professor at the University of Lie`ge, warned that if the episode were replicated in larger populations, the consequences would be magni\ufb01ed: \u201cThis apprehension was quite justi\ufb01ed, when we think that proportionately, the public services of London, for example, might be faced with the responsibility of 3200 sudden deaths if such phenomenon occurred there\u201d. His fear was realized in 1952, when such a catastrophe occurred, as described in \u201cLondon, England\u201d section below. Donora, Pennsylvania A severe episode of atmospheric pollution occurred in Donora, Pennsylvania, during the period October 25e31, 1948.5 Twenty persons died, 17 of them within 14 h on October 30. During this period, a polar high-pressure area remained nearly stationary, with its center in the vicinity of northeastern Pennsylvania. This caused the regional winds, both at the ground and through the lowest layers, to be extremely light. Donora is southeast of Pittsburgh and is in the Monongahela River valley. Cold air accumulated in the bottom of the river valley and fog formed, which persisted past midday for four consecutive days. The top of the fog layer has a high albedo (See Chapter 2). and re\ufb02ects solar radiation, so that only part of the incoming radiation is available to heat the fog layer and eliminate it (Figure 10.1(a)). During the night, longwave radiation leaves the top of the fog layer, further cooling and stabilizing the layer (Figure 10.1(b)). Wind speeds at Donora were less than 3.1 ms 1 (7 miles h 1) from the surface up to 1524 m (5000 ft) for three consecutive days, so that pollutants emitted into the air within the valley were not transported far from their point of emission. Maximum temperatures at Donora at an elevation of 232 m (760 ft) mean sea level were considerably lower than those at the Pittsburgh airport, elevation 381 m (1250 ft), indicating the extreme vertical stability of the atmosphere. Thus, the pollutants were trapped within a stagnant air parcel in the valley. In the vicinity of Donora, there were sources of sulfur dioxide, PM, and carbon monoxide. Previous recorded periods of stagnation had occurred in Donora during October 5e13, 1923, and October 7e18, 1938. London, England A dense 4-day fog occurred in London and its surroundings during December 5e9, 1952.7,8 The fog began as the area came under the in\ufb02uence of an anticyclone approaching from the northwest early on December 5. This system became stationary, so that there was almost no wind until milder weather spread into the area from the west on December 9. Temperatures remained near freezing during the fog. The visibility was unusually restricted, with a 4-day average of less than 20 m over an area approximately 20 by 40 km and visibility of less than 400 m over an area 100 by 60 km. The density of the fog was enhanced by the elevated concentrations of small particles in the air available for condensation of fog droplets. The result was a very large number of very small fog droplets, which make for a more opaque and persistent fog than one that is formed in cleaner air. The depth of the fog layer was variable with diameters, but was generally 100 m or less. Measurements of PM with diameters less than 20 mm and of sulfur dioxide were made at 12 sites in the greater London area. The measurements were made by pumping air through a \ufb01lter paper and then through a hydrogen peroxide solution. The smoke deposit on the \ufb01lter was analyzed by re\ufb02ectometer; the sulfur dioxide was determined by titrating the hydrogen peroxide with standard alkali, thus eliminating interference by carbon dioxide. Using the sampling procedure, sulfur dioxide was measured in two phases, i.e. the gas phase and dissolved in \ufb01ne fog droplets. Any sulfur dioxide associated with larger fog droplets or adsorbed on particles collected on the \ufb01lter not measured. During this time, \u201csmoke\u201d was, by today\u2019s standards, a crude indicator of PM. Smoke concentrations ranged from 0.3 to more than 4 mg m 3. Daily means of the sampling stations are shown in Figure 21.4. Sulfur dioxide measurements ranged from less than 0.1 ppm (260 mgm 3)to 1.34 ppm (3484 mgm 3). Also, 4 of the 11 stations had at least one daily value in excess of 1 ppm, and 9 of the 11 II.

These concentrations indicated unhealthy conditions, e.g. the US primary (health) standard for sulfur dioxide, which is a maximum 24 h concentration of 365 mgm 3 (0.14 ppm), must not be exceeded more than once per year. Daily means are shown in Figure 10.2. The smoke and SO2 means rose and later decreased in concomitantly. Daily concentrations of smoke averaged over all stations rose to about \ufb01ve times normal levels for London at that time and sulfur dioxide to about six times normal, peaking on December 7 and 8, respectively. In addition to the daily measurements at 12 sites, monthly measurements at 117 sites were made using lead peroxide candles. This allowed determination of the spatial pattern. The December 1952 concentrations were about 50% higher than those of December 1951. 1000 From the commencement of the fog and low visibility , many people experienced dif\ufb01culty in breathing; the effects generally occurring simultaneously over a large area of hundreds of square kilometers. The rise in the number of deaths (Figure 10.2) paralleled the mean daily smoke and sulfur dioxide concentrations; daily deaths reached a peak on December 8 and 9, with many of them related to respiratory troubles. Although the deaths decreased with decreasing concentrations, the deaths per day remained considerably above the pre-episode level for some days. A question that needs to be answered is whether most of the persons who died would have died soon afterward anyway. If this were the case, a below-normal death rate would have occurred following the episode. This situation did not seem to exist, but detailed analysis was complicated by increased deaths in January and February 1953, FIGURE 10.2 Daily air pollution (SO2 500 0.50 2.0 and smoke) and deaths during the 1952 London episode.

CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS INFAMOUS AIR POLLUTION EPISODES (cont\u2019d) which were attributed primarily to an in\ufb02uenza outbreak. This also raises the possibility that exposures to air pollutants could have impaired immunity in sensitive groups, which made them more vulnerable to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Those who analyzed these excess deaths (the number of deaths above the normal number for each calendar day) asserted that the level of sulfur dioxide was not near the toxic limit of 10 ppm necessary to affect healthy persons. They attributed the deaths to the synergistic effect of \ufb01ne particles and sulfur dioxide combined. They believed that considerable sulfuric acid mist was formed from the oxidation of sulfur dioxide, but since no measurements were made, its amount was speculative. In the Meuse Valley, Donora, and London episodes, the areas were in\ufb02uenced by high pressure with nearly nonexistent surface air motion. Surface inversions caused the condensation of fog, which, once formed, persisted throughout the day, even during midafternoon. In each case the fog layer was relatively shallow, extending only about 100 m. The persistence of the fog past the third day and the lack of any air transport out of the region, as well as the existence of considerable emissions of pollutants, seem to separate these episodes from more common meteorological occurrences. Both the Meuse Valley and Donora had topography constraining the volume in which the pollutants were con\ufb01ned. This constraint apparently resulted from the lack of any transport wind in the London 1952 episode. Measurements of pollutant concentrations were made only in London. A previous air pollution episode responsible for approximately 300 deaths occurred in London between November 26 and December 1, 1948. Concentrations of smoke and sulfur dioxide were 50e70% of the values during the 1952 episode. Other Episodes The co-occurrence of sulfur compounds and particulates appear to elicit greater air pollution problems.", "For example, just before the infamous London incident, a fog occurred during the period December 3e7, with sulfur dioxide as high as during the 1952 episode, but with particulate concentrations considerably lower due to the partial implementation of the 1956 British Clean Air Act. Excess deaths numbered 340. High pollution levels were measured in the eastern United States between November 27 and December 5, 1962, notably in Washington, DC, Philadelphia, New York, and Cincinnati. Between December 2 and 7, elevated pollution levels were found in Rotterdam; Hamburg, Frankfurt, and the Ruhr area; Paris; and Prague. Pollution levels were high in Osaka between December 7 and 10, and mortality studies, which were under way, indicated 60 excess deaths. An accident under similar meteorological conditions to those of the London incidents, i.e. complicated by fog, weak winds, and a surface inversion, occurred in Poza Rica, Mexico, in the early morning of November 24, 1950, when hydrogen sul\ufb01de was released from a plant for the recovery of sulfur from natural gas. There were 22 deaths, and 320 persons were hospitalized. Recent Air Pollution Emergencies Government authorities increasingly are facing emergencies that may require rapid lifesaving decisions by those on the scene. Of particular concern are transportation accidents involving the movement of volatile hazardous materials. A railroad derailment accident of a tank car carrying lique\ufb01ed chlorine on February 26, 1978, at Young-town, Florida, caused seven people to die. An accident in Houston, Texas, involving a truck carrying anhydrous ammonia on May 11, 1976, also claimed seven lives. There are also many near-misses. Two potentially dangerous situations involved barges with tanks of chlorine: one that sank in the lower Mississippi River and another that came adrift and rested on the Ohio River dam at Louisville, Kentucky; neither resulted in release of material. Just one or a few differences in variables can mean the difference between disaster and prevention. In 1978, US \ufb01re\ufb01ghters and other \ufb01rst responders9 fought a \ufb01re in Chester, Pennsylvania, at a site with large quantities of illegally stored chemicals, among them highly \ufb02ammable, extremely toxic, and highly volatile materials. This is a potentially deadly combination of physical and chemical factors. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were stored at the site. Given their high vapor pressure, even without a \ufb01re, ruptured tanks and other storage devices would likely see large releases of these toxic substances. In addition, the site contained a particularly toxic group of semivolatile compounds (vapor pressures in the range of 10 5e10 2 kPa), the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Semivolatile compounds present special challenges during disasters. Although under normal conditions, they do not vaporize readily, during combustion they can be released in large quantities in aerosol form and be advectively transported within the plume. They may also be transformed to even more toxic compounds, e.g. halogenated dioxins and furans. Both mechanisms increase the danger to \ufb01rst responders and surrounding communities. The \ufb01re and II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 10.2 CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND AIR POLLUTION ASSOCIATIONS INFAMOUS AIR POLLUTION EPISODES (cont\u2019d) explosion hazards were greater than if the substances were merely \ufb02ammable, but less volatile. The intense \ufb01re destroyed one building and caused extensive damage to two others used for stockpiling drummed wastes. Forty-seven \ufb01re\ufb01ghters were hospitalized. In the \ufb01re\u2019s aftermath, there remained a controversial three-acre site, located on the west bank of the Delaware River and in a light industrial area. Residential neighborhoods were within 300 m from the site. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the site had been used as a rubber recycling facility, but was later converted to an illegal industrial waste storage and disposal facility until 1978. Numerous 55 gallon drums were stored on the site, or dumped their contents either directly onto the ground or into trenches, severely contaminating soil and groundwater. In addition to the PCBs, the site stored acids and cyanide salts. Burned building debris, exploded drums, tires, shredded rubber, and contaminated earth littered the property. About 150,000 gallons of waste materials remained on site after the \ufb01re. Most of the wastes were in drums stored in the \ufb01re-damaged buildings. Because of the dumping of contaminants, and the \ufb01re, the groundwater and soil were contaminated with heavy metals including arsenic, chromium, mercury, and lead; these were in addition to the organic contaminants, e.g. PCBs; plastic resins; and VOCs from past disposal activities. Besides the public health menace, the \ufb01re and latent effects of the stored contaminants occurred in an ecologically sensitive area, including nearby wetlands and other habitat for wildlife and marine animals.", "Several cleanup actions were conducted until it was ultimately removed from the Superfund list of most hazardous sites. The site is now a parking area. Bhopal, India On December 2, 1984, the contents of a methyl isocyanate (MIC) storage tank at the Union Carbide India plant in Bhopal became hot. Pressure in the tank became high. Nearly everything that could go wrong did. The refrigerator unit for the tank, which would have slowed the reactions, was turned off. After midnight, when the release valve blew, the vent gas scrubber that was to neutralize the gas with caustic soda failed to work. The \ufb02are tower, which would have burned the gas to harmless byproducts, was down for repairs. As a result many tons of MIC were released from the tank. The gas spread as a foglike cloud over a large, highly populated area to the south and east of the plant10,11 . The number of fatalities was in excess of 2000 people with thousands of others injured. Although little meteorological information is available, it is assumed that winds were quite light and that the atmosphere at this time of day was relatively stable. Thus, stable atmospheric conditions made for longer exposure to elevated MIC concentrations. Nuclear Accidents Releases of radioactive materials from nuclear power plants have occurred, with concentrations suf\ufb01cient to require evacuation of residents. On April 26, 1986, shortly after midnight local time, a serious accident occurred at a nuclear power plant in Chernobyl in the Ukraine. It is estimated that 4% of the core inventory was released between April 26 and May 6. Quantities of Cs-137 (cesium) and I-131 (iodine) were released and transported, resulting in contamination, primarily by wet deposition of cesium, in Finland, northern Sweden and Norway, the Alps, and the northern parts of Greece. Because of temperatures of several thousand kelvin during the explosion-like release, the resulting pollutant cloud is assumed to have reached heights of 2000 m or more. The estimated southeast winds at plume level initially moved the plume toward Finland, northern Sweden, and northern Norway. As winds at plume level gradually turned more easterly and \ufb01nally north and northwesterly, contaminated air affected the region of the Alps and northern Greece. Modeling the long-range transport including wet and dry removal processes con\ufb01rmed the regions affected.12 Elevated levels of radioactivity were measured throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Because of the half-life of about 30 years for Cs-137, the contamination will endure. More recently, in March of 2011, a tsunami and its aftermath led to large scale releases of radioactive material. The plume from the Fukushima nuclear disaster did not have the initial energy of the Chernobyl plume and the heavy elements appeared to remain in the reactor, whereas the volatiles, especially I-131, were transported advectively with the plume. Iodine from Fukushima was detected in Scotland a few days after the disaster. The initial winds blew towards the East, but after 2 days the winds changes rotation towards the southwest for a day, before becoming westerlies. A reason for the small exclusion zone of only 20 km in the case of Fukushima was as a result of the low energy of the explosion. Relatively little heavy material was ejected from the reactor. As in most nuclear power plant releases, I-131 and Cs-137 were transported in the plume. Radioactive iodine was detected in California, but by the time the plume reached the US West coast the level of radioactivity was very low. A large (Continued) II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 10. CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS INFAMOUS AIR POLLUTION EPISODES (cont\u2019d) number of evacuees had decamped to an area southwest of Fukushima. Radiation levels there, 2 days after the accident, were apparently higher than at the boundary of the accident site. The heavier cesium in the plume was deposited in a line southwest of Fukushima. The accident contaminated 8% of Japanese land with Cs-137 (half-life is 30 years). World Trade Center, New York On September 11, 2001, terrorists intentionally crashed fully fueled Boeing 767 jets into the twin towers of the heavily populated World Trade Center (WTC; Figure 10.3). The burning fuel, building materials, and building contents, as well as the \ufb01bers and particles released during the collapse were the source of dangerous gas and particle-phase pollutants released throughout the city. In addition to the immediate threat, the \ufb01re smoldered for months following the attack. The \ufb01re was a source of a variety of pollutants (Figure 10.3).", "A number of air pollutants and indicators of air pollution were measured at monitoring sites around the site. Concentrations of all measured pollutants were generally highest in September and October and declined to levels more typical for New York City by November and December. Concentrations of pollutants were highest near the site of the twin towers, known as Ground Zero, decreasing with distance, showing a signi\ufb01cant decrease at a measurement site 0.5 km away. Dust composition differed among samples from the initial collapse, near underground \ufb01res, and during demolition/debris removal. Concentrations were highest until the \ufb01res were extinguished (December 19, 2001), after which the concentrations dropped and remained lower during the subsequent monitoring through February 2002. The analyses of air pollutants following the disaster are provide in Table 10.1. Concentrations of PM2.5 and lead (Pb), for which there are 24 h daily observations at the Ground Zero and downwind sites were highly variable through the end of October. The highest PM2.5 concentrations occurred at Ground Zero in October (400 mgm 3), dropping afterNovember(<100 mgm 3). Theparticleconcentrations decreased with distance from Ground Zero, as evidenced by only one reading at remote sites in October near 100 mgm 3, and the rest of the measurements consistently below 50 mgm 3. Concentrations of coarse PM (particles between 2.5 and 10 mm) were initially equivalent to PM2.5 at the downwind site, but steadily decreased until the \ufb01res were extinguished. After December, coarse PM concentrations dropped to approximately 30% of PM10, which is typically observed. This is supported by the number of particles in discrete size intervals (i.e. the particle size distribution from 0.3 to 10 mm). The trends for Pb were similar. The highest Pb concentrations occurred at Ground Zero in September and October (6 mgm 3), dropping in November (about 0.1 mgm 3). As for PM, the lowest overall Pb concentrations were observed with distance from Ground Zero, highest in October and November (<1 mgm 3) and the rest of the measurements consistently below 0.3 mgm 3, through January 2002. The difference in PM2.5 and Pb concentrations was less marked between the Ground Zero sites and the downwind site after December. However, metals associated with steel, i.e. manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe), exhibited a different temporal trend. From October to December, concentrations of Mn and Fe steadily increased at Ground Zero and to a lesser degree at the downwind site. These Mn and Fe increases were likely due to the increased cutting of steel beams during debris removal. As these activities decreased, i.e. after December, Mn and Fe concentrations also declined. Concentrations of especially those VOCs, vapor-phase compounds that are potential markers for combustion, also decreased substantially after September and October. As evidence, concentrations of benzene at Ground Zero were greater than 25 ppb in September, decreasing to 16 ppb in October, falling below 5 ppb thereafter II.

Thus, as expected, dioxin concentrations were highest in October and November (as high as 10 picogram per cubic meter (pg m 3)) and decreasing after the \ufb01res were extinguished to less than 1pgm 3. Other semivolatile organic compounds were measured downwind, also showing compounds associated with combustion, including one not previously observed in ambient monitoring, diphenylpropane (likely due to burning plastics). All measured pollutants displayed similar spatial and temporal trends, i.e. highest near the \ufb01res and highest in September and October 2001. In such emergencies, it is most important to know the local wind direction at the accident site, to determine the extent of the area to be immediately evacuated. The next important factor is the wind speed, so that the pollutant transport time to various areas can be determined. Both can be estimated on-site by simple means, such as watching the drift of bubbles released by a bubble machine. It would be well to keep in mind that wind speeds increase with height above the surface and that wind direction is different at height than at the surface. In fact, the WTC episode dramatically demonstrated the importance of local meteorology. The wind directions at Ground Zero were almost always different than those measured at any of the three nearby, major airports. And, the three airports often have meteorological conditions different from one another. As evacuation is taking place, it is important to determine whether meteorological events will cause a wind direction shift later on, requiring a change in the evacuation scenario. Particularly in coastal areas, or areas of complex terrain, and slopes, authorities should be alert to a possible change in wind direction between night and day. Useful advice may be obtained from the nearest weather forecaster, although accurate forecasting of wind direction for speci\ufb01c locations is not easy. Accurate air movement measurements and predictions are a matter of safety, even life and death. Portable meteorological stations are becoming increasingly accurate, precise, and reasonably available. These should be deployed during any emergency involving airborne contaminants, or the potential for such. If the situation is one of potential rather than current release, speci\ufb01c concentrations at various distances and localities may be estimated for various conditions by using atmospheric dispersion models. 10.3 CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS There are a number of mechanisms and steps between exposure to an air pollutant and cardiovascular effects. For example, three mechanistic pathways have been proposed to link aerosol and gas-phase air pollutants to arrhythmia (see Figure 10.4). The pollutant may be translocated, whereupon it raises blood pressure and causes endothelial dysfunction, which in time leads to arrhythmia. The pollutant may induce oxidative stress and in\ufb02ammation that increase coagulation, which in turn leads to myocardial ischemia. The oxidative stress, myocardial ischemia, and coagulation then lead to arrhythmia. Finally, the pollutant may alter the autonomic nervous system, which changes cardiac autonomic control. This can lead to heart rate variability (HRV) and repolarization abnormalities and changes to rhythm, which lead to arrhythmia.13 Most of the interest in ambient air pollution\u2019s role in cardiovascular disease has focused on chronic effects, e.g. the effects of long-term exposure to PM and second-hand smoke (SHS) on heart disease. However, short-term, acute effects have also been associated with certain air pollutants, especially when a person has other risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (i.e. abnormal amounts of cholesterol, fats, and other lipids in blood).", "Particulate matter is a primary air pollutant that has been associated with both acute and chronic cardiovascular disease. As evidence, beginning in 1987 the National Mortality and Morbidity Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) has compared ambient concentrations of PM10 with morbidity and mortality in the largest US cities. The data indicate that daily mortality increased 0.21% ( 0.06 standard error (SE)) and cardiopulmonary mortality increased 0.31% ( 0.09 SE). These increases indicate that with each 10 mgm 3 increase in daily ambient PM10 concentrations, there is a concomitant increase in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality rates. Conversely, each incremental decrease in PM10 concentrations would translate into improved cardiovascular health.14 The effect is even more dramatic for II.

Ref. 13. \ufb01ner particles. As evidence, an American Cancer Society11,15 cohort study found that each 10 mgm 3increase in annual average PM2.5 ambient concentration was associated with a 4% increase in mortality from all causes, as well as a 6% increase in cardiopulmonary-related mortality. There appears to be a link between acute and chronic exposure to PM and cardiovascular events. These may be related to increases in heart rate and blood pressure, \ufb01brinogen, and blood coagulation factors; arterial vasoconstriction; in\ufb02ammatory mediators (e.g. C-reactive protein); endothelial injury/dysfunction; and decreases in heart rate variability.16 These can then lead to myocardial ischemia, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, increased plaque vulnerability, and enhanced potential for acute thrombosis triggering acute coronary syndromes.17 Further support for these changes has been drawn from studies of SHS, also known as environmental tobacco smoke, which is the single largest contributor to indoor PM when a smoker is present.18 Exposure to SHS increases platelet activation, rapidly deteriorates endothelial function, promotes atherosclerotic plaque development, and increases the likelihood of infarct expansion.17 These and other studies indicate that even low doses of air pollution over time induce changes in coronary morphology and circulation, which lead to cardiovascular problems, i.e. air pollutant exposure accelerates the development of coronary atherosclerosis and worsens its sequelae. Indeed, cardiovascular effects are both acute (quite abrupt, e.g. arrhythmia or myocardial infarction by acute in\ufb02ammatory responses, altered platelet adhesiveness, or perhaps vascular endothelial dysfunction) and chronic (e.g. acceleration of the progression of atherosclerosis). High concentrations of ambient particles can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction, but the stress caused by exposure to even low doses over time has been associated with chronic cardiovascular diseases. 10.3.1 Carbon Monoxide: a Cardiovascular Agent Carbon monoxide (CO) exposure is a profound example of a mechanism of chronic cardiovascular effects induced by an air pollutant. The CO molecule binds to hemoglobin at a much higher preferential rate compared to oxygen (z240:1).19 Tying up the oxygen carrier in the blood, hemoglobin results in COHb not easily releasing the carbon monoxide. Therefore, hemoglobin will not be available to transport oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. High concentrations of COHb are referred to as carboxyhemoglobinemia, which if suf\ufb01ciently high leads to death. Carbon monoxide also decreases O2 storage in muscle cells by binding to the O2 and displacing the O2 from myoglobin. All tissues are vulnerable to carbon monoxide-induced hypoxic injury, but those having the highest O2 demand are particularly vulnerable. The brain and heart are particularly vulnerable, and the fetus may also be a sensitive target of carbon monoxide, through hypoxic and/or nonhypoxic mechanisms.20 At lower COHb concentrations, the continuous oxygen deprivation stresses the cardiovascular system. Exposure to CO and elevated COHb blood concentrations have been associated with blood clotting, which may be the mechanistic link of smoking and thromboembolism. Likewise, COHb crosses the placental membranes, causes vasoconstriction of the placenta, II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 10. CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS which lowers birth weight. Since unborn children absorb CO faster and more ef\ufb01ciently than adults, this could lead to hypoxia, with resulting developmental problems. The kinetics of carbon monoxide is fairly straightforward. For example, blood COHb concentrations can be compared to speci\ufb01c categories of health effects. Knowing the CO respiratory exposure dose can be used to estimate COHb in the blood.", "Table 10.2 can be even used to convert the reported ambient air carbon monoxide concentrations into equivalent predicted blood COHb levels. There is much uncertainty with such dose interconversions. Predicted COHb levels and corresponding exposure concentrations may have greater relevance to outcomes mediated through hypoxic mechanisms than to those mediated through nonhypoxic mechanisms. In addition, steady state requires exposure durations of approximately 16e24 h. Exposures to lower levels of carbon monoxide for longer durations and exposures to higher levels for shorter durations that achieve similar blood COHb levels likely will not indicate similar results.21 TABLE 10.2 Predicted Steady State Blood Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) Levels Carbon Monoxide Exposure Steady State Blood Concentration (ppm) COHb (%) 0.1 0.25 0.5 0.32 1 0.39 2 0.50 5 1.0 10 1.8 15 2.5 20 3.2 40 6.1 60 8.7 80 11 100 14 200 24 400 38 600 48 800 56 1000 61 Source: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

Typical variables that correlate with CO concentrations include PM10,PM2.5,NO2,O3, and SO2. That is, in the ambient environment, CO is seldom the only air pollutant that is detected. Near-road environments also have cardiovascular air pollutants such as PM, NO2, benzene, and 1,3-butydiene. Urban areas often have O3, PM, numerous air toxins, oxides of nitrogen, and oxides of sulfur. Even in the instance of SHS (environmental tobacco smoke), CO is one of myriad cardiovascular pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These co-exposures present a statistical dilemma. Ignoring co-variables that contribute to risk in regression models (e.g. single-pollutant models) will bias risk assessments upwardly (false positives). However, assuming that strongly correlated co-variables are independent in multi-pollutant models introduces downward bias. The conservative approach would be to avoid false negatives, since there may be synergism among the co-occurring pollutants. Not all studies have explored multipollutant models, but most of those that have tend to support evidence similar to the results of clinical studies that have shown CO to exacerbate coronary vascular disease.21 Air pollutants that affect cardiovascular systems are most problematic for sensitive subpopulations, including unborn children, infants, asthmatics, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. For many air pollutants, exposure concentrations correspond to levels that may have relatively small impacts on the general population, but dramatic effects on these sensitive groups. This is true for acute impacts where highly susceptible individuals exhibit serious outcomes following increases in exposures to pollutants. For these and other reasons, cardiovascular epidemiologic studies often focus on highly susceptible populations. A typical design has been to examine associations between temporal trends in ambient pollution concentrations and hospital admissions or emergency department visits for which the reported diagnosis was some form of cardiovascular and/or respiratory disease of impairment. For example, worldwide hospital admissions appear to increase following an episode of elevated SO2 ambient air concentrations.23 II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 10.3 CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS Although PM, CO, and other air pollutants linked to cardiovascular effects have been decreasing in developed countries, they have not shown these trends in many developing nations. People around the world are exposed to unhealthful concentrations of PM, CO, SO2, and other pollutants that stress cardiovascular systems. For example, indoor air contaminants pose a risk to the health of over half of the world\u2019s population. In homes where biomass fuels and coal are used for cooking and heating, PM levels may be 10e50 times higher than the guideline values.24 10.3.3 Indirect Cardiovascular Effects The major steps between air pollutant exposure and cardiovascular effects involve inhalation of the air pollutant, followed by physiological mechanisms that lead to cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary disease (Figure 10.4). There are two other types of air pollution-linked cardiovascular paradigms: exposure routes other than inhalation and effects from changes in the environment induced by air pollution. 10.3.3.1 Nonrespiratory Routes As discussed in Chapter 8, inhalation is the dominant exposure route for air pollutants, but is not the exclusive pathway to effects. Household dust, for example, is a major pathway for exposure to air pollutants. Following PM deposition onto food translates into an ingestion pathway (see Figure 8.5).", "Deposition onto surfaces can lead to dermal exposures. These different routes would change the biological mechanisms linking air pollution with cardiovascular and other effects. This is because absorption into the gastrointestinal tract or through skin may change the kinetics and lead to different amounts and types of metabolites. These have their own mechanisms, which may or may not resemble those that begin with a pollutant entry via respiration. 10.3.3.2 Environmental Changes Leading to Effects The cardiovascular system works best under optimal environmental conditions, including acceptable ambient temperature and oxygen. Relatively small changes that alter environmental conditions so that an organism is outside of the optimal range that supports life will stress the cardiovascular system in humans and other animals. Meteorological conditions certainly affect health. Previous discussions in this chapter addressed the more direct effects from air pollutants. Even within the category of climate change-induced health effects, cardiovascular and other outcomes can be brought about directly or indirectly, through multiple causal pathways (see Figure 10.5). Health system condions Societal, upstream health determinants, e.g. educa on, employment, income, living & working condi ons FIGURE 10.5 Human health causal pathways possibly resulting from global climate change. Direct chemical exposures could include increased bioavailability of chemical contaminants, e.g. higher temperatures increase transformation; it would also include increased use of chemicals to address problems, e.g. change in insect and microbial populations. Indirect exposures can include changes in water, air, and food quality, as well as changes in vector ecology, ecosystem conditions, agricultural operations, and industry. Indirect exposure may also include releases from contaminant sinks, such as sediments. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Adapted from: Ref. 25. Any increase in the number and severity of other events, such as \ufb02ooding, will also increase psychological stress and concomitant cardiovascular response (e.g. indicated by increased hospital admissions). Changes in environmental conditions, e.g. warmer temperatures and altered hydrological cycle, can also lead to changes in ecosystems that in turn affect human health. Climate change can alter seasonality of some allergenic species and disease vectors. Insect and other vector populations could lead to increases in the number and severity of vector-borne diseases. These include changes in spatial and temporal distributions of malaria, dengue, tick-borne diseases, cholera, and some other diarrheal diseases.25 These diseases can be expected to increase cardiovascular and other stress in human populations. Thus, opportunistic diseases brought on by environmental change that is induced by air pollutants (e.g. greenhouse gases) can result in increased cardiovascular effects in populations. One of the considerations of global climate change is the extent to which the release of air pollutants may create extreme heat events. Heat waves are generally characterized by several days of warm, stable air II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 10. CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS masses, with daytime temperatures >32 C, and consecutive nighttime temperatures above normal. If climate change does indeed increase the number of and severity of heat waves in the temperate zones, this will be met by greater cardiovascular effects (see Figure 10.6). Heat waves presently are the most deadly weather-related exposure in the United States, leading to a greater number of deaths annually than those attributed to hurricanes, tornadoes, \ufb02oods, and earthquakes combined. Like direct air pollutant exposures, heat-sensitive subpopulations include children and the elderly. Climate change will bring more heat waves to the United States. Increases in the number of people living in cities, as well as population aging, will further increase heat-related health risks. Studies suggest that, if Increase in mean Probability of occurrence Probability of occurrence Probability of occurrence Increase in variance Increase in mean and variance current emissions hold steady, excess heat-related deaths in the United States may increase from the present average of about 700 each year to as many as 5000 per year by 2050.26 The indirect health effects demonstrate the complexity of causal links between emissions of air pollutants and health. This applies not only to cardiovascular effects but also to most other adverse health and ecological outcomes. This is important to keep in mind when reading the previous chapter and the next four chapters. QUESTIONS 1. Give an example of an air pollutant that causes direct cardiovascular damage. 2.

As the name implies, frst responders are the teams who frst arrive on the scene of an emergency. They include frefghters, HAZMAT teams, police, and medical personnel. These people are particularly vulnerable to exposures. Often, the contents of items and areas needing response are not well known, so the wrong treatment or response can be dangerous, such as spraying water on low-density or water-reactive substances. Other vulnerabilities include the frenetic nature of an emergency response. For example, the frst responders to the WTC attacks on September 11, 2001, had incompatible radios and, since cell phone networks collapsed, they were not able to communicate well with each other. This undoubtedly led to a number of deaths. The vulnerability has been articulated well by Captain Larry R. Collins, a 24 year member of the Los Angeles County Fire Department (Frontline First Responder, April 5, 2003): A truly accurate assessment of the stability of damaged structures often requires the skill, experience, training, and knowledge of a certifed structural engineer who is prepared to perform a risk analysis and make certain calculations about the weight of the material, the status of key structural members, how the loads have been redistributed after the event, and the need for stabilization or evacuation. Unfortunately, frst responders typically do not have those capabilities, and when lives are hanging in the balance, they do not have the luxury of time to wait for a structural engineer. Someone needs to make immediate decisions about frefghting, search and rescue, and other emergency operations. 10. Heylin M. Bhopal: Ten years after.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11 Cancer and Air Pollutants 11.1 LINKING AIR POLLUTION TO CANCER Since the most prominent type of cancer associated with air pollution is lung cancer and since cancer is a chronic effect, many texts include cancer in a discussion of chronic respiratory effects (Chapter 8). However, there are a number of different types of cancers associated with airborne carcinogens. Indeed, the major exposure route for airborne carcinogens is inhalation, but the cancer outcomes can occur at numerous sites in the body. Ambient air pollutants include carcinogens in both the vapor and particulate phases with sorbed compounds, metals and metallic compounds, and other substances that are capable of causing oxidative stress, in\ufb02ammation, and genetic defects. Even at low doses, airborne pollutant exposure is a major contributor to lung and other cancers. A recent study in Europe of more than 300,000 cohorts representing over 4 million person-years at risk found that following exposures to particulate matter (PM), the risks of lung cancer are elevated incrementally by PM concentration.1 For example, when exposed to the coarse fraction of PM (aerodynamic diameters >2.5 mmand <10 mm, i.e. PM10) for every concentration increase of 10 mgm 3 was associated with a 22% increase in the hazard ratio (HR) for lung cancer incidence (i.e. newly reported cases in a year). For the \ufb01ne fraction of PM (aerodynamic diameters <2.5 mm, i.e. PM2.5), for every increase of 5 mgm 3,there was 18% increase in the HR for lung cancer. These associations between risk for lung cancer and PM are statistically signi\ufb01cant: \u0081 PM10 HR \u00bc 1.22 (95% con\ufb01dence interval (CI) 1.03e1.45) per 10 mgm 3; and \u0081 PM2.5 HR \u00bc 1.18 (0.96e1.46) per 5 mgm 3. The associations also hold for speci\ufb01c types of lung cancer. The PM10 and PM2.5 HRs for adenocarcinomas of the lung were found to be 1.51 (1.10e2.08) and 1.55 (1.05e2.29), respectively. Since all of the CI values are greater than 1, the associations between increased cancer risk and PM concentrations in the ambient air are significant at a 95% level of con\ufb01dence. Indeed, the study concluded that at PM concentrations even below European Union limit values, ambient PM plays a role in lung cancer development. The cancer HR in this context is actually a type of relative risk (see Chapter 4). Generally, the difference between the HR and relative risk is that the HR is an instantaneous event whereas relative risk is cumulative, i.e. the relative risk can only be reported following the study, whereas the HR can be calculated during the study at different points in time. In this case, ambient PM concentration intervals were compared to cases of cancer over more than a decade. If the concentration made no difference in cancer incidence, the HR and relative risk would be 1. If cancer incidence increased in accordance with PM concentration, the values would be >1. If cancer incidence had increased, the values would have been <1.a The study also found an association between lung cancer HR and the volume of road traf\ufb01c, i.e. 4000 vehicle km per day within 100 m of the residence was associated with an HR for lung cancer of 1.09 (0.99e1.21), although the CI does fall below 1.", "This nonchemical variable (i.e. location, not chemical concentration) could indicate the presence of airborne carcinogens, including PM but others as well, near roadways in Europe.1 For example, benzene and 1,3-butadiene are often detected in the air near roadways. The actual reasons for the link between PM and cancer are not completely clear. PM is composed of various chemical compounds, among which there are often carcinogens. However, the properties of the aerosol itself also play a role since PM from various sources and numerous locations tend to be linked to cancer. a If an HR or relative risk from a factor (e.g. healthy diet) decreases signi\ufb01cantly, this is considered to be a protective factor.

CANCER AND AIR POLLUTANTS 11.1.1 Cancer Etiology A prominent hypothesis in carcinogenesis is the \u201ctwo hit\u201d theory, suggested by A.G. Knudson2 in 1971. The theory argues that cancer develops after genetic material (i.e. usually deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA) is damaged. The \ufb01rst damage is known as \u201cinitiation\u201d. This step may, but does not necessarily, lead to cancer. The next step, \u201cpromotion\u201d, changes the cell\u2019s makeup and nature, such as the loss of normal homeostasis (cellular self-regulation), and the rapid division of clonal tumor cells. Promoters may or may not be carcinogens. Health researchers and regulating agencies usually do not assign a safe concentration of exposure to a carcinogen. They do, however, use the reference concentration (RfC)b to assign a level of exposure that is \u201csafe\u201d in terms of health hazard for all diseases except cancer. The criteria for causality discussed in Chapter 4 were developed by A. Bradford Hill as a means of linking risk factors to cancer. 3 Recall that these criteria are: 1. Strength of association, 2. Consistency, 3. Speci\ufb01city, 4. Temporality, 5. Biologic gradient, 6. Plausibility, 7. Coherence, 8. Experimentation, 9. Analogy. Strength of association and biological gradient are established by the cancer doseeresponse curves. These curves are the source of the cancer slope factor (CSF) for individual carcinogenic substances. The CSF is the principal hazard characteristic for carcinogens. It is an upper bound estimate, approximating a 95% con\ufb01dence limit, of the increased cancer risk from a lifetime exposure to an agent. This estimate, usually expressed in units of proportion (of a population) affected per mg kg 1 day 1, is generally reserved for use in the low-dose region of the doseeresponse relationship; that is, for exposures corresponding to risks less than 1 in 100.c The slope factor can be related to risk as follows: 11 CSF \u00bc risk per unit dose \u00bc risk per mg kg day (11.1) Table 11.1 provides the CSF values for a number of potential air pollutants. Both factors are developed from a mix of mutagenicity studies, animal testing, and epidemiology. Public health policy often holds that there is no \u201csafe\u201d level of exposure for carcinogens, i.e. doseeresponse models include no threshold. That is, cancer doseeresponse curves often do not include a \u201cno observable adverse effect level\u201d (NOAEL) or a \u201clowest observed adverse effect level\u201d. Instead, CSFs are used to calculate the estimated probability of increased cancer incidence over a person\u2019s lifetime (the so-called \u201cexcess lifetime cancer risk\u201d). Cancer is a type of mutation of genetic material of normal cells, which changes the normal balance between proliferation and cell death in favor of uncontrolled tumor cell division. The process of producing uncontrolled and rapidly dividing cells is known as tumorigenesis. These may mutate into malignant tumors (cancer). Such tumors can metastasize into other organs, meaning that lung and other cancers associated with air pollutants can lead to cancers at other sites. Cancer involves billions of cells that theoretically originate from an initial cell that is cloned, escapes apoptosis (i.e. normal, programmed cell death), and becomes genetically altered into a new cell. This process forms new cellular material (neoplasms) that may be benign or malignant. Next, the constituent cells of malignant neoplasia are the result of numerous biochemical processes, including neoplastic differentiation; insensitivity to antigrowth signals; tissue invasion and metastasis, limitless replicative potential, evasion of apoptosis; sustained angiogenesis (i.e. development of new blood vessels); expression of telomerase (i.e. enzyme for adding nucleotides to cancer cells); and self-suf\ufb01cient growth signals.5 A series of several mutations to certain classes of genes is usually needed for a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell.6 This can entail numerous \u201cdriver mutations\u201d and \u201cpassenger\u201d mutations.7 Driver mutations give selective advantage to a clone, which leads to clonal expansion.", "Passenger mutations or \u201cgene hitchhikers\u201d do not necessarily give an advantage to the clone, but can increase the frequency of cell growth since they are closely linked to selectively advantageous genes. The mutation mechanism involves a number of steps before carcinogenesis (Figure 11.1). The pathway to carcinogenesis varies both inside and outside of the body. The compounds released into the atmosphere may be parent carcinogens. They may also include precursors to carcinogens (top of Figure 11.1). These precursors may be transformed in the atmosphere into carcinogens. They may also be transformed into b For ingestion and dermal routes of exposure, the reference dose (RfD) is used. It is applied in exactly the same manner as the RfC. c 33 This text makes an effort to avoid using the slash in units, preferring the use of exponents (e.g. mg m is preferable to mg m ). However, for environmental exposure calculations, most literature uses the slash, i.e. mg (kg day) 1, so these units are used for exposure and its inverse, i.e.(mg kg 1 day 1) 1, for cancer slope factors.

CANCER AND AIR POLLUTANTS precursors that are not yet carcinogenic, but will become carcinogens as a result of endogenous processes within the organism (middle of Figure 11.1). The process within the cell following distribution is the same, whether it is the parent compound that is carcinogenic, or one of the parent compound\u2019s atmospheric transformation products, or a metabolite of the parent compound or an exogenous transformation product that subsequently is bioactivated to become a carcinogen (bottom of Figure 11.1). Cancer is the result of mutation, but not all of these mutations become cancer.", "That is, all cancer begins with mutation, but not all mutation ends in cancer. The DNA damage and repair sequences could lead to cell death, protein dysfunction, chromosomal aberrations, or other expressions beside tumorigenesis. As discussed in detail in Chapter 8, exposure is expressed as mass of an air pollutant per body mass per time, whereas slope factors are expressed in inverse exposure units since the slope of the doseeresponse curve is an indication of risk per exposure. Commonly, exposure is expressed in units of mg kg 1 day 1 and the CSF is its inverse, i.e. (mg kg 1 day 1) 1. The cancer slope indicates hazard (see Chapter 7). Since risk is the product of hazard and exposure, the product of the unit and the unit\u2019s inverse must be dimensionless. Risk is a unitless probability of the adverse outcome, i.e. cancer risk is the product of carcinogen hazard and the amount of exposure to that hazard. The CSF values are contaminant-speci\ufb01c and route-speci\ufb01c. Thus, one must not only know the contaminant, but how a person is exposed (e.g. via inhalation, via ingestion or through the skin). Lifetime cancer risk can be de\ufb01ned as the theoretical probability of contracting cancer when continually exposed for a lifetime (e.g. 70 years) to a given concentration of a carcinogen. The probability is usually calculated as an upper con\ufb01dence limit. The maximum estimated risk may be presented as the number of chances in a million of contracting cancer. Two measures of risk are commonly reported. One is the individual cancer risk, i.e. the probability of a person developing cancer due to the exposure. This is often reported as a \u201cresidual\u201d or increased probability above background. For example, to characterize the contribution of all the power plants in the United States to increased cancer incidence, the risk above background would be reported. The second way that cancer risk is reported is population risk, i.e. the annual excess number of cancers in an exposed population. The maximum, worst case, individual risk might be calculated from exposure estimates based upon a \u201cmaximum exposed individual\u201d or MEI. The hypothetical MEI lives an entire lifetime outdoors at the point where pollutant concentrations are highest. Assumptions about exposure greatly affect the risk estimates. For example, the cancer risk from power plants in the United States has been estimated to be to be 100-to 1000-fold lower for an average exposed individual than that calculated for the MEI. 11.2 ESTIMATING RISK FROM AIRBORNE CARCINOGENS Cancer risk varies by the potency of the carcinogen and the exposure to that carcinogen. As for any air pollution risk, cancer risk is a function of hazard and exposure. Since cancer is a chronic disease, the exposure must be longterm or at least must address the latency between exposure and cancer outcome. Thus, cancer risk assessments generally express hazard potency for the doseeresponse curves from animal research and human epidemiology. The quasi-linear segment of these curves provides what CSF and the long-term exposure is the lifetime average daily dose (LADD): Cancer risk \u00bcCSF LADD (11.2) \u00f0C\u00de$\u00f0IR\u00de$\u00f0EL\u00de$\u00f0AF\u00de$\u00f0ED\u00de LADD \u00bc \u00f0BW\u00de$\u00f0TL\u00de Where C \u00bc chemical concentration (mass per volume); IR \u00bc inhalation rate (volume per time); EL \u00bc exposure length (time); AF \u00bcabsorption factor (unitless); ED \u00bc exposure duration (time); BW \u00bc body weight (mass); and TL \u00bctypical lifetime (time). Usually, cancer occurs after prolonged exposure to a carcinogen. As such, the exposure setting must be characterized. This includes both the physical environment and the activities of the potentially exposed populations. From this assessment, sources of the air pollutant can be identi\ufb01ed along with the possible routes of exposure. To quantify exposure, the concentration of the carcinogen and the intake variables must be assigned. Daily intake (DI) must be estimated or modeled: Concentration \u00f0mg volume 1\u00de Intake \u00f0volume day 1\u00de DI \u00f0mg per kg day\u00de\u00bc (11.3) body mass \u00f0kg\u00de II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11.2 ESTIMATING RISK FROM AIRBORNE CARCINOGENS Then, chronic daily intake can be estimated by averaging DI over long-term exposure (e.g. 70 years for LADD). Exposure factors vary. For example, an average lifetime may be assumed to be 70 years, but the exposure duration (ED) may be for 25 years (e.g. the source may have only been operating for 25 years). Body weight may be assumed to be 70 kg; frequency of exposure may be <365 days a year (e.g. 250 days per year). The intake rate must account for time period and the amount of the air pollutant.", "For example, inhalation rates will vary by activity and person, so an average exposure inha 31 1 lation rate may be used, e.g. 2.5 m h 8hday . However, as indicated in Table 11.2, inhalation rates can be age-dependent and highly variable. As discussed in Chapter 8, an exposure equation8 must account for both chemical concentration of the airborne carcinogen and a person\u2019s activities that affect the time of contact. The chemical intake (I) is expressed in units of concentration (mass per volume or mass per mass) per time, such as mg kg 1 day 1. Since the intake of air pollutants is almost entirely via inhalation, the contaminant concentration in the air can be used exclusively. IR ETEFED I \u00bc CA (11.4) BW AT Where CA \u00bc contaminant concentration in air (mgm 3) IR \u00bc inhalation rate (m3 h 1) BW \u00bc body weight (kg) ET \u00bcexposure time (h day 1) EF \u00bc exposure frequency (days year 1) ED \u00bc exposure duration (years) AT \u00bcaveraging time (days over which exposure is averaged). Similarly, an exposure concentration (EC) is a time-weighted average concentration derived from measured or modeled concentrations of a contaminant in the air, but adjusted according to the characteristics of the exposure scenario. For an acute exposure, the EC and CA values will almost be the same. However, estimating cancer risks from chronic exposure involves both the CA measured at a point of exposure point as well as scenario-speci\ufb01c parameters, such as the EC and EF: CA ET EF ED EC \u00bc (11.5) AT The value for AT for chronic exposures is ED in years 365 days year 1 24 h day 1. Since this gives AT in hours, it is multiplied by 24 for an AT in days. Thus, EC usually is CA that has been time-weighted over the duration of exposure and incorporates information on human activity patterns. The U.S. EPA cancer risk guidelines apply a linear extrapolation from exposures observed in animal studies or human occupational studies.9 It is common to see EC combined with an inhalation unit risk (IUR), which is similar to the CSF, i.e. it is a predictive cancer risk potency estimate. The IUR is the upper bound excess lifetime cancer risk estimated to result from continuous exposure to an agent at a concentration of 1 mgm 3 in air.

CANCER AND AIR POLLUTANTS IUR \u00bc 2 10 6 per mgm 3, then two excess cancer cases (upper bound estimate) are expected to develop per 1,000,000 people if exposed daily for a lifetime to 1 mgof the chemical in 1 m3 air.d The air pollution concentration in air (CA)mustinclude all physical phases, i.e. both the pollutant in vapor phase and those in aerosol phase. The aerosol phase can simply be the same compound in liquid and solid phases, as well as any of the pollutant that is sorbed to particulate matter. For example, at equilibrium, benzene will exist in both gaseous and liquid phases, it can be sorbed on the surface of a particle (adsorbed), and it can be sorbed within the particle matrix (absorbed). The CA value must account for all these phases and normalized, e.g. all expressed in units of mass per volume (e.g. mg m 3)ormassper mass (e.g. mg kg 1). Many carcinogens and other toxic air pollutants are organic compounds with highly diverse physical characteristics and chemical composition.", "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), for example, exist in the ambient air almost entirely in the gas phase since their vapor pressures in the environment are usually >10 2 kPa. For VOCs, then, CA may be almost equal to vapor phase concentrations. Conversely, relatively nonvolatile organic compounds (NVOCs) with vapor pressures <10 5 kPa are predominantly found in and on particles, unless signi\ufb01cant energy is added to increase their volatility. Thus, the CA for NVOCs can be estimated to equal the total amount of the air pollutant in PM collected. However, semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) with vapor pressures between 10 2 and 10 5 kPa can exist as in both the gas and particle phases in the ambient air. These values correspond to the classi\ufb01cations that are based upon observations of the compounds\u2019 behaviors during air sampling10 (see Discussion Box: \u201cMeasuring SVOCs in the Air\u201d). MEASURING SVOCS IN THE AIR Many airborne carcinogens are SVOCs, which have vapor pressures between 10 5 and 10 2 kPa under environmental conditions (temperature z25 C; pressure z1 atm). This group includes the dioxins, furans, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and other persistent organic pollutants, including several organochlorine pesticides. These vapor pressures are low enough that the compounds may form particles and can sorb onto and into PM. The vapor pressures are high enough that they can also exist to some extent in the vapor phase in the troposphere. The compounds\u2019 phase distribution between gas and particle depends on environmental conditions, such as relative humidity and temperature. Measurements of phase distribution can be dif\ufb01cult due to the various inherent engineering features of the monitoring equipment, such as the need to maintain sampling \ufb02ow rate, the pore size of \ufb01lters, and the amount of time an organic compound resides on the \ufb01lter or trap.11 For example, a compound will sorb to a trapping material, such as a polymer (e.g. XAD) or polyurethane foam (PUF). The general method for determining SVOCs in the air consists of several steps, such as those for PAHs12: 1. Filters and sorbent cartridges (containing sorbent media, e.g. PUF or XAD) are cleaned in solvents and vacuum dried. The \ufb01lters and sorbent cartridges are stored in screw-capped jars wrapped in aluminum foil (or otherwise protected from light) before careful installation on the sampler. 2. Approximately 300 e 400 m3 of air is drawn through the \ufb01lter and sorbent cartridge using a high-volume \ufb02ow rate air sampler or equivalent. 3. The amount of air sampled through the \ufb01lter and sorbent cartridge is recorded, and the \ufb01lter and cartridge are placed in an appropriately labeled container and shipped along with blank \ufb01lter and sorbent cartridges to the analytical laboratory for analysis. 4. The \ufb01lters and sorbent cartridge are extracted by Soxhlet extraction with appropriate solvent. The extract is concentrated by KudernaeDanish (KeD) evaporator (i.e. a system for concentrating materials dissolved in volatile solvents), followed by silica gel cleanup using column chromatography to remove potential interferences prior to analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). 5. The eluent is further concentrated by KeD evaporation, then analyzed by GC/MS. 6. The analytical system is veri\ufb01ed to be operating properly and calibrated with \ufb01ve concentration calibration solutions. d The unit risk can also be applied to other exposure routes. For example, a similar calculation can be made for drinking water, with the assumption of continuous exposure to an agent at a concentration of 1 mg/L in water. For example, if the unit risk \u00bc 2 10 6 per mg/L, 2 excess cancer cases (upper bound estimate) would be expected per 1,000,000 people if exposed daily for a lifetime to 1 mg of the substance in 1 liter of drinking water. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11.2 ESTIMATING RISK FROM AIRBORNE CARCINOGENS MEASURING SVO C S 7. A preliminary analysis of the sample extract is performed to check the system performance and to ensure that the samples are within the calibration range of the instrument. If the preliminary analysis indicates nonperformance, then steps need to be taken, including recalibrating the instrument, adjusting the amount of the sample injected, adjusting the calibration solution concentration, and adjusting the data processing system to re\ufb02ect observed retention times. 8. The samples and the blanks are analyzed and used (along with the amount of air sampled) to calculate the concentration of SVOCs in the air sample.", "Systems for collecting, extracting, and analyzing SVOCs have been recommended by the American Society for Testing and Materials13 and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.14 Because of the relatively low concentrations of SVOCs in the environment, a large volume of air must pass through the \ufb01lters and sorbents (e.g. for PAHs, the U.S. EPA recommends 0.22 m 3 min 1) in order to acquire suf\ufb01cient sample for analysis. Given the midrange vapor pressures, ef\ufb01cient collection requires a \ufb01lter backed up by sorbent cartridge (to collect aerosols and vapors, respectively). Gas phase air pollutants are collected as they diffuse into media, such as PUF and XAD sorbant traps and denuders.15 Denuders are devices that contain glass surfaces on which compounds are collected. Most of the gas volume, including the gas phase of SVOCs, immediately diffuses onto surfaces like those on the PUF, e.g. collection ef\ufb01ciencies16 of the gas, sulfur dioxide (SO2), in a denuder have been found to be 99.2 and 99.6%. About 90% of the gas collected is in the \ufb01rst 10% of the denuder length.15 The vapor phase of SVOCs would be expected to behave similarly. The PUF is analogous to a \u201cnest\u201d of micro-denuders with its many crevices and large amount of surface area (Figure 11.2), so similar collection dynamics are assumed. Recently, similar \ufb01ndings have been found for PUF and the polymer collection media.17a,17b If air \ufb02ow volume is known (e.g. for SVOC monitoring, the target \ufb02ow rate of air is about 350 l min 1), the concentration can be calculated. For example, if 20 mg of a compound is collected on the trap through which air has \ufb02owed for 24 h at 350 l min 1, the integrated concentration of dioxins for that day would be 20 mg 51 1 \u00bc 4 10 mgl or 40ngl : 60 min$350 l 24 h h min INTHE AIR (cont\u2019d) Converting liters to cubic meters (1000 l m 3); the total concentration on this day would be 40,000 ng m 3 or 40 mgm 3. There now exist integrated combined gas and particle sampling systems (Figure 11.2) that give both vapor and aerosol phase concentrations. An example of the results using this apparatus is provided in Table 11.3 and Figure 11.3, which show the mean concentrations of the PAHs observed during the sampling periods in September 2001. Several PAHs are suspected carcinogens. Figure 11.4 shows the concentration of a number of PAHs collected by the various samplers. This is a gross indication of phase distribution between aerosols and gases. The lighter compounds to the left of the \ufb01gure are fairly well distributed between the vapor and particle phases. This is indicated by their being captured in the gas phase by denuders and sorbant materials (i.e. the polymer XAD-4), and in the particle phase by the quartz \ufb01lters. The heavier compounds to the right of the \ufb01gure are mainly captured on quartz \ufb01lters, that is, in the particle phase. (Continued) II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11.

The XAD-4 impregnated quartz \ufb01lters were used to collect those compounds that desorb from the particles on the quartz \ufb01lters and/or not removed by the denuders. The volumetric \ufb02ow rate of the HiC IOGAP sampler was set to 85 l min 1 and temperature controlled at 4 C above ambient to prevent condensation of water. Drawing used with permission by URG Corporation. The key to collecting and analyzing SVOCs lies in understanding their behavior in the environment. The sampling must consider the substrate. For example, is the compound bound to soil or sediment, does it need to be extracted from tissue, and how do the various phases differ in terms of sampling equipment? Sampling media varies with regard to the af\ufb01nity they have for particular SVOCs. For example, most SVOCs are lipophilic, so the sampling media needs to have af\ufb01nity for lipids. Most SVOCs are relatively large molecules, so the sampling material needs to be selected with that in mind. There must also be a means of removing (extracting) the SVOC after collection. A material that is very good at collecting the SVOC, but from which extraction is almost impossible or inconsistent would not be a good sampling material. Usually, extraction is a means by which the analyte that was in the air, and then was trapped in sampling media, is now transferred to a solvent. For example, supercritical \ufb02uid extraction involves placing the sample (e.g. PUF) in a container which is exposed to supercritical CO2 which removes the analyte and transfers it to a known amount of solvent (e.g. hexane). The solvent is then injected into the chromatograph, which separates the various compounds and sends them to the detector, e.g. a mass spectrometer or ultraviolet detection. The concentration of the analyte in the extract solution can be ascertained using a standard curve drawn from known amounts of the analyte injected into the chromatograph. Peak height or area is plotted linearly against concentration in nanograms per milliliter (ng ml 1). If the detector response is linear, a single point is used as a calculation constant. The quantity of the compound in the sample (A) is calculated as: As Ve A \u00bc 1000 (11.6)Vi where, A is the total amount of analyte in the sample (ng); As, the calculated amount of material injected onto the chromatograph based on calibration curve for injected standards (ng); Ve, the \ufb01nal volume of extract (ml); V1, the volume of extract injected (ml); 1000, the factor for converting microliters to milliliters. The extraction ef\ufb01ciency (EE) is determined from the recovery of surrogate spike: S EE \u00bc\u00f0100\u00de (11.7) Sa where, EE is the extraction ef\ufb01ciency (percent); S, the amount of spike recovered (ng); Sa, the amount of spike added to plug (ng). The EE (surrogate recovery) for an SVOC such as a PCB must fall between 60 and 120% to be acceptable. For example, if 200 ng of a PCB congener is added and 150 ng of the spike is recovered, the EE \u00bc (150/200) 100 \u00bc 75%. This would be acceptable, so long as the recoveries are consistent. For example, if the next spike recovery is 65%, and the next is 85%, this is problematic. Even though all EE values are between 60 and 120%, they are so inconsistent that the concentrations being reported would have quite large uncertainties.", "The reason (Continued) II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION MEASURING SVOCS IN THE AIR (cont\u2019d) that these vary and that more than 100% of the spike appears to be recovered is related to instrument error and variability (e.g. there may have been drift and other changes in the GC after the calibration curve was drawndfollowing some runs, there may be other variations in the separation and detection equipment. Thus, the instrument needs to be recalibrated frequently, per instrument speci\ufb01cations and regulations). Arguably, within the acceptable range, lower but consistent EE (e.g. 65e70% range) is more acceptable than higher but inconsistent, i.e. less precise (e.g. 75e120% range) extraction. The total volume of air sampled under ambient conditions is determined using the following equation18: P n i\u00bc1\u00f0Ti Fi\u00de \u00bc (11.8) Va3 1000 l=m where, Va is the total volume of air sampled (m3); Ti, the sampling period (min); and Fi, the average air \ufb02ow during sampling period (l min 1). This volume must be corrected to standard temperature (25 C) and standard pressure (760 mm Hg): Vs \u00bc Va Pb Pw 760 mm Hg 298 K tA (11.9) where, Vs is the volume of air sampled at 25 Cand 760 mm Hg (m3); Va, the total volume of air sampled; Pb, the mean ambient barometric pressure (mm Hg); Pw, the vapor pressure of water at calibration temperature (mm Hg); and tA, the average ambient temperature (C \u00fe 273). II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11.3 NATIONAL AIR TOXICS ASSESSMENT Areviewof Eqns (11.4) and (11.5) indicates that intake and exposure increase with increasing pollutant concentration, along with the time, duration, and frequency of contact with the pollutant, but is indirectly proportionate to body weight and averaging time. The body weight proportionality re\ufb02ects the decrease in dose, since the same mass of the chemical is present in a greater amount of tissue into which the pollutant is distributed and is metabolized. Similarly, a longer averaging time, with equal chemical uptake and all other factors held constant, simply dilutes the intake concentration and decreases exposure. Human activity patterns vary over a lifetime, so it is recommended that a time-weighted average EC be calculated for each exposure period characterized by a speci\ufb01c activity pattern within each microenvironment (e.g. unique ECs for a school-aged child resident versus working adult residents versus adults at home for longer periods of time). All exposure period-speci\ufb01c ECs are then be combined into a longer term (e.g. lifetime) average EC by weighting the EC by the duration of each exposure period. An example is n ECj \u00bc\u00f0CAi ETi EFi\u00de (11.10) X EDj ATj i\u00bc1 where, ECj \u00bc average EC for exposure period j; CAi (mgm 3) \u00bc contaminant concentration in air in MEi; ETi (hours/day) \u00bc exposure time spent in MEi; EFi (days/year) \u00bc exposure frequency for MEi; EDj (years) \u00bc exposure duration for exposure period j; and ATj (hours) \u00bc averaging time \u00bc EDj 24hday 1 365 days year 1. Once EC is calculated, it can be multiplied times a CSF or IUR to obtain a cancer risk estimate. These factors are further speci\ufb01ed for each route of exposure. The LADD is a commonly used metric of chronic, long-term exposure. Acute and subchronic exposures require different equations since the ED is much shorter. For example, instead of LADD, acute exposures to noncarcinogens may use maximum daily dose to calculate exposure (see Example Box: \u201cCarcinogen Exposure Calculation\u201d). CARCINOGEN EXPOSURE CALCULATION In the process of synthesizing pesticides over an 18-year period, a polymer manufacturer has contaminated the soil on its property with vinyl chloride. The plant closed 2 years ago but vinyl chloride vapors continue to reach the neighborhood surrounding the plant at an average concentration of 1 mg m 3. Assume that people are breathing at a ventilation rate of 0.5 m3 h 1 (about the average of adult males and females over 18 years of age19). The legal settlement allows neighboring residents to evacuate and sell their homes to the company. However, they may also stay. The neighbors have asked for advice on whether to stay or leave since they have already been exposed for 20 years. Vinyl chloride is highly volatile, so its phase distribution will be mainly in the gas phase rather than the aerosol phase. Although some of the vinyl chloride may be sorbed to particles, we will use only vapor phase LADD equation since the particle phase is likely to be relatively small. Also, we will assume that outdoor concentrations are the ECs.", "This is unlikely, however, since people spend very little time outdoors compared to indoors, so this may provide an additional factor of safety. To determine how much vinyl chloride penetrates living quarters, indoor air studies would have to be conducted. For a scientist to compare exposures, indoor air measurements should be taken. Absorption rates are published by the air quality agencies. For example, the EPA values for AF and CSF for a number of hazardous air pollutants are provided in Table 11.1. The appropriate equations in Table 11.4 must be selected based on the chemical\u2019s physical and chemical properties. In this case, most of the inhalation exposure will be vapor phase, given vinyl chloride\u2019s vapor pressure. Vinyl chloride is well absorbed, i.e. AF \u00bc 0.875. Assume an average person exposure, i.e. the person stays in the neighborhood is exposed at the average concentration 24 h a day (EL \u00bc 24), and that a person lives the remainder of entire typical lifetime exposed at the measured concentration. However, these values can be adjusted if more speci\ufb01c human activity data are available (e.g. diaries). Although the ambient concentrations of vinyl chloride may have been higher when the plant was operating, the only measurements we have are those taken recently. Thus, this is an area of uncertainty that must be discussed with the clients. The common default value for a lifetime is 70 years, so we can assume the longest exposure would be is 70 years (25,550 days). These and other default values appropriate to the exposed population are given (Continued) II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11.

The ED is assumed to be for a person who is now 20 years of age and has already been exposed for that time, and lives the remaining 50 years exposed at 1mgm 3. Using the appropriate equation in Table 11.4 (inhaling vapor phase contaminants), LADD can be estimated as follows: \u00f0C\u00de$\u00f0IR\u00de$\u00f0EL\u00de$\u00f0AF\u00de$\u00f0ED\u00de LADD \u00bc \u00f0BW\u00de$\u00f0TL\u00de \u00f01\u00de$\u00f00:5\u00de$\u00f024\u00de$\u00f00:875\u00de$\u00f025; 550\u00de \u00bc \u00f070\u00de$\u00f025; 550\u00de 1 z0:2mg \u00f0kg day\u00de If the 20 year old leaves today, the ED would be for the 20 years that the person lived in the neighborhood. Thus, only the ED term would change, i.e. from 25,550e 7300 days (i.e. 20 years). Thus, the LADD falls to 2/7 of its value: 1 LADD \u00bc 0:05 mg \u00f0kg day\u00de : Once the hazard and exposure calculations are done, risks can be characterized risk quantitatively. There are two general ways that such risk characterizations are used in environmental problem solving, i.e. direct risk assessments and risk-based cleanup standards. Using the LADD value, estimate the direct risk to the people living near the abandoned polymer plant. What information needs to be communicated? Insert the calculated LADD values and the vinyl chloride inhalation slope factor of 3.00 10 1 from Table 11.1. The two LADD values under consideration, the cancer risk to the neighborhood exposed for an entire lifetime (ED \u00bc 70 years) gives us 0.2 mg kg 1 1 111 day 0.3 (mg kg day ) \u00bc 0.06. This is an incredibly high risk!", "The threshold for concern is often 1 in a million (0.000001 \u00bc 10 6), while this is a probability of 6%or6 10 2. Even at the shorter duration period (20 years of exposure instead of 70 years), the risk is calculated as 0.05 0.3 \u00bc 0.017 or nearly a 2% risk. The combination of a very steep slope factor and very high lifetime exposures leads to a very high risk. Vinyl chloride is a liver carcinogen, so unless corrective actions signi\ufb01cantly lower the ambient concentrations of vinyl chloride, the prudent course of action is that the neighbors accept the buyout and leave the area.

Exposure factor handbook; 2003; and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. ATSDR public health assessment guidance manual; 2003.20 Incidentally, vinyl chloride has relatively high water solubility and can be absorbed to soil particles, so ingestion of drinking water (e.g. people on private wells drawing water from groundwater that has been contaminated) and dermal exposures (e.g. children playing in the soil) are also conceivable. The total risk from a single contaminant like vinyl chloride is equal to the sum of risks from all pathways (e.g. vinyl chloride in the air, water, and soil): X Total Risk \u00bc risks from all exposure pathways (11.11) Equation 11.7 points to a recent observation about air pollutants, especially those that are ingredients in pesticides and other products. Although the pollutant may be airborne, some of the exposure may be through routes other than inhalation. For example, some pesticides are found in household dust that has settled on food, which is then eaten. This is an example of an air pollutant where the uptake is via food or nondietary ingestion, introducing the chemical into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This can be from pica (eating nonfood substance) or inadvertent ingestion of soil and dust. Thus, the chemical ingestion includes both food and nonfood items. Dietary (food and liquids) and/or non-dietary (soil, dust, and other materials) exposure can be estimated as follows: Eing \u00bc Cing \u00f0IR\u00de (11.12) where Eing \u00bc ingestion exposure (mass per time) Cing \u00bc concentration of the chemical in food or other exposure media (mass of chemical per mass of medium or mass of chemical per volume of medium) IR \u00bc ingestion rate (mass of medium ingested during the exposure per time). Requirements and measures of success are seldom if ever as straightforward as this example. A number of actions are likely to be called for when carcinogens and other toxic compounds are found in elevated concentrations, including physical removal of the source and relocating people during the remediation. The actions will include documenting the amount of the chemical in the source and the amount moving into the air. Thus, the movement of the contaminant from soil to air must be estimated. Exposure to vinyl chloride may often occur from direct industrial releases, but has also been found in land\ufb01ll gas and groundwater as a degradation product of chloroethylene solvents, particularly trichloroethylene. Vinyl chloride in contaminated groundwater can volatilize and contaminate indoor air, so is an important avenue of exposure (Figure 11.5). This volatilization is referred to as vapor intrusion, and should be considered in any volatile risk assessment. Vapor intrusion into buildings presents an interesting perspective on exposure. Often, when groundwater is (Continued) II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11.

OSWER Draft Guidance for Evaluating the Vapor Intrusion to Indoor Air Pathway from Groundwater and Soils (Subsurface Vapor Intrusion Guidance).", "Report No. EPA530-D-02-004. U.S. EPA, Offce of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, Washington, DC. Indoor air Vadose zone soil gas Soil contamina on by residual or mobile chemical compound contaminated, the principal exposure pathway is ingestion of well water. Thus, the logical action would be to \ufb01nd an alternate source of drinking water, e.g. bottled water. However, if the contaminant becomes an air pollutant, the inhalation pathway would remain. For example, consider a scenario where drinking water and vapor intru 31 1 sion pathways led to exposure 10 mgm kg day and 31 1 2.5 mgm kg day , respectively. Using bottled water would eliminate the drinking water ingestion rote, but the exposure would only be reduced to 2.5 mgm 3kg 1 day 1 since the inhalation of vinyl chloride would continue. Assessing the vapor intrusion pathway typically involves the use of indirect measurements and modeling, based on soil gas or groundwater data. In addition, sampling indoor air does not in itself account for contributions from \u201cbackground\u201d sources. For example, if the neighborhood is near a source of vinyl chloride emissions, some ambient concentrations will permeate the building. The measurements will indicate the total vinyl chloride concentrations, not whether they came from in\ufb01ltration from ambient air or from vapor intrusion.21 Concentrations of volatile substances in soil gas attenuate (i.e. decrease in concentration) as the substances move from the source through the soil and into indoor air (Figure 11.6). This occurs because the emissions into a building mix with the ambient air \ufb02ow through the building. The extent of attenuation depends on the emission rate into the building, which is affected by the following: 1. Subsurface features (e.g. \ufb01ne-grained soils, high-moisture soil layers) that may hinder the diffusion and advection of VOCs 2. Biodegradation of contaminants, which leads to a decrease in the emissions along the vapor migration pathway 3. The integrity of the foundation and subgrade walls 4. Changes with time in groundwater level, source strength, and in\ufb01ltration rates 5. Pressurization of the building (underpressurization draws soil gas into a building) 6. Air exchange into a building, which brings fresh air into the enclosed space and dilutes the concentration of VOCs that enter through the vapor intrusion pathway.22 Migration of chemical by source (e.g. leaking tank or higher concentration to areas The arrows in Figure 11.6(A) diffusion occurs from a highly polluted area of of lower concentration). move from the ground water source through the unsaturated (vadose) zone source (Figure 11.6(B)). Away from the building, the dominant contaminant transport mechanism through the water in the soil pore spaces from the building is commonly diffusion. Advection increases with II.

Vapor phase air diffusion not the case when a chemical has a very low Henry\u2019s Law coef\ufb01cients can be \ufb01ve orders of magnitude greater constant (see Chapter 18). Also, vapor diffusion rates will than water diffusion coef\ufb01cients. Thus vapor diffusion decrease with increasing moisture content, so water through the air-\ufb01lled pores of the soil matrix usually diffusion becomes more dominant in very wet dominates for VOCs in the unsaturated zone. This is conditions. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11. CANCER AND AIR POLLUTANTS CARCINOGEN EXPOSURE CALCULATION (cont\u2019d) 11.3 NATIONAL AIR TOXICS ASSESSMENT A very valuable tool for estimating air pollution cancer risks in the United States is the National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA). As discussed in Chapter 3, the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act required a U.S. national scale air toxics assessment to screen and prioritize pollutants, emission sources and locations of interest for further study in order to gain a better understanding of risks. NATA provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from inhaling air toxics. Assessments include estimates of cancer and noncancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources, providing a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged. The assessment addresses the inhalation of 178 air toxics, for cancer and noncancer risk, plus noncancer risk for diesel PM. The 2005 NATA results are summarized in Figure 2.12. In addition to the national assessments, more focused reports can be generated. These include reports on a speci\ufb01c compound or the air toxics present in a speci\ufb01c state. 11.4 CANCER DOSEeRESPONSE", "The more potent the carcinogen, the larger the slope factor will be (i.e. the steeper the slope of the dosee response curve). Note, e.g. that when inhaled, ingested, or dermally exposed, the slope for the most carcinogenic dioxins, tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, is eight orders of magnitude steeper than the slope for aniline. Keep II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11.4 CANCER DOSEeRESPONSE in mind that this is the linear part of the curve. The curve is actually sigmoidal because at higher doses, the effect is dampened, i.e. the response is increasing at a decreasing dosage rate. This process is sometimes called the saturation effect. One way to think about this is to consider that if the doseeresponse curve comes from animal tests of various doses, there is a point at which increasing the dose of a chemical adds little to the onset of tumors. The dosage approaches an effective limit and becomes asymptotic. So, if chemical A is given to 1000 rats, at increasing dosages, an incremental increase in rats with tumors is seen. This is the linear range. Doubling dose doubles the effect. But, at some in\ufb02ection point, the increased dosage, say after 50 rats with tumors, if the dose is doubled half as many additional rats with tumors are seen. The rate continues to decrease up to a point where even very large doses do not produce many additional tumors. This is one of the challenges of animal experiments and models. We are trading dose for time; the assumed lifetime of humans is about 70 years and the doses to carcinogens are usually very small (e.g. parts per billion or trillion). Animal doses may last only a few months and use relatively high doses. We have to extrapolate long-term effects from limited data from short-term studies. The same is somewhat true for human studies, where we try to extrapolate effects from a small number of cases to a much larger population, e.g. a small study comparing cases to controls in one hospital or a retrospective view of risk factors that may have led to a cluster of cases of cancer. It can be argued that addressing rare and chronic diseases like cancer, endocrine dysfunction, reproductive disorders, and neurological diseases is an effort in the controlling the variables to reduce the possibility of an improbable (thankfully!) event. In fact, new statistical devices are being developed to deal with rare events (see Discussion Box: Small Numbers and Rare Events). SMALL NUMBERS AND RARE EVENTS In statistics, there is an interesting but logical observation that when one deals with rare events, small changes can be very profound. If you think about it, when you start with very small numbers, a slight change can make a huge difference. Stockbrokers and retailers use this phenomenon often. For example, a company may be the fastest growing company in its \ufb01eld this year. Upon investigation, its sales may have been only $5.00 last year, but they grew to $5000.00 this year. This is a 1000-fold increase, while real estate investors might say that sales grew 100,000% this year! Engineers and scientists often prefer absolute terms and might say that the growth rate was $4.995 103 year 1. These are all correct statements. But would you rather invest in a company that had $10 million in sales last year and grew to $20 million this year? That is only a 10-fold increase and only 100% growth. But, the absolute growth is $1 106 year 1,or three orders of magnitude greater than the small \ufb01rm. What does this tell us about rare outcomes, like cancer? First, one must know what the numbers mean. In reviewing epidemiological information, are the data given as incidence of disease or prevalence? Disease incidence is the number of new cases diagnosed each year, while prevalence is the number of cases at any given time. Next, we must be careful that to ascertain whether the values are absolute or relative. For example, are the values given a year-over-year change or are they simply a one-time event. In environmental and public health reports, especially risk assessments, the values are often presented as probabilities in engineering notation, e.g. a common target of cleanup of hazardous waste sites is that no more than one additional case of cancer per million population should be result from the clean site, that is, the added risk is less than or equal to 10 6. Like all probabilities, this is simply a fraction and a decimal.", "However, if the environmental practitioner uses it in a public forum, it can be very disarming and not clearly understood. In fact, the whole concept of population risk is foreign to most people. The point is that when the environmental practitioner goes about explaining rare events like cancer, great care must be taken. Toxicology deals with even smaller values and often very limited data. In fact, one of the raging toxicological debates is that of cancer doseeresponse, and where to literally \u201cdraw the line\u201d. As a matter of scienti\ufb01c policy, in what is known as the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d, many health agencies around the world assume that a single molecule of a carcinogen can cause cancer. In other words, there is no threshold under which a dose, no matter how small, would be safe; \u201cone hit potentially leads to a tumor\u201d. This approach is commonly known as the \u201conehit model\u201d. Most other diseases have such a threshold dose, known as the \u201cno observed adverse effect concentration\u201d or the NOAEC (see Figure 7.3 and 7.5 in Chapter 7). The precautionary principle is in large part due to our lack of understanding of how things work at the molecular level. Toxicological models work better when they use observed data, but at level below this, we are guessing (albeit a very educated guess) as to what is happening. Since risk at very low doses is not directly measurable using animal experiments or from epidemiology, mathematical models are used to extrapolate from high to low doses. (Continued) II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11. CANCER AND AIR POLLUTANTS SMALL NUMBERS AND RARE EVENTS (cont\u2019d) Cancer doseeresponse curves do not have a threshold, i.e. there is no concentration at which cancer is not expected. This does not mean that one molecule of a carcinogen will cause cancer, but it does mean that there is no mathematical difference between a concentration at which cancer will occur and a lower concentration at which cancer will not occur. Thus, cancer risk models are usually considered to be \u201cno threshold\u201d models. Various extrapolation models or procedures may reasonably \ufb01t the observed data; however, extremely large differences of risk at low doses can be calculated. Scientists must use different models depending on the particular chemical compound, as well as use information about how cancer seems to be occurring (i.e. the biological \u201cmechanism of action\u201d at work in the cell).24 When such biological information is limited, the default is to assume linearity and since there is no threshold, the curve intersects the y-axis at 0. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency usually recommends a linearized multistage procedure as the default model unless suf\ufb01cient information to the contrary exists. The linearized multistage procedure calls for the \ufb01tting of a multistage model to the data. Multistage models are exponential models approaching 100% risk at high doses, with a shape at low doses given by a polynomial function. If this is \ufb01rst degree, the model is equivalent to a so-called one-hit model, yielding almost a linear relationship between low dose and cancer risk. An upper bound risk is estimated by applying an appropriate linear term into the statistical bound for the polynomial. At suf\ufb01ciently small exposures, any higher order terms in the polynomial are assumed to be negligible, and the graph of the upper bound will appear to be a straight line. The slope of this line is called slope factor, which is a measure of the cancer potency, the compound, i.e. the steeper the slope the more potent the carcinogen.25 Air pollution \u201ctreatment\u201d is expressed as pollutant removal effciency, such as \u201cpercent removal\u201d. For example, to determine how well an incinerator destroys a hazardous substance, the removal ef\ufb01ciency is employed. Environmental and chemical engineers use the \u201crule of six nines\u201d for extremely hazardous compounds, i.e. the quantity (mass) of a compound in a waste stream must be reduced by 99.9999%. For instance, if the most toxic form of dioxin, tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD) is in a waste stream, the incinerator must destroy 99.9999% (six nines) of the TCDD. If the incinerator is destroying 99.9998%, then it theoretically is out of compliance (assuming the means to quantify the pollutant removal are within the range of six signi\ufb01cant \ufb01gures). Often, however, the removal is reported in units of mass or concentration.", "If a waste contains a total of 100 mg (mass), or 100 mg l 1 (concentration) of TCDD, after treatment in a properly operating incinerator, we are left with 0.0001 mg if we started with 100 mg (100 mge0.999999 100 mg). If the incinerator increases its ef\ufb01ciency seven nines (99.99999% removal), we would have 0.00001 mg TCDD left. That is, the improvement allowed us to remove only 0.00009 mg of TCDD. This leaves the engineer open to \u201cspin\u201d. For example, the incinerator improvement may look better if the removal rate is reported as nanograms (ng) removed (10 ng better). To make the difference look insigni\ufb01cant, one could report the removal as grams removed (only 0.00001 g removed). But, both removal ef\ufb01ciencies are the same, only the units differ! Units can be challenging. For example, in hazardous waste engineering, we often use parts per billion (ppb). That is a small concentration. For example, in the language of bartending, 1 ppb is equivalent to a gin and tonic, where the shot of gin is added to a volume of tonic carried by train with 6 mi of tanker cars!26 A further problem is that removal ef\ufb01ciency is a relative measure of success. If a waste has a large amount of a contaminant, even relatively inef\ufb01cient operations look good. Taking the TCDD example, if waste A has 100 g of TCDD (scary thought!) and waste B has 100 ng of TCDD and they both comply with the rules of six nines, the waste A incinerator is releasing 0.0001 g or 100 ng of the contaminant to the atmosphere, while the waste B incinerator is emitting only 0.0001 ng. That is why environmental laws also set limits on the maximum mass or concentration of a contaminant leaving the stack (or pipe for water discharges). In addition, the laws require that for some pollutants that ambient concentration not be exceeded. However, for many very toxic compounds that require elaborate and expensive monitoring devices, such ambient monitoring is infrequent and highly localized (e.g. near a known polluter). Regulators often depend on self-reporting by the facilities, with occasional audit (analogous to the IRS accepting a taxpayers self-reporting, which is veri\ufb01ed to some extend by audits of a certain sample of taxpayers). Statistics and probabilities for extreme and rare events can be perplexing. People want to know about trends and differences in exposures and diseases between their town or neighborhood and those of others. Normal statistical information about central tendencies, like the mean, median, and mode or ranges and deviations, fail us when we analyze rare events. Normal statistics allows us to characterize the typical behaviors in our data in terms of differences between groups and trends, focusing on the center of the data. Extreme value theory (EVT), conversely, lets us focus on the points far out on the tail of our data, with the intent of characterizing a rare event. For example, perhaps we have been II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION SMALL NUMBERS AND RARE EVENTS (cont\u2019d) collecting health data for 10 years for thousands of exposures over the next 50 years? EVT is one means of workers exposed to a contaminant. What is special about answering these questions. The \ufb01rst question can be those who have been most highly exposed (e.g. those at handled with traditional statistics, but the second is an the 99th percentile)? What can we expect as the highest extrapolation (50 years hence) beyond our data set. 11.5 AIRBORNE CARCINOGENS There are three expansive categories of data from which the weight of evidence of cancer causality are drawn: (1) human data (primarily epidemiological); (2) results of long-term experimental animal bioassays; and (3) supporting data, including a variety of short-term tests for genotoxicity and other relevant properties, kinetic and metabolic studies, and structureeactivity relationships. In hazard identi\ufb01cation of carcinogens under the guidelines, human data, animal data, and supporting evidence are combined to characterize the weight-of-evidence (WOE) regarding the agent\u2019s potential as a human carcinogen. The general categories27 used in the United States are the following: \u0081 Carcinogenic to Humans \u0081 Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans \u0081 Suggestive Evidence of Carcinogenic Potential \u0081 Inadequate Information to Assess Carcinogenic Potential \u0081 Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans. These closely track with an earlier U.S. classi\ufb01cation system placed the cancer potential in a hierarchy of WOE. In descending order from strongest to weakest, the categories are as follows:", "Group A (Strongest WOE)dCarcinogenic to Humans: Agents with adequate human data to demonstrate the causal association of the agent with human cancer (typically epidemiologic data). Group BdProbably Carcinogenic to Humans: Agents with suf\ufb01cient evidence (i.e. indicative of a causal relationship) from animal bioassay data, but either limited human evidence (i.e. indicative of a possible causal relationship, but not exclusive of alternative explanations; Group B1), or with little or no human data (Group B2). Group CdPossibly Carcinogenic to Humans: Agents with limited animal evidence and little or no human data. Group D (Weakest WOE)dNot Classi\ufb01able as to Human Carcinogenicity: Agents without adequate data either to support or refute human carcinogenicity. Group EdEvidence of Noncarcinogenicity for Humans: Agents that show no evidence forcarcinogenicity in at least two adequate animal tests in different species or in both adequate epidemiologic and animal studies. Table 11.6 shows both cancer classi\ufb01cations and the IUR for each hazardous air pollutant designated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The IUR is the upper bound excess lifetime cancer risk estimated to result from continuous exposure to an agent at a concentration of 1 mgm 3 in air. The WOE categories express the relative degree of certainty that these agents may cause cancer in humans. The categories speci\ufb01cally do not connote relative levels of hazard or degree of conservatism applied in developing a doseeresponse assessment. For example, a substance in group C (possible human carcinogen), under the 1986 guidelines, may have a greater cancer risk to a greater number of people than another substance in group A (known human carcinogen), yet there is a greater certainty with regard to the risk associated with the latter. EPA\u2019s WOE classi\ufb01cations are focused on the amount and quality of evidence regarding whether or not a substance is carcinogenic to humans, not on the level of risk a substance might present. A number of chemical classes of air pollutants include carcinogens. Theseinclude bothinorganicandorganic compounds. Carcinogenic metals include both types of compounds. For example, a metal oxide is inorganic and a metal acetate is organic (i.e. an organometallic compound). 11.5.1 Carcinogenic Metals The sensitivity of cells or tissues to metals appears to be related, at least in part, to their ability to produce metallothionein (MT), a protective protein that binds heavy metals. Activation of the MT gene in response to exposure results in production of metallothionein, which sequesters cadmium, thus limiting its genotoxic effects. The difference between rats and mice in sensitivity to a metal as a lung carcinogen appears, at least in part, to be due to differential expression of MT in lung tissue following inhalation exposure to cadmium. Other tissues in which some metals cause cancer in rodents also show minimal basal expression of the MT gene or limited activation of MT in response to metal (e.g. cadmium) exposure. There is no evidence to suggest that mechanisms by which a carcinogenic metal causes tumors in experimental animals would not also operate in humans.28 II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11.5 AIRBORNE CARCINOGENS stainless steel production, welding, chrome plating, and leather tanning. Although lead (Pb) is most associated with neurotoxicity, two of its compounds, i.e. lead acetate and lead phosphate are likely human carcinogens. Lead acetate is used in cotton dyes; as a coating for metals; as a drier in paints, varnishes, and pigment inks; as a colorant in certain permanent hair dyes (progressive dyes); in explosives; and in washes to treat poison ivy. Lead phosphate is a stabilizer in certain plastics and specialty glass. Exposure to these compounds can occur by inhalation, ingestion, or dermally. Occupational studies indicated that inhaled chromium is a human carcinogen, resulting in an increased risk of lung cancer. Although chromium-exposed workers were exposed to both Cr3\u00fe and Cr6\u00fe compounds, only the Cr6\u00fe compounds have been found to be carcinogenic in animal studies. Thus, the Cr6\u00fe species is the only Cr oxidation state that is classi\ufb01ed by the U.S. EPA has as a human carcinogen (Group A).32,33 The calculated Cr6\u00fe IUR estimate is 1.2 10 2 (mgm 3) 1. Thus, a continuously exposed person breathing air containing Cr6\u00fe an average of 8 105 mgm 3 over an entire lifetime would theoretically have no more than a one-in-a-million increased risk of developing cancer. Compounds of the metalloid arsenic have been associated with many forms of skin, lung, bladder, kidney, and liver cancers (Figure 11.11). Occupational exposure to inhaled arsenic, especially in mining and copper smelting, has been consistently associated with an increased lung cancer risk. Arsenic is also used in wood preservatives, glass, insecticides, herbicides, among many processes. Exposure occurs mainly by inhalation air, and by ingestion of food and water.30 11.5.2 Fibers Fibers were introduced in Chapter 6 as elongated particles, i.e. having aspect ratios greater than 3:1. Exposure to \ufb01bers of various chemical compositions, e.g. \ufb01berglass, fabrics, and minerals has been linked to lung and other cancers. The major carcinogenic \ufb01ber is arguably asbestos, a group of highly \ufb01brous minerals with separable, long, and thin \ufb01bers. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 5. Exposure to asbestos causes lung cancer and mesothelioma, which is a cancer of the linings of the lung, abdomen, and heart. It also causes asbestosis, a noncancer disease that progressively limits oxygen exchange. Many of the occupational studies have reported that exposure to asbestos via inhalation causes lung cancer and mesothelioma (Figure 11.12). Smokers who are also exposed to asbestos have a greater than additive increased risk of developing lung cancer. 34 Asbestos exposure via ingestion has also been linked to GI cancers.", "Fibers longer than 5 mm appear to be more carcinogenic than short \ufb01bers (<5 mm). Asbestos to be a human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) and has ranked it in the U.S. EPA\u2019s Group A. The cancer mechanism for asbestos is complex. The synergistic effect of asbestos exposure and cigarette smoke observed for lung cancer has not been observed for mesothelioma in humans. Thus, the mechanisms induced solely by \ufb01bers versus those of \ufb01bers in concert with other carcinogens must be different. Fiber morphology, durability, and surface properties may be the key physicochemical properties that affect carcinogenicity. Asbestos appear to be both a cancer initiator and a promoter. Also, asbestos includes several different types of minerals, so it would appear that numerous mechanisms, the physical and chemical makeup of the different \ufb01bers would have different mechanisms.35 The calculated IUR estimate is 2.3 10 1 (\ufb01bers cm 3) 1. Thus, if an individual were to continuously breathe air containing asbestos at an average of 0.000004 \ufb01bers cm 3 over an entire lifetime, that person would theoretically have no more than a one-in-amillion increased chance of developing cancer as a direct result of breathing air containing this concentration of asbestos.36 Other \ufb01bers have been studied to determine cancer potential. The data are for the most part incomplete and not conclusive. This is not the same as saying they do not cause cancer, only that the weight of evidence is less than that of asbestos in designating them as carcinogenic \ufb01bers. Fiberglass, for example, has not been designated to be a carcinogen, but it may emit styrene, which is a possible carcinogen.38 Human-made \ufb01bers, such as carbon nanotubes, have properties that render them inhalable and potentially harmful, e.g. they may emulate some of asbestos\u2019 physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms.38 Unfortunately, there is presently a paucity of reliable data from which to conduct a cancer risk assessment. 11.5.3 Carcinogenic Organic Compounds Most of the hazardous air pollutants listed in Table 11.6 are organic compounds. These include both aromatics and aliphatic compounds, i.e. rings and chains, respectively. Their toxicity generally and carcinogenicity speci\ufb01cally depend on their chemical structure, especially the extent and types of substitutions (e.g. halogens and alkylated groups may make aromatic compounds more carcinogenic). The chemical conformation is also very important. For example, planar structures tend to increase the likelihood of docking to ligands on cell membranes, which could initiate mutations. As evidence, the planar PCBs appear to be more toxic than the nonplanar PCBs. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 11.

The most prominent indirect pathway is the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer (Figure 11.14). In the late 1970s, the scienti\ufb01c community presented strong evidence of stratospheric ozone reacting with halogenated compounds found refrigerants, propellants, and other chemicals. As a result, laws and regulations were passed in many countries to decrease and eliminate the manufacture and use of several of these compounds, especially the halocarbons, which include the chloro\ufb02uorocarbons (CFCs). Depletion of O3 begins with the release of chemicals into the atmosphere, i.e. air pollutants. Direct exposure is when a toxic chemical is absorbed, distributed, and metabolized to induce changes to genetic material in the cell, which then is expressed as clonal, tumor cells. Conversely, air pollutant carcinogenesis can be indirect, i.e. disease or damage results from earlier reactions that allow for exposures to other agents. In the case of O3 depletion, the agent is ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation.", "Like the direct exposure, the cellular genetic material is damaged, but unlike the direct absorption of the chemical, the damage occurs after numerous reactions with the ozone in the stratosphere and the concomitant increase in UVradiation reaching the earth\u2019s surface that would have otherwise have been trapped (Figure 11.15). Other free radicals besides O catalyze ozone destruction, including Cl ,OH , HOO , and NO . Many reactions occur between O3 and various chemicals, but the net O3 depletion reaction is O3 \u00fe O,/2O2 (11.15) Similar reaction reactions occur when CFCs release atomic Cl. While in the form of CFC, the chlorine and \ufb02uorine are tightly bound in stable compounds. This allows them to move up into stratosphere, where the high energy causes the molecules and fragments of their molecules to photodissociate to form radicals, including Cl ,F ,FO , and ClO . Catalysis is an important part of the process. That is, a molecule acts as the catalyst by reacting with an O3 molecule to remove one of the oxygen atoms, which generate molecular oxygen and the oxygenated form of the molecular catalyst. The oxygenated molecule then reacts with O to form another molecule of O2. Many of these reactions involve free radicals, which are generally reactive given their odd number of electrons. For example, the refrigerant CFC-12 (CF2Cl2) is an important ozone-depleting compound that releases Cl,,ina reaction catalyzed photochemically.

These decreasing ozone concentrations diminish the UV \ufb01lter, which increases the amount of UV radiation at the earth\u2019s surface, thus increasing the global UV dose in the temperate zones (Figure 11.16). This change has been associated with an increase in the incidence of skin cancer, especially the most virulent form, melanoma. The disease is the result of UV exposure, but the UV exposure has been increased due to chemical reactions in the stratosphere, decreasing the absorption of UV. Indeed, the incidence of both nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers has been increasing over the past decades. Globally each year, as many as 3 million persons contract nonmelanoma skin cancer and 132,000 persons contract melanoma. In the U.S. skin cancer represents a third of all diagnosed cancers, with about 20% of the population expected to contract skin cancer in their lifetimes. A 10% decrease in stratospheric O3 concentrations is projected to increase nonmelanoma skin cancer incidence by 26% worldwide. This would be associated with an additional 300,000 nonmelanoma and 4500 melanoma skin cancer cases annually.41 11.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 12 Reproductive and Hormonal Effects of Air Pollutants 12.1 REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS A number of air pollutants can affect the female reproductive system\u2019s processes that produce eggs, as well as processes that affect how the sperm and egg combine to form a single cell (zygote), and the nurturing environment during gestation within the mother that allows the offspring to develop. Certain other air pollutants may also affect the developing, yet to be born child. Such chemicals are known as reproductive and developmental toxins. These chemical classes include teratogens, i.e. substances that induce birth defects, as well as mutagens and carcinogens that are discussed in Chapter 11. The risks of reproductive problems from exposure to pollutants are very important because the time between conception and a child\u2019s birth is arguably the most vulnerablelifestagethreatenedbyairpollution. Duringthistime, the unborn child is undergoing the most rapid growth of its entire lifetime, and whose organsare developing prolifically.1 The child in the womb needs oxygen and nutrients provided by the mother, but the same processes that allow for entry of these essential chemicals also allow exposures, i.e. in utero exposures, to pollutants. The actual effects during development have the same outcomes as in adults, e.g. respiratory dysfunction, cardiovascular problems, cancer, neurological damage, endocrine system changes, and compromised immunological systems. However, the prolifc tissue development and vulnerability at early life stages exacerbates and increases the likelihood of these problems at substantially lower exposures and doses of the same pollutant. Thus, the timing of exposure to an air pollutant is crucial to the type and severity of a reproductive or developmental disorder (Figure 12.1). Developmental respiratory problems are particularly problematic (Figure 12.2). The Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry lists reproductive toxics (Table 12.1). For most of these, inhalation is a major exposure pathway. Note the variability of chemical classes, including substances that are highly volatile (e.g. the chlorinated solvents) to nearly nonvolatile (atrazine). 12.2 ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION", "Developmental effects from air pollutants may also occur after birth. Other developmental toxins adversely affect any human life stage by altering the chemical messages between glands and receptors in cells throughout the body (Figure 12.3). These are collectively known as hormonally active agents or endocrine disruptors. These chemical compounds act in a number of ways at a number of sites (Table 12.2). The endocrine system consists of glands, i.e. specialized groups of cells that manufacture, store, and release hormones directly into the bloodstream. These chemical messengers regulate bodily functions. A number of air pollutants appear to disrupt the activity of glands, including the adrenals, chemoreceptor organs, gonads, hypothalamus, pancreatic islets, parathyroid, pineal, pituitary, and thyroid. Hormones that are affected include steroids, growth hormones, and thyroxine.2 The mode of action can be as an agonist, an antagonist, or as an indirect effect of another endogenous process (e.g. changes to the nervous or immune system that alter hormonal messages). This messaging system in animals and plants employs hormones, which chemical compounds that interact with receptor sites in the cell (usually on the membrane), which, in turn, initiate biochemical processes. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) provide a unique challenge since EDCs can mimic hormones, antagonize normal hormones, alter the pattern of synthesis and metabolism of natural hormones, or modify hormone receptor levels.3 Anthropogenic EDCs that are of concern include pesticide residues (e.g. DDT, Fundamentals of Air Pollution 313 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-401733-7.00012-8 Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 12. REPRODUCTIVE AND HORMONAL EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS endosulfan, and methoxychlor), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, alkylphenols (e.g. nonylphenol), plastic additives (e.g. bisphenol A, diethyl phthalate), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and pharmaceutical hormones (e.g. 17b estradiol, ethinyl estradiol).4 An endocrine disrupting molecule may react with a receptor molecule on the cell\u2019s surface. This reaction may signal the feminine or masculine responses (e.g. hair growth, testis or ova development) much like a hormone would do (Figure 12.4). In other words, the EDC and the natural hormone both bind to the cell\u2019s receptor. They are both ligands, i.e. molecules that travel through the bloodstream as chemical messengers that will bind to a target cell\u2019s receptor. Or, the new polypeptide that is formed from this receptorecontaminant interaction may react with DNA in the nucleus. The former reaction is an example of an endocrine response, while the latter may lead to mutagenicity or cancer. One of the frst EDCs heavily researched was DDT.5 Throughout the 1980s, exposure to this pesticide was associated with abnormal sexual differentiation in seagulls, and thinning and cracking of bald eagle eggs. 6 Numerous pesticides and chemicals have been associated with endocrine related abnormalities in wildlife, including the inducement of feminine traits, such as secretion of the egg laying hormone, vitellogenin, in males of numerous fsh downstream for wastewater treatment plants (likely the result of chemicals used in homes, e.g. household chemicals and drugs) that bypassed treatment).7a,7b Numerous species of aquatic and terrestrial animals are affected by EDCs.8 Recently, these problems have found their way to humans, such as those exposed to halogenated compounds and II.

Several of these EDCs even were found at micro-gram per liter levels, including nonylphenol (40 mgl 1), bisphenol A (12 mgl 1), and ethinyl estradiol (0.831 mgl 1).10 It is diffcult to classify the chemicals that disrupt mammalian endocrine systems, given the different Signaling cell TABLE 12.2 Substances Listed as Endocrine Disruptors by the Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry (2013)2 Aldrin/Dieldrin Atrazine DDT, DDE, DDD Endosulfan Iodine Malathion Methoxychlor Pentachlorophenol Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) & polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)", "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) Toxaphene types of disruption, although those listed by one U.S. agency are largely represented by relatively low vapor pressure, lipophilic compounds.2 Most of the endocrine disruptors listed in Table 12.2 are semivolatile (vapor pressure ranging from 10 5 to 10 2 kPa at 20 C) and persistent organic pollutants Target cell Activated target cell New molecules synthesized, e.g. estrogen produced to stimulate feminization FIGURE 12.4 Schematic of the process for endocrine signals between cells.

Burlington (MA): Elsevier Academic Press; 2009. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 12.2 ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION (POPs). The notable exceptions include iodine (0.04 kPa at 25 C) and atrazine (vapor pressure \u00bc 4 10 8kPa at 20 C), given that iodine is not an organic compound and that atrazine can be considered virtually nonvolatile. Airborne POPs are particularly dangerous since they are often hormonally active and damage unborn children and neonates, as evidenced by their routinely being detected in breast milk11,12 andininfant cordblood.13,14 In the United States, biomonitoring results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show widespread human exposure to industrial chemicals, many of which have not been fully evaluated for adverse health effects but a number of which are likely EDCs. Much of the exposure to POPs is at distance from original sources and points of use. Due to their persistence, POPs can be transported to long distances. Long-range atmospheric transport can carry pollutants thousands of miles to what would otherwise be thought to be relatively pristine areas, e.g. arctic regions. POPs are a subset of the so-called \u201cPBTs\u201d, which are compounds that are persistent, readily bioaccumulate in tissue, and are toxic at low doses. PBTs are composed of myriad compounds (see Discussion Box: The Inuit and Persistent Organic Pollutants). Hormonally active pollutants actually include numerous chemical classes beyond those listed in LONG-RANGE ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT AND THE INUIT Indigenous peoples often subsist on traditional food for all or part of their diet. This is certainly true for the Inuit population who live in the Arctic and sub-Arctic climes. Ironically, these very remote Arctic regions have been chronically exposed to POPs, rendering these subpopulations vulnerable to the chronic health effects. Since POPs remain in the environment for long periods of time, they can be transported over great distances from their sources. The tendency of these compounds to be toxic, to bioaccumulate, and to biomagnify in food chains increases the risk to the Inuit populations. In addition to the need for many indigenous people in the Arctic to rely on traditional diets for nourishment, the hunting and fshing are also an important part of their cultural identity. Indeed, alternative sources of food often do not exist. Exacerbating the problem, traditional diets are often high in fat. Since most POPs are lipophilic, they tend to accumulate in fatty tissue of the animals that are eaten. Due to these physicochemical properties, POPs can move many hundreds of kilometers away from their sources, either in the gas phase or attached to particles. They are generally moved by advection, i.e. along with the movement of air masses. Some of the routes of long-range transport of POPs are shown in Figure 12.5. There is also a fairness problem. That is, most northern residents have not used or directly benefted from the activities associated with the production and use of these chemicals, yet indigenous peoples in the Arctic have some of the highest known exposures to these chemicals. Lactating Inuit mother\u2019s breast milk, for example, contains elevated levels of PCBs, DDT, and its metabolites, chlorinated dioxins and furans, and brominated organics, such as residues from fre retardants, i.e. polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and heavy metals.1,15 Infants are particularly vulnerable to persistent, bioaccumulating toxic compounds (PBTs) which, as mentioned, are lipophilic and fnd their way to fat reserves in warmblooded animals (Figure 12.6). Although POPs are found in varying tissue concentrations among women in both industrially developed and developing nations, the Canadian Inuit have shown some of the highest levels of contaminants to be detected.", "Their diet consists of seal, whale, and other species high on the marine food chain, increasing the Inuit body burden of POPs.16 These elevated exposures have been associated with reports of health effects similar to the effects of persons exposed to PCBs who also had evidence of other contaminants in body fuids. A study of Inuit women from Hudson Bay17 indicated very high levels of PCBs and dichlorodiphenylethene (DDE) in breast milk; these results prompted an examination of the health status of Inuit newborns.18 Correlation analysis revealed a statistically signifcant negative association between male birth length and levels of hexachlorobenzene, mirex, PCBs, and chlorinated dibenzodioxins (CDDs)/dibenzofurans (CDFs) in the fat of mothers\u2019 milk. No signifcant differences were observed between male and female newborns for birth weight, head circumference, or thyroid stimulating hormone. Immune system effects have also been detected in Inuit infants suspected of receiving elevated levels of PCBs and dioxins during lactation. These babies had a drop in the ratio of the CD4\u00fe (helper) to CD8\u00fe (cytotoxic) T cells at ages 6 and 12 months (but not at 3 months).18 The Inuit situation demonstrates the critical ties between humans and their environment and the importance of physical properties of contaminants (e.g. persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity potentials), the conditions of the environment (e.g. the lower Arctic temperatures increase the persistence of many POPs), and the complexities of human activities (e.g. diet and lifestyle) in order to assess risks and, ultimately, to take actions to reduce exposures. The combination of these factors leaves the Inuit (Continued) II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 12. REPRODUCTIVE AND HORMONAL EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS LONG-RANGE ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT AND THE INUIT (cont\u2019d) in a tragic dilemma. Since they are subsistence anglers and hunters, they depend almost entirely on a tightly defned portion of the earth for food. Their lifestyle and diet dictate dependence on food sources high in POPs. What makes this disaster even more complex and tragic is that it forces innocent people to make extremely diffcult decisions. Pediatricians rightly encourage breast feeding for its many attributes, including enhancing the infant\u2019s immune system in the critical frst weeks after birth. So, in terms of risk tradeoffs, it is dangerous to discourage breast feeding. This dilemma not only applies to the Inuit, or to subsistence farmers, hunters, and anglers, but to all of us. The key is to ensure that breast milk everywhere does not contain hazardous levels of PBTs and other contaminants. The only way to do this is to consider the entire life cycle of the pollutants and fnd ways to prevent their entry into the environment in the frst place. Another lesson is to pay attention to the properties of a compound before its use and to monitor for problems after the product reaches the marketplace. For example, all other things being equal, the recalcitrance of compounds is greater in the Arctic regions compared to temperate and tropical regions, as a direct result of lower ambient temperature. Toxicity properties of environmental contaminants are also affected by extrinsic conditions, such as whether the substances are found in the air, water, sediment, or soil, along with the conditions of these media (e.g. oxidationereduction, pH, and grain size). For example, the metal mercury is usually more toxic in reduced and anaerobic conditions because it is more likely to form alkylated organometallic compounds, like monomethyl mercury and the extremely toxic dimethyl mercury. These reduced chemical species are likely to form when buried under layers of sediment where dissolved oxygen levels approach zero. Ironically, engineers have unwittingly participated in increasing potential exposures to these toxic compounds. With the good intention of attempting to clean up contaminated lakes in the 1970s, engineers recommended and implemented dredging programs in the process of removing the sediment. However, the metals and other toxic chemicals that had been relatively inert and encapsulated in buried sediment were released to the lake waters. In turn, the compounds were also more likely to fnd their way to the atmosphere (see Figure 14.8 in Chapter 14). The problem of long-range transport of persistent pollutants begins with the manufacture and use of a product, followed by contamination of soil and surface waters. Next the persistence allows the chemicals to reach the groundwater and to be sequestered in sediment. These are the reservoirs of the pollutants, which serve as sources of air pollutants. The pollutants are then transported many kilometers before they accumulate in the food chain.", "Along the way, humans and ecosystems are exposed, but the most damage to human populations may well occur in people who have not benefted from the use which occurred decades earlier. Unfortunately for the Inuit, the doses which cause the most reproductive, endocrine, neurotoxic, and other chronic effects are highest among a population separated in time and space from the benefts of pest control enjoyed by a previous generation of another population. These complexities are a lesson to environmental scientists and engineers to consider systematically the many physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the compound and the environment where it exists. Table 12.2. Another U.S. agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, includes a more expansive list of EDCs beyond the persistent organic pollutants (Table 12.3). This listing follows the process wherein chemicals are evaluated and screened for potential for endocrine disruption based on biological assays and potential exposure scenarios. This is a listing of the chemicals which were frst screened as part of the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) based on human exposure-related factors, not the actual biological mechanisms of endocrine disruption.19 The factors include whether a chemical is produced in high volumes (i.e. high production volume [HPV] chemicals). This initial list focuses on active ingredients and inert ingredients of products. Therefore, Table 12.3 merely presents an alphabetized list of pesticide active ingredients and HPV/pesticide inert chemicals for screening in the EDSP. Because this list of chemicals was selected on the basis of exposure potential only, it was neither construed as a list of known nor likely endocrine disruptors. After developing this frst listing, the U.S. EPA issued a revised list of chemicals (Table 12.4)for screening. As in the frst list (Table 12.3), these are merely candidates for potential endocrine disruptors, based on registration status and/or the likelihood of exposure (i.e. via drinking water).20 Although the list is based on the ingestion pathway, the water being II.

They are diverse in molecular structure (Tables 12.4 and 12.5), come from a myriad of sources, and have been detected throughout the environment, i.e. food, water, air, soil, and in plant and animal tissues. It is noteworthy that there is little overlap between the three tables. This is partially the result of the criteria for ranking endocrine disruptors.

DDT fnds its way to the fnal product, although this amount has decreased to <1% in current formulations. Evidence suggests that dicofol is less endocrine disruptive than DDT and its metabolite, p,p0-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE; see Chapter 19). The difference may be that dicofol can be more readily metabolized to less toxic chemicals, or that it has a shorter half-life (t1/2) than the t1/2 of DDT or DDE. It may also be because the parent compound of dicofol is less potent than DDT or DDE, or the reduced potency of the parent compound.21 The chronic dietary reference dose (RfD, see Chapter 7), based on its endocrine effects is 0.004 mg kg 1 day 1. As a comparison, the oral RfD for DDT is 0.0005 mg kg 1 day 1, i.e. an order of magnitude greater hazard for DDT compared to dicofol. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 12. REPRODUCTIVE AND HORMONAL EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS The modes of action of endocrine disruption can be similar between mammals and other vertebrates. Thus, EDCs are also threats to ecosystems. Indeed, dicofol was the agent of a large spill into Lake Apopka, Florida. Studies of the consequences of the spill provided information about endocrine disruption of wildlife as a result of impaired physiology of reptiles, especially alligators, brought on by changes in their hormonal systems. Understanding of human endocrine disruption has also been enhanced from extrapolations from these and other \u201cnatural experiments\u201d and other studies following spills and releases of toxic substances. 12.2.1 Endocrine Disruptor Characteristics Some endocrine disruptors act directly on hormone receptors as hormone mimics or agonists.24 Some EDCs block hormone receptors, i.e. antagonists. An estrogenic compounds, for example, may lead to the same physiological outcome, i.e. feminization, as an anti-androgenic compound that blocks the estrogen receptor. The former is an estrogen agonists, the latter is an androgen antagonist. Others act directly on any number of proteins that control the delivery of a hormone to its normal target cell.", "The affnity of an endocrine disruptor to a hormone receptor is not directly equivalent to its potency, i.e. the doseeresponse of an EDC is one of the many factors within the endocrine system that determine the actual hormonal response. Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, most EDC doseeresponse curves are nonlinear. Endocrine disruptors are not necessarily specifc, i.e. the same chemical can disrupt the activity of more than a single androgen, estrogen, or thyroid hormone. Indeed, some EDCs have been found to interact with multiple hormone receptors simultaneously. It appears that two different EDCs may act synergistically at low doses that would not have elicited an effect had each EDC acted alone. As mentioned, EDCs often are also harmful to reproduction and development. Sensitivity to endocrine disruption is most severe during tissue development. The developmental effects occur at lower doses than those required for the same effects in adults. Thus, any testing for endocrine disruption must consider exposures during a specifc developmental period and the entire life, i.e. lifelong follow-up is needed to assess latent effects. Endocrine disrupting compounds have been found to be transported from mother to child occurs through the 23e25 placenta during pregnancy. Indeed, there is much interest in the linking in utero exposures to air pollutants and other environmental contaminants to develop 26,27 mental outcomes. QUESTIONS 1.

They range from the infamous toxic metals, lead and mercury, to complex organic compounds that were either designed and synthesized to insult nervous systems, e.g. the organochlorine and organophosphorus insecticides to other compounds that just happen be neurotoxic, e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and halogenated compounds like the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These and other neurotoxicants move through the environment in many ways, but air transport is a key pathway that leads to human exposure. Given the complexity of neural systems, the types of neurotoxicity elicited by air pollutants are varied. When taken up by humans and other organisms, they may either be detoxi\ufb01ed or undergo bioactivation to become more toxic. Thus, the parent compounds may be intrinsically neurotoxic or they may be activated to become neurotoxic (Figure 13.1). Following the absorption and distribution of the neurotoxicant, the metabolic mechanism can be categorized. These general classi\ufb01cations of neurotoxic effects are discussed in the following sections.1 13.1.1 Demyelination The support of myelin to signal transduction in the nervous system is analogous to an electrical insulator that prevents the loss of ionic currents. When xenobioticsa interfere with these processes in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), it can cause numbness, weakened muscles, poor coordination, and paralysis, known as myelinopathy. The effect of demyelination in the brain is known as toxic leukoencephalopathy, which ranges in severity from headaches to cognitive dysfunction to paralysis and death. Pollutants can adversely affect the integrity of the myelin sheath either in the absence of or prior to damage to the myelinating cells and those that injure myelinproducing cells. The former group includes hexachlorophene, the organometallic species of tin (Sn) and other pollutants that cause reversible edema between the layers of myelin.", "Neurons (i.e. nerve cells; Figure 13.2) vary in susceptibility to different pollutants. For example, the optic nerve is highly susceptible to hexachlorophene, whereas other cranial nerves tend to have higher susceptibility to organic solvents, e.g. xylenes or trichloroethylene. Conversely, long-term exposure to cyanide compounds (CN ) and carbon monoxide (CO) appears to cause direct injury to myelin-producing Schwann cell Eliminaon Detoxi\ufb01caon Phase 2 Inacve metabolite metabolism Toxic e\ufb00ect FIGURE 13.1 Metabolic pathways of detoxi\ufb01cation and bio-activation of an air pollutant. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) a Xenobiotic here is used to denote any substance foreign to the body. In other usage, a xenobiotic is one that is not only foreign, but is synthetic. The former would include any species of a metal, including naturally occurring forms, e.g. elemental lead or mercury. The latter de\ufb01nition would only include the chemical forms that are produced anthropogenically.

NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS bodies in the PNS and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Inorganic lead (Pb) also damages myelin-producing cells. Oligodendrocytes seem to be more sensitive to Pb toxicity than do astrocytes or neurons. Indeed, the developmental effects of Pb exposure may result from the preferential inhibition of oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation. 13.1.2 Axonopathy An axon can be degenerated while leaving the cell body intact, i.e. axonopathy, which can cause sensory and motor function de\ufb01cits. Often, the greatest vulnerability to this type of neurotoxicity is at the most distal portions of the longest-and largest-diameter axon, which are the \ufb01rst parts to degenerate. The degeneration progresses with proximally and may eventually affect the entire neuron after long-term exposure, in a process known as \u201cdying back neuropathy\u201d. With axon degeneration, the myelin also degrades, but Schwann cells in the PNS may survive and guide PNS axon regeneration. Such regeneration does happen within the CNS. The vulnerability of distal axons to toxic effects may be because these regions are more dependent on intact energy-dependent axonal transport mechanisms. Certain xenobiotics can transect an axon. Pollutants that interfere with the production of the coenzyme adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) may cause distal regions to degenerate \ufb01rst. Neurotoxicants that target the globular protein, tubulin, also induce this injury since tubulin-derived microtubules are critical for axonal transport. 13.1.3 Neuronopathy Neuronopathy is a collective and general term related to damage to nerve cells, primarily in the body of the neuron. Airborne neurotoxicants can affect the normal cycles of cellular generation and apoptosis, i.e. cell death, in neurons. For example, the most toxic dioxin congener, i.e. 2,3,7,8-dibenzo-para-dioxin, induces neurotoxicity and neuronal apoptosis in the brain cortex in part due to changes in neuronal apoptosis.2 Toxicity induced by glutamate and other excitatory amino acids, i.e. excitotoxicity, may cause ischemic and seizure-induced brain damage. For example, a toxin produced by algae in shell\ufb01sh, i.e. domoic acid, binds to glutamate receptors, resulting in excitotoxic cell death. Although this is not a direct air pollution impact, pollutants that deposit into surface waters could change ecosystem diversity, with the indirect effect of preferential growth of certain toxin-producing microbes, e.g. algae, which could lead to human neurotoxicity. 13.1.4 Functional Neurotoxicity Neurotoxicants can interfere with nervous system signaling processes by activating or inhibiting receptors, or by altering the optimal quantities of a neurotransmitter available to activate receptors. For example, exposure to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides affects acetylcholine signaling. 13.1.5 Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition Potential neurotoxicants are metabolized principally by oxidation, hydrolysis by esterases, and by transfer of portions of the molecule to glutathione. As discussed in Chapter 12, oxidation can detoxify or enhance toxicity by bioactivation. Many compounds are not directly neurotoxic, e.g. phosphorothioates, but become so as a result of oxidative metabolism to a neurotoxic compound. One of the most obvious and widespread mechanism for environmental neurotoxicity is by inhibit the II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 13.1 NEUROTOXICITY endogenous production of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The function of AChE is to hydrolyze the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is needed for synapses. Organophosphates inhibit AChE, which stops the enzyme\u2019s stimulation of the neural receptor activity. Following the release of acetylcholine into the synapse or the neuromuscular junction, AChE-catalyzed hydrolysis terminates the receptor-stimulating activity. Many pesticides include sulfur-phosphorous moieties, e.g. thiophosphates, thionophosphates, and thiophosphonates, which do not effectively inhibit AChE: S (or O) R1 P C\u2013\u2026\u2026.", "R2 The R1 and R2 groups are either alkyl (carbon chain) or aryl (benzene ring) groups, which may be bonded directly to phosphorus (i.e. in phosphinates), or linked via eOe, or eSe (i.e. in phosphates). Also, the R1 may be bonded directly and R2 bonded via one of the above groups (phosphonates). In phosphoramidates, carbon is linked to phosphorus through an eNH group. The group Ce. can be any of numerous substituted and branched aliphatic, aromatic, or heterocyclic groups linked to phosphorus by a bond (usually eOe or eSe), which is known as the leaving group. The double-bonded atom may be oxygen or sulfur. The P]O form of a thioate ester is referred to as the oxon, which is often part of the name of the derived compound (e.g. parathion is the parent P]S compound of paraoxon). Since the P]Sform is intrinsically relatively stable, many insecticides are manufactured in this form which then is converted to the biologically active oxon in tissues. The substituent groups in R1,R2,and Ce. may also be chemically transformed.3 These compounds are activated to phosphates or phosphonates by a CYP-dependent monooxygenase activity known as oxidative desulfuration (Chapter 12). The biologically active oxons bind to the active site of AChE, covalently phosphorylating the serine residue in the catalytic site of the enzyme. The phosphorylation of AChE creates a relatively stable inactive enzyme that persists for hours to days before hydrolysis of the phosphate moiety occurs spontaneously, and AChE activity is restored. An example of the bioactivation process is: The precursor phosphorothioate in the pesticide parathion is bioactivated to the phosphate ester. This ester is directly responsible for the inhibition of AChE and for subsequent neurotoxicity.3 Carbamates similarly inhibit AChE, but by carbamylating the enzyme. The stability of the carbamylated enzyme is much less than the phosphorylated enzyme and spontaneous reactivation occurs much faster than with organophosphates. Whereas organophosphates enhance neurotransmitter activity by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, many toxins produce hyperstimulation of receptors by directly binding and activating them (agonism). Others reduce receptor stimulation by prohibiting the neurotransmitter from activating them (antagonism). Certain chemical properties appear to increase the likelihood and severity of a neurotoxicant. Neurotoxicity increases with length of carbon chain and hydrophobicity of R1 and R2, and when a leaving group is not sterically hindering (e.g. planar forms tend to be more toxic than nonplanar). 13.1.6 Developmental Neurotoxicity The previous chapter discussed how exposures to air pollutants in utero and during early life can permanently alter physiology and metabolism. This not only applies to carcinogens, but to numerous other air pollutants, including those that adversely affect the nervous system, i.e. neurotoxins. Neonates are particularly vulnerable because of their rapid tissue growth, cell differentiation, immature metabolic pathways, and the development of vital organ systems. The CNS is particularly vulnerable, given its unprotected barriers and a large time of conformation.4 The neurotoxic effects can be manifested immediately, or they may have latency periods of decades. For example, early life stage exposures to lead, mercury, and PAHs have been associated neurotoxic years or even decades after exposure. 5 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviewed the scienti\ufb01c literature to assemble a list of chemicals that are toxic to the developing mammalian nervous system. Compounds were assigned one of three groups based on the strength of the evidence for developmental neurotoxicity: (1) no evidence: either there were no reports that met prescribed criteria for evidence, or there were reports which showed no developmental neurotoxicity; (2) minimal evidence: one report only or (13.1) II.

Those chemicals that have substantial evidence of developmental neurotoxicity are shown in Table 13.1. The list includes metals and their compounds, pesticides, industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other substances (e.g. nicotine and tetrahydrocannabinol, chemicals in tobacco and marijuana smoke, respectively). It also includes criteria air pollutants, i.e. ozone (O3)and CO. 13.2 NEUROTOXIC METALS Metals have been known for centuries to induce neurotoxicity. Metal toxicity has been observed for millennia.", "The Ebers papyrus documented lead, copper, and the metalloid antimony over 3000 years ago. Hippocrates (460e377 BC) noted abdominal problems in miners of metallic ore.6 Metals were important to ancient societies, but even then, their toxicity was somewhat known. The Romans, for example, knew of the danger of mercury exposure, so they used prisoners to mine the metal.7 Since metals continue to be important part of society, it is inevitable that humans and ecosystems will be exposed to myriad metallic compounds. After exposure, the parent metal, a salt, a cation, or one of its organometallic species is absorbed and distributed within the body. A fraction of the species or its transformation products may accumulate in lipids and other substrates and the rest is excreted. The difference results in accumulation and increased body burden. The metal and its metabolites thereafter induce neurotoxicity in various ways. For neurotoxicity to occur, a metal must reach a neural target (e.g. a neuron) at a concentration suf\ufb01cient to alter mechanistically the normal functioning of the nervous system. Metal neurotoxicity can involve the types of membrane receptoreligand disruptions discussed in Chapter 12. However, it may also involve intracellular receptors and ion channels.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 13.2 NEUROTOXIC METALS tend to react with nucleophilic macromolecules, e.g. proteins, amino acids, and nucleic acids. A nucleophile donates an electron pair to an electrophile, an electron pair acceptor, to form a chemical bond. Mercury, for example, reacts with sulfur (S) in thiols, cysteinyl protein residues, and glutathione and S in thiols and thiolates. However, other metals, e.g. lithium, calcium, and barium, preferentially react with harder nucleophiles, e.g. the oxygen in purines. Lead tends to fall between these two extremes, i.e. exhibits universal reactivity with all nucleophiles.6 13.2.1 Lead Humans are exposed to lead (Pb) through numerous routes and pathways (Figure 13.3). In the United States, mean Pb population exposure has fallen with the elimination of leaded gasoline, Pb-based paint, and Pb solder in cans. With the decrease in Pb exposure, measured blood-Pb levels in the U.S. population has also occurred. The same phenomenon has been observed in other countries that eliminated gasoline Pb.8 However, Pb exposures remains can remain elevated in areas near Pb sources, e.g. smelters, or for subpopulation exposed to Pb-based paint or Pb-contaminated drinking water.9 Like other metals, Pb can bioaccumulate in the tissues of aquatic organisms through ingestion of food and water, and adsorption from water, and can subsequently lead to adverse effects in contaminated tissue. The metal lead (Pb) is arguably the most notorious and well-studied human neurotoxin. Many studies have indicated that an increase in Pb body burden, as indicated by blood Pb concentrations >10 mg dl, is associated with decreased cognitive functions10 and increased behavioral problems11 (Figure 13.4). Indeed, at elevated concentrations from acute exposure, Pb insults to the brain and CNS can result in coma, convulsions, and death. Surviving children from such acute Pb poisoning typically retain mental and behavioral disruptions. With lower concentrations, long-term exposures are associated with asymptomatic periods before observable neurotoxic effects, including diminished cognition, shortened attention span, behavioral changes, dyslexia, and attention de\ufb01cit disorder. Other effects from chronic Pb exposure include hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity, and toxicity to the reproductive organs. For the most part, these effects are permanent. Most of these ailments are irreversible and resist medical treatment.12 One of the \ufb01rst observations of a neurotoxic air pollutant was that of the Pb. Ingestion of nonfood items, i.e. pica, is known to be a major pathway to Pb exposure that leads to increase Pb concentrations in a child\u2019s blood, and ultimately to neurotoxic effects. However, other pathways contribute to the Pb body burden. In particular, interest has been given to near-road exposures to air pollutants.", "Like several other heavy metals, Pb interferes with physiological processes because, when ionized, divalent lead (Pb2\u00fe) acts like divalent FIGURE 13.3 Pathways by which humans Auto Industrial Crustal are exposed to lead.

Due to its larger atomic size and other chemical differences, however, Pb2\u00fe induces biological processes that differ from those of Ca2\u00fe. For example, during gestation and in early childhood, the developing brain is harmed when Pb2\u00fe, competing with Ca2\u00fe, induces the release of a neurotransmitter in elevated amounts and at the wrong time (e.g. during basal intervals, when a person is at rest). Thus, at high lead exposures, a person may have abnormally high amounts of brain activity (when it should be lower) and, conversely, when a neural response is expected, little or no increase in brain activity is observed. This may induce chronic effects when synaptic connections in the brain are truncated during early brain development. Lead also adversely affects the release of the transmitter, glutamate, which is involved in brain activities associated with learning. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor seems to be selectively blocked when lead is present. Other lead effects include the activation of protein kinase C (known as \u201cPKC\u201d) because PKC apparently has a greater af\ufb01nity for lead than for the normal physiological activator, divalent calcium. This interference complicates and exacerbates the other neurotransmitter effects and harms the cell\u2019s chemical messaging (i.e. second-messenger systems), synthesis of proteins, and genetic expression. All of these neurological effects, especially in the developing brain, began to be documented in earnest by the medical community only within the last half century. Herbert Needleman, a pediatrician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, discovered that a correlation existed between the amount of lead in the teeth of infants and their intelligence at age 16, as measured by their IQ scores. 13 This lead to research that has continued to show an inverse doseeresponse between lead dose and measured IQ. That is, the higher the lead content, the lower the IQ in these teenagers. In a series of follow-up studies, Needleman determined that lead poisoning had long-term implications for a child\u2019s attentiveness, behavior, and school success. Especially in poorer homes with older residences, this type of ingestion continues to be a major lead exposure pathway in young children. Other pathways include soil ingestion (another example of pica), inhalation of lead on dust particles (which can be very high when older homes are renovated, so not limited to lower socioeconomic status children), and Pb that has leached into food from glazes on cooking and dining ware into the food; common in some ethnic groups, e.g. Hispanic-Americans in the United States. Needleman and other scientists called interventions even while the scienti\ufb01c evidence is still being gathered.b He was among the \ufb01rst to advocate the removal of tetraethyl lead from gasoline and to remove lead-based paints and to reduce exposure in houses where young children can chew on the paint chips. The results have been dramatic, with average blood lead levels in this country dropping an estimated 78% from 1976 to 1991. Some important health thresholds are shown in Figure 13.5. It is important to note that chronic lead thresholds, e.g. the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), are several orders of magnitude lower than acute thresholds.", "As with other chronic disease, a b At least on its face, this runs contrary to some of the measures calling for improved environmental risk-based science proposed in the 1980s, especially the separation of risk assessment and risk management. The National Academy of Sciences in 1983 (Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process; ISBN: 0309033497) issued risk assessment guidance with the intent to make risk science more objective and empirical. Thus, the scienti\ufb01c aspects of risks, i.e. risk assessment, are considered independently from the decision making aspects of risks, i.e. risk management. II.

Notably, a mercury-based preservative used in vaccines has been implicated by certain advocacy group as contributing to the apparent increase in autism in recent decades. The metal has also been central to the debate about the safety of seafood and tradeoffs of hazards to unborn and nursing babies and the bene\ufb01ts of breast Regulatory and advisory numbersa NIOSH IDLH (100 mg m\u20133) NIOSH REL, OSHA PEL & ACGIH TLV (0.05 mg m\u20133) 8-h average) NAAQS (0.00015 mg m\u20133 3-month average) feeding, given the proli\ufb01c in utero and neonatal neural tissue development. Like other metals, mercury is a natural component of the earth, with an average abundance of approximately 0.05 mg kg 1 in the earth\u2019s crust, with signi\ufb01cant local variations. It is an unusual metal in that it is a liquid at room temperature (it melts at 38.9 C and boils at 303 C) and is quite heavy with a density of 13.5 g cm 3 at 25 C. Studies have indicated that mercury can be a toxic substance and that one of its compounds methylmercury chloride is a highly toxic substance. Measurements have shown that because mercury persists in the environment and methylmercury II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 13. NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS biomagni\ufb01es up the food chain, a wide variety of species and ecosystems may be exposed to excessive levels of mercury in the environment.16 Mercury ores that are mined generally contain about 1% mercury, but at the Almaden mine in Spain they are mining an ore which contains about 12% mercury. Although about 25 mercury minerals are known, virtually the only deposits that are being mined contain cinnabar (HgS), a bright red substance which is also used to produce the color vermillion.", "Despite a decline in global mercury consumption, competing sources of mercury and low prices, the mining of mercury continues in a number of countries. Spain, China, Kyrgyzstan, and Algeria have dominated this activity in recent years. The last U.S. mine closed in 1982. There are reports of small mines in China, Russia (Siberia), Outer Mongolia, Peru, and Mexico. In the early 1980s, the annual production from mining (cinnabar) was 7000 tonnes, today it is less than half of that and is about 2000 tonnes.17 Mercury is also obtained: as a by-product of mining or re\ufb01ning of other metals (such as zinc, gold, silver) or minerals and even from natural gas; from recycling spent products; and reprocessing mine tailings containing mercury. In the United States, this recovery of mercury as a by-product of other metal mining (primarily gold) from recycling and from the decommissioning of chloralkali plants, amounts to about 250 tonnes per year. 3 Concentrations of total mercury in the atmosphere of the northern hemisphere have recently been estimated at 2 ng m 3, those in the southern hemisphere being half this value. Values in urban areas are usually higher (e.g. 10 ng m 3). Mercury has an appreciable vapor pressure (2 10 3mmHg or 0.3Pa at 25 C) which is the reason for it being in the atmosphere.18,19 It has been estimated that each year 2000e3000 tonnes20 enter the atmosphere from natural and anthropogenic sources. Natural sources, such as volcanoes, are responsible for approximately half of atmospheric mercury emissions. The anthropogenic half can be divided into the following estimated percentages which excludes biomass burning, an important source in some regions21,22: \u0081 65% from stationary combustion, of which coal-\ufb01red power plants are the largest aggregate source (40% of U.S. mercury emissions in 1999). This includes power plants fueled with gas where the mercury has not been removed. Emissions from coal combustion are between one and two orders of magnitude higher than emissions from oil combustion, depending on the country.23 \u0081 11% from gold production. The three largest point sources for mercury emissions in the United States are the three largest gold mines. Hydrogeochemical release of mercury from gold-mine tailings has been accounted as a signi\ufb01cant source of atmospheric mercury in eastern Canada. \u0081 6.8% from nonferrous metal production, typically smelters. \u0081 6.4% from cement production. \u0081 3.0% from waste disposal, including municipal and hazardous waste, crematoria, and sewage sludge incineration. This is a signi\ufb01cant underestimate. \u0081 3.0% from caustic soda production. \u0081 1.4% from pig iron and steel production. \u0081 1.1% from mercury production, mainly for batteries. \u0081 2.0% from other sources. Mercury vapor in laboratories can be a problem especially in laboratories that are heated. One way of reducing the evaporation (Hg vapor pressure is quite low; i.e. 1.712619 10 4 kPa at 20 C) is to cover the pool of mercury in a beaker with a layer of water. The diffusion of mercury through water is very slow and it effectively seals off the evaporation process (the diffusion coef\ufb01cient of mercury in water is extremely low, 10 2 1).24,25 i.e.6.3 10 m s The chemical species most easily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract (about 95% absorbed) is methylmercury. Organic Hg species, especially methylmercury, impairs neurological development, especially in unborn children and infants. Methylmercury in utero exposure, which can result from a mother\u2019s consumption of \ufb01sh and shell\ufb01sh that contain methylmercury, can adversely affect a baby\u2019s growing brain and nervous system. Through the blood of a pregnant woman, Hg enters the blood of the developing child and then into the child\u2019s brain and other tissues. As with metallic mercury (Hg0), methylmercury can endogenously form inorganic mercury compounds. These compounds can accumulate and in the brain. Elimination of methylmercury occurs slowly over a period of several months, mostly as inorganic mercury in the feces. As with inorganic mercury, a fraction of the methylmercury in a nursing woman\u2019s body will pass into her breast milk.26 Cognitive skills, memory, attention, language, as well as \ufb01ne motor and visual spatial skills have been observed in children exposed to methylmercury in the womb. More recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) support this general \ufb01nding. Outbreaks of Hg poisonings provide strong evidence that adults, children, and unborn children are at risk from ingestion and inhalation exposures to mercury. During methylmercury poisoning outbreaks, infants were born with severe disabilities to some mothers who showed no symptoms of nervous system damage.", "These experiences demonstrated that the developing nervous system of the unborn child is likely much II.

Reported in Ref. 28. more vulnerable to methylmercury exposure than is the adult nervous system.27 Mercury concentrations in human populations are being found above reference concentrations (RfC \u00bc 0.3 mgm 3), i.e. concentrations considered to be safe for exposures. For example, the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey measurements of blood Hg levels in human populations from the years 1999 through 2002 con\ufb01rm that blood Hg levels indicate that approximately 6% of childbearing-aged (i.e. 16e49 years old) women had levels at or above 5.8 mgl 1 (Table 13.2).28 This is the blood Hg concentration equivalent to the reference dose, which is 0.1 mg per kilogram body weight per day (0.1 mgkg 1 day 1). Based on this prevalence for the overall U.S. population of women of reproductive age and the number of U.S. births each year, 300,000 newborns each year may have increased risk of learning disabilities associated with in utero exposure to methylmercury.29 13.2.3 Manganese As with lead and mercury, other metals are released to atmosphere not only as a result of mechanical processes during extraction and manufacturing, but also by combustion processes. Many organometallic molecules have been identi\ufb01ed in the ef\ufb02uent from system burning pure methane with pure oxygen. Inhibitors, such as tetraethyl lead and methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), can greatly change the rate of reaction. That is their principal asset as gasoline additives. MMT (CH3C5H4)Mn(CO)3 is an octane enhancer, which was approved as a fuel additive in the US. The element manganese (Mn) is ubiquitous in the environment. The metal and its compounds have been an important constituent of numerous manufacturing processes, including30: \u0081 Metallic manganese primarily in steel production to improve hardness, stiffness, and strength. It is also used in carbon steel, stainless steel, and high-temperature steel, along with cast iron and super alloys \u0081 Manganese dioxide (MnO2) in the production of dry-cell batteries, matches, \ufb01reworks, and the production of other manganese compounds \u0081 Catalyst manganese chloride (MnCl2$4H2O) in the chlorination of organic compounds, in animal feed, and in dry-cell batteries \u0081 Manganese sulfate as a fertilizer, livestock nutritional supplement, in glazes and varnishes, and in ceramics. The average manganese levels in various environmental media are31: \u0081 levels in drinking water are approximately 0.004 parts per million (ppm); \u0081 average air levels are approximately 0.02 micrograms per cubic meter (mgm 3); \u0081 levels in soil range from 40 to 900 ppm; \u0081 average daily intake from food ranges from 1 to 5 milligrams per day (mg day 1). Workers where manganese metal is produced from manganese ore or where manganese compounds are used to make steel or other products are most likely to be exposed through inhalation to higher than normal levels of manganese. Arguably, one of the most important current issues associated with manganese is as a fuel additive, especially MMT. In 1994, the EPA issued an exposure assessment based on some key assumptions in southern California: \u0081 100% unleaded gasoline contains 1/32 g of Mn per gallon of gasoline (about 14% of the gasoline in the Riverside area used MMT in 1990) \u0081 About 30% of the total MMT combusted is emitted from the tailpipe as manganese-containing particle matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 microns (PM2.5) \u0081 69% of the of Mn in larger particles, that is 4 microns (PM4), was derived from automotive sources. The exposure assessment concluded that 5e10% of the general population in Riverside might be exposed via inhalation to manganese annual average levels of approximately 0.1 mgm 3 PM4 or higher, indicating that possibly hundreds of thousands of persons in the Los Angeles area could experience such exposures at or greater than EPA\u2019s current inhalation health benchmark31 for manganese RfC of 0.05 mgm 3. Decisions on the safety of Mn additive usage are still under consideration in the United States. Manganese is essential for normal physiologic functioning in humans and animals. Unfortunately, Mn is also neurotoxic. Chronic inhalation exposure to high II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION concentrations of manganese in humans may result in CNS effects.", "The syndrome manganism may result from chronic exposure to higher levels, i.e. feelings of weakness and lethargy, tremors, a mask-like face, and psychological disturbances. Respiratory effects have also been noted in workers chronically exposed by inha \u20133 ) Concentration (mg m lation. Impotence and loss of libido have been noted in male workers af\ufb02icted with manganism.32 Chronic inhalation exposure of humans to manganese results primarily in effects on the nervous system. Slower visual reaction time, poorer hand steadiness, and impaired eye-hand coordination were reported in several studies of workers occupationally exposed to manganese dust in air. Other chronic effects reported in humans from inhalation exposure to manganese are respiratory effects such as an increased incidence of cough, bronchitis, dyspnea (dif\ufb01cult breathing) during exercise, and an increased susceptibility to infectious lung disease.33 The RfC for Mn is 0.05 mgm 3 based on impairment of neurobehavioral function in humans. The RfC is an estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure to Health numbersa 1000 100 10 1 LOAELc for neurological 0.1 effects (0.05 mg m\u20133) 0.01 0.001 0.0001 RfC (5 \u00d7 105 mg m\u20133) 0.00001 13.

(For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious noncancer effects during a lifetime. Although the RfC is not a direct estimator of risk, it serves as a reference point to gauge the potential effects. Thus, exposures increasingly greater than the RfC indicate a potential for adverse health effects increases (Figure 13.6). Studies in human populations indicate neurological damage from Mn exposure. The lowest observable adverse effect concentration (LOAEC) is 150 mgm 3, based on impairment of neurobehavioral function. Based on this LOAEC and other studies, the RfC for Mn is 0.05 mgm 3.34 Note that the LOAEC is likely higher than the no observable adverse concentration (NOAEC), since research could not show an Mn concentration threshold below which no neurotoxicity is observed. Thus, additional uncertainty factors had to be included in the RfC calculation (Chapter 7). Manganese is one of a few contaminants that can be eliminated before even being absorbed. This process is known as \u201cpresystemic elimination\u201d and can take place while the contaminant is being transferred from the Regulatory, advisory numbersb NIOSH IDLH (500 mg m\u20133) OSHA ceiling (5 mg m\u20133) NIOSH PEL (1 mg m\u20133) ACGIH TLV (0.2 mg m\u20133) II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 13.2 NEUROTOXIC METALS exposure site (e.g. the outer layer of the skin or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract). Manganese can be eliminated during uptake by the liver, even before it is absorbed into the bloodstream. Presystemic elimination, however, does not necessarily mean that an organism experiences no adverse effect. In fact, Mn exposure can damage the liver without ever being absorbed into the bloodstream. This is also one of the complications of biomarkers, since the body is protected against Mn toxicity by low rates of absorption or by the liver \u2019s presystemic Mn elimination.35 The inorganic forms include manganese chloride (MnCl2), manganese sulfate (MnSO4), manganese acetate [Mn(CH3COO)2 or C6H9MnO6$2H2O], manganese phosphate (MnPO4), manganese dioxide (MnO2), manganese tetroxide (Mn3O4), and manganese carbonate (MnCO3). Emphasis has been placed on the health effects of compounds containing inorganic manganese in the Mn(II), Mn(III), or Mn(IV) oxidation states, since these are the forms most often encountered in the environment and the workplace. There is evidence in animals and humans that adverse neurological effects can result from exposure to different manganese compounds; much of this information on toxicity differences between species of manganese is from reports and experiments of acute exposures to very high doses.", "Results from animal studies indicate that the solubility of inorganic manganese compounds can in\ufb02uence the bioavailability of manganese and subsequent delivery of manganese to critical toxicity targets such as the brain; however, the in\ufb02uence of manganese oxidation state on manganese toxicity is not currently well understood. Manganese in the form of permanganate produces toxic effects primarily through its oxidizing capacity. However, because of its tendency to oxidize organic material, the permanganate ion is not stable in the environment; thus, the probability of exposure to this species around waste sites is considered very low. As discussed in Chapter 3, the National Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) screens U.S. emission sources and locations of interest for further study in order to gain a better understanding of risks. The NATA neurological hazard index was dominated by metals, speci\ufb01cally the manganese compounds, with minor contributions by cyanide compounds, ethylene oxide, and mercury compounds. The neurological hazard index exceeded 1.0 for fewer than 350,000 people in the United States (Figure 13.7). 13.2.4 Other Neurotoxic Metals A number of other metals are suspected of being neurotoxic, especially cadmium (Cd) and the metalloid arsenic (As). The biological mechanisms of Cd neurotoxicity are not well understood. It may involve oxidative damage and interaction with other metals, e.g. cobalt and zinc. It may also involve the endocrine system, i.e. Cd\u2019s hormonal activity may induce estrogenic endogenous changes that affect neurotransmissions.40 As is the case for many pollutants, neurotoxic metals may also involve epigenetics and geneeenvironment interactions (Figure 13.8). II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 13. NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTANTS FIGURE 13.8 Potential mechanisms of cadmium (Cd) neurotoxicity. (1) Cd-induced neuron cell apoptosis and formation of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) are mediated through Ca2\u00fe-mitochondria signaling and Ca2\u00fe-membrane channels. (2) Cd impaired neurogenesis. (3) Cd accumulation in the brain, which in turn alters gene expression and epigenetic effect. (4) Cd has estrogenic or anti-androgenic effect, which can disrupt hypothalamicepituitaryegonadal (HPG) axis. These potential mechanisms have possible, simultaneous interactions. The solid black arrows represent the stimulation, the solid black line segments indicate the inhibition, and the dotted lines represent the negative feedback control of the HPG axis. Ref. 40. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Normally in adults, Cd seldom crosses the bloode brain barrier. Actually, Cd exposure may not necessarily follow the inhalation-adsorption model discussed in previous chapters, but can completely bypass the bloodebrain route and follow a nasal exposure route. As such, Cd can move along the primary olfactory neurons to their terminations in the olfactory bulbs. The olfactory route is a plausible means of Cd reaching the brain. In addition, Cd has been shown to damage olfactory sensation.40 Upon entry into neurons, Cd induces a decrease in the activity of glutathione peroxidase catalase and super oxide dismutase, producing an increase in free radicals. This free radicals increase lipid peroxidation, which disrupts both cellular and mitochondrial membranes. This increases apoptosis and induces genetic damage. The net effect is a combination of these impacts and the extent to which metallothionein is activated, which scavenges free radicals and chelates Cd.41 The degradation of membrane potentials stimulates the release of a cytochrome enzyme. Thus Cd neurotoxicity follows a path similar to other oxidative stress models.42 Other metals are listed in Table 13.1. In addition to the Pb, Cd, and methylmercury, the speci\ufb01c compounds that are potentially neurotoxic include aluminum (Al) and tin (Sn). The speci\ufb01c compounds are aluminum chloride (AlCl3), aluminum lactate (C9H18AlO9), tributyltin chloride (C12H27ClSn), and triethyltin [(C2H5)3Sn]. Arsenic is also listed. Arsenic (As) is a metalloid that behaves in many ways like metals in the environment and within organisms, so in air pollution realms it is often grouped with metals. 13.3 NEUROTOXIC ORGANIC COMPOUNDS In addition to the organometallic compounds mentioned in the previous section (e.g. alkylated Pb, Hg, Mn, Al, and Sn compounds), numerous other organic compounds are known to affect mammalian nervous systems. Most of the chemicals listed in Table 13.1 are indeed organic compounds, having carbon-tocarbon and carbon-to-hydrogen bonds. 13.4 NEUROTOXIC PARTICULATES Both conventional air pollutants and air toxics may have neurotoxic effects. The pathways of the chemicals sorbed to particles will be those discussed in this chapter. However, the pathways are complicated by the characteristics of particles. An ongoing area of investigation is which aspect of PM contributes to toxicity, including neurotoxicity.", "Indeed, if the PM constituents include the inherently toxic substances mentioned throughout this chapter, e.g. Pb, Hg, benzene, PAHs, PCBs, and dioxins, in which case the particulates simply serve as a delivery vehicle. However, the morphology and size must also play a role beyond toxicant delivery, e.g. contributing to endogenous changes to endocrine and immune signaling, which induce neurological responses. Diesel particles for example may follow an olfactory pathway similar to that described for Cd. The organochlorine, organophosphate, and other pesticides modes of action often involve AChE, which is an extremely important mechanism for neurotoxicity (Section 13.1.5 above). 13.5 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER EFFECTS This chapter has discussed speci\ufb01c neurotoxic effects. It should be noted that respiratory, reproductive, developmental, endocrine, and neurotoxic effects are seldom unique endpoints, but involve and interact with one another. It should also be noted that many of the human effects described in these chapters relate directly to other II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION mammals, as well as other vertebrates. They also apply to invertebrates to the extent that their endogenous systems resemble those of humans (e.g. neurological and hormonal impacts can follow similar pathways for lower organisms to those of humans). As such, they should be kept in mind when discussing ecosystem effects in the next chapter. QUESTIONS 1. How might an air pollutant exposure lead to myelinopathy? 2.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14 Air Pollution\u2019s Impact on Ecosystems 14.1 ECOSYSTEM RISK The term \u201csystem\u201d is included in \u201cecosystem\u201d. Thus, air pollution\u2019s impact on ecosystems must be considered in an integrated manner. The ecological risk assessment framework (Figure 14.1) is based mainly on characterizing exposure to a chemical, physical, or biological agent within the system, and the ecological effects resulting from this exposure. Both exposure and effects are considered during the problem formulation step.1 The fnal step of the risk assessment process is referred to as \u201ccharacterization\u201d to mean that \u201cboth quantitative and qualitative elements of risk analysis, and of the scientifc uncertainties in it, should be fully captured by the risk manager\u201d.2 In particular, the process allows for an Stakeholder participationRisk management Integrated risk assessment Problem formulation with hazard identification Analysis Characterization Characterization Exposure of of assessment exposure effects Risk characterization FIGURE 14.1 Framework for integrated human health and ecological risk assessment. World Health Organization and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; 1998. integration of research with risk assessment, which could underpin risk management decisions. The problem formulation step in the ecological framework has the advantage of providing an analytic-deliberative process early on. That is, it combines sound science with input from various stakeholders inside and outside of the scientifc community. The ecological risk framework calls for the characterization of ecological effects instead of hazard identifcation used in human health risk assessments (see Chapter 7). This is because the term \u201chazard\u201d has been used in chemical risk assessments to connote either intrinsic effects of a stressor or a margin of safety by comparing a health effect with an estimate of exposure concentration. 14.2 ECOSYSTEM SUSCEPTIBILITY TO AIR POLLUTION The earth includes a wide belt of ecosystems, including rain forests, temperate and arboreal forests, grasslands, coral reefs, riverine and lacustrine systems, and wetlands,a of magnifcent diversity and productivity (Table 14.1). Ecosystems can be harmed by numerous human activities that introduce stressors to the environment. As is the case for human health risk assessments, the stressors may be chemicals, but physical and biological stressors also exist. For example, the placement of a roadway or the changes brought about by bulldozers and earthmovers are considered to be physical stressors to habitats, e.g. by bifurcation and changes to buffer zones. The accidental or intentional introduction of invasive biota, e.g. grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella, (fauna) and kudzu, Pueraria lobata, (fora), in the southern United States are examples of biological stressors. Indeed, physical and biological stressors may arise as a result of chemical air pollutants, a Microbial ecologists would add those very small ecosystems that can be less than a few square centimeters.

AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS TABLE 14.1 Species Abundance by Ecosystem Type Tropical rain forests contain more species than any other ecosystem, as well as a higher proportion of species unique to a particular ecosystem (endemic).

Biodiversity Synthesis; 2005. such as shifting and shrinking habitats from climate change exacerbated by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases or changes in ecosystem structure due to differential effects on certain species exposed to an air pollutant. The identifcation of possible adverse outcomes is crucial. These outcomes alter essential structures or functions of an ecosystem. The severity of outcomes is characterized asto their type, intensity, and scale of the effect and the likelihood of an ecosystem to recover from the damage imposed by a single stressor or multiple stressors. The characterization of adverse ecological outcomes can range from qualitative, expert judgments to statistical probabilities, to quantitative feld measurements. The emergent felds of ecotoxicology and ecorisk have several things in common with human toxicology and risk assessment, such as concern about ambient concentration of contaminants and their uptake by biota in water, air, sediment, and soil. In some ways, however, ecological doseeresponse and exposure research differ from that in human systems. First, ecologists deal with many different species, some more sensitive than others to the effects of contaminants.", "Second, the means of calculating exposure are different, especially if one is concerned about the exposure of an entire ecosystem rather than the effects on one or a few biological species. Ecosystems are complex. Ecologists characterize them by evaluating their composition, structure, and functions. Ecosystem composition is a listing, a taxonomy if you will, of every living and nonliving part of the ecosystem. Ecological structure, as the term implies, is the manner in which all parts of the system are linked to form physical patterns of life forms from single forest stands to biological associations and plant communities. A single wetland or prairie, for example, is a much simpler structure than a multilayered forest, which consists of plant and microbial life in the detritus, herbs, saplings, newer trees, and canopy trees. Ecosystem functions include cycles of nitrogen, carbon, phosphorous, that lead to biotic processes such as production, consumption, and decomposition (see Part IV). Indicators of an ecosystem\u2019s condition include the diversity of organisms living in the ecosystem. Another factor is the effciency by which biota produce and store energy. Even for a healthy system, how sustainable is the condition given the stresses now and in the future? Diversity is usually referred to as \u201cbiodiversity\u201d, which is the: \u201c. composition, structure, and function (that) determine, and in fact constitute, the biodiversity of an area. Composition has to do with the identity and variety of elements in a collection, and includes species lists and measures of species diversity and genetic diversity. Structure is the physical organization or pattern of a system, from habitat complexity as measured within communities to the pattern of patches and other elements at a landscape scale. Function involves ecological and evolutionary processes, including gene fow, disturbances, and nutrient cycling\u201d.4 II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14.3 AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS ON AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS The diversity of a community in an aquatic or wetland ecosystem can be found using the Shannone Weiner index: m D\u00bc Pilog P (14.1) X i i\u00bc1 2 or m D\u00bc 1:44 \u00f0n =N\u00deln\u00f0n=N\u00de (14.2) X ii i\u00bc1 where, D\u00bc index of community diversity; Pi\u00bc ni/N; ni\u00bc number (i.e. density) of the ith genera or species; N\u00bc total number (i.e. density) of all organisms in the sample;i\u00bc 1, 2. m;and m\u00bc number of genera or species. The larger the value of D, or community diversity, the greater is the stability of the ecosystem (see Example Box: Estimating Diversity of an Ecosystem). Productivity is an expression of how economical a system is with its energy. How much biomass is produced from abiotic (e.g. nutrients and minerals) and biotic resources (from microbial populations to canopy plant species to top predator fauna)? One common measure is \u201cnet primary productivity\u201d,b which is the difference between two energy rates: P1 \u00bc kp ke (14.3) where P1 \u00bc net primary productivity; kp \u00bc rate of chemical energy storage by primary producers; and ke \u00bc rate at which the producers use energy (via respiration). Sustainability describes the likelihood that the diversity and productivity will last. Even though an ecosystem appears to be diverse and highly productive, is there something looming that threatens the continuation of these conditions? For example, is an essential nutrient being leached out of the soil, or are atmospheric conditions changing that may threaten a key species of animal, plant, or microbe? Sustainability is diffcult to quantify and even more diffcult to predict precisely. Ecological risk assessments may be prospective or retrospective, but often are both. The Florida Everglades provides an example of an integrated risk approach. The population of panthers, a top terrestrial carnivore in southern Florida, was found to contain elevated concentrations of mercury (Hg) in the 1990s. This was observed through retrospective ecoepidemiological studies. The fndings were also used as scientists recommended possible measures to reduce Hg concentrations in sediment and water in Florida. Prospective risk assessments can help to estimate expected declines in Hg concentrations in panthers and other organisms in the food chain from a mass balance perspective. That is, with decreasing Hg mass entering the environment through the air, water, and soil, how has the risk to sensitive species concomitantly been reduced? Integrated retrospective prospective risk assessments are employed where ecosystems have a history of previous impacts and have the potential for future effects from a wide range of stressors. This, for example, may be the case for ecosystems around and near hazardous waste sites. 14.3 AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS ON AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS Various air pollutants induce a range of effects on aquatic ecosystems.", "Sulfur and nitrogen compounds can lead to acidifcation of surface waters via numerous mechanisms, such as hydrolysis, which cause gas-phase and particulate-phase pollutants to react in the atmosphere followed by deposition onto water surfaces and/or actual particulate phase pollutants that precipitate into water and thereafter react. Airborne nitrogen and phosphorus species can also enrich surface waters, which changes pH, dissolved oxygen, and other characteristics, which in turn change the species abundance and diversity. Although tropospheric ozone has very little effect in the water chemistry directly, it may change the biodiversity by stressing riparian and partially submerged plants or harming air-breathing animals. Stress on aquatic ecosystems occurs at all spatial scales. Large and vulnerable systems can indicate the impact of pollutant loading on ecosystem condition. This is particularly true for coral reef systems. 14.3.1 Coral Reefs Coral reefs are incredibly diverse and productive (Table 14.2). These so-called \u201crain forests of the ocean\u201d cover a mere fraction of the ocean foor but are home to millions of organisms from thousands of species. They are threatened by natural and human events, e.g. warm ocean temperatures and high sea levels overfshing and development, but also by air pollution. For example, the corals off the coast of Florida, the world\u2019s third largest barrier reef, have been highly stressed, with half of the live coral off the Florida coast lost in recent years. An additional indication is that fsh feeding on these corals are developing deformities and experience premature mortality.6 The addition of nitrogen species from the atmosphere contributes to these problems, since they serve as nutrients for aquatic microbes, respiration by which changes the oxygen content and b Also known as \u201cnet primary production\u201d. Either is abbreviated as NPP. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14. AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS EXAMPLE BOX: ESTIMATING DIVERSITY OF AN ECOSYSTEM5 An environmental assessment of microbes in a small stream near an industrial plant found a total of 1510 organisms, represented by seven different species. The actual number count of each microbial species in stream community was 10, 50, 75, 125, 200, 350, and 750 ml 1. SolutionandDiscussion: Construct a table to derive the values needed to fnd D, using Eqn (14.1): m D \u00bc 1:44 \u00f0ni =N\u00deln\u00f0ni =N\u00de: i\u00bc1 X i ni ni/N L1.44 ln(ni/N) L1.44(ni/N) ln(ni/N) 1 10 0.006623 7.224883 0.047847 2 50 0.033113 4.907292 0.162493 3 75 0.049669 4.323423 0.21474 4 125 0.082781 3.587834 0.297006 5 200 0.13245 2.911028 0.385567 6 350 0.231788 2.105182 0.487956 7 700 0.463576 1.10705 0.513202 S 1510 1 2.10881 Thus, the diversity index is approximately 2.1. The index is most useful when comparing systems. So, if the stream is 2.1 and surrounding streams are all around 4, there may be a problem. For example, further investigation is needed if these are biological indicators of the health of the stream and the facility is emitting pollutants that are known to stress ecosystems. Generally, D values range from about 1.5 to 4.5. New pollution control equipment is installed and measurements are taken a year later with the following results, from which another index is calculated. Construct a new table with four times each species: i ni ni/N L1.44 ln(ni/N) L1.44(ni/N) ln(ni/N) 1 40 0.006623 7.224883 0.047847 2 200 0.033113 4.907292 0.162493 3 300 0.049669 4.323423 0.21474 4 500 0.082781 3.587834 0.297006 5 800 0.13245 2.911028 0.385567 6 1400 0.231788 2.105182 0.487956 7 2800 0.463576 1.10705 0.513202 S 6040 1 2.10881 Even though the species abundance quadrupled, the index remains 2.1. The index indicates, correctly, that the total species abundance does not affect diversity. Some new sources are located near the ecosystem, so a followup study is conducted 5 years later, which indicates the species density has changed to 3000, 50, 35, 40, 30, 70, and 15 l 1 of the same species of microbes as the early study. How had the numbers and diversity changed in 5 years? Again, calculate D by constructing a new table: L1.44 L1.44(ni/N) i ni ni/N ln(ni/N) ln(ni/N) 1 3000 0.92593 0.11082 0.10261 2 50 0.01543 6.00668 0.0927 3 35 0.0108 6.52029 0.07044 4 40 0.01235 6.32801 0.07812 5 30 0.00926 6.74227 0.06243 6 70 0.0216 5.52216 0.11931 7 15 0.00463 7.7404 0.03584 S 3240 1 0.56144 After 5 years, the actual number of microbes is more than doubling, but the diversity has been drastically reduced (D \u00bc 0.6 vs 2.1).", "This may indicate that conditions favorable to one species, e.g. the presence of a toxic chemical or a change in habitat (e.g. a road), are detrimental to the other six species. A follow-up question must be asked. Were the measurements conducted in the same season (some microbes grow better in warmer conditions, while others may compete more effectively in cooler waters)? If the studies are comparable, further investigation is needed, but this certainly is an indication that things are amiss, since Shannon values usually range from about 1.5 to 4.5. Diversity, like productivity, is often an important indicator of change. If diversity as measured by the index shows a decline, it may well indicate than an ecosystem is under increasing stress. II.

Environmental microbiology. 2nd ed. Burlington (Massachusetts): Elsevier Academic Press; 2009. pH of waters. These and other physicochemical changes contribute to coral reef destruction. Disastrous coral reef losses are occurring from physical, chemical, and biological sources. The U.S. Coral Reef Task Force recently identifed what it considers to be the most prominent threats that federal agencies and states must address to protect coral reefs in the United States7: 1. Pollution, including eutrophication and sedimentation from poor or overly intensive land use, chemical loading, oil and chemical spills, marine debris and invasive alien species. 2. Overfshing and exploitation of coral reef species for recreational and commercial purposes, and the collateral damage and degradation to habitats and ecosystems from fshing activities. 3. Habitat destruction and harmful fshing practices, including those fshing techniques that have negative impacts on coral reefs and associated habitats. This can include legal techniques such as traps and trawls used inappropriately, as well as illegal activities such as cyanide and dynamite fshing. 4. Dredging and shoreline modifcation in connection with coastal navigation or development. 5. Vessel groundings and anchoring that directly destroy corals and reef framework. 6. Disease outbreaks that are increasing in frequency and geographic range are affecting a greater diversity of coral reef species. 7. Global climate change and associated impacts including reduced rates of coral calcifcation, increased coral bleaching and mortality (associated with variety of stresses including increased sea surface temperatures), increased storm frequency, and sea level rise. Air pollutant transport and impacts on coral reefs include biological agents. Microbes appear to be transported long distances in winds aloft. For example, some of the invasive bacteria that threaten coral reef habitats may be coming from Africa in the form of Saharan dust. Deserts commonly contain gravel and bedrock, along with some sand. The Sahara is the exception, with sand covering 20% of the spatial extent of the desert. This means that the Sahara often loses large amounts of dust by winds that advectively transport particles in plumes that can travel across the Atlantic Ocean, depositing dust along the way (Figure 14.2). Saharan dust carries disease-causing bacteria and fungi that have been associated with the destruction of coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea. Scientists are investigating these phenomena to evaluateany linkages to the threatsand possible interventions. For example, invasive species can include numerous organisms, butrecently algaeandbacteria havebeenhighlighted as a muchlarger concern than had previously been thought. Some of these bacteria are likely arriving in the coral reef ecosystems by long-range, atmospheric transport. Physical threats include ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which have increased in the 20th century with the depletion of stratospheric ozone, i.e. an indirect effect of air pollution (Chapter 11). UV radiation can also increase locally when protective screens of organisms die off. UV radiation, therefore, is a ubiquitous stressor that is very likely impacting on human and ecological systems on a global scale. It has been implicated in observed shifts in polar plankton community composition, local and global declines in amphibian population abundance and diversity, coral bleaching syndrome, not to mention an increasing incidence of human skin cancer and other diseases.", "Disruption and loss of coral reef ecosystem communities due to coral bleaching/disease lead to coral mortality, changes in reef persistence, and formation dynamics, aswell ascascading reef communityinteractions.8 Chemical contamination threatens both the integrity of coral reefs and the organisms need them for habitats. For example, several endocrine disrupting compounds discussed in Chapter 12 have found their way to the ocean. These compounds impair the reproduction and development of marine organisms by the same or similar II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14. AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS FIGURE 14.2 February 9, 2007, deposition of sediment \ufb02owing into Princess Charlotte Bay on the east coast of Queensland\u2019s Cape York Peninsula in Australia. The plumes merge into a 12-km-wide river of sediment-laden water, moving northwardly and washing over the coral reef. The sediment makes the normally turquoise-colored reef look greenish-brown. The sediment integrates contaminants from various upstream sources, including atmospheric deposition onto watersheds. The plume veers northeastwardly from the inner reef and eventually reaches the outer reef. (For color version of this fgure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) National Aeronautics and Space Administration. MODIS Rapid Response Team, Goddard Space Flight Center; 2007. modes of actions as those for endocrine disruption in humans. Thus, living aquatic organisms in coral reef habitats could well be negatively impacted by interfering with the reproduction mechanisms in aquatic organisms. Itis certainly likelythat myriad organicand metallic compounds are transported and deposited into the ocean as air pollutants. The more volatile compounds are transported in the gas phase, and the semivolatile and nonvolatile organic compounds and metals sorbed to aerosols can be transported great distances in the atmosphere. Contaminants may even reach reefs by leapfrogging from one medium to another, e.g. soil to air to water to air to biota, etc. For example, streams deposit their loads into reef systems (Figure 14.2). The streams themselves may receive loadings from nonpoint sources on land that had previously experienced atmospheric deposition. These loads contain contaminants from upstream sources, both natural (e.g. nutrients) and human activities (e.g. metallic and organic compounds from industrial and municipal facilities). 14.4 AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS ON TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS As in aquatic ecosystems, those on land vary in vulnerability to air pollution. The effects on mammalian fauna are similar to those of humans. However, a terrestrial ecosystem consists of many more species. Various species of fora, fauna, and microbes respond differently to air pollutant exposure. In addition, ecosystems include abiotic components, e.g. soil, changes to which must also be considered as to their response to air pollution. 14.4.1 Effects on Flora The effects of air pollution on plants range from subtle to catastrophic, as shown in Figure 14.3. Historically, these effects have been classifed as visible symptoms Examples Chlorosis Flecking reduced crop yield Altered photosynthesis Suppression of transpiration Reduced enzyme level So2 serves as source of S for plant II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14.4 AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS ON TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS and nonvisual or subtle effects.9 Visible symptoms are deviations from the normal healthy appearance of the leaves. For broadleaf plants, a healthy leaf has good color, with a normal cell structure in the various layers. Deviations from this healthy appearance include tissue collapse and various degrees of loss of color. Extensive tissue collapse or necrosis results from injury to the spongy or palisade cells in the interior of the leaf. The leaf becomes severely discolored and loses structural integrity. Dead tissue may fall out of the leaf, leaving holes in the structure. Less dramatic discolorations are caused by a decrease in the number of chloroplasts, a symptom referred to as chlorosis. Injury to the outer or epidermal layer is referred to as glazing or silvering of the leaf surface. When the pattern is spotty, the terms fecking and stippling are used to describe the injury. Other forms of visible injury are related to various physiological alterations. Air pollution injury can cause early senescence or leaf drop. Stems and leaf structure may be elongated or misshapen. Ornamentals and fruit trees can also show visible injury to the blooms of the fruit, which can result in decreased yield. The nonvisual or subtle effects of air pollutants involve reduced plant growth and alteration of physiological and biochemical processes, as well as changes in the reproductive cycle. Reduction in crop yield can occur without the presence of visible symptoms. This type of injury is often related to low-level, long-term chronic exposure to air pollution.", "Studies have shown that feld plantings exposed to fltered and unfltered ambient air have produced different yields when no visible symptoms were present.10 Decreases in total biomass can lead to economic loss for forage crops or hay. Physiological or biochemical changes have been observed in plants exposed to air pollutants, including alterations in net rates of photosynthesis, stomata response, and metabolic activity. Such exposure studies have been conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. An understanding of the processes involved will help to identify the cause of reduction in yield. Laboratory studies have also investigated the interaction of air pollutants and the reproductive cycle of certain plants. Subtle changes in reproduction in a few susceptible species can render them unable to survive and prosper in a given ecosystem. The major air pollutants which are phytotoxic to plants are ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, fuorides, and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN).11 Table 14.3 lists some of the types of plants injury resulting from exposure to these pollutants. The effects range from slight reduction in yield to extensive visible injury, depending on the level and duration of exposure. Examples of the distinction between air pollution injury and damage are also given in Table 14.3. Visible markings on plants or crops such as lettuce, tobacco, and orchids caused by air pollution translate into direct economic loss (i.e. damage). In contrast, visible markings on the leaves of grapes, potatoes, or corn caused by air pollution will not result in a determination of damage if there is no loss in yield. Individual circumstances determine whether air pollution damage has occurred. The costs of air pollution damage are diffcult to estimate. However, estimates indicate crop losses are estimated to be billions of dollars in the United States alone.12 When compared to the crop losses due to all causes, the air pollution loss percentages are small. Ozone (O3) is particularly damaging to fora, i.e. it is phytotoxic. It is well known that if O3 or its reaction products reach the target tissues in the plant cell, the cell will die. Recent studies have provided an increased understanding of how O3 interacts with the plant at the cellular level. Coupled with cost estimates, these types of studies give some indication of the crop loss and the costs associated with air pollutants. For example, although air quality has improved in most urban areas, it has not done so in numerous rural areas where most crops are grown. Ground-level O3 exposures can impose huge fnancial and food supply costs. Sensitivity to ozone varies across species, with over 65 plant species. Many crop species exposed to O3 even at concentrations slightly lower than the U.S. standard experience decreased growth, lower biomass production, and thus, lower yields. Other effects include foliar injury, reduced plant vigor, increased susceptibility to environmental conditions (e.g. harsh weather, drought, and winds), diminished insect pest infestation, and reduced ability to compete with weed species. 14.4.1.1 Forests Forests are particularly vulnerable to air pollution. The risks are either direct or indirect. Direct damage to forests comes from damage to foliage and root systems as a result of chemical changes induced by air pollutants, e.g. acidic deposition onto trees and the soils from which the roots extract nutrients. This stresses the plant and damages its metabolic processes. Indirect damage can come about by changes in humidity and temperature regimes, brought on by emissions of greenhouse gases that lead to climate change. Actually, direct and indirect ecosystem risks often combine to exacerbate risks, such as when organisms that are already stressed from direct pollutant exposure (e.g. sulfur dioxide, SO2) are further stressed by changes in humidity and temperature. Forests, particularly rain forests, are the oxygen factories of the earth. Tropical forests have particularly extensive species abundance. Other rain forests include seasonally moist forests, where rainfall is abundant for II.

These are more open woodlands, yet they two are highly productive. Tropical rain forests are the most threatened of all the forests due to human activities, e.g. clearing trees for agricultural products, harvesting whole trees for timber and urbanization, and roads that traverse habitats. These not only supplant habitats, but they truncate migration, foraging, predation, and breeding, i.e. the problem is greater than the areal extent of habitats displaced. The changes interrupt ecosystem dynamics and species activities, such as predatoreprey relationships (Figure 14.4). Ambient concentrations of air pollutants are not usually thought of as major contributors to rain forest destruction compared to physical destruction. However, acid rain, biome shifts due to global climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion can substantially stress trees and other vegetation. Rain forests lose species to extinction at an alarming rate. Scientists estimate that about half of the world\u2019s species exist in rain forests, even though they cover but 7% of the earth\u2019s land surface. Rain forest species are particularly vulnerable because they adapted to microhabitats that only exist in the unique conditions under ambient moisture and temperature regimes. Other species are lost to habitat destruction and deforestation. Ecosystems\u2019 edges are particularly important to species survival. When they change due to climatic and anthropogenic stresses, canopy species (larger trees) can no longer survive. This leads to more destruction further within the ecosystem, with rapid decreases in species abundance and biodiversity.3 Rain forest destruction is indeed a societal problem. Local cultures have depended on the bounty for centuries. In fact, many of the primitive practices have been highly destructive, notably slash and burn. Farmers have completely deforested areas and other vegetation to make arable land. However, the remaining layer of ash is an indication that many of the soil nutrients have chemically altered and leached from the soil. This exacerbates erosion rates. In a short time, the crops are no longer productive. This is often worsened when the cropped feld is converted to pasture, with resulting soil compaction and overgrazing. In addition to the localized effects, deforestation increases the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Soil and plants in tropical forests sequester 4.6 109 5.8 109 metric tonnes of carbon worldwide with each square kilometer of tropical forest holding 45,000 tonnes of carbon. From 1850 to 1990, deforestation released 122 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.", "Currently, the deforestation carbon emission rate is 1.6 billion tonnes per year. 13 A secondary air pollution impact of such deforestation is the increased emissions of fugitive dust. This is (A) (B) FIGURE 14.4 Decrease in extent and abundance of rain forests in Rwanda, Africa, from 1986 (photo (A)) and 2001 (photo (B)).

About 99% of the rain forest vegetation was lost during this 15-year period. (For color version of this fgure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.)

In addition, since the damage to humans from particulate matter is well documented, similar problems are likely to occur in other air-breathing animals. Thus, wildlife populations would be expected to be weakened, which II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14. AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS may show up in reduced species abundance, decreased diversity and changes to predatoreprey relationships (e.g. loss of food species for top predators and reduced populations of animal species). Rain forests, in particular, are being destroyed by varied and complex factors, so stopping the destruction is equally complicated. Without aggressive interventions, the disaster will only worsen. The damage can be acute or chronic, i.e. changes in a single season or changes in the entire ecosystem. Plant injury from O3 exposure is widespread. In the United States, trees in forests, at least those that are sources of timber, are considered to be \u201ccrops\u201d. The U.S. Forest Service is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Forests across the country have experienced O3 injury (Figure 14.5). 1010 Approximately 1.95 km2 of the earth\u2019s surface has at least 20% or more crown tree cover, representing about one-third of the total land area.14 The crown cover is the canopy cover plus the amount of skylight obstructed by tree canopies. Several different types of forest ecosystems can be defned based on their location and the species present. The largest in area are tropical forest systems, followed by temperate forests, rain forests, and tidal zone systems. The temperate forest systems are located in the latitudes where the greatest industrialization is occurring and have the most opportunity to interact with pollutants in the atmosphere. The impact of air pollution on forest ecosystems ranges from benefcial to detrimental. The relationship of air pollutants with forests can be classifed into three categories15: low dose (I), intermediate dose (II), and high dose (III). With this classifcation scheme, seemingly contradictory statements on the impact of air pollution on forests can be understood. 14.4.1.1.1 LOW-DOSE LEVELS Under low-dose conditions, forest ecosystems act as sinks for atmospheric pollutants and in some instances as sources. The atmosphere, lithosphere, and oceans are involved in large-scale cycling carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and other elements through each subsystem with different timescales. Under low-dose conditions, forest and other biomass systems have been utilizing chemical compounds present in the atmosphere and releasing others to the atmosphere for thousands of years. Industrialization has increased the concentrations of NO2,SO2,and CO2 in the \u201cclean U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14.4 AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS ON TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS background\u201d atmosphere, and certain types of interactions with forest systems can be defned. Forests can act as sources of some of the trace gases in the atmosphere, such as hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfde, NOx,and NH3. Forests have been identifed as emitters of terpene hydrocarbons, which are a component of the photochemistry that leads to the formation of ozone. c In 1960, emissions of terpenes from forest systems are approximately 2 108 tonnes of reactive materials per year on a global basis.16 This is several times the anthropogenic input. Yet, it is important to remember that forest emissions are much more widely dispersed and less concentrated than anthropogenic emissions. Table 14.4 shows terpene emissions from different types of forest systems in the United States. Forest systems also act as sources of CO2 when controlled or uncontrolled burning and oxidation of organic compounds in detritus and litter occur. In addition, release of ethylene occurs during the fowering of various species.", "Thus, although trees are an important part of strategies to control global warming by storing (sequestering) carbon, especially in large root systems, they are also sources of CO2. One additional form of emission to the atmosphere is the release of pollen grains. Pollen is essential to the reproductive cycle of most forest systems but becomes a human health hazard for individuals susceptible to hay fever. The contribution of sulfur from forests in the form of dimethyl sulfde is considered to be about 10e25% of the total amount released by soils and vegetation.17 Trees and soils of forests act as sources of NH3 and oxides of nitrogen. Ammonia is formed in the soil by several types of bacteria and fungi. The volatilization of ammonia and its subsequent release to the atmosphere is dependent on temperature and the pH of the soil. Commercial fertilizers are used as a tool in forest management. The volatilization of applied fertilizers may become a source of ammonia to the atmosphere, especially from the use of urea. Nitrogen oxides are formed at various stages of the biological denitrifcation process. This process starts with nitrate; as the nitrate is reduced through various steps, NO2,NO, N2O, and N2 can be formed and, depending on the conditions, released to the atmosphere. The interactions of air pollutants with forests at low-dose concentrations result in imperceptible effects on the natural biological cycles of these species. In some instances, these interactions may be benefcial to the forest ecosystem. Forests, as well as other natural systems, act as sinks for the removal of trace gases from the atmosphere. 14.4.1.1.2 INTERMEDIATE-DOSE LEVELS The second level of interaction, the intermediate-dose level, can result in measurable effects on forest ecosystems. These effects consist of a reduction in forest growth, change in forest species, and susceptibility to forest pests. Both laboratory investigations and feld studies show SO2 to be an inhibitor of forest growth. When various saplings have been exposed to SO2 in the laboratory, they show reduction in growth compared with unexposed saplings.18 Various feld investigations of forest systems in the vicinity of large point sources show the effects of elevated SO2 levels on the trees closer to the source. For example, SO2 from the Sudbury, Ontario (Canada) smelter caused a reduction in forest growth over a very large area, with the proximate trees severely defoliated, damaged, and killed.19 The effect of photochemical oxidants, mainly O3 and PAN, on the forests located in the San Bernardino Mountains northeast of Los Angeles, California, has been to change the forest composition and to alter the susceptibility of forest species to pests. This area has been subjected to increasing levels of oxidant since the 1950s (Figure 14.6). During the late 1960s and early 1970s, changes in the composition and esthetic quality of the forest were observed.20 During this period, the photochemical problem was expanding to a wider geographical region; and photochemical oxidant was transported to the San Bernardino Mountains with increasing frequency and at higher concentrations. The receptor forest system has been described as a mixed conifer system containing ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, white fr, and cedar, along with deciduous black oak. The damage to the ponderosa pine ranged from no visible injury to death. As the trees came under increased stress due to exposure to oxidant, they became more susceptible to pine beetle, which ultimately caused their death. The ponderosa pine appears to be more susceptible than the other members of this forest system, and continued exposure to photochemical oxidant may very well shift it from the dominant species to a minor one. c This harkens back to the 1980s when President Reagan postulated that trees accounted for much pollution, which spawned the phrase, \u201ckiller trees\u201d. This led to some hilarious running gags and skits on the show, Saturday Night Live, where such a tree (played by the late John Belushi) would attempt entry into homes with obvious malicious intent. What made the skits so funny was, like most humor, they were based on some element of truth. For example, coniferous trees do emit large amounts of organic compounds to the troposphere, some of which are ozone precursors. II.

The interactions in the intermediate-dose category may result in effects on the reproduction cycle of species, the utilization of nutrients, the production of biomass, and the susceptibility to disease. 14.4.1.1.3 HIGH-DOSE LEVELS The third category for interactions is high dose (III). The effects produced by this level of interaction can be seen by the casual observer. The result of high-dose exposure is destruction or severe injury of the forest system. High-dose conditions are almost always associated with point source emissions. The pollutants most often involved are SO2 and hydrogen fuoride. Historically, the most harmful sources of pollution for surrounding forest ecosystems have been smelters and aluminum reduction plants. One example of high-dose interaction is the impact of a smelter on the surrounding area in Wawa, Ontario, II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14.4 AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS ON TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS Canada. This smelter began operating about 1940. Damage occurred in the prevailing downwind northeast sector for a distance of 60 km.21 They analyzed vegetative plots and established four zones of impact in the downwind direction: within 8 km of the plant, damage was classifed as \u201cvery severe\u201d where no trees or shrubs survived; \u201csevere damage\u201d occurred at w17 km, where no tree canopy existed; \u201cconsiderable damage\u201d existed at w25 km, where some tree canopy remained, but with high tree mortality; and \u201cmoderate damage\u201d was found at w35 km, where a tree canopy existed but was put under stress and where the number of ground fora species was still reduced. This type of severe air pollution damage has occurred several times in the past. If care is not taken, additional examples will be documented in the future. 14.4.1.2 Crops and Food Supply Food supply is a crucial part of civilization. Agriculture exists in various forms and takes advantage of numerous types of ecosystems that range from mono-cultures (e.g. large grain felds) to highly diverse systems from which crops of a few species are harvested (e.g. perennial polyculture forests). Air pollutants are a threat to any agricultural ecosystem (sometimes called \u201cagroecosystems\u201d), whether it has one dominant species or is highly biodiverse. 14.4.1.2.1 VEGETATIVE INJURY AND DAMAGE The U.S. Department of Agriculture makes a distinction between air pollution damage and air pollution injury. Injury is considered to be any observable alteration in the plant when exposed to air pollution. Damage is defned as an economic or esthetic loss due to interference with the intended use of a plant. This distinction indicates that injury by air pollution does not necessarily result in damage because any given injury may not FIGURE 14.6 Relationship between Los Angeles Basin\u2019s urban sources of photochemical smog and the San Bernardino Mountains, where ozone damage has occurred to the ponderosa pines.

Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania): Air Pollution Control Association; 1979. p. 433e50. prevent the plant from being used as intended, e.g. marketed. Thus, damage is a value-laden concept.", "Vegetation reacts with air pollution over a wide range of pollutant concentrations and environmental conditions. Many factors infuence the outcome, including plant species, age, nutrient balance, soil conditions, temperature, humidity, and sunlight.22 Any type of observable effect due to exposure can be termed plant injury. A schematic diagram in Figure 14.3 indicates the potential levels of injury with increasing exposure to air pollution. At low levels of exposure for a given species and pollutant, no signifcant effects may be observed. However, as the exposure level increases, a series of potential injuries may occur, including biochemical alterations, physiological response, visible symptoms, and eventual death. Air pollutants may enter plant systems by either a primary or a secondary pathway. The primary pathway is analogous to human inhalation described in Chapter 9. Figure 14.7 shows the cross section of a leaf, with both of the outer surfaces covered by a layer of epidermal cells, which help in moisture retention. Between the epidermal layers are the mesophyll cellsdthe spongy and palisade parenchyma. The leaf has a vascular bundle which carries water, minerals, and carbohydrates throughout the plant. Two important features shown in Figure 14.7 are the openings in the epidermal layers called stomata,which are controlled by guard cells which can open and close, and air spaces in the interior of the leaf. Similar to the selectivity of chemical exchanges by cells in the alveoli in the lung, the stomata selectively allow certain molecules to enter (e.g. nutrients). However, this same system also allows entry of xenobiotics and other air pollutants. The leaf structure has several important functions, three of which are photosynthesis, transpiration, and II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14. AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS FIGURE 14.7 Cross section of leaf Leaf hairs showing various components. Cutin Upper epidermis Palisade parenchyma Spongy parenchyma respiration.11 Photosynthesis is accomplished by chloroplasts in the leaf, which combine water and CO2 in the presence of sunlight to form sugars and release O2. A simplifcation of this process is: 6CO2 \u00fe 6H2O/C6H12O6 \u00fe 6O2 (14.4) Transpiration is the physical movement of water from the root system up to the leaves and its subsequent evaporation to the atmosphere. This process moves nutrients throughout the plant and cools the plant. Respiration is a heat-producing process resulting from the oxidation of carbohydrates by O2 to form CO2 and H2O: C6H12O6 \u00fe 6O2/6CO2 \u00fe 6H2O (14.5) These three functions involve the movement of O2, CO2, and H2O through the epidermal layers of the leaf. The analogy to human inhalation is obvious. With the diffusion of gases into and out of the leaf, pollutant gases have a direct pathway to the cellular system of the leaf structure. Direct deposition of particulate matter also occurs on the outer surfaces of the leaves. The indirect pathway by which air pollutants interact with plants is through the root system. Deposition of air pollutants on soils and surface waters can cause alteration ofthenutrientcontentofthesoilinthevicinityoftheplant. This change in soil condition can lead to indirect or secondary effects of air pollutants on vegetation and plants. Injury to plants and vegetation is caused by a variety of factors of which air pollution is only one. Drought, too much water, heat and cold, hail, insects, animals, disease, and poor soil conditions are some of the other causes of plant injury and possible plant damage.23 Estimates suggest that less than 5% of total crop losses are related to air pollution. Air pollution has a much greater Vascular bundle Air spaces Lower epidermis impact on some geographic areas and crops than others. Crop failure can be caused by fumigation from a local air pollution source or by more widespread and more frequent exposure to adverse levels of pollution. The subtle interaction of air pollutants with these other stressors to plants and vegetation is the subject of ongoing research. For some plant systems, exposure to air pollutants may induce biochemical modifcations which interfere with the water balance in plants, thereby reducing their ability to tolerate drought conditions. 14.4.1.2.2 VEGETATIVE IMPACTS FROM ACID DEPOSITION Acidic deposition refers to the transport of acid constituents from the atmosphere to the earth\u2019s surface. This process includes dry deposition of SO2,NO2, HNO3, and particulate sulfate matter and wet deposition (\u201cacid rain\u201d) to surfaces. This process is widespread and alters distribution of plant and aquatic species, soil composition, pH of water, and nutrient content, depending on the circumstances.", "The impact of acidic deposition on forests depends on the quantity of acidic components received by the forest system, the species present, and the soil composition (notably ionic strength and depth). Numerous studies have shown that widespread areas in the eastern portion of North America and parts of Europe are being altered by acidic deposition. Decreased pH in some lakes and streams in the affected areas was observed24 in the 1960s and the trend continued for decades. When a forest system is subjected to acidic deposition, the foliar canopy can initially provide some neutralizing capacity. If the quantity of acid components is too high, this limited neutralizing capacity is II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14.4 AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS ON TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS overcome. As the acid components reach the forest foor, the soil composition determines their impact. The soil composition may have suffcient buffering capacity to neutralize the acid components. However, alteration of soil pH can result in mobilization or leaching of important minerals in the soil. In some instances, trace metals such as calcium or magnesium may be removed from the soil, altering the aluminum tolerance for trees. This interaction between airborne acid components and the tree-soil system may alter the ability of the trees to tolerate other environmental stressors such as drought, insects, and other air pollutants like ozone. In Germany, considerable attention is focused on the role of ozone and acidic deposition as a cause of forest damage. Forest damage is a complex problem involving the interaction of exposures to acids and other air pollutants, forestry practices, and naturally occurring soil conditions. As in all ecosystems, forests must always be understood as complex, integrated systems with myriad interrelationships that can be affected by air pollutants. 14.4.2 Effects on Fauna Acidic deposition and the alteration of the pH of aquatic systems have led to the acidifcation of lakes and ponds in various locations in the world. Low-pH conditions result in lakes which contain no fsh species. Heavy metals on or in vegetation and water have been and continue to be toxic to animals and fsh. Arsenic and lead from smelters, molybdenum from steel plants, and mercury from chlorine-caustic plants are major offenders. Poisoning of aquatic life by mercury is relatively new, whereas the toxic effects of the other metals have been largely eliminated by proper control of industrial emissions. Gaseous (and particulate) fuorides have caused injury and damage to a wide variety of animalsddomestic and wilddas well as to fsh. Accidental effects resulting from insecticides and nerve gas have been reported. Autopsies of animals in the Meuse Valley, Donora, and London episodes described in Chapter 10, revealed evidence of pulmonary edema. Breathing toxic pollutants is not, however, the major form of pollutant intake for cattle; ingestion of pollution-contaminated feeds is the primary mode. Air pollution\u2019s impact on fauna follows a two-step process: accumulation of airborne contaminants on or in vegetation or forage that serves as their feed and subsequent effects of the ingested herbage on animals. In addition to pollution-affected vegetation, carnivores (humans included) consume small animals that may have ingested exotic chemicals including pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and antibiotics. As in humans, the principal route of exposure to air pollutants can be indirect. After deposition, the animal ingests the contaminant. This reminds us that not every exposure to air pollution is by inhalation. Increasing environmental concern has pointed out the importance of the complete food chain for the physical and mental wellbeing of human beings. 14.4.2.1 Effects of Metals and Metalloids The problems with metals in human populations discussed in previous chapters, especially Chapter 13, also affect other fauna. One of the earliest cattle problems involved widespread poisoning of cattle by arsenic at the turn of the century. Abnormal intake of arsenic results in severe colic (salivation, thirst, and vomiting), diarrhea, bloody feces, and a garlic-like odor on the breath; cirrhosis of the liver and spleen as well as reproductive effects may be noted. Arsenic trioxide in the feed 1 Cattle feeding on herbage containing 25e50 mg kg must be approximately 10 mg kg body weight for these effects to occur. ppm by weight lead (Pb) develop excitable jerking of muscles, frothing at the mouth, grinding of teeth, and paralysis of the larynx muscles; a \u201croaring\u201d noise is caused by the paralysis of the muscles in the throat and neck. Symptoms of molybdenum poisoning in cattle include emaciation, diarrhea, anemia, stiffness, and fading of hair color. Vegetation containing 230 mg kg 1 of this substance affects cattle.", "Mercury in fsh has been found in waters in the United States and Canada. Mercury in the waters is converted into methyl mercury by aquatic vegetation and other processes. Small fsh consume such vegetation and in turn are eaten by larger fsh and eventually by humans; food with more than 0.5 ppm of mercury (0.5 mg kg 1)cannot be sold in the United States for human consumption. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that pregnant women and women of childbearing age should not exceed consuming 14 ounces of fsh with 0.5 ppm mercury per week. Mercury has a very complicated chemistry. It forms numerous chemical species with very different properties and behaviors in the environment. Three major types of mercury are important in air pollution: elemental mercury [Hg(0)], which is the uncombined chemical element; divalent mercury [Hg(II)], which is chemically reactive and under most environmental conditions is found to be combined with other substances into mercury salts (e.g. HgCl2); and particulate-phase mercury [Hg(p)], most of which is actually the chemical species Hg(II) but is only slightly reactive because it is mixed with solid-phase material in the atmosphere. These three species have very different affnities for compartments and organisms (Figure 14.8). Thus, the mercury that is II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14. AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS released from a stack can have a tortuous journey to and through the food chain. 14.4.2.2 Gaseous and Particulate Effects Periodically, accidental emissions of a dangerous chemical affect animal well-being. During nerve gas experimentation in a desolate area in Utah, a high-speed airplane accidentally dropped several 100 gallons of nerve gas. As a result of the discharge, 6200 sheep were killed. Considering the large number of exotic chemicals being manufactured, such unfortunate accidents may be anticipated in the future. Fluoride emissions from industries producing phosphate fertilizers or phosphate derivatives have caused damage to cattle throughout the world; phosphate rock, the raw material, can contain up to 4% fuoride, part of which is discharged to air (and waters) during processing. In Polk and Hillsborough counties of Florida, the cattle population decreased by 30,000 between 1953 and 1960 as a result of fuoride emissions. Since 1950, research has greatly increased our knowledge of the effect of fuorides on animals; standards and guides for diagnosing and evaluating fuorosis in cattle have been compiled. Chronic fuoride toxicity (fuorosis) is the type most frequently observed in cattle. The primary effects of fuorides in cattle are seen in the teeth and bones. Excessive intake weakens the enamel of developing teeth; the initially dulled erupted teeth can develop into soft teeth, with uneven wearing of molar teeth. Characteristic osteofuorotic bone lesions develop, causing intermittent lameness and stiffness in the animal. Fluoride content of the bone increases with dosage despite excretion in urine and feces. Secondary symptoms include reduced lactation, nonpliable skin, and dry, rough hair coat. As shown in Figure 14.9,the fuoride ingestion level correlates with the fuoride content of bones and urine as well as incisor teeth classifcation.25 Tolerance of animals for fuorides varies, dairy cattle being the most sensitive and poultry the least (Table 14.5). Fluorosis of animals in contaminated areas can be avoided by keeping the intake levels below those listed by incorporating clean feeds with those high in fuorides. It has also been determined that increased consumption of aluminum and calcium salts can reduce the toxicity of fuorides in animals. In addition, high-dose exposures can completely alter an II.

For example, if the population of a species of animals or plants that is sensitive to an air pollutant falls dramatically, then the entire predatoreprey interactions can change. Thus, nonhuman species are indicators of environmental quality. ber of reasons. For example, we may be farther away from the object (e.g. an airplane can move away from us); the sun\u2019s angle may change with the time of day; and if air pollution increases, the contrast may decrease, reducing our ability to see the object. Objects close to us are easily perceived, but this diminishes as a function of distance. The lowest limit of contrast for human observers is called the threshold contrast and is important because this value infuences the maximum distance at which we can see various objects. Thus, it is closely related to our understanding of good versus bad visibility for a particular set of environmental conditions. Threshold contrast is illustrated in Figure 14.11. I is the intensity of light received by the eye from the object, and I \u00fe DI represents the intensity coming from the surroundings. The threshold contrast can be as low as 0.018e0.03 and the object can still be perceptible. Other factors, such as the physical size of the visual image on the retina of the eye and the brain\u2019s response to the color of the object, infuence the perception of contrast. Let us consider the infuence of gases and particles on the optical properties of the atmosphere. Reduction in visibility is caused by the following interactions in the atmosphere: light scattering by gaseous molecules and particles, and light absorption by gases and particles.27 Light-scattering processes involve the interaction of light with gases or particles in such a manner that the direction or frequency of the light is altered. Absorption processes occur when the electromagnetic radiation interacts with gases or particles and is transferred internally to the gas or particle. Light scattering by gaseous molecules is wavelength dependent and is the reason why the sky is blue. This process is dominant in atmospheres that are relatively free of aerosols or light-absorbing gases. Light scattering by particles is the most important cause of visibility reduction. This phenomenon is dependent on the size of the particles suspended in the atmosphere. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14.

The eye responds to an increment in light intensity by increasing the number of signals (pulses) sent to the brain. The detection of threshold contrast involves the ability to discriminate between the target (I) and the brighter background (I \u00fe DI). Gregory RL., Eye and brain: the psychology of seeing. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson; 1977. Light absorption by gases in the lower troposphere is limited to the absorption characteristics of nitrogen dioxide. This compound absorbs the shorter, or blue, wavelengths of visible light, causing us to observe the red wavelengths. We therefore perceive a yellow to reddish-brown tint in atmospheres containing quantities of NO2. Light absorption by particles is related principally to carbonaceous or black soot in the atmosphere. Other types of fne particles such as sulfates, although not good light absorbers, are very effcient at scattering light. 14.4.3.1.1 LIGHT EXTINCTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE The interaction of light in the atmosphere is described mathematically in Eqn (14.7): dI \u00bc bextI dx (14.6) where dI is the decrease in intensity, bext is the extinction coeffcient, I is the original intensity of the beam of light, and dx is the length of the path traveled by the beam of light. Figure 14.12(A) shows a beam of light transmitted through the atmosphere. The intensity of the beam I(x) decreases with the distance from the illumination source as the light is absorbed or scattered out of the beam.", "For a short period, this decrease is proportional to the intensity of the beam and the length of the interval at that point. Here bext is the extinction or attenuation coeffcient and is a function of the degree of scattering and absorption of the particles and gases which are present in the beam path. Figure 14.12(B) illustrates a slightly more complicated case, but one more is applicable to atmospheric visibility. In this example, the observer still depends on the ability to perceive light rays emanating from the target object and on the scattering and absorption of those rays out of the beam. In addition, however, the observer must contend with additional light scattered into the line of sight from other angles. This extraneous light is sometimes called air light. Equation (14.7) is modifed to account for this phenomenon by adding a term to represent this background intensity. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14.4 AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS ON TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS FIGURE 14.12 (A) A diagram of extinction of light from a source such as an electric light in a refector, illustrating (i) transmitted, (ii) scattered, and (iii) absorbed light. (B) A diagram of daylight visibility, illustrating (i) residual light from a target reaching an observer, (ii) light from a target scattered out of an observer\u2019s line of sight, (iii) air light from the intervening atmosphere, and (iv) air light constituting horizon sky. Ref. 26. dI \u00bc dI\u00f0extinction\u00de\u00fedI\u00f0air light\u00de (14.7) This air light term contributes to the reduced visibility we call atmospheric haze. A simplifed relationship developed by Koschmieder which relates the visual range and the extinction coeffcient is given by Lv \u00bc3:92=bext (14.8) where Lv is the distance at which a black object is just barely visible.28 Equation (14.9) is based on the following assumptions: 1. The background behind the target is uniform. 2. The object is black. 3. An observer can detect a contrast of 0.02. 4. The ratio of air light to extinction is constant over the path of sight. While the Koschmieder relationship is useful as a frst approximation for determining visual range, many situations exist in which the results are only qualitative. The extinction coeffcient bext is dependent on the presence of gases and molecules that scatter and absorb light in the atmosphere. The extinction coeffcient may be considered as the sum of the air and pollutant scattering and absorption interactions, as shown in the following equation: bext \u00bcbrg \u00febag (14.9) \u00febscat \u00febap where brg is scattering by gaseous molecules (Rayleigh scattering), bag is absorption by NO2 gas, bscat is scattering by particles, and bap is absorption by particles. These various extinction components are a function of wavelength. As extinction increases, visibility decreases. The Rayleigh scattering extinction coeffcient for particle-free air is 0.012 km 1 for \u201cgreen\u201d light (g \u00bc0.05 mm) at sea level.29 This permits a visual range of w320 km. The particle-free, or Rayleigh scattering, case represents the best visibility possible with the current atmosphere on earth. The absorption spectrum of NO2 shows signifcant absorption in the visible region (Figure 14.13).30 As a strong absorber in the blue region, NO2 can color plumes red, brown, or yellow. Figure 14.14 shows a comparison of extinction coeffcients of 0.1 ppm NO2 and Rayleigh scattering by air.31 In urban areas, some discoloration can be due to area-wide NO2 pollution. In rural areas, the biggest problem with NO2 is that in coherent plumes from power plants, it contributes to the discoloration of the plume. Suspended particles are the most important factor in visibility reduction. In most instances, the visual quality of air is controlled by particle scattering and is characterized by the extinction coeffcient bscat. The size of particles plays a crucial role in their interaction with light. Other factors are the refractive index and shape of the particles, although their effect is harder to measure and is less well understood. If we could establish these properties, we could calculate the amount of light scattering and absorption. Alternatively, the extinction coeffcient associated with an aerosol can be measured directly. Light and suspended particles interact in the four basic ways shown in Figure 14.15: refraction, diffraction, phase shift, and absorption. For particles with a diameter of 0.1e1.0 mm, scattering and absorption can be calculated by using the Mie equations.32 Figure 14.16 shows the relative scattering and absorption effciency Absorption coefficent, 11 cm mm 3 Hg 10 FIGURE 14.13 Absorption spectrum of NO2.

With particles of larger and smaller diameters, scattering decreases. Absorption generally contributes less to the extinction coeffcient than does the scattering processes. Atmospheric particles of different chemical FIGURE 14.14 Comparison of bext for 0.1 ppm NO2 and Rayleigh scattering by air.

Figure 14.17 shows the scattering-to-mass ratio for four different materials.34 Clearly, carbon or soot aerosols, and aerosols of the same diameter with water content, scatter with different effciencies at the same diameter. Visibility is also affected by alteration of particle size due to hydroscopic particle growth, which is a function of relative humidity. In Los Angeles, California, the air, principally of marine origin, has numerous sea salt particles. Visibility is noticeably reduced when humidity exceeds about 67%.

This effect is presumably due to numerous hygroscopic aerosols from air pollution sources. Some materials, such as sulfuric acid mist, exhibit hygroscopic growth at humidity as low as 30%. 14.4.3.1.2 TURBIDITY The attenuation of solar radiation has been studied by McCormick and his associates36,37 using the Voltz sun photometer, which makes measurements at a wavelength of 0.5 mm. The ratio of the incident solar transmissivity to the extraterrestrial solar intensity can be as high as 0.5 in clean atmospheres but can drop to 0.2e0.3 in polluted areas, indicating a decrease of 50% in ground-level solar intensity. The turbidity coeffcient can also be derived from these measurements and used to approximate the aerosol loading of the atmosphere. By assuming a particle size distribution in the size range 0.1e10.0 mm and a particle density, the total number of particles can be estimated. The mass loading per cubic meter can also be approximated. Because of the reasonable cost and simplicity of the sun photometer, it is useful for making comparative measurements around the world. 14.4.3.1.3 PRECIPITATION Pollution can cause opposite effects in relation to precipitation. Addition of a few particles that act as ice nuclei can cause ice particles to grow at the expense of supercooled water droplets, producing particles large enough to fall as precipitation. An example of this is commercial cloud seeding with silver iodide particles released from aircraft to induce rain. If too many particles are added, none of them grow suffciently to cause precipitation. Therefore, the effects of pollution on precipitation are complex. 14.4.3.2 Formation of Atmospheric Haze Atmospheric haze is the condition of reduced visibility caused by the presence of fne particles or NO2 in the atmosphere. The particles must be 0.1e1.0 mmin diameter, the size range in which light scattering occurs. The source of these particles may be natural or anthropogenic.", "Atmospheric haze has been observed in both the western and eastern portions of the United States. Typical visual ranges in the East are <15 mi and in the Southwest >50 mi. The desire to protect visual air quality in the United States is focused on the national parks in the West. The ability to see vistas over. Fifty to hundred kilometers in these locations are particularly vulnerable to atmospheric haze. This phenomenon is generally associated with diffuse or widespread atmospheric degradation as opposed to individual plumes. The major component of atmospheric haze is sulfate particulate matter (particularly ammonium sulfate), along with varying amounts of nitrate particulate matter, which in some areas can equal the sulfate. Other components include graphitic material, fne fy ash, and organic aerosols. The sources of particulate matter in the atmosphere can be primary, directly injected into the atmosphere, or secondary, formed in the atmosphere by gas-toparticle conversion processes.38 The primary sources of fne particles are combustion processes, e.g. power plants and diesel engines. Power plants with advanced control technology still emit substantial numbers and masses of fne particles with diameters <1.0 mm. The composition of these particles includes soot or carbonaceous material, trace metals, V2O5, and sulfates. In addition, large quantities of NO2 and SO2 are released to the atmosphere. 14.4.3.2.1 PARTICLE FORMATION IN THE ATMOSPHERE The secondary source of fne particles in the atmosphere is gas-to-particle conversion processes, considered to be the more important source of particles contributing to atmospheric haze. In gas-to-particle conversion, gaseous molecules become transformed to liquid or solid particles. This phase transformation can occur by three processes: absorption, nucleation, and condensation. Absorption is the process by which a gas goes into solution in a liquid phase. Absorption of a specifc gas is dependent on the solubility of the gas in a particular liquid, e.g. SO2 in liquid H2O droplets. Nucleation and condensation are terms associated with aerosol dynamics. Nucleation is the growth of clusters of molecules that become a thermodynamically stable nucleus. This process is dependent on the vapor pressure of the condensable species. The molecular clusters undergo growth when the saturation ratio, S, is greater than 1, where saturation ratio is defned as the actual pressure of the gas divided by its equilibrium vapor pressure. S > 1is referred to as a supersaturated condition.39 The size at which a cluster may be thermodynamically stable is infuenced by the Kelvin effect. The equilibrium vapor pressure of a component increases as the droplet size decreases. Vapor pressure is determined by the energy necessary to separate a single molecule from the surrounding molecules in the liquid. As the curvature of the droplet\u2019s surface increases, fewer neighboring molecules will be able to bind a particular molecule to the liquid phase, thus increasing the probability of a molecule escaping the liquid\u2019s surface. Thus, smaller droplets will have a higher equilibrium vapor pressure. This would affect the minimum size necessary II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14. AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS for a thermodynamically stable cluster, suggesting that components with lower equilibrium saturation vapor pressures will form stable clusters at smaller diameters. Condensation is the result of collisions between a gaseous molecule and an existing aerosol droplet when supersaturation exists. Condensation occurs at much lower values of supersaturation than nucleation. Thus, when particles already exist in suffcient quantities, condensation will be the dominant process occurring to relieve the supersaturated condition of the vapor-phase material. A simple model for the formation and growth of an aerosol at ambient conditions involves the formation of a gas product by the appropriate chemical oxidation reactions in the gas phase. This product must have a suffciently low vapor pressure for the gas-phase concentration of the oxidized product to exceed its saturation vapor pressure. When this condition occurs, nucleation and condensation may proceed, relieving supersaturation. These processes result in the transfer of mass to the condensed phase. Aerosol growth in size occurs while condensation is proceeding. Coagulation, i.e. the process by which discrete particles come into contact with each other in the air and remain joined together by surface forces, represents another way in which aerosol diameter will increase. However, it does not alter the mass of material in the coagulated particle. The clearest example of this working model of homogeneous gas-to-particle conversion is sulfuric acid aerosol formation. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) has an extremely low saturation vapor pressure.", "Oxidation of relatively small amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) can result in a gas-phase concentration of H2SO4 that exceeds its June 25,1975 June 27,1975 July 1,1975 July 3,1975 equilibrium vapor pressure in the ambient atmosphere, with the subsequent formation of sulfuric acid aerosol. In contrast, nitric acid (HNO3) has a much higher saturation vapor pressure. Therefore, the gas-phase concentration of HNO3 is not high enough to permit nucleation of nitric acid aerosol in typical atmospheric systems. Atmospheric haze can occur over regions of several thousand square kilometers, caused by the oxidation of widespread SO2 and NO2 to sulfate and nitrate in relatively slow-moving air masses. In the eastern United States, large air masses associated with slow-moving or stagnating anticyclones have become suffciently contaminated to be called hazy blobs. These blobs have been tracked by satellites as they develop and move across the country.40 The evolution of regional hazy air masses has been documented in several case studies. The development of one such system is shown in Figure 14.18. During a 10-day period in the summer of 1975, a large region of the eastern United States had decreased visibility associated with the presence of fne particles in the atmosphere. The phenomenon occurred in association with a slow-moving high-pressure system. Because it seldom rains during the passage of these systems, the fne particles may have stayed airborne for a longer period of time than usual. 14.4.3.3 Effects of Atmospheric Haze The United States Clean Air Act of 1977 set as a national goal the prevention of any future degradation and the reduction of any existing impairment of visibility in mandatory class I federal areas caused by anthropogenic air pollution. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 reinforce the support of these goals (see Chapter 28 June 29,1975 July 5,1975 KM 0 1000 Visual range 6.5\u201310 km 5\u20136.5 km <5 km FIGURE 14.18 The evolution and transport of a large hazy air mass. Contour maps of noon visibility for June 25eJuly 5, 1975. Ref. 40. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14.4 AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS ON TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS for a discussion of federal classes of areas). These areas include most of the major national parks, such as the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and Zion Park. This portion of the Clean Air Act addresses the problem of visibility degradation by atmospheric haze of anthropogenic origin. This legislation recognizes atmospheric haze as a cause of degradation in visual air quality. All nations contain areas of exceptional scenic beauty. The value of these areas is largely determined by society. Many nations, determined to protect these areas, have established parks or preserves where only limited development can occur, in many instances limited to facilities such as food and lodging for visitors to the area. The Grand Canyon National Park in the southwestern United States is a prime example of an area of natural beauty. This park is w250 km long, varying in width up to w45 km. The actual canyon is w10km at its widest point, with the Colorado River running in the bottom of the canyon, 1600 m below the edge of the outer rim. Visitors go to parks for many reasons, such as hiking, camping, wildlife, and the enjoyment of solitude, but the overwhelming majority visit the Grand Canyon to enjoy the magnifcent views from its rim. These views have detail in the foreground (0e5 km), with colored layers of rock strata on canyon walls perhaps 5e25 km distant and in the far background (25e50 km) additional geologic features which contribute to the viewers\u2019 appreciation of the scene. To enjoy these views, one must have good visibility over the entire path length from the details in the foreground to the objects in the distant background. A survey by national park personnel indicates that large areas of the United States are subject to varying degrees of visibility degradation.26 The middle portion of the eastern half of the country and the Florida Gulf Coast are subject to widespread hazy air masses associated with stagnation conditions. Large portions of the western half of the country are subject to atmospheric haze problems associated with power plants, urban plumes, and agricultural activities. Average airport visibilities over the eastern half of the United States have been determined over a period of approximately 25 years (1948e1974).30 Although seasonal variations occur, the long-term trend has been decreased visual air quality over the time period. Holzworth42 reported on the frequency of visibility of less than 7 mi for 28 cities.", "Two periods of records were compared for each city. There were increases in low visibility in only 26% of the comparisons from the early period (around 1930e1940) to a later period (around the mid-1950s). Milleretal.43 using analyses for Akron, Ohio, Lexington, Kentucky, and Memphis, Tennessee, concluded that \u201csummer daytime visibilities were signifcantly lower during the period 1966e1969 than visibilities for the preceding 4-year period\u201d. Faulkenberry and Craig,44 in examining the trends at three Oregon cities, utilized a modifcation of the HolzwortheMaga technique by which a single statistic can be calculated for each year, indicating the probability of observing better visibility at Salem, Oregon, with no trends at Portland and Eugene, Oregon, over the period 1950e1971. Arizona has traditionally been a large copper-producing state. SOx emissions from copper smelters near Phoenix and Tucson are shown in Figure 14.19.27 Phoenix is located 100 km from the nearest smelter, and Tucson is 60 km from the nearest smelter. The improvement in visibility in the 1967e1968 period was due to a decrease in SOx emissions when there was a 9-month shutdown caused by a strike. Improvement in Percent of hours with visibility 40 km 60 km 14.4.3.4 Visibility Holzworth and Maga41 developed a technique for examining the trend in visibility and analyzed data for several California airports. Bakersfeld\u2019s visibility deteriorated over the period 1948e1957 and Sacramento\u2019s visibility decreased over the period 1935e1958. Los Angeles had decreasing visibility from 1932 to 1947, with little change over the period 1948e1959. Arizona smelter so emissions (tons day 1) FIGURE 14.19 Historic trends in hours of reduced visibility at Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, compared to trends in SOx emissions from Arizona smelters. The solid lines (ddd) represent yearly SOx emissions. The dots (.) represent yearly percentages of hours of reduced visibility. Note the open dots used to represent different locations in Tucson before 1958. Ref. 26. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14. AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS visibility in the mid-1970 was the result of better control technology and process changes. Zannetti et al.45 did an analysis of visual range in the eastern United States again showing the importance of humidity but also showing the importance of air mass type, which is usually related to its direction of origin. Mathai46 summarized the specialty conference on atmospheric visibility. With the exception of water content of particles and the measurement of organic species, analytical laboratory techniques are readily available for particle analysis. Regulatory approaches to mitigate existing visibility impairment and to prevent further impairment are being formulated. A signifcant problem for regulation is the lack of proven techniques to quantify the contributions due to various sources. 14.4.3.5 Acidic Deposition Over the past 25 years, evidence has been accumulated on changes in aquatic life and soil pH in Scandinavia, Canada, and the northeastern United States. Many believe that these changes are caused by acidic deposition traceable to pollutant acid precursors that result from the burning of fossil fuels. Acid rain is only one component of acidic deposition, a more appropriate description of this phenomenon. Acidic deposition is the combined total of wet and dry deposition, with wet acidic deposition being commonly referred to as acid rain. Acidity is defned in terms of the pH scale, where pH is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion [H\u00fe] concentration: pH \u00bc log H\u00fe (14.10) In the simplest case, CO2 dissolves in raindrops, forming carbonic acid. At a temperature of 20 C, the raindrops have a pH of 5.6, the value often labeled as that of clean or natural rainwater. It represents the baseline for comparing the pH of rainwater which may be altered by SO2 or NOx oxidation products. Figure 14.20 Lemon juice Mean pH of Adirondack Lakes\u20141975 Vinegar \u201cPure\u201d rain (5.6) Mean pH of Adirondack Lakes\u20141930s Distilled water Baking soda Acid rain 0123456 7891011121314 Acidic Basic Neutral FIGURE 14.20 The pH scale is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration. The pH of common substances is shown with various values along the scale. The Adirondack Lakes are located in the state of New York and are considered to be receptors of acidic deposition. US Environmental Protection Agency. Acid raindresearch summary. EPA600/8-79-028. Cincinnati (OH); 1979. illustrates the pH scale with the pH of common items and the pH range observed in rainwater. The pH of rainwater can vary from 5.6 due to the presence of H2SO4 and HNO3 dissolved or formed in the droplets. These strong acids dissociate and release hydrogen ions, resulting in more acidic droplets.", "Basic compounds can also infuence the pH. Calcium (Ca2\u00fe), magnesium (Mg2\u00fe), and ammonium \u00f0NH\u00fe\u00de ions help to neutralize 4 the rain droplet and shift the overall H\u00fe toward the basic end of the scale. The overall pH of any given droplet is a combination of the effects of carbonic acid, sulfuric and nitric acids, and any neutralizers such as ammonia. The principal elements of acidic deposition are shown in Figure 14.21. Dry deposition occurs when it is not raining. Gaseous SO2,NO2,and HNO3 and acid aerosols are deposited when they come into contact with and stick to the surfaces of water bodies, vegetation, soil, and other materials. If the surfaces are moist or liquid, the gases can go directly into solution; the acids formed are identical to those that fall in the form of acid rain. SO2 and NO2 can undergo oxidation, forming acids in the liquid surfaces if oxidizers are present. During cloud formation, when rain droplets are created, fne particles or acid droplets can act as seed nuclei for water to condense. This is one process by which sulfuric acid is incorporated in the droplets. While the droplets are in the cloud, additional gaseous SO2 and NO2 impinge on them and are absorbed. These absorbed gases can be oxidized by dissolved H2O2 or other oxidizers, lowering the pH of the raindrop. As the raindrop falls beneath the cloud, additional acidic gases and aerosol particles may be incorporated in it, also affecting its pH. The United States has established a National Atmospheric Deposition Program, and Canada has established Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN),47 which consists of sampling networks and organizational and support structures to obtain quantitative information on the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of acidic deposition CAPMoN is operated by Environment Canada, is designed to study the regional patterns and trends of atmospheric pollutants such as acid rain, smog, particulate matter and mercury, in both air and precipitation.48,49 The lowest rainwater pH isopleths are associated with the regions of highest SO2 emissions. Although there is considerable controversy over the quality and strength of the link between SO2 and NOx emissions from stationary sources and subsequent deposition of low-pH water hundreds of kilometers downwind, the National Research Council has concluded that a 50% reduction in the emissions of sulfur and nitrogen gases will produce about a 50% reduction in the acids deposited on the land and water downwind of the emission source. They also state that current meteorological models of atmospheric transport cannot identify II.

These are compared with point measurements at a possible 97 locations. The ADOM tended to overestimate ground-level SO2 and underestimate ground-level sulfate. Two factors not included in the model that may contribute to these results are consideration of conversion during surface fog and conversion in non-precipitating clouds. The RADM also overestimated SO2 and underestimated aerosol sulfate. In the eastern United States, acid rain consists of w65% sulfuric acid, w30% nitric acid, and w5% other acids.", "In the West, windblown alkaline dusts buffer the acidity in rains occurring over many rural areas, whereas in urban areas 80% of the acidity is due to nitric acid.54 Average pH in rainfall over the eastern United States for the period April 1979eMarch 1980 was less than 5.0, with some areas less than 4.2.55 The lowest annual pH recorded was 3.78 at De Bilt, The Netherlands, in 1967, and the lowest in an individual rainfall was 2.4 at Pitlochry, Scotland, on April 10, 1974.56 One of the major effects of acidic deposition is felt by aquatic ecosystems in mountainous terrain, where considerable precipitation occurs due to orographic lifting. The maximum effect is felt where there is little buffering of the acid by soil or rock structures and where steep lakeshore slopes allow little time for precipitation to remain on the ground surface before entering the lake. Maximum fsh kills occur in the early spring due to the \u201cacid shock\u201d of the frst meltwater, which releases the pollution accumulated in the winter snowpack. This frst melt may be 5e10 times more acidic than rainfall. Although the same measurement techniques for rainfall acidity have not been used over a long period of time and sampling has been carried out at relatively few locations, the trend between 1955e1956 and 1975e1976 was for the area with a pH of less than 4.6 to expand greatly over the eastern United States. The largest increases occurred over the southeastern United States, where industrialization grew rapidly during the period. The last several decades have also seen an increased area of lower pH over northern Europe. 14.4.3.6 Effects of Acidic Deposition Land, vegetation, and bodies of water are the surfaces on which acidic deposition accumulates. Bodies of freshwater represent the smallest proportion of the earth\u2019s surface area available for acidic deposition. Yet, the best-known effect is acidifcation of freshwater aquatic systems. Consider a lake with a small watershed in a forest ecosystem. The forest and vegetation can be considered as an acid concentrator. SO2,NO2, and acid aerosol are deposited on vegetation surfaces during dry II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 14. AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS periods and rainfalls; they are washed to the soil foor by low-pH rainwater. Much of the acidity is neutralized by dissolving and mobilizing minerals in the soil. Aluminum, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium are leached from the soil into surface waters. The ability of soils to tolerate acidic deposition is very dependent on the alkalinity of the soil. The soil structure in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada is quite varied, but much of the area is covered with thin soils with a relatively limited neutralizing capacity. In watersheds with this type of soil, lakes and streams are susceptible to low pH and elevated levels of aluminum. This combination has been found to be very toxic to some species of fsh. When the pH drops to w5, many species of fsh are no longer to reproduce and survive. In Sweden, thousands of lakes are no longer able to support fsh. In the United States the number of polluted lakes is much smaller, but many more may be pushed into that condition by continued acidic deposition. In Canada, damage to aquatic systems and forest ecosystems is a matter of considerable concern. Aquatic systems in areas of large snowfall accumulation are subjected to a pH surge during the spring thaw. Acidic deposition is immobilized in the snowpack, and when warm springtime temperatures cause melting, the melted snow fows into streams and lakes, potentially overloading the buffering capacity of the aquatic system. A second area of concern is reduced tree growth in forests, discussed earlier. As acidic deposition moves through forest soil, the leaching process removes nutrients. If the soil base is thin or contains barely adequate amounts of nutrients to support a particular mix of species, the continued loss of a portion of the soil minerals may cause a reduction in future tree growth rates or a change in the types of trees able to survive in a given location.

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 15 Air Pollution\u2019s Impact on Materials and Structures 15.1 ABIOTIC RECEPTORS Chapter 1 introduced the connections between stressors and receptors. The previous chapters in Part II address human and ecological receptors. These dominate concerns about receptor impacts, but air pollution\u2019s damage to the things built by civilizations are also an important concern for society. Chapter 14 considered the direct ecological injury brought by exposures to air pollutants, as well as the indirect impacts from even slight decreases in the pH of rainfall and other environmental conditions attributable to air pollution. These include abiotic features of ecosystems. However, many of these same processes also have substantial impact on materials important to humans. Air pollution\u2019s impacts on materials and structures follow the same type of pathways as those that affect human health and ecosystems. The pathway may be by a direct release of a damaging agent (e.g. acidic aerosols or oxidizers, e.g. ozone [O3]): Source/Air pollutant/Transport/Receptor (15.1) The pathway may also involve atmospheric transformation of a less corrosive substance into a damaging agent (e.g. reactions to form acids): Source/Precursor/Transformation /Corrosive agent/Transport/Receptor (15.2) Damage to materials increases societal costs, both fnancially and culturally.", "For example, in addition to the chemical reactions with material matrices within the structures, dry deposition of acidic compounds can coat buildings and other structures, which can lead to very high cleaning and maintenance costs. Coatings and paints are also vulnerable to air pollution, especially sulfur dioxide (SO2), which reacts in the atmosphere to become sulfuric acid (H2SO4). As evidence, the use of acid-resistant coatings has led to an average increase in the cost of $5.00 per vehicle manufactured in the U.S., which translates into $61 million per year.1 The costs are much greater given this estimate applies to merely one sector of a vast global marketplace. Material damage results from a wide range of air pollutants in all physical phases. Gases and vapors may be corrosive inherently, or they may be transformed chemically in the atmosphere into highly reactive substances, such as the formation of acids from oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. Material damage may also result from exposure to chemicals in aerosols that are deposited on materials and subsequently react to surfaces and crevices as acid aerosols and the dissolution of many types of materials by acid-forming gases. Exposure to acidic gases decreases the optimal life of paints, as well as reacts with minerals in stone and cement structures and products, compared to ordinary weathering processes, e.g. wind, moisture, temperature fuctuations, sunlight, and other meteorological factors. Building materials are expected to undergo weathering, but the rate increases dramatically with increasing exposure to air pollutants. In some cases, the frst stages of weathering are actually protective, as when rust, verdigris, and other oxides form on metals. The oxidized layer acts as a protective flm against subsequent corrosive attacks on the materials. However, the flm can be rendered less effective in the presence of air pollutants, e.g. when SO2 that is converted to sulfates during deposition reacts with calcite (made up of calcium carbonate, CaCO3) in limestone and marble,a and with gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate).2 Similarly, the natural process of metal corrosion from exposure to natural environmental elements is hastened by exposure to anthropogenic pollutants, in particular SO2 or other acidic substances, which render a Marble is metamorphosed limestone.

AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES the protective flm less effective. The rate of deteriora-18 tion is determined by the pollutant concentration, the 16 deposition rate, and the structural material\u2019s permeability and moisture content. These factors lead to 14 increased exposed surface areas and contact with aqueous phase contaminants. However, the extent of the damage to materials produced by the pollutant speciesabove andbeyondthatfromthe naturalweathering processes is uncertain.

From an engineering standpoint, corrosion can also translate into diminished optimal lives of products and structures. For example, air pollutants can contribute to the dilapidation of infrastructures, including bridges, roads, power grids, and communication systems. As such, material damage translates into threats to public safety. 15.2 EFFECTS ON METALS The principal effects of air pollutants on metals are corrosion of the surface, with eventual loss of material mass from the surface, and alteration in the electrical properties of the metals. Metals are divided into two categories: ferrous and nonferrous. Ferrous metals contain iron and include various types of steel. Nonferrous metals, such as zinc, aluminum, copper, and silver, do not contain iron. Three factors infuence the rate of corrosion of metals: moisture, type of pollutant, and temperature. In general, dry or cold locations tend to have the lowest rate of corrosion, the tropics and marine environments intermediate, and polluted industrial locations the highest rate of corrosion. The role of moisture in corrosion of metals and other surfaces is twofold: surface wetness acts as a solvent for containments and is a medium for electrolysis. The presence of sulfate and chloride ions accelerates the corrosion of metals. Metal surfaces can come into contact with liquid water repeatedly over a period of time as the humidity fuctuates. Several studies have been conducted in urban areas to relate air pollution exposure and metal corrosion.", "In Tulsa, Oklahoma, wrought iron disks were exposed in various locations.4 Using weight change as a measure of air pollution corrosion, the results indicated higher corrosion rates near industrial sectors containing an oil refnery and fertilizer and H2SO4 manufacturing facilities. Steel plates at 20 sites in Chicago, Illinois, were exposed at 20 locations, at which SO2 concentrations were also measured.5 Figure 15.1 shows the 4 2 0 FIGURE 15.1 Relationship between corrosion of mild steel and corresponding mean sulfur dioxide concentration at seven Chicago, Illinois, sites. Upham JB. J Air Pollut Control Assoc 1967;17:400. relationship between weight loss during 3-, 6-, and 12-month exposure periods and the mean SO2 concentration. Corrosion was also found to be higher in downtown locations than in suburban areas. Nonferrous metals are also subject to corrosion, but to a lesser degree than ferrous metals. Table 15.1 compares the weight loss of several nonferrous metals over a 20-year period.6 The results vary depending on the type of exposure present. For example, corrosion values at an industrial site in England were 100 times higher than those found in an arid African location.3 Zinc is often used as a protective coating over iron to form galvanized iron. In industrial settings exposed to SO2 and humidity, this zinc coating is subject to suffcient corrosion to destroy its protective capacity. The useful life of a zinc-coated galvanized sheet has been studied in different environmental settings.7 Table 15.2 shows the predicted useful life as a function of SO2 concentration. Aluminum appears to be resistant to corrosion from SO2 at ambient air concentrations. Aluminum alloys tend to form a protective surface flm that limits further corrosion upon exposure to SO2. Laboratory studies at higher concentrations (280 ppm) show corrosion of aluminum at higher humidities (>70%), with the formation of a white powder of aluminum sulfate. Copper and silver are used extensively in the electronics industry because of their excellent electrical conductivity. These metals tend to form a protective surface coating which inhibits further corrosion. When exposed to H2S, a sulfde coating forms, increasing the resistance across contacts on electrical switches.8 II.

It should be noted that metal damage research has been focused on a rather small subset of air pollutants\u2019 corrosion of metals and metal compounds, notably SO2,O3, and particulate matter. Metallic materials can also be damaged following deposition of acid aerosols and the dissolution of acid-forming gases on surfaces, increasing the corrosion of metals.9 Actually, the heterogeneous oxidation of metals is protective by forming an oxide coating, e.g. tarnish and rust. Copper tarnish, e.g., is a solid-gaseous reaction, producing a resistant coating of copper oxide: 2Cu\u00f0s\u00de\u00feO2\u00f0g\u00de/2Cuo\u00f0s\u00de (15.3) Corrosive action of metals often includes a galvanic process.", "That is, the liquid water reaching the metal surface either from precipitation or from condensation becomes an electrolyte solution with two dissimilar metals. The positive ions (cations) are attracted to the negatively charged cathode and the negative ions (anions) are attracted to the positively charged anode. Thus, rust is a redox reaction that begins with the formation of iron cations via half-reactions: 2Fe\u00f0s\u00de/2Fe2\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00fe4e (15.4) and, 4e /4H\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feO2\u00f0g\u00de/2H2O (15.5) Leading to the full reaction: 2Fe\u00f0s\u00de\u00fe4H\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feO2\u00f0g\u00de/2Fe2\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00fe2H2O\u00f0l\u00de (15.6) The divalent iron cation can then move toward the metal surface and precipitate as a hydrated form of ferric oxide [iron(III)oxide] which coats the metal: 4Fe2\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feO2\u00f0g\u00de\u00fe7H2O\u00f0l\u00de/2Fe2O3 (15.7) 1:5H2O\u00f0s\u00de\u00fe8H\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 15. AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES O2 O2 These reactions emphasize the importance of the physical phase of the contaminant, as well as the physical phase of the medium or substrate. Notably, the liquid phase of the water not only allows for the contact between the contaminants and the corroding surface, but also serves as the vehicle in which the ions form, undergo galvanic change, and are transported to the surface (Figure 15.2). 15.3 EFFECTS ON STONE The primary concern in regard to air pollution damage to stone structures is the soiling and deterioration of limestone, which is widely used as a building material, and for its metamorphosed form, i.e. marble, in statuary. 1 Figure 15.3 shows the long-term effects of urban air pollution on the appearance of stone masonry. Many buildings in older cities have been exposed to urban smoke, SO2,and CO2 for decades or centuries. The surfaces have become soiled and are subjected to chemical attack by acid gases. Exterior building surfaces are also subjected to a wetedry cycle induced by changes in rain and humidity. SO2 and water react with limestone (CaCO3) to form calcium sulfate (CaSO4) and gypsum (CaSO4 2H2O). These two sulfates are fairly soluble in water, causing deterioration in blocks and in the mortar used to join the blocks. The soluble calcium sulfates can penetrate into the pores of the limestone and then recrystallize and expand, causing further deterioration of the stone. CO2 in the presence of moisture forms carbonic acid. This acid converts the limestone into bicarbonate, which is also water soluble and can be leached away by rain. This mechanism is present in the deterioration of marble statues. The solid layer protection for metals discussed in the previous section also occurs on stone. For example, the calcium carbonate in limestone materials does not appear to react with sulfuric FIGURE 15.3 Effects of urban air pollution on materials. (A) Pock marks in marble column on the south side of the U.S. Capitol building. Silicate mineral inclusions in the marble loosen and fall out when the calcite around them is dissolved by precipitation with pH that has been lowered (i.e. higher acidity) by urban air pollution. (B) Marble block that forms the northeast corner of the Capitol balustrade shows preferential erosion of the calcite around a silicate mineral inclusion.

The heterogeneous reaction (three phases) does indeed occur: CaCO3\u00f0s\u00de\u00feH2SO4\u00f0l\u00de/CaSO4\u00f0s\u00de\u00feH2O\u00f0l\u00de\u00feCO2\u00f0g\u00de (15.8) Similar to the tarnish and rust of metals, the calcium sulfate (CaSO4) is a resistant solid layer that protects the stone. These coatings on both the minerals and the metals begin to become less effective as acidic air II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 15.4 EFFECTS ON FABRICS AND DYES pollution increases the rates of oxidation and other corrosive reactions to the point that the natural processes cause deeper and more extensive damage into metals and stone due to increased ionic strength in the water to which they are exposed. Thus, reaction (15.8) must be reformulated when water is present, allowing the CaCO3 to become dissolved and aqueous (aq) ions to be released: CaCO3\u00f0s\u00de\u00feH2SO4\u00f0l\u00de/Ca2\u00fe\u00f0aq\u00de\u00feSO2 \u00f0aq\u00de\u00feH2O\u00f0l\u00de 4 \u00feCO2\u00f0g\u00de (15.9) This ionic reaction is the corrosive one. Thus, comparing the two reactions, the solid phase CaSO4 is protective, but the cation (Ca2\u00fe) and anion \u00f0SO2 \u00de in 4 crease corrosivity. This is the same type of process as when the ions in the half-reactions involved in rust, including the increase in H\u00fe (i.e. decreasing pH), overcome the protective layer on metals. The increased ionic strength at least partially explains the difference in corrosion of buildings and structures that are protected from direct rainfall versus those that are sheltered under the same atmospheric conditions.", "That is, with identical SO2 concentrations, the protective layer is overridden in the unsheltered area due to increased moisture (i.e. water is needed for the ions). As evidence of surface destruction from air pollution, the dry deposition of SO2 enhances the effects of environmental elements on calcareous (limestone, marble, and cement) materials by converting calcium carbonate (calcite) to calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum): 2SO2\u00f0g\u00de\u00feCaCO3\u00f0s\u00de\u00fe4H2O\u00f0l\u00de/2CaSO4 2H2O\u00f0s\u00de \u00fe2H2CO3\u00f0l\u00de (15.10) The rate of deterioration is determined by the SO2 concentration, the deposition rate, and the stone\u2019s permeability and moisture content; however, the extent of the damage to stones produced by the pollutant species above and beyond that from the natural weathering processes is uncertain. Note also that this reaction produces carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is a naturally occurring component of many surface waters and is itself corrosive. In addition, H2CO3 exists in equilibrium with carbon dioxide and water: CO2 \u00feH2O4H2CO3 (15.11) However, it also dissociates into the bicarbonate ions: H2CO34HCO3 \u00feH\u00fe (15.12) This increasing pH (release of H\u00fe) and ionic concentrations can lead to additional material damage. For many environmental situations, H2CO3 includes dissolved CO2 (i.e. CO2 (aq)). An asterisk is added, i.e. H2CO3, to indicate the presence of both chemical species in equilibrium: H2CO34HCO3 \u00feH\u00fe (15.13) The bicarbonate ion then can dissociate into carbonate ions and additional hydrogen ions: HCO3 4CO2 \u00feH\u00fe (15.14) 3 Again, the ionic strength and pH are major factors in the destruction of stone and cement structures. Most of the damage is the result of the gasesolid heterogeneous reaction of SO2 and CaCO3. However, the ancillary effect of adding H2CO3,H\u00fe, and other ions in the aqueous phase exacerbates and increases the rate of degradation. Instead of attack by ions and acids in normal rain (H2CO3 is the main reason that normal rain has a pH < 6), the sequential additional acidity from reaction (15.8) adds to the damage and increases the rate of damage. Thus, the continuously increasing CO2 concentrations in the troposphere in recent decades would be expected to be accompanied by increased corrosion of stone structures. 15.4 EFFECTS ON FABRICS AND DYES The major effects of air pollution on fabrics are soiling and loss of tensile strength. Oxides of sulfur are considered to cause the greatest loss of tensile strength. The mechanism is not understood, but it is likely that fne droplets of H2SO4 aerosol deposit on the very thin nylon fbers, causing them to fail under tension. The reactions in the previous sections may apply as well. Cellulose fbers are also weakened by SO2, possibly due to reactions similar to reaction (15.8), i.e. gasesolid heterogeneous reactions. Cotton, linen, hemp, and rayon are subject to damage from SO2 exposure. A study in St Louis, Missouri, found that urban air pollution affects the tensile strength of cotton duck material.10 Samples were exposed at seven locations for up to 1 year. Figure 15.4 shows the relationship between tensile strength and pollutant exposure. Substantial loss of fabric strength was observed following exposures to sulfur trioxide at two levels of ambient air exposure. At high exposure (5.5 mg SO3 per square decimeter per day, i.e. 5.5 mg dm 2 day 1) the material lost almost all of its strength after 1 year; and even the lower exposed (0.6 mg SO3 dm 2 II.

AIR POLLUTION\u2019S IMPACT ON MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES 100 80 60 40 20 0 Exposure (months) FIGURE 15.4 Effects of sulfation and time on tensile strength of cotton duck. Ref. 10. Breaking strength remaining (%) day 1) materials exhibited less than one-half its initial tensile strength when exposed to air pollution for 1 year. Particulate matter contributes to the soiling of fabrics. The increased frequency of washing to remove dirt results in more wear on the fabric, causing it to deteriorate in the cleaning process. This also means that any pollutants in detergents and other products needed for these additional washings will be released into sewers or septic systems, with a potential for surface and ground water contamination, including the addition of nutrients which can lead to eutrophication of lakes and other surface waters. In addition to air pollution damage to fabrics, the dyes used to color fabrics have been subject to fading caused by exposure to air pollutants. Since the early 1900s, fading of textile dyes has been a continuing problem. The composition of dyes has been altered several times to meet demands of new fabrics and to \u201csolve\u201d the fading problem.", "Before World War I, dyes used on wool contained free or substituted amino acid groups, which were found to be susceptible to exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2). When cellulose acetate rayon was introduced in the mid-1920s, previous dye technologies were replaced with new chemicals called dispersive dyes. Not long after their initial use, fading of blue, green, and violet shades began to be observed in material exposed to nitrogen oxides. The fabric was marked by a reddening discoloration. Laboratory studies duplicating ambient air levels of NO2 and humidity reproduced these effects.11 Ozone has also been found to cause fading of material. This was discovered when white fabrics developed a yellow discoloration.12a,12b This fnding has led researchers to investigate the effects of O3 on other chemicals added to the material, including optical brighteners, antistatic and soil-release fnishes, and softeners. A very complex process occurred in which the dyes were migrating to the permanentpress-fnish materials (e.g. softeners). Softeners have been found to be good absorbers of gases. Fading results from the combination of dye and absorbed NO2 and O3. This combination with high relative humidities has caused color fading in numerous types of material and dye combinations. However, dyes and pigments have improved in recent decades, so that fading from airborne pollutants has become less of a problem. 15.5 EFFECTS ON LEATHER, PAPER, PAINT, AND GLASS Sulfur dioxide affects the composition of leather and paper, causing signifcant deterioration. The major concern is the destruction of leather-bound books in the libraries of the world. SO2 is absorbed by leather and converted to H2SO4 which attacks the structure of the leather. Initially, the edges of the exposed back of the book begin to crack at the hinges. As the cracks expand, more leather is exposed and the cracks widen, with the back eventually falling off the book. Preventive measures now include storage in SO2 free air. The cellulose fber in paper is attacked and weakened by SO2. Paper made before about 1750 is not signifcantly affected by SO2.13 At aboutthattime, the manufacture of paper changed to a chemical treatment process that broke down the wood fber more rapidly. The process seems to introduce trace quantities of metals, which catalyze the conversion of SO2 to H2SO4. Sulfuric acid causes the paper to become brittle and more subject to cracking and tearing. New papers are available to minimize the interaction with SO2. A hardened paint surface resists sorption by gases, although the presence of relatively high concentrations of 2620e5240 mgm 3SO2(1e2 ppm) increases the drying time of newly painted surfaces. Hydrogen sulfde (H2S) reacts with lead-based pigments: Pb2\u00fe\u00fe H2S/PbS \u00fe 2H\u00fe (15.15) This process blackens white and light-tinted paints. Although most paints no longer contain Pb-based II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 15.6 EFFECTS ON RUBBER pigments, the reaction would be expected to be similar for other metal pigments, so a general metal (Me) reaction can be written for other divalent metals reacting with H2S: Me2\u00fe\u00fe H2S/MeS \u00fe 2H\u00fe (15.16) If they indeed do behave like lead, other metal-based paints can discolor surfaces in several hours at a concentration of 70 mgm 3 H2S (0.05 ppm).14 In time the metal sulfde would be expected to oxidize to the original color. However, paints pigmented with titanium or zinc do not form a black precipitate in the frst place, so the lead-based paint chemistry may not readily be generalizable to other metal pigments. Alkyd or vinyl vehicles and pigments contain no heavy metal salts for reaction with H2S. Painted surfaces are also dirtied by particulate matter. Contaminating dirt can readily become attached to wet or tacky paint, where it is held tenaciously and forms focal points for gaseous sorption for further attack. Dirt that collects on roofs or in gutters, blinds, screens, windowsills, or other protuberances is eventually washed over external surfaces to mar decorative effects. Automobile fnishes can be damaged from scarring by calcium sulfate crystals formed when H2SO4 in rain or dew react with dry deposited calcium.15 As a result of air pollution regulations and advances in materials science, new coatings are being applied to metal and other surfaces. These coatings are also vulnerable to air pollution. For example, a study of chemical damage to melamine-acrylic base coat/clear-coat enamel paint systems by H2SO4, a simulated acid rain and sodium sulfate indicates that air pollutants in aqueous solution can damage surfaces coated with these enamels. In fact, these solutions penetrated the coating in a short time.", "Upon entry, chemical reactions occur which result in degradation of the polymer network. This alters the thermal properties and the appearance of the coating materials. The steps in degradation begin with hydrolysis of the melamine network, followed by either destruction or leaching of the melamine-acrylic composite.16 Glass is normally considered to be a very stable material. However, there is growing evidence that SO2 air pollution may be accelerating the deterioration of medieval glass. A corrosion surface forms on these glass surfaces and the sulfate present helps prolong surface wetness. This condition is conducive to further attack and degradation of the glass surface.17 Inks and paints in paintings and other works of art are particularly vulnerable to O3. Because of the potential of O3 to damage works of art, recommended O3 concentrations in museums, libraries, and archives are quite low, e.g. <0.013 ppm. Fading of art work has also been observed due to exposure to NO2, and peroxyacetyl nitrate.18 15.6 EFFECTS ON RUBBER Although it was known for some time that ozone cracks rubber products under tension, the problem was not related to air pollution. During the early 1940s, it was discovered that rubber tires stored in warehouses in Los Angeles, California, developed serious cracks. Intensifed research soon identifed the causative agent as O3 that resulted from atmospheric reaction between sunlight (3000e4600 A \u00b0 ), oxides of nitrogen, and specifc types of organic compounds, i.e. photochemical air pollution. Natural rubber is composed of polymerized isoprene units. When rubber is under tension, O3 attacks the carbonecarbon double bond, breaking the bond. The broken bond leaves adjacent C]C bonds under additional stress, eventually breaking and placing still more stress on surrounding C]C bonds. This \u201cdomino\u201d effect can be discerned from the structural formulas in Figure 15.5. The number of cracks and the depth of the cracks in rubber under tension increase directly with increasing O3 exposure. Rubber products may be protected against ozone attack by the use of a highly saturated rubber molecule, the use of a wax inhibitor which will \u201cbloom\u201d to the surface, and the use of paper or plastic wrappings to protect the surface. Despite these efforts, rubber products generally still crack more on the west coast than on the east coast of the United States. The elastomeric compounds, i.e. natural rubber and synthetic polymers and copolymers of butadiene, isoprene, and styrene, are especially susceptible to top degradation at even low concentrations of O3. These compounds are long-chain unsaturated organic molecules. Ozone is able to break the molecular chain at the carbon]carbon double bond; a chain of three oxygen atoms is added directly across the double bond, forming a fve-membered ring structure.19 The change in structure promotes the characteristic cracking of stressed/ stretched rubber. Tensile strain of 5% generates surfcial cracks in the rubber, which become more numerous with increased stress/stretching. The rate of crack growth depends on the degree of stress, the type of rubber compound, concentration, duration of contaminant 20ae20c exposure, velocity, and temperature. In one study, vulcanized natural rubber compounds were exposed for 24 h to varying O3 concentrations under stressed conditions. Ozone concentrations were 60, II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 15.

Air pollution also destroys irreplaceable materials, including monuments, historically important structures and buildings, as well as works of art and cultural artifacts. Materials generally have instrumental value, i.e. anthropocentric value based on somewhat arbitrary criteria. Material damage follows the prototypical stressorereceptor paradigm, but the value placed on the receptor is less intrinsic than health and ecological values. An example of intrinsic and instrumental values is shown in Table 15.4. II. THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION TABLE 15.4 Various Value Systems Related to Air Pollution. What is valued?

THE RISKS OF AIR POLLUTION 16 Scale and Complexity of Air Pollution Air pollution exists at all scales, from personal to global. Ambient air pollution scales may be further subdivided into local, urban, regional, continental, and global. The spheres of in\ufb02uence of the air pollutants themselves range from molecular (e.g. gases and nanoparticles) to planetary (e.g. dispersion of greenhouse gases throughout the troposphere). The spatial extent of the local scale is a radius of up to about 5 km on the earth\u2019s surface. The urban scale extends the radius to about 50 km. The regional scale radius is from 50 to 500 km. Continental scales are from 500 to several 1000 km in any direction, but is often the direction of the winds aloft, since this the route traversed by the pollutant. Of course, the global scale extends worldwide. 16.1 MECHANICAL SCALE AND COMPLEXITY Atmospheric physics is discussed in detail in Chapters 2 and 28. Respiratory physics, i.e. \ufb02uid mechanics of the respiratory system, is discussed in Chapter 9. Cellular transport is discussed throughout this text. The same laws of motion apply to every scale. Since physics and chemistry both play prominent roles in chemical transformation, the dynamics must be understood at each scale. Indeed, some of the terms used by chemists are the same as those used by physicists, but their meanings are somewhat nuanced, e.g. kinetics, equilibrium, and dynamics. Numerous air terms have different connotations within the contexts of scale and complexity. For example, the term particle at the atomic scale usually means an atom, molecule, ion, or even an electron; whereas particle in most air pollution discussions means a single aerosol. Even among air pollution modelers and other air pollution experts, particle has a somewhat different meaning. Models often use the particle concept to represent a part of the atmosphere, analogous to a geometric point as a theoretical component of an air mass. Similarly, the term diffusion to most physicists and chemists means molecular movement due to concentration gradients, but for others working in air pollution, the term is nearly synonymous with the spread and dilution of substances in a plume.a The term pathway also has scale and complexity dependence, such as the pathways representing modes of action leading to an effect from a dose at the cellular scale, as used in Chapter 7, versus the pathways of exposure that are larger scale (e.g. air that is inhaled, water that is consumed, soil that is contacted by skin), as used in Chapter 8. Ambiguity is always problematic in the life sciences, especially the biomedical and environmental sciences, and engineering.", "Therefore, this chapter seeks to clarify and differentiate the meanings of key terms within the context of time and space. Mechanics is the \ufb01eld of physics concerned with the motion and the equilibrium of bodies within particular frames of reference. Air pollution scientists make use of the mechanical principles in practically every aspect of pollution, from the movement of \ufb02uids that carry contaminants to the forces within substances that affect their properties to the relationships between matter and energy within organisms and ecosystems. Engineering mechanics is important, for example, the design of pollution control equipment must properly account for statics and dynamics. Fluid mechanics is a particularly important branch of the mechanics of air pollution. Statics is the branch of mechanics that is concerned with bodies at rest with relation to some frame of reference, with the forces between the bodies, and with the equilibrium of the system. It addresses rigid bodies that are at rest or moving with constant velocity. Hydrostatics is a branch of statics that is essential to environmental science and engineering in that it is concerned with the equilibrium of \ufb02uids (liquids and gases) and their stationary interactions with solid bodies, such as pressure. While many \ufb02uids are considered by environmental assessments, the principal \ufb02uids are water and air. Dynamics is the branch of mechanics that deals with forces that change or move bodies.

SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF AIR POLLUTION science and engineering discipline because it is fundamental to understanding the movement of contaminants through the environment. Dynamics is sometimes used synonymously with kinetics. However, this text prefers the engineering approach to treat kinetics as one of the two branches of dynamics, with the other being kinematics. Dynamics combines the properties of the \ufb02uid and the means by which it moves. This means that the continuum \ufb02uid mechanics vary by whether the \ufb02uid is viscous or inviscid, compressible or incompressible, and whether \ufb02ow is laminar or turbulent. For example, the properties of the two principal environmental \ufb02uids, i.e. water in an aquifer and an air mass in the troposphere, are shown in Table 16.1. Thus, in air pollution mechanics, turbulent systems are quite common. However, within smaller systems, such as control technologies, laminar conditions can be prominent. Kinematics is concerned with the study of a body in motion independent of forces acting on the body. That is, kinematics is the branch of mechanics concerned with motion of bodies with reference to force or mass. This is accomplished by studying the geometry of motion irrespective of what is causing the motion. Therefore, kinematics relates position, velocity, acceleration, and time. Chapters 24, 25, 29, 30, and 31 extensively apply kinematic principles. Aerodynamics and hydrodynamics are the important branches of environmental mechanics. Both are concerned with deformable bodies and with the motion of \ufb02uids. Therefore, they provide an important underlying aspect of contaminant transport and movements of \ufb02uids, and consider \ufb02uid properties such as compressibility and viscosity. These are crucial properties in explaining the movement of contaminants within plumes, \ufb02ows in vents and pipes, and design of air pollution control systems. Kinetics is the study of motion and the forces that cause motion. This includes analyzing force and mass as they relate to translational motion. Kinetics also considers the relationship between torque and moment of inertia for rotational motion. Note that chemists often refer to kinetics as those reactions that have yet to reach equilibrium, i.e. equality between both sides of the reaction. Indeed, this is the connotation used in Chapters 17 and 18. Thus, TABLE 16.1 Contrasts between Plume in Ground Water and Atmosphere Ground Water Plume Air Mass Plume General \ufb02ow type Laminar Turbulent Compressibility Incompressible Compressible Viscosity Low viscous 3(1 10 kg m 1 s 1 Very low viscosity 5(1.781 10 kg m 1 s 1 at288K) at288K) kinetic reactions employ a one-direction arrow (/), whereas equilibria show a two-direction arrow (4). A key concept for environmental dynamics within the context of physical motion is that of linear momentum, the product of mass and velocity. A body\u2019s momentum is conserved unless an external force acts upon a body.", "Kinetics is based on Newton\u2019s \ufb01rst law of motion, which states that a body will remain in a state of rest or will continue to move with constant velocity unless an unbalanced external force acts on it. Stated as the law of conservation of momentum, linear momentum is unchanged if no unbalanced forces act on a body. Or, if the resultant external force acting on a body is zero, the linear momentum of the body is constant. Kinetics is also based upon Newton\u2019s second law of motion, which states that the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the force acting upon that body, and inversely proportional to the body\u2019s mass. The direction of acceleration is the same as the force of direction. The equation for the second law is: dp F \u00bc (16.1) dt where, p \u00bc momentum. Newton\u2019s third law of motion states that for every acting force between two bodies, there is an equal but opposite reacting force on the same line of action: Freacting \u00bc Facting (16.2) Another force that is important in air pollution is friction, which is a force that always resists motion or an impending motion. Friction acts parallel to the contacting surfaces. When bodies come into contact with one another, friction acts in the direction opposite to that which is bringing the objects into contact. Forces are an important part of air pollution control systems. As such, forces are discussed in detail in Chapters 30 and 31. Air pollutants may move within one environmental compartment, such as a source within a home. Most often, however, pollutants move among numerous compartments, such as when a contaminant moves from the source to the atmosphere, until it is deposited to the soil and surface waters, where it is taken up by plants, and eaten by animals. Science is by necessity compartmentalized among physics, chemistry, and biology. However, complex topics like pollutant transport require that all three of the sciences be considered. Thus, while the focus and language of this chapter is predominantly on physical transport, discussing chemical and biological phenomena at the same time can help to explain the concepts as they may be expected to occur in the real world. The general behavior of contaminants after they are released is shown in Figure 16.1. The movement of pollutants is known as transport. This is half of the often cited duo of environmental \u201cfate and transport\u201d. Fate is an III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16.1 MECHANICAL SCALE AND COMPLEXITY expression of what contaminant becomes after all the physical, chemical, and biological processes of the environment have acted. It is the ultimate site of a pollutant after its release. The pollutant will undergo numerous changes in location and form before reaching its fate. Throughout the contaminant\u2019s journey, it will be physically transported and undergo coincidental chemical processes, known as transformations, such as photochemical and biochemical reactions (see Chapters 17 and 18). Certainly, fate implies more than physical transport. The fate of an air pollutant depends on abiotic chemical reactions, such as photolysis, endothermic, and exothermic reactions, and mechanical separation processes, as well as biotic transformation, e.g. microbial degradation.b Usually, in the discussions of fate and transport, the reactions are those that occur in the ambient environment. The intentional treatment and control processes usually fall under the category of environmental engineering. For example, if a chlorinated solvent is released from a factory\u2019s vents and stacks, it may undergo transformations in the atmosphere before it reaches the soil. In the soil, the microbially mediated transformations may change the chemical structure to a simpler molecule, e.g. by mineralization. This lighter molecule may have a suf\ufb01ciently high vapor pressure, which allows it to again move into the atmosphere, where it undergoes additional photochemical transformation, increasing its aqueous solubility. This new compound b Of course, biotic processes employ the same principles as abiotic, e.g. electron transfer and redox, but they take place in different substrates (i.e. cells), at different rates, and use different substances (e.g. enyzmes as catalysts). III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16. SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF AIR POLLUTION is deposited onto the surface of the lake, where it is taken up by algae. The algae are food for \ufb01sh, so this transformation product is bioaccumulated and further transformed in the \ufb01sh. If the \ufb01sh is eaten by humans, the ultimate fate of the original air pollutant released from the stacks and vents is in human tissue. Thus, the fate is a consequence of physics, chemistry, and biology.", "Environmental engineering has a slightly different perspective of fate. Engineers seek control and design systems to accomplish outcomes. For example, engineers employ remediation reactions, such as thermal and mechanical separation processes, as well as abiotic chemical reactions, such as precipitation and hydrolysis, as well as biological processes, such asmicrobial metabolic biochemical reactions, to break down toxic substances into simpler, less toxic compounds. The same processes and reactions that occur in the ambient environment mentioned in the previous paragraph are used by engineers for the treatment and control processes that usually fall under the category of environmental engineering. Engineers have simply changed the scale from large environmental compartments like air masses and lakes to smaller reactors, such as pollutant collection and treatment devices. Physical transport is in\ufb02uenced by the kinematics and mechanics of \ufb02uids. In addition, it is important to identify when these processes reach equilibrium, such as when a chemical is sequestered and stored. Fate is often described according to environmental media or compartments (see Chapter 18). Understanding air pollutant transport begins with the characteristics of environmental \ufb02uids. Recall from Chapter 1 that a \ufb02uid is a collective term that includes all liquids and gases. A liquid is matter that is composed of molecules that move freely among themselves without separating from each other. A gas is matter composed of molecules that move freely and are in\ufb01nitely able to occupy the space with which they are contained at a constant temperature. A \ufb02uid is a substance that will deform continuously upon the application of a shear stress; i.e. a stress in which the material on one side of a surface pushes on the material on the other side of the surface with a force parallel to the surface. Fluids are generally divided into two types: ideal and real. The former has zero viscosity and, thus, no resistance to shear (explained below). An ideal \ufb02uid is incompressible and \ufb02ows with uniform velocity distributions. It also has no friction between moving layers and no turbulence (i.e. eddy currents). On the contrary, a real \ufb02uid has \ufb01nite viscosity, has nonuniform velocity distributions, is compressible, and experiences friction and turbulence. Real \ufb02uids are further subdivided according to their viscosities. A Newtonian \ufb02uid is one that has a constant viscosity at all shear rates at a constant temperature and pressure. Water and most solvents are Newtonian \ufb02uids. However, environmental engineers are confronted with non-Newtonian \ufb02uids, i.e. those with viscosities not constant at all shear rates. Sites contaminated with drilling \ufb02uids and oils have large quantities of non-Newtonian \ufb02uids onsite. As mentioned, one of the concepts of the particle is a theoretical point that has mass and location, but no geometric extension. We can observe this particle as it moves within the \ufb02uid as a representation of where that portion of the \ufb02uid is going and at what velocity. Another spatial and thermodynamic concept is the control volume, which is an arbitrary region in space that is de\ufb01ned by boundaries. The control volume\u2019s boundaries may be either stationary or moving. The control volume is a means of applying the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics, i.e. conservation of mass and energy. The amount of mass or energy entering a control volume must equal the amount exiting the control volume minus what remains in the control volume. Thus, the control volume is useful in measuring and modeling the amount of an air pollutant entering, remaining, and exiting a parcel of air, water, soil, or even a cell or parcel of tissue in an organism (e.g. pharmacokinetics). Contaminant transport requires motion. This highlights the need of understanding the spatial context and complexity of not only the air pollutant, but of the \ufb02uid behavior. The forces acting on a \ufb02uid may be body forces or surface forces. The former are forces that act on every particle within the \ufb02uid, occurring without actually making physical contact, such as gravitational force. The latter are forces that are applied directly to the \ufb02uid\u2019s surface by physical contact. As mentioned in Chapter 2, in physics, stress represents the total force per unit area acting on a \ufb02uid at any point within the \ufb02uid volume. So, stress at any point P is: dF s\u00f0P\u00de\u00bc lim (16.3) dA/0 dA where, s(P) \u00bcvector stress at point P. dA \u00bcin\ufb01nitesimal area at point P. dF \u00bcforce acting on dA. Fluid properties are characteristics of the \ufb02uid that are used to predict how the \ufb02uid will react when subjected to applied forces.", "If a \ufb02uid is considered to be in\ufb01nitely divisible, that is, it is made up of many molecules that are constantly in motion and colliding with one another, this \ufb02uid is in continuum. That is, a \ufb02uid acts as though it has no holes or voids, meaning its properties are continuous (i.e. temperature, volume, and pressure \ufb01elds are continuous). Assuming that a \ufb02uid is a continuum allows for the \ufb02uid\u2019s properties to be functions of position and time. Fluid properties are important at every scale of air pollution. For example, \ufb02uid properties must be considered at the cellularscale, e.g. \ufb02ow through cell membranes. Recall the discussion in Chapter 9 of the importance of Newtonian and non-Newtonian \ufb02uids in the cascade of III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16.1 MECHANICAL SCALE AND COMPLEXITY bronchial tubules in the lung, as well as the difference in \ufb02ow from turbulent at the entry of air by inhalation to laminar \ufb02ow at the bloodeair exchange sites. Such \ufb02uid properties can be represented by two \ufb01elds. The density \ufb01eld is represented by: r \u00bcr\u00f0x; y; z; t\u00de (16.4) where, r \u00bcdensity of the \ufb02uid. x, y, z \u00bccoordinates in space. t \u00bctime. The other \ufb02uid \ufb01eld is the velocity \ufb01eld: ! ! v \u00bc v \u00f0x; y; z; t\u00de (16.5) When a rate of change equals zero, the system is said to be in steady state. Thus, if the \ufb02uid properties and the \ufb02ow characteristics at each position do not vary with time, the \ufb02uid is at steady \ufb02ow: vr r \u00bcr\u00f0x; y; z\u00de or \u00bc0 (16.6) vt and ! ! v v ! v \u00bc v \u00f0x; y; z\u00de or \u00bc0 (16.7) vt Conversely, a time-dependent \ufb02ow is considered to be an unsteady \ufb02ow. Any \ufb02ow with unchanging ! magnitude and direction of the velocity vector v is considered to be a uniform \ufb02ow. Fluids, then, can be classi\ufb01ed according to observable physical characteristics of \ufb02ow \ufb01elds. A continuum \ufb02uids mechanics classi\ufb01cation is shown in Figure 1.9. Laminar \ufb02ow is in layers, whereas turbulent \ufb02ow has random movements of \ufb02uid particles in all directions. In incompressible \ufb02ow, the variations in density are assumed to be constant, while the compressible \ufb02ow has density variations, which must be included in \ufb02ow calculations. Viscous \ufb02ows must account for viscosity while inviscid \ufb02ows assume viscosity is zero. The velocity \ufb01eld is very important in environmental modeling, especially in modeling plumes in the atmosphere and in groundwater, since the velocity \ufb01eld is a way to characterize the motion of \ufb02uid particles and provides the means for computing these motions. The velocity \ufb01eld may be described mathematically using Eqn (16.5). This is known as the Eulerian viewpoint. Another way to characterize the \ufb02uid movement (i.e. \ufb02ow) is to follow the particle (sometimes referred to as a \u201cparcel\u201d) as it moves, using time functions that correspond to each particle as shown in Figure 16.2.Recallfrom Chapters 6 and 9 that molecular diffusion is important at very small distances and for very small particles ( 0.1 mm diameter) given that Brownian motion allows x2 at tt them to move in a \u201crandom walk\u201d away from the air stream. Interception works mainly for particles with diameters between 0.1 and 1 mm. The particle does not leave the air stream but comes into contact with the \ufb01lter medium (e.g. a strand of \ufb01berglass). Inertial impaction collects particles that are suf\ufb01ciently large to leave the air stream by inertia (diameters 1 mm). This random walk of the particle provides what is known as the Lagrangian viewpoint, which is expressed mathematically as: ! v \u00bc\u00bdx\u00f0t\u00de; y\u00f0t\u00de; z\u00f0t\u00de (16.8) A Lagrangian plume model characterizes the plume by calculating the air dispersion from statistics of the trajectories of a large number of the particles (enough to represent the whole plume). The major means by which air pollutants move in the atmosphere is advection, i.e. they move with the \ufb02ow of the \ufb02uid where they reside, i.e. the air. This change in position in space is the \ufb02uid velocity (V). This is a vector \ufb01eld quantity. Speed (V) is the magnitude of the vector velocity V at some given point in the \ufb02uid, and average speed (V) is the mean \ufb02uid speed through a control volume\u2019s surface. Therefore, velocity is a vector quantity (magnitude and direction), while speed is a scalar quantity (magnitude only). The standard units of velocity and speed are meter per second (m s 1). Obviously, velocity is important in air pollution, especially with regard to complexity.", "For example, velocityc informs mixing rates after a pollutant is emitted into a plume. If an air pollutant is released into a well-mixed chamber, calculations of concentration would be simpler than an unmixed chamber. Unfortunately, this assumption translates into average concentrations within the entire chamber or plume. This is an example of the dif\ufb01culty in stepping up laboratory or mesoscale \ufb01ndings to the real world. For example, an air pollutant plume is never homogeneous. It is certainly likely to have higher concentrations near the source, but it will also c The distinction between velocity and speed is seldom made in air pollution. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16. SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF AIR POLLUTION have pockets of higher and lower concentrations given the variability of terrain, structures, albedo, clouds, temperature, and moisture. Even a small compartment, e.g. a room in a house, is never completely mixed, with regions of varying pollutant concentrations. Pressure (p) is also important at all scales. Recall that p is a force per unit area: F p \u00bc (16.9) A Thus, p is a type of stress that is exerted uniformly in all directions. This is arguably the most important type of stress in air pollution engineering, where it is common to use the term pressure instead of force to describe the factors that in\ufb02uence the behavior of \ufb02uids. The standard unit of p is the Pascal (Pa), which is equal to 1Nm 2. For vapor pressure, partial pressures, and partitioning coef\ufb01cients discussed in the next chapters, the most common units the kilopascal (kPa) and millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Pressure varies with area, as shown in Figure 16.3. In this example, the same weight (force) over different areas leads to different pressures, much higher pressure when the same force is distributed over a smaller area. For a liquid at rest, the medium is considered to be a continuous distribution of matter. However, when considering p for a gas, the pressure is an average of the forces against the vessel walls; i.e. gas pressure. Fluid pressure is a measure of energy per unit volume per the Bernoulli equation, which states that the static pressure in the \ufb02ow plus one half of the density times the velocity squared is equal to a constant throughout the \ufb02ow, referred to as the total pressure of the \ufb02ow: p \u00fe 1=2pV2 \u00fe pgh \u00bc constant (16.10) where, p \u00bc pressure V \u00bc \ufb02uid velocity h \u00bc elevation g \u00bc gravitational acceleration Weight = 150 N Weight = 150 N A = 10 m2 A = 0.1 m2 p = 15 Pa p = 1500 Pa FIGURE 16.3 Difference in pressure with same weight over different areas. To adhere to the conservation of energy principle, a \ufb02owing \ufb02uid will maintain the energy, but velocity and pressure can change. In fact, velocity and pressure will compensate for each other to adhere to the conservation principle, as stated in the Bernoulli equation: p1 \u00fe 1=2pV2 \u00fe pgh1 \u00bc p2 \u00fe 1=2pV2 \u00fe pgh2 (16.11) 12 This is shown graphically in Figure 16.4. The so-called \u201cBernoulli effect\u201d occurs when increased \ufb02uid speed leads to decreased internal pressure. In many air pollution scenarios, \ufb02uid pressure is measured against two references: zero pressure and atmospheric pressure. Absolute pressure is compared to true zero pressure and gage pressure is reported in reference to atmospheric pressure. To be able to tell which type of pressure is reported, the letter \u201ca\u201d and the letter \u201cg\u201d are added to units to designate whether the pressure is absolute or gage, respectively. So, it is common to see pounds per square inch designated as \u201cpsia\u201d or inches of water as \u201cin wg\u201d. If no letter is designated, the pressure is likely absolute pressure. When a gage measurement is taken, and the actual atmospheric pressure is known, absolute and gage pressures are related: pabsolute \u00bc pgage \u00fe patmospheric (16.12) Barometric and atmospheric pressures are synonymous. A negative gage pressure implies a vacuum measurement. A reported vacuum quantity is to be subtracted from the atmospheric pressure. For example, when a piece of equipment is operating with 20 kPa vacuum, the absolute pressure is 101.3 kPa 20 kPa \u00bc 81.3 kPa. (Note: The standard atmospheric pressure \u00bc 101.3 kPa \u00bc 1.013 bars). Thus, the relationship between vacuums, which are always given as positive numbers, and absolute pressure is: pabsolute \u00bc patmospheric pvacuum (16.13) Pressure concepts are used throughout this text, as in most discussion of physics, chemistry, and biology. As Pressure p1 III.", "TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16.1 MECHANICAL SCALE AND COMPLEXITY 100 80 60 40 kPa in each unit 20 mm Hg in water kPa 0 mm Hg in water kPa in Hg psi atm mentioned, the standard metric unit of pressure is the Pascal, which is quite small for most air pollution applications. Thus, the kPa is used most often. See Figure 16.5 for a comparison of relative size of pressure units commonly used in environmental assessments, research studies, and textbooks. Acceleration is the time rate of change in the velocity of a \ufb02uid particle. In terms of calculus,d it is a second derivative. That is, it is the derivative of the velocity function. Since the derivative of a function is itself a function, this indicates a \ufb02uid\u2019s rate of change. This explains why the second derivative must be a function showing the rate of change of the rate of change. This is obvious when one looks at the units of acceleration: length per time per time (m s 2) (See Example Box: Fluid Acceleration). EXAMPLE BOX: FLUID ACCELERATION Consider a \ufb02uid is moving at the constant velocity of 4m s 1. What is the rate of change of the velocity? What is the second derivative of the \ufb02uid\u2019s movement? Solution and Discussion The function s \u00bcf(t) shows the distance the \ufb02uid has moved (s) after t seconds. If the \ufb02uid is traveling at 4m s 1, then it must travel 4 m for each second, or 4t meters after t seconds. The rate of change of distance (how fast the distance is changing) is the speed. We know that thisis4ms 1.So: s \u00bcf \u00f0t\u00de\u00bc4t and; ds \u00bcf 0\u00f0t\u00de\u00bc4 dt In acceleration, we are interested in the rate of change of the rate of change. This is the rate of change of the \ufb02uid velocity. Since the \ufb02uid is moving at constant velocity, it is not accelerating. Therefore, acceleration \u00bc0. This is also a way of saying that when one differentiates for a second time (i.e. \ufb01nds the second derivative), the result \u00bczero. d Newton simultaneously invented the calculus with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646e1716) in the seventeenth century. Both are credited with devising the symbolism and the system of rules for computing derivatives and integrals, but their notation and emphases differed. A debate rages on who did what \ufb01rst, but both of these giants had good reason to revise the language of science; i.e. mathematics, to explain motion. 16. SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF AIR POLLUTION In the complexities of any air mass or other \ufb02uid bodies in the environment, the \ufb02uid concepts must be combined to describe \ufb02uid movement. If given the function f(t) as the displacement of a particle in the \ufb02uid at time t, the derivative of this function f0(t) represents the velocity. The second derivative f00(t) represents the acceleration of the particle at time t: s \u00bc f \u00f0t\u00de (16.14) ds v \u00bc \u00bc f 0\u00f0t\u00de dt (16.15) d2 s \u00bc f 00\u00f0t\u00de a \u00bc (16.16) dt2 If the derivative is zero, the function is \ufb02at and must therefore reside where the graph is turning. We are able to identify the turning points of a function by differentiating and setting the derivative equal to zero. Turning points may be of three types: minima (Figure 16.6A), maxima (Figure 16.6B), and points of in\ufb02exion (Figure 16.6C). The graph shows how the derivatives are changing around each of these stationary points: Near the point where the derivative is changing from negative to positive, it is increasing. In other words the rate of change in velocity is positive. So, the derivative of the derivative, i.e. second derivative, must be positive. When the second derivative is positive at a given turning point, this is the minimum point. Likewise, at the maximum negative to positive means that the derivative is decreasing, i.e. the rate of change is negative. This means when the second derivative is negative at a given turning point, this must be a maximum point. At the in\ufb02ection points, the rate of change is neither positive nor negative, i.e. the rate of change is zero. As discussed in Chapter 2, the relationship between mass and volume is also important in air pollution physics and chemistry. For both the pollutant and the \ufb02uid in which it resides, air pollution estimates and assessments depend on reliable applications of density, speci\ufb01c weight, speci\ufb01c volume, mole fractions, viscosity, and other \ufb02uid properties.", "Standardization is important in air pollution science and engineering, but information is reported in many different formats. In fact, engineers often resist the use of SI units more than their colleagues in the basic sciences. This may, at least in part, be due to the historic inertia of engineering, where many equations were derived from English units. When an equation is based on one set of units and is only reported in those units, it can take much effort to convert them to SI units. Exponents in many environmental equations have been empirically derived from studies wherein English units were applied (See Discussion Box: Units in Handbooks and Reference Manuals). (C)In\ufb02econ points 16.1 MECHANICAL SCALE AND COMPLEXITY UNITS IN HANDBOOKS AND REFERENCE MANUALS Standardization is important in air pollution science and engineering, but in the \u201creal world\u201d, information is reported in many different formats. In fact, engineers seem to resist the use of SI units more than their colleagues in the basic sciences. This may, at least in part, be due to the historic inertia of engineering, where many equations were derived from English units. When an equation is based on one set of units and is only reported in those units, it can take much effort to convert them to SI units. Exponents in many water quality, water supply, and sludge equations have been empirically derived from studies that applied English units. Some equations may use either English or SI units, such as the commonly used HazeneWilliams formula for mean velocity \ufb02ow (v) in pressure pipes is: 0:63$s 0:54 v \u00bc 1:318C$r (16.17) where r is the hydraulic radius in feet or meters, s is the slope of the hydraulic grade line (head divided by length), and C is the friction coef\ufb01cient (a function of pipe roughness). The exponents apply without regard to units. Other formulae, however, require that a speci\ufb01c set of units be used. An example is the fundamental equation for kinetic energy. Two different equations are needed when using either the SI system or the English system, which requires the gravitation conversion constant (gc) in the denominator. These are, respectively: 2 mv Ekinetic \u00bc (16.18) 2 2 mv Ekinetic \u00bc\u00f0in ft lbf\u00de (16.19) 2gc where m is mass and ft-lbf is foot-pound-force. Two other important physical equations, potential en ergy and pressure require the insertion of their denominators: Epotential \u00bc mgz \u00f0in ft gc lbf\u00de (16.20) rgh p \u00bc in ft lbf ft (16.21) gc where g is the gravitational acceleration, r is density, and h is the height. With this in mind, it is sometimes better to simply apply the formulae using English units and convert to metric or SI units following the calculation. In other words, rather than try to change the exponent or coef\ufb01cient to address the difference in feet and meters, just use the units called for in the empirically derived equation. After completing the calculation, convert the answer to the correct units. This may seem contrary to the need to standardize units, but it may save time and effort in the long run. Either way, it is mathematically acceptable dimension analysis. Another variation in units is how coef\ufb01cients and constants are reported. For example, the octanolewater coef\ufb01cient seems to be reported more often as log Kow than simply as Kow. This is usually because the ranges of Kow values can be so large. One compound may have a coef\ufb01cient of 0.001, while another has one of 1000. Thus, it may be more manageable to report the log Kow values as 3 and 3, respectively. Further, chemists and engineers are comfortable with the \u201cp\u201d notation as a representative of the negative log. This could be because pH and pOH are common parameters. So, one may see the negative logarithm used with units in handbooks. For example, vapor pressure is sometimes reported as a negative log. Therefore, examples and problems in handbooks and reference manuals make use of several different units as they are encountered in the environmental literature. Speci\ufb01c volume The reciprocal of a substance\u2019s density is known as its speci\ufb01c volume (y). This is the volume occupied by a unit mass of a \ufb02uid. The units of y are reciprocal density units (m3 kg 1). Stated mathematically, this is: 1 y \u00bc r (16.22) Speci\ufb01c weight As discussed in Chapter 1, the weight of a \ufb02uid per its volume is known as speci\ufb01c weight (g). Civil engineers sometimes use the term interchangeably with density.", "A substance\u2019s g is not an absolute \ufb02uid property because it depends on the \ufb02uid itself and the local gravitational force: g \u00bc gr (16.23) The units are the same as those for density; e.g. kg m 3 . Mole Fraction In a composition of a \ufb02uid made up of two or more substances (A, B, C, .), the mole fraction III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16. SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF AIR POLLUTION (xA, xB, xC, .) is the number of moles of each substance divided by the total number of moles for the whole \ufb02uid: nA xA \u00bc (16.24) nA \u00fe nB \u00fe nC \u00fe . The mole fraction value is always between 0 and 1. The mole fraction may be converted to mole percent as: xA% \u00bc xA 100 (16.25) For gases, the mole fraction is the same as the volumetric fraction of each gas in a mixture of more than one gas. in the liquid surface normal to a line of unit length drawn in the surface. Surface tension decreases with temperature and depends on the contact \ufb02uid. Surface tension is involved in capillary rise and drop. Water has a very high s value (approximately 0.07 N m 2 at 200 C). Of the environmental \ufb02uids, only mercury has a higher s (Table 16.2). The high surface tension creates a type of skin on a free surface, which is how an object more dense than water (e.g. a steel needle) can \u201c\ufb02oat\u201d on a still water surface. It is the reason insects can sit comfortably on water surfaces. Surface tension is somewhat dependent on the MOLE FRACTION EXAMPLE A total of 112 g of MgCl2 is dissolved in 1 l of water. The density of this solution is 1.089 g cm 3. What is the mole fraction of MgCl2 in the solution at standard temperature and pressure. Solution The number of moles of MgCl2 is determined from its molecular weight: 112 g \u00bc 1:18 mol 95:22 g Next, we calculate the number of moles of water: Mass of water \u00bc 1.00l (1000cm 3l 1) (1.00 g cm 3) \u00bc 1000 g water and 1000 g Moles of water \u00bc\u00bc 55:49 mol 18:02gmol 1 1:18 mol Thus, xMgCl \u00bc\u00bc 0:021: 2 55:49 \u00fe 1:18 The mol% of MgCl2 is 2.1%. Compressibility The fractional change in a \ufb02uid\u2019s volume per unit change in pressure at constant temperature is the \ufb02uid\u2019s coef\ufb01cient of compressibility. Gases, like air are quite compressible. That is, gases have large variations in density (r), much larger than in liquids. However, any \ufb02uid can be compressed in response to the application of pressure (p). For example, water\u2019s compressibility at 1 atm is 4.9 10 5 atm 1. This compares to the lesser compressibility of mercury gas that is contacting the free surface. If not indicated, it is usually safe to assume that the gas is the air in the troposphere. dp (3.9 10 6 atm 1) and the much greater compressibility of hydrogen (1.6 10 3 atm 1). A \ufb02uid\u2019s bulk modulus, E (analogous to the modulus of elasticity in solids) is a function of stress and strain on the \ufb02uid (Figure 16.7), and is a description of its compressibility. It is de\ufb01ned according to the \ufb02uid volume (V): Stress p F/A V1 stress dp E E \u00bc\u00bc (16.26) 1 strain dV=V1 E is expressed in units of pressure (e.g. kPa).

Surface tension, s, is the force of \ufb02uids. III.

Capillarity is also an important factor in physiological response to air pollutants. For example, morphological changes have been observed in lung tissue exposed to ozone. These changes, in part, are due to ozone\u2019s effect on the alveolar capillaries and the degradation of capillary endothelia.", "This leads to less ef\ufb01cient oxygen exchange between the inhaled air and blood, which in turn leads to respiratory and cardiovascular stress. Capillary rise occurs for two reasons, its adhesion to a surface, plus the cohesion of water molecules to one another. Higher relative surface tension causes a \ufb02uid to rise in a tube (or a pore) that is indirectly 16.1 MECHANICAL SCALE AND COMPLEXITY Unconfined water level FIGURE 16.8 Capillary rise of water with respect to diameter of conduit. proportional to the diameter of the tube. In other words, capillarity is greater the smaller the inside diameter of the tube (Figure 16.8). The rise is limited by the weight of the \ufb02uid in the tube. The rise (hcapillary) of the \ufb02uid in a capillary is expressed as (Figure 16.9 displays the variables): 2s cos l hcapillary \u00bc rgRw (16.27) where s is the \ufb02uid surface tension (g s 2), l is the angle of meniscus (concavity of \ufb02uid) in capillary (degrees), rw is the \ufb02uid density (g cm 3), g is the gravitational acceleration (cm s 1), and R is the radius of capillary (cm). The contact angle indicates whether cohesive or adhesive forces are dominant in the capillarity. When l values are greater than 90 , cohesive forces are dominant; when l < 90 , adhesive forces dominate. Thus, l is dependent on both the type of \ufb02uid and the surface to which it comes into contact. For example, watereglass l \u00bc 0, ethanoleglass l \u00bc 0, glycerineglass l \u00bc 19, kerosenee glass l \u00bc 26, watereparaf\ufb01n l \u00bc 107, and mercuryeglass l \u00bc 140. CAPILLARITY EXAMPLE What is the rise of contaminated water (i.e. a solution of water and soluble and insoluble contaminants) in a sorption material used to collect gaseous air pollutants that has an average pore space diameter of 0.1 cm, at 18 C and a density of 0.999 g cm 3, under surface tension of 50 g s 1 if the angle of contact of the meniscus is 30 ? What would happen if the average pore space were 0.01 cm, with all other variables remaining as stated? Answer If the pore space were 0.01 cm in diameter, the rise would be 2.5 cm. However, it is likely that the angle of contact would have also decreased since the angle is in\ufb02uenced by the diameter of the column (approaching zero with decreasing diameter). Also note that since the solution is not 100% water, the curvature of the meniscus will be different, so the contact angle l will likely be greater (i.e. less curvature) than the meniscus of water alone. The lower surface tension of the mixture also means that the capillary rise will be less. 2s cos l 2 80 cos 30 hcapillary \u00bc\u00bc cmy0:25 cm r gR 0:999 980 0:05 w III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16. SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF AIR POLLUTION Viscosity How much a \ufb02uid resists \ufb02ow when it is acted on by an external force, especially a pressure differential or gravity, is the \ufb02uid\u2019s viscosity. This is a crucial \ufb02uid property used in numerous environmental applications, including air pollution plume characterization. Recall from Bernoulli\u2019s Eqn (16.10) and Figure 16.4 that if a \ufb02uid is \ufb02owing in a long, horizontal conduit with constant cross-sectional area, the pressure along the pipe must be constant. But why if we measure the pressure as the \ufb02uid moves in the conduit, would there be a pressure drop? A pressure difference is needed to push the \ufb02uid through the conduit to overcome the drag force exerted by the conduit walls on the layer of \ufb02uid that is making contact with the walls. Since the drag force exerted by each successive layer of the \ufb02uid on each adjacent layer that is moving at its own velocity, then a pressure difference is needed (Figure 16.10). The drag forces are known as viscous forces. Thus, the \ufb02uid velocity is not constant across the conduit\u2019s diameter, owing to the viscous forces. The greatest velocity is at the center (furthest away from the walls), and the lowest velocity is found at the walls. In fact, at the point of contact with walls, the \ufb02uid velocity is zero.", "So, if P1 is the pressure at point 1, and P2 is the pressure at point 2, with the two points separated by distance L, the pressure drop (DP) is proportional to the \ufb02ow rate: DP \u00bc P1 P2 (16.28) and DP \u00bc P1 P2 \u00bc IvR (16.29) where Iv is the volume \ufb02ow rate, and R is the proportionality constant representing the resistance to the \ufb02ow. This resistance R depends on the length (L) of pipe section, the pipe\u2019s radius, and the \ufb02uid\u2019s viscosity. Two types of viscosity are important in air pollution: absolute viscosity and kinematic viscosity. VISCOSITY EXAMPLE 1 Workers are being exposed to an air pollutant known to decrease blood pressure in the capillaries, small arteries, and major arteries and veins after the blood is pumped from the aorta. If high-dose studies show an acute drop in the gage pressure of the circulatory system from 100 to 0 torr at a volume \ufb02ow of 0.7 l s 1, given the total resistance of the circulatory system.

The absolute viscosity of a \ufb02uid can be measured by a number of ways, but engineers commonly use the sliding plate viscometer test. The test applies two plates separated by the \ufb02uid to be measured (Figure 16.11). For Newtonian \ufb02uids, the force applied in the viscometer test has been found to be in direct proportion to the velocity of the moving plate and inversely proportional to the length of separation of the two plates: F dv f A dy (16.30) Using a constant this proportionality can become an equality: F dv \u00bc m (16.31) A dy This equation is known as Newton\u2019s law of viscosity. Fluids that conform to this law are referred to as Newtonian \ufb02uids.e The constant, m, is the \ufb02uid\u2019s absolute viscosity. The m is also known as the coef\ufb01cient of viscosity, but environmental texts often refer to m as dynamic viscosity. The term \ufb02uidity is the reciprocal of dynamic velocity. The inverse relationship between viscosity and \ufb02uidity should make sense after some thought. Since the de\ufb01nition of viscosity is the resistance to \ufb02ow when an external force is applied, then it makes sense that if a substance does a poor job resisting the \ufb02ow, Moving plate (where, v0) F Stationary plate (where, v 0) FIGURE 16.11 The sliding plate viscometer.

Civil engineering reference manual for the PE exam. 8th ed. Belmont (CA): Professional Publications, Inc.; 2001. the substance must have a lot of \ufb02uidity. An electrical analogy might be that of conductivity and resistance. If copper wire has much less resistance to electrical \ufb02ow than does latex rubber, we say that copper must be a good conductor. Likewise, if water at 35 Cis less effective at resisting \ufb02ow downhill (i.e. gravity is applying our force) than is motor oil at the same temperature, we say that the water has less dynamic viscosity than the motor oil. And, we also say that the water has more \ufb02uidity than the oil. Before the modern blends of multiviscosity motor oils, the temperatureeviscosity relationship was part of the seasonal rituals of the oil change. Less viscous motor oil (e.g. 10 W) had to used in a car\u2019s engine to prepare for the lower temperatures in winter, so that the starter could \u201cturn over\u201d the engine (less viscous oil \u00bc less resistance the force of the starter moving the pistons). Conversely, in preparing for summer, a higher viscosity motor oil (commonly 40 W)f would be used because the high temperatures in the engine would allow the oil to \u201cblow out\u201d through the piston rings or elsewhere (because the oil was not doing a good job of resisting the force applied by the pistons and shot out of the engine). The newer oil formulations (e.g. 10e40 W) maintain a smaller range of viscosities, so automobile owners worry less about the viscosity.", "The F/A term is known as the shear stress, s, of the \ufb02uid. The dv/dy term is known as the velocity gradient or the rate of shear formation.g So, the shear stress is linear; e See discussion of Newtonian and non-Newtonian \ufb02uids earlier in this chapter. f In the 1960s, many of us went further. We used 50 W or even higher viscosity racing formulas even if we never really allowed our cars to ever reach racing temperatures! We often applied the same logic for slicks, glass packs, four-barrel carburetors, and other racing equipment that was really never needed, but looked and sounded awesome! g1 The dv dy term is also known as the rate of strain and the shear rate.

Most \ufb02uids encountered in environmental studies are Newtonian, including water, all gases, alcohols, and most solvents. Most solutions also behave as Newtonian \ufb02uids. Slurries, muds, motor grease and oils, and many polymers behave has pseudoplastic \ufb02uids; i.e. viscosities decrease with increasing velocity gradient. They are easily pumped, since higher pumping rates lead to a less viscous \ufb02uid. Some slurries behave as Bingham \ufb02uids (e.g. behave like toothpaste or bread dough), where the shear formation is resisted up to a point. For example, depending on their chemical composition, slurries used in wet scrubbers to collect gases (e.g. sulfur dioxide) may behave as Bingham \ufb02uids. The rare dilatant \ufb02uids are sometimes encountered in environmental engineering applications, such as clay slurries used as land\ufb01ll liners and when starches and certain paints and coatings are spilled. These can be dif\ufb01cult \ufb02uids to remove and clean up, since their viscosities increase with increasing velocity gradient, so pumping these \ufb02uids at higher rates can lead to their becoming almost solid with a suf\ufb01ciently high shear rate. Plastic \ufb02uids (Figure 16.13) require the application of a \ufb01nite force before any \ufb02uid movement. Categorizing and characterizing \ufb02uids according to their behavior under shear stress and velocity gradient is not absolute. For example, a Bingham \ufb02uid can resist shear stresses inde\ufb01nitely so long as they are small, but these \ufb02uids will become pseudoplastic at higher Dilatant fluid Newtonian fluid Pseudoplastic fluid Plastic fluid FIGURE 16.13 Hypothetical \ufb02uid types according to viscosity (m) and shear rate (velocity).

Even if all conditions remain constant, viscosity can also change with time. A rheopectic \ufb02uid is one where viscosity increases with time, and a thixotropic \ufb02uid is one that has decreasing viscosity with time. Those \ufb02uids that do not change with time are referred to as time-independent \ufb02uids. Colloidal materials, like certain components of sludges, sediments, and soils, act like thixotropic \ufb02uids. That is, they experience a decrease in viscosity when the shear is increased. However, there is no hysteresis, meaning that the viscosity does not return to the original state with the ceasing of the agitation. There is a seeming paradox between viscosity and temperature. As a general rule, temperature is inversely proportional to viscosity of liquids, but temperature is directly proportional to the viscosity of gases. Viscosity of liquids is predominantly caused by molecular cohesion. These cohesive forces decrease with increasing temperature, which is why viscosity decreases with increasing temperature. Gas viscosity is mainly kinetic molecular in its origin, so increasing temperature means that more collisions will occur between molecules. The more the gas is agitated, the greater the viscosity, so gas velocity increases with increasing temperatures. The viscosity of liquids increases only slightly with increasing pressure. Under environmental conditions, absolute viscosity can be considered to be independent of pressure. Absolute viscosity units are mass per length per time (e.g. g cm 1 s 1). The coef\ufb01cients for some common \ufb02uids are provided in Table 16.3. Note the importance of temperature in a substance\u2019s absolute viscosity, e.g. the several orders of magnitude decrease with only a 20 C increase in glycerin.

Recall that absolute viscosity is only slightly affected by pressure. Table 16.4 can be used to convert most of the units of m and n. Laminar versus Turbulent Flow: The Reynolds Number At a suf\ufb01ciently high velocity, a \ufb02uid\u2019s \ufb02ow ceases to be laminar and becomes turbulent. A dimensionless Reynolds number (NR) is used to differentiate types of \ufb02ow. The NR is expressed as the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in a \ufb02uid: Inertial forces NR \u00bc (16.34) Viscous forces The inertial forces are proportional to the velocity and density of the \ufb02uid, as well as to the diameter of the conduit in which the \ufb02uid is moving. An increase in any of these factors will lead to a proportional increase in the momentum of the \ufb02owing \ufb02uid. We know from our previous discussion that the coef\ufb01cient of viscosity or absolute viscosity (m) represents the total viscous force of the \ufb02uid, so, NR can be calculated as: Devr NR \u00bc (16.35) m where De is the conduit\u2019s equivalent diameter, which is a so-called \u201ccharacteristic dimension\u201dh which evaluates the \ufb02uid \ufb02ow as a physical length. It is actually the inside diameter (i.d.) of the conduit, vent, or pipe. Recall that mr 1 is the kinematic viscosity y, so the Reynolds number can be stated as the relationship between the size of the conduit, the average \ufb02uid velocity n, and y: Den NR \u00bc (16.36) y When \ufb02uids move at very low velocities, the bulk material moves in discrete layers parallel to one another. The only movement across the \ufb02uid layers is molecular h Other equivalent diameters for fully \ufb02owing conduits are the annulus, square, and rectangle. Equivalent diameters for partial \ufb02ows in conduits are the half-\ufb01lled circle, rectangle, wide and shallow stream, and trapezoid.

Such a \ufb02ow is laminar (Figure 16.14).

Conduit Conduit dimensional mixing across the \ufb02ow stream. This is known as turbulent \ufb02ow. Most pollution control equipment and atmospheric plumes are subjected to turbulent \ufb02ow (Figure 16.15). Flows in closed conduits with Reynolds numbers under 2100 are usually laminar.i Due to the relatively low velocities associated with this type of \ufb02ow, they are mainly encountered with liquids such as water moving through underground strata and blood \ufb02owing in arteries. In open atmospheric conditions, such as a plume of an air pollutant, laminar \ufb02ow is quite rare. Flows with Reynolds numbers greater than 4000 are usually turbulent. The range of NR values between these thresholds are considered \u201ccritical \ufb02ows\u201d or \u201ctransitional \ufb02ows\u201d, that show properties of both laminar and turbulent \ufb02ow in the \ufb02ow streams. Usually, if the \ufb02ow is in the transition region, engineers will design equipment as if the \ufb02ow were turbulent, as this is the most conservative design assumption. Under laminar conditions, the \ufb02uid particles adhere to the conduit wall. The closer to the wall that a particle gets, the more likely it will adhere to the wall. Laminar \ufb02ow is, therefore, parabolic and its velocity at the conduit wall is zero (Figure 16.14). Laminar \ufb02ow velocity is greatest at the pipe\u2019s center (vmax in the Figure 16.16), and is twice the value of the average velocity, vaverage: _ V vaverage \u00bc\u00bc vmax \u00f0laminar\u00de (16.37) A 2 i The literature is not consistent on the exact Reynolds numbers as thresholds for laminar versus turbulent \ufb02ow.

Assuming this \ufb02ow is representative of a cooling tower in a power plant, what kind of \ufb02ow should be assumed in selecting pumps and other equipment? Describe the difference in \ufb02ow if, rather than a cooling tower, the \ufb02ow would be from a wet scrubber system. Solution Since the NR is greater than 2100, but less than 4000, the \ufb02ow is considered transitional or critical. Therefore, the conservative design calls for an assumption that the \ufb02ow is turbulent. If the \ufb02ow were from a scrubber, this would likely have much higher suspended solids and may in some cases become non-Newtonian. So, not only would the Reynolds number likely greatly decrease (i.e. laminar \ufb02ow more likely with low velocity and high viscosity), but the characteristics of the \ufb02uid would also change if the \ufb02ow were non-Newtonian. This is because the viscosities are not constant at all shear rates in non-Newtonian \ufb02uids. The fundamental \ufb02uid properties and physical principles discussed in this chapter are important in all environmental sciences. In Chapters 30 and 31, we will extend these and other physical concepts speci\ufb01cally to carrier gases and removal of pollutants before they reach the atmosphere. 16.

Cellular processes have been described in Part II. This section brie\ufb02y considers the various types of variability and uncertainty of air pollution from the individual person to globe.", "Variability describes the inherent heterogeneity across space, in time, or among individuals, which cannot be reduced with additional investigation, but only better understood or characterized.1 In air pollution, variability exists at every scale regarding the amount and type of pollutant released, the transport, transformation and fate of the pollutant, the potential exposures to the pollutant, and possible outcomes resulting from contact with the pollutant for numerous receptors and their speci\ufb01c characteristics (e.g. demographic and socioeconomic status for human populations; biological organization and trophic status for ecosystems) or activities (e.g. the amount of water or \ufb01sh consumed on a daily basis, residence in geographic areas). Variability affects the precision of estimates of air pollution quantities and location, as well as the degree to which results may be generalized. Examples of the kinds of air pollution variability include human (intra-and interindividual), ecosystem (predatoreprey, productivity and diversity), which includes both spatial and temporal variabilities. Human variability describes person-to-person differences in biological susceptibility, exposure, and effects from contact with air pollutants. Also, species and subspecies (e.g. polymorphisms) of organisms vary in their response to pollutants. This makes for dif\ufb01culties in extrapolating results from animal studies to humans (both cancer and noncancer), as well as extrapolating the condition of an ecosystem from the condition of just a few species in that system. Thus, variability may be both intraspecies and interspecies. Human populations have intra-and interindividual variability. Intra-individual variability refers to the changes that occur in one person over time. These changes can be physiological (e.g. body weight, age, and cognitive function) or behavioral (e.g. ingestion rates and activity patterns). The distinction between physiological and behavioral is somewhat arbitrary. For example, breathing rate may change physiological with aging or disease status, or because a person has changed activities (e.g. a less active job). Interindividual variability refers to the differences among individuals within a population; whereas intraindividual variability can arise from differences in physiological or behavioral characteristics. Accuracy is an expression of the agreement between a measured or modeled value and the true value. Error is the difference between a measured or modeled quantity and the true value. Thus, accuracy decreases with error, which is mainly comprised of systematic and random error. These and other sources of error are described in Table 16.5. 16.3 AIR POLLUTION SCALES IN SPACE AND TIME Air pollution varies spatially and temporally, i.e. in space and time, respectively. Spatial variability can occur at regional, local, neighborhood, microenvironmental, and personal scales. For example, inhalation rates vary somewhat from one city to the next and certainly vary with latitude (e.g. different outdoor activities in Northern latitudes than in the Tropics). Temporal variability occurs over large time horizons, from very long or to very short periods. For example, a change in outdoor exercise can occur seasonally or even daily, depending on weather conditions. Such season variability is known as intra-annual variability. Air pollution studies address the pollutant source, exposed population (e.g. infants and pregnant women), time frame of exposure, routes and pathways of exposure, microenvironment, and activities. A person is exposed to pollutants continuously, with exposures varying according to activities and locations. The phenomenon known as \u201cpersonal cloud\u201d suggests a unique atmosphere surrounding the individual. The cloud indicates an increased personal exposure to air pollutants compared to indoor concentrations, or compared to the time-weighted indoor and outdoor concentrations (Figure 16.17). Results from several recent studies suggest that a number of factors, such as relative humidity and ventilation, may lead to very different exposures based on personal measurements versus ambient concentrations of air pollutants. 16.3.1 Personal Scale With personal monitoring, the monitoring device is worn by individuals as they proceed through their normal activities. This approach is most common in workplaces. The radioactivity sensors worn by nuclear power plant workers are one example. Personal monitoring is increasingly being used, however, to estimate total human exposures, including exposures from the air people breathe, the water they drink, and the food they eat.1 One advantage of personal monitoring is that the data provide valuable insights into the sources of the pollutants to which people are actually exposed. A challenge with personal monitoring is ensuring that suf\ufb01cient sampling is done to be representative of the population being studied.

SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF AIR POLLUTION FIGURE 16.17 Various scales of air pollution that contribute to personal exposures. A person spends varying amounts of time indoors and outdoors in numerous locations. Each has its own unique exposure pro\ufb01le due to varying airborne concentrations of pollutants and time spent in each microenvironment. In addition, unique characteristics of the person and activity, e.g. breathing rate, also change the amount of pollutant absorbed, which leads to a unique dose of the pollutant. (For color version of this \ufb01gure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book.) Ozkaynak H. Case study applications of human exposure models. Eurotox 2009 conference, WHO/IPCS CEC6 exposure assessment course. Dresden, Germany; September 13, 2009. Sampling the amount of pollutant near or within a person, e.g. using personal monitors and biomarkers, is known as a direct measurement. Use of models, microenvironmental measurements, and questionnaires, where measurements do not actually involve personal measurements, are examples of indirect methods of determining personal exposures to air pollutants. The direct/indirect nomenclature focuses on the type of measurements being made; the scenario evaluation/point-of-contact/reconstruction nomenclature focuses on how the data are used to develop the dose estimate. The three-term nomenclature is used in these guidelines to highlight the point that three independent estimates of dose can be developed. As discussed in Chapter 8, there is seldom a suf\ufb01cient amount of direct information from measurements to estimate and to predict exposures for a population. Thus, indirect methods must be used.", "Personal exposure2a,b can be expressed mathematically as a composite of the time in a microenvironment (e.g. in a garage, indoors at home, or in a car) and the concentration of the pollutant in that microenvironment: m Ei \u00bc TijCij (16.39) j\u00bc1 X where Tij is the time spent in microenvironment j by person i with typical units of minutes, Cij is the air pollutant concentration person i experiences in microenvironment j with typical units of mgm 3, Ei represents the exposure for person i integrated Tij,and m is the number of different microenvironments. Thus, the units of exposure are mass per volume-time mgm 3 min 1). Note, then, that exposure is the concentration per unit time. The calculation amounts to a weighted sum of concentrations with the weights being equal to the time spent experiencing a given concentration. What people are doing is crucial to modeling their exposure to air pollutants. To support exposure, intake dose, and risk assessments, the EPA developed the Consolidated Human Activity Database (CHAD). CHAD is a relational database with a graphical user interface that facilitates queries and report generation.3 It contains databases from previously existing human activity pattern studies, which were incorporated in two forms: (1) as the original raw data and (2) as data modi\ufb01ed according to prede\ufb01ned format requirements. CHAD contains data obtained from pre-existing human activity studies that were collected at city, state, and national levels. People\u2019s diary information is input to CHAD. Figure 16.18 and Tables 16.6 and 16.7 provide the structure and data elements of CHAD. Most of the \ufb01elds are answers from the questionnaire. Some \ufb01elds vary from day to day for an individual and \ufb01elds based on the diary entries will most likely be different for each day. The CHAD_Diary table contains one record for each activity during a 24-h period. No record represents more than an hour or crosses the hour boundary. The minimal information in the diary data is the CHADID which links to the CHAD_DATA, a sequence number, which indicates the order of the records in a day, start, end, and duration times, and an activity and location.

Thus, if we measure concentrations with personal and indoor air pollution monitors and we apply activity patterns, such as those in CHAD, we can estimate and predict personal exposures to numerous pollutants. Obviously the mean personal exposure can be expressed in concentration units (mgm 3) by dividing Ei by the total time spent in each microenvironment and summing these exposures.

The concentrations can be measured using a real-time personal monitoring device. These data are not actually continuous, but can be quite frequent (e.g. every few seconds). Other times, fully continuous space is not assumed, which means that discrete microenvironments are used. If this is the case the equation appears as III.

For air pollutants, the microenvironment can be any air volume (e.g. home, of\ufb01ce or vehicle) that is assumed to be suf\ufb01ciently homogeneous and characterized in the concentrations of an air pollutant. Persons can be exposed to harmful substances in the air that they breathe, the food that ingest and products that they use (Figure 16.20). Indeed, at the microenvironmental scale, inhalation is not the only pathway of exposure, since air pollutants may settle on surfaces (e.g. \ufb02oors, furniture, and food). Thus, even for a pollutant that enters the microenvironment via the air, in addition to the inhalation and nasal routes, the route of exposure may be dermal or ingestion. j\u00bc1 The source of microenvironmental exposures may be at a distance (e.g. the home is in the plume of pollutants where m is the number of microenvironments encounreleased upwind). However, many microenvironmental tered, Cj is the average pollutant concentration in exposures are generated with the microenvironment E is (e.g. smoking, use of personal care products, and the integrated exposure over all members of the popula applying pesticides).

This can be further simpli\ufb01ed if we assume that each person spends the same total amount of time across all microenvironments: m T \u00bc Ti \u00bc Tij (16.44) j\u00bc1 X Further, if the time spent by certain individuals in particular microenvironments is zero, then the average personal exposure \u00f0E\u00de for the population would be m X 1 Ec Cj (16.45) transport and transformation in the various compartments before \ufb01nally arriving in the microenvironment.", "Actual measurements within microenvironments are much more frequently conducted in occupational settings than in residential and other environmental settings. Thus, many microenvironmental pollution exposure estimates are based on indirect information, such as biomarkers. For example, in an occupational setting the amount of lead (Pb) in the air may well be measured using sampling equipment. However, in a residential setting, Pb exposures may have to be reconstructed from biomarker data and epidemiology, e.g. blood Pb from health clinics. The estimates would be based on as ~ Tj j\u00bc1 sumptions about breathing rates and activities (e.g. the amount of time spent in each microenvironment), com nT Therefore, timeeactivity relationships and concentrations can be used to model expected exposures to air pollutants. Indoor and personal exposures can dominate exposures to many pollutants. For example, Figure 16.19 shows the modeled results of expected exposures to particulates (PM2.5) for a simulated population based on available measurements of ambient, indoor, and personal measurements, combined with information about microenvironments (e.g. types and time in each) and activities. Note that ambient contribution is quite small compared to personal and indoor exposures.4 bined with pharmacokinetics (e.g. how much of the Pb is expected to be in a child\u2019s blood given assumptions about intake, uptake, adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination). For example, if a child\u2019s blood concentration of contaminant A is 10 mgdl 1, the model may include average diary or the CHAD database mentioned previously to make assumptions about the respective time spent in each microenvironment. If the pharmacokinetics model indicates that 1 mgdl 1 of contaminant A in the blood relates to a concentration of 0.3 mgm 3 of contaminant A in the air, then III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16.

Next, each microenvironment would have to be considered. For example, if the child spent 2 h each day outdoors, but there appears to be no outdoor source of contaminant A nearby, those 2 h may be dropped from the daily exposure, i.e. the other 22 h in other microenvironments must account the blood levels. Other microenvironments may be eliminated in the same way. Those contaminated microenvironments would be 3 mgm that are left must account for the exposures. For example, if the likely microenvironments represent only 8 h per day, the extrapolated concentration in 3 3 \u00bc 9 mgm 3. Note that the uncertainties are built into these models, e.g. blood and urine may be reliable biomarkers for less persistent compounds, since they may be sequestered and better represented in fatty tissue, hair or nails. However, the choice of biomarkers is complicated, so rules of thumb are not very useful. Each biomarker must be selected based on characteristics of the parent pollutant, the pharmacokinetics speci\ufb01c to each stratum of the population to which it will be applied, e.g. children will have very different pharmacokinetics than adults, and the reliability of the algorithms and assumptions of the model being used. When they are taken, actual microenvironmental measurements must be taken from speci\ufb01c zones expected to be relatively homogeneous and amenable to characterizing the conditions in that zone. Microenvironments may be further divided into time segments (e.g. kitchen-day, kitchen-night). This can produce measurements closely linked to the point of human contact in both location and time. Such studies represent a very limited environment, however, so care must be applied when attempting to use these measurements to represent a population of interest beyond the individuals spending time in the speci\ufb01c microenvironment in which air pollution measurements have been taken. 16.3.3 Ambient Scale Most environmental air quality regulations apply to ambient air concentrations of pollutants.

The divisions within ambient air are arbitrary and pollutant dependent. For example, carbon monoxide is more localized in extent than is ozone and photochemical oxidant smog. 16.3.3.1 Local Local air pollution problems are usually characterized by one or several large emitters or a large number of relatively small emitters. The potential impact on nearby receptors increases with decreasing height of release. Carbon monoxide, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene emitted from motor vehicles lead to high concentrations near roadway, for example. Any ground-level source, such as evaporation of volatile organic compounds from a waste treatment pond, will produce the highest concentrations near the source, with concentrations generally diminishing with distance. This is a local example of a concentration gradient. Large sources that emit high above the ground through stacks, such as those in power plants or industrial sources, can also cause local problems, especially under unstable meteorological conditions that cause portions of the plume to reach the ground in high concentrations. In urban setting around the world, pollutants are frequently and continuously emitted from relatively short stacks or vents on the top of one-or two-story buildings. Under most conditions such releases are caught within the turbulent downwash downwind of the building. This allows high concentrations to be brought to the ground surface. Many different pollutants can be released in this manner, including compounds and mixtures that can cause odors. The modeling of the transport and dispersion of pollutants on this scale is discussed in Chapter 27. Usually, the most acute effects of accidental releases are at the local scale. For example, a \ufb01re, derailed rail car leak, or an industrial accident usually requires III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16. SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF AIR POLLUTION evacuation from within a local area. Indeed, guidelines are given for \ufb01rst responders on the recommended distances for such evacuations. Even for a highly toxic substance, the areas are generally at the neighborhood scale. For example, in the United States, the initial isolation and protective distances following a chlorine gas (Cl2) leak are5: \u0081 If a tank, rail car, or tank truck is involved in a \ufb01re, isolate it for 0.5 mi (800 m) in all directions; also consider initial evacuation for 0.5 mi (800 m) in all directions. \u0081 Small spills (involving the release of approximately 52.83 gallons (200 l) or less) \u0081 First isolate in all directions: 100 ft (30 m). \u0081 Then protect persons downwind during the day: 0.2 mi (0.2 km). \u0081 Then protect persons downwind during the night: 0.8 mi (1.2 km). \u0081 Large spills (involving quantities greater than 52.83 gallons (200 l)) \u0081 First isolate in all directions: 800 ft (240 m). \u0081 Then protect persons downwind during the day: 1.5 mi (2.4 km). \u0081 Then protect persons downwind during the night: 4.6 mi (7.4 km). 16.3.3.2 Urban Air pollution problems in urban areas generally are of two types. One is the release of primary pollutants (those released directly from sources). The other is the formation of secondary pollutants (those that are formed through chemical reactions of the primary pollutants). Air pollution problems can be caused by individual sources on the urban scale as well as the local scale. For pollutants that are relatively nonreactive, such as carbon monoxide and particulate matter,j or relatively slowly reactive, such as sulfur dioxide, the contributions from individual sources combine to yield high concentrations. Since a major source of carbon monoxide is motor vehicles, \u201chot spots\u201d of high concentration can occur especially near multilane intersections. The emissions are especially high from idling vehicles. The hot spots are exacerbated if high buildings surround the intersection, since the volume of air in which the pollution is contained is severely restricted. The combination of these factors results in high concentrations. Tropospheric ozone is the dominant urban problem resulting from the formation of secondary pollutants. Many large metropolitan areas experience the formation of ozone from photochemical reactions of oxides of nitrogen and various species of hydrocarbons. These reactions are catalyzed by the ultraviolet light in sunlight and are therefore called photochemical reactions. Many metropolitan areas are in nonattainment for ozone; that is, they are not meeting the air quality standards. The Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 recognized this as a major problem and have classi\ufb01ed the various metropolitan areas to be in non-attainment according to the severity of the problem for that area.", "The CAAA sets timetables for the various classi\ufb01cations for reaching attainment with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Oxides of nitrogen, principally nitric oxide (NO) but also nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are emitted from automobiles and from combustion processes. Hydrocarbons are emitted from many different sources. The various species have widely varying reactivities. Determining the emissions of these chemical species from myriad sources as a basis for pollution control programs can be dif\ufb01cult, but methods continue to improve. These and other aspects of atmospheric chemistry are discussed in Chapters 17 and 18. 16.3.3.3 Regional At least three types of problems contribute to air pollution problems on the regional scale. The \ufb01rst is the blend of urban oxidant problems at the regional scale. Many major metropolitan are in close proximity to one another and continue to grow. Urban geographers refer to some of the larger urban aggregations as \u201cmegalopolises\u201d. As a result, the air from one metropolitan area, containing both secondary pollutants formed through reactions and primary pollutants, \ufb02ows on to the adjacent metropolitan area. The pollutants from the second area are then added on top of the \u201cbackground\u201d from the \ufb01rst. A second type of problem is the release of relatively slow-reacting primary air pollutants that undergo reactions and transformations during lengthy transport times. A common occurrence in environmental engineering is the direct relationship between time, spatial coverage, and chemical transformation. Thus, these protracted transport times result in transport distances over regional scales not only of the parent compounds but of numerous transformation byproducts. The gas, sulfur dioxide (SO2), released primarily through combustion of fossil fuels (especially from coal and oil) is oxidized during long-distance transport to sulfur trioxide (SO3): 2SO2 \u00fe O2/2SO3 (16.46) j Fate may also include some remediation reactions, such as thermal and mechanical separation processes, but in discussions of fate and transport, the reactions are usually those that occur in the ambient environment. The treatment and control processes usually fall under the category of environmental engineering. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16.3 AIR POLLUTION SCALES IN SPACE AND TIME Although SO2 is a gas, both gas phase and liquid phase oxidation of SO2 occurs in the troposphere. The SO3 in turn reacts with water vapor to form sulfuric acid: SO3 \u00fe H2O/H2SO4 (16.47) Sulfuric acid in turn reacts with numerous compounds to form sulfates. These are \ufb01ne (submicrometer) particulates. Nitric oxide (NO) results from high-temperature combustion, both in stationary sources such as power plants or industrial plants in the production of process heat and in internal combustion engines in vehicles. The NO is oxidized in the atmosphere, usually rather slowly, or more rapidly if there is ozone present, to nitrogen dioxide (NO2). NO2 also reacts further with other constituents, forming nitrates, which is also in \ufb01ne particulate form. The sulfates and nitrates existing in the atmosphere as \ufb01ne particulates, generally in the size range less than 1 mm, can be removed from the atmosphere by several processes. \u201cRain out\u201d occurs when the particles serve as condensation nuclei that lead to the formation of clouds. The particles are then precipitated if the droplets grow to suf\ufb01cient size to fall as raindrops. Another mechanism, known as \u201cwashout\u201d, also involves rain, but the particles in air are captured by raindrops falling through the air. Both mechanisms contribute to \u201cacid rain\u201d, which results in the sulfate and nitrate particles reaching lakes and streams, and increasing their acidity. As such, acid rain is both a regional and continental problem (see discussion in the next section). A third type of regional problem is visibility, which may be reduced by speci\ufb01c plumes or by the regional levels of particulate matter that produce various intensities of haze. The \ufb01ne sulfate and nitrate particulates just discussed are largely responsible for reduction of visibility (see Chapter 14). This problem is of concern in locations of natural beauty, where it is desirable to keep scenic vistas as free of obstructions to the view as possible. Regional haze is a type of visibility impairment that is caused by the emissions of air pollutants from numerous sources across a broad region. The CAAA provides special protections for such areas; the most restrictive denoted as mandatory Federal Class I areas that cover 156 national parks and wilderness areas. Decreased visibility can also impair safety, especially in aviation. 16.3.3.3 Continental In a relatively small continental area such as Europe, there is little difference between what would be considered regional scale and continental scale. However, on larger continents there would be a substantial difference.", "Perhaps of greatest concern on the continental scale is that the air pollution policies of a nation are likely to create impacts on neighboring nations. Acid rain in Scandinavia has been considered to have had impacts from Great Britain and Western Europe. Japan has considered that part of their air pollution problem, especially in the western part of the country, has origins in China and Korea. For decades, Canada and the United States have cooperated in studying and addressing the North American acid rain problem. Acid rain is a continental and regional air pollution concern, affecting surface waters in large parts of North America and Europe. Actually, precipitation in North America was acidic even before industrialization. This is primarily due to the natural acidity rendered to water by carbon dioxide (CO2). The CO2 gas is dissolved into water droplets in the atmosphere, resulting in carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is ionized. These ions increase the hydrogen ion (H\u00fe) concentration of the water vapor. Since pH is the negative log of the [H\u00fe] concentration,k the pH of the water droplets must fall below neutral, i.e. pH \u00bc 7. Acidic deposition may be wet or dry. Wet deposition refers to acidic rain, fog, and snow. The dry deposition fraction consists of acidic gases or particulates. The severity of ecological effects stemming from acid deposition depends on many factors, especially the strength of the acids and the buffering capacity of the soils and water. Much of the pH reduction occurs as the result of interactions with a few speci\ufb01c air contaminants. For example, sulfur oxides produced in the burning of fossil fuels (especially coal) is a major contributor to low pH in rain. In fact, CO2 is not the principal concern of acid rain. Other processes have led to dramatic increases in droplet acidity, especially sulfuric and nitric acid formation from the ionization of the oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, which further decreases this pH level to those harmful to aquatic organisms. Acid precipitation can result from the emissions of plumes of strong acids, such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4)or hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the forms of acid mists, but most commonly the pH drop is the result of secondary reactions of the acid gases SO2 and NO2.The dominant source of SO2 is emissions from the combustion of fuels containing sulfur. The precipitation from air containing high concentrations of sulfur oxides is poorly buffered and its pH readily drops. Nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and other oxidized forms of nitrogen are emitted from automobile exhaust, and any other high-temperature combustion. These reactions in the atmosphere also contribute to the acid mix in the atmosphere, with the major acid being nitric acid, HNO3. k More accurately, pH is the negative log of the hydronium ion, [H3O2], concentration. III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION 16. SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF AIR POLLUTION The continental impacts include numerous surface water bodies in North America and Scandinavia that have become so acidic that they no longer support \ufb01sh life that was once abundant. In a recent study of Norwegian lakes, more than 70% of the lakes having a pH of less than 4.5 contained no \ufb01sh, and nearly all lakes with a pH of 5.5 and above contained \ufb01sh. The low pH not only affects \ufb01sh directly, but also contributes to the release of potentially toxic metals such as aluminum, thus magnifying the problem. In North America, acidic rain has already decimated the populations of numerous \ufb01sh and many plants in 50% of the high mountain lakes in the Adirondacks. The pH in certain lakes has reached such levels of acidity as to replace the trout and native plants with acid-tolerant rough \ufb01sh species and mats of algae. The United States\u2019 recommended a deposition limit has ranged from 10 to 20 kg SO2 per hectare per year. 4 Putting this limit into the context of emissions, toward the end of the 20th century the state of Ohio\u2019s total annual emissions were 2.4 106 metric tons of gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO2) per year. If these total emissions are converted to SO2 and deposited on the State of 4 Ohio, the total would be 360 kg per hectare per year. 1 Similar calculations for the sulfur emissions for northeastern United States indicate that the rate of sulfur emission is four to \ufb01ve times greater than the rate of deposition. As the reactions above indicate, much of the sulfur is oxidized into acidic chemical species. Acidic deposition is an example of a continental pollution.", "The source can be coal burned in the U.S. West, Midwest, and Ohio River valley, but the effects are manifested thousands of miles away in the Canadian Shield. Similarly, acidic fjords and lakes in Scandinavia can be traced to the use of tall stacks in Great Britain and the lowland countries of continental Europe. British industries for some years simply built increasingly tall stacks as a method of air pollution control, reducing the immediate ground-level concentration, but emitting the same pollutants into the higher atmosphere. The air quality in the United Kingdom improved, but at the expense of acid rain at other parts of Europe. One of the dif\ufb01culties in dealing with continental and intercontinental air pollution is that society must change its dependence of fossil fuels, at least those that emit chemical compounds that lead to damage to ecosystems long distances from those who bene\ufb01t from the industrial output and energy production. To many nations, combustion is perceived to be tantamount to progress and development. Limitations of combustion are viewed as threats to economic development. Another perplexing aspect of acid rain is that the bene\ufb01ciaries of the combustion do not suffer the direct, negative impacts of these bene\ufb01ts, e.g. energy production. This is akin to the water pollution scenario where the communities downstream suffer for the bene\ufb01ts received by upstream polluters. 16.3.3.4 Global The release of radioactivity from the accidents at Chernobyl and more recently in Japan would be considered primarily a regional or continental problem. However, higher than usual levels of radioactivity were detected in Western North America soon after both accidents. The more recent meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan is a warning that we have not learned the lessons of the interconnectedness and long-range vulnerabilities presented by air pollutants like radioisotopes. Similarly, persistent organic pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, have been observed in Arctic mammals, thousands of miles from their sources. These observations demonstrate the effects of long-range transport. A particularly noteworthy air pollution problem of a global nature is the release of chloro\ufb02uorocarbons used as propellants in spray cans and in air conditioners, and their effect on the ozone layer high in the atmosphere (see Chapter 11). Some knowledge of the exchange processes between the stratosphere and the troposphere and between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres was gained in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a result of the injection of radioactive debris into the stratosphere from atomic bomb tests in the Paci\ufb01c. The debris was injected primarily into the Northern Hemisphere in the stratosphere. The stratosphere is usually quite stable and resists vertical air exchange between layers. It was found that the exchange processes in the stratosphere between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres is quite slow. However, radioactivity did show up in the Southern Hemisphere within 3 years of the onset of the tests, although the levels remained much lower than those in the Northern Hemisphere. Similarly, the exchange processes between the troposphere into the stratosphere are quite slow. The main transfer from the troposphere into the stratosphere is injection through the tops of thunderstorms that occasionally penetrate the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Some transfer of stratospheric air downward also occurs through occasional gaps in the tropopause. Since the ozone layer is considerably above the troposphere, the transfer of chloro\ufb02uorocarbons upward to the ozone layer is expected to take place very slowly. Thus, there was a lag from the \ufb01rst release of these gases until an effect was seen. Similarly, with the cessation of use of these materials worldwide, there has been a commensurate lag between in restoration of the ozone concentrations in the stratospheric layer (see Chapter 11). III. TROPOSPHERIC POLLUTION Another global problem is climate change that is generated by excessive amounts of radiant gases (commonly known as greenhouse gases), especially methane (CH4) and CO2.CO2 is not normally considered an air pollutant since it is the product of respiration and a reactant of photosynthesis. However, like other substances, it becomes a pollutant when its concentrations reach levels leading to adverse impacts. In the case of climate change, a portion of infrared radiation from the earth\u2019s surface is intercepted by the CO2 in the air and is reradiated both upward and downward. That which is radiated downward keeps the ground from cooling rapidly. As the carbon dioxide concentration continues to increase, the earth\u2019s temperature is expected to increase.", "It is not a question of eliminating CO2 from the atmosphere, which would be catastrophic in many ways, e.g. elimination of plant life, dramatic swings in diurnal temperatues, etc. It is a question of optimal ranges of CO2 in the troposphere and identifying when human activities add suf\ufb01cient amounts to push the concentrations outside of the optimal CO2 concentration range. The combine contributions from anthropogenic and natural sources of pollutants complicate the optimal range, since even the natural sources are highly variable. A natural air pollution problem that can cause global effects is the injection into the atmosphere of \ufb01ne particulate debris by volcanoes. The addition of this particulate matter has caused some spectacular sunsets throughout the earth. If suf\ufb01cient material is released, it can change the radiation balance. Blocking of the incoming solar radiation will reduce the normal degree of daytime warming of the earth\u2019s surface. A \u201cmini-ice age\u201d was caused in the mid-1800s, when a volcanic mountain in the Paci\ufb01c erupted. The summer of that year was much cooler than usual and snow occurred in July in New England. Global phenomena like climate can be sensitive to the effects of air pollutants. Like most environmental systems climate varies in its response to different pollutants. In fact, some pollutants lead to cooling whereas others lead to heating of the troposphere. Currently, the major concern of much of the scienti\ufb01c community is with warming. For example, the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) reports that between 1970 and 2004, global greenhouse gas emissions increased by 70%. Models vary in predicting how this increase will affect mean global temperatures and other climatic variables, but many scientists and policy makers fear that delays in curbing the trend could lead to a substantial environmental and societal catastrophe. Disasters can be direct, such as drought and biome shifting due to increased temperature. They may also be indirect, such as the economic and social costs of migrating populations due to sea level rise, or increased vector-borne diseases due to changes in biodiversity brought on by alterations of the water cycle. The atmosphere is a highly complex system, consisting of many interconnected and diverse systems at numerous scales. This chapter has introduced the scales of air pollution. The next chapters explain the air pollution processes that occur at various temporal and spatial scales. QUESTIONS 1. Air toxics are often studied at the urban scale. What is the approximate length of this scale? 2. How does \ufb02ow generally differ for plumes in the troposphere compared to plumes in unconsolidated materials, e.g. ground water \ufb02ow? 3.

If a PM monitor is operating at 19 kPa vacuum, what is absolute pressure of this system? 8. Over a 25-year period, the concentration of SO2 in a town is higher in the winter than in the summer every year on record. What type of variability is this? 9. A study is measuring occupational exposure to vapors of an organic solvent in the workplace. Concentrations of the compound are measured in the room where the solvent is used and compared to the concentration of the compound in the workers\u2019 urine. The study assumes that the only exposure to that solvent is occupational. However, two people also use the solvent at home in their hobbies. What type of error is being made here? Recommend at least two ways to decrease this error. 10. About 50% of the above solvent is changed physiologically after inhalation to a metabolite and the rest remains as the parent compound. However, 80% of the metabolite is eliminated into the urine within 24 h and 90% of the parent compound makes it to the urine in 24 h. The remaining part is stored in fats for a longer time period. If a worker takes up 1mgm 3 of this compound, how much would be expected to be in the urine collected over a 24-h period, assuming that the company just started using the solvent today? What would need to be known if the solvent has been used for a longer time? 11. If the investigators in the two previous questions simply assume 100% of the solvent is in the urine III.

Based on your previous answers, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using urine versus blood as the medium for an exposure biomarker? 13. Consider how Eqn (16.39) is an improvement compared to assuming that a personal exposure is merely the integral of concentration with respect to time. 14. How does personal exposure to an air pollutant differ from the concentration of that pollutant in a microenvironment? 15. Why are blood and urine samples more reliable for reactive compounds than for very persistent and lipophilic compounds? 16. Are most of the neighborhood scale actions of \ufb01rst responder to maintain initial isolation and protective distances aimed at decreasing the hazard or decreasing the exposure to the air pollutant? Explain. 17. At what scale(s) does air pollution impair visibility? Explain. 18.
