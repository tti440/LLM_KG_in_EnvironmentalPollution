Enslaver Parasites: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 In science fiction books and movies, villains sometimes use mind control or physical devices to break the will and control the actions of their victims. In these stories, people may be forced to perform strange or grotesque actions, or to harm themselves or others\u2014all against their will. Real life can be just as strange. Consider the hapless cricket shown in the video in WEB EXTENSION 13.1. This cricket does something that a cricket ordinarily would never do: it walks to the edge of a body of water, jumps in, and drowns. Shortly afterward, a hairworm begins to emerge from the body of the cricket (FIGURE 13.1). For the worm, this is the final step in a journey that begins when a terrestrial arthropod\u2014 such as a cricket\u2014drinks water in which a hairworm larva swims. The larva enters the cricket\u2019s body and feeds on its tissues, growing from microscopic size into an adult that fills all of the cricket\u2019s body cavity except its head and legs. When fully grown, adult hairworms must return to the water to mate. After the adults mate, the next generation of hairworm larvae are released to the water, where they will die unless they are ingested by a terrestrial arthropod host. FIGURE 13.1 Driven to Suicide The behavior of this wood cricket (Nemobius sylvestris) was manipulated by the hairworm (Paragordius tricuspidatus) emerging from its body. By causing the cricket to jump into water (where it drowns), the parasite is able to continue its life cycle. Has the hairworm \u201censlaved\u201d its cricket host, forcing it to jump into the water\u2014an act that kills the cricket but is essential for the hairworm to complete its life cycle? The answer appears to be yes. Observations have shown that when crickets infected with hairworms are near water, they are much more likely to enter the water than are uninfected crickets (Thomas et al. 2002). Furthermore, in 10 out of 10 trials, when infected crickets were rescued from the water, they immediately jumped back in. Uninfected crickets do not do this. Hairworms are not the only parasites that enslave their hosts. Maitland (1994) coined the term \u201censlaver parasites\u201d for several fungal species that alter the perching behavior of their fly hosts in such a way that fungal spores can be dispersed more easily after the flies die (FIGURE 13.2). The fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis also manipulates the final actions of its host, the ant Camponotus leonardi. First, an infected ant climbs down from its home in the upper branches of trees and selects a leaf in a protected environment about 25 cm above the soil (Andersen et al. 2009). Then, just before the fungus kills it, the ant bites into the selected leaf with a \u201cdeath grip\u201d that will hold its body in place after it is dead. The fungus grows well in such protected environments, but it cannot survive where the ant usually lives\u2014at the tops of trees, where the temperature and humidity are more variable. Thus, while the ant\u2019s final actions do not benefit the ant, they do allow the fungus to complete its life cycle in a favorable environment. FIGURE 13.2 Enslaved by a Fungus Shortly before they die from the infection, yellow dung flies infected by the fungus Entomophthora muscae move to the downwind side of a relatively tall plant and perch on the underside of one of its leaves. This position increases the chance that fungal spores released by Entomophthora will land on healthy yellow dung flies. (After D. P. Maitland. 1994. Proc R Soc London 258B: 187\u2013193.) Even vertebrates can be enslaved by parasites. Rats typically engage in predator avoidance behaviors in areas that show signs of cats. However, rats infected with the protist parasite Toxoplasma gondii behave abnormally: they do not avoid cats, and in some cases they are actually attracted to cats.", "While such a behavioral change can be a fatal attraction for the rat, it benefits the parasite because it increases the chance that the parasite will be transmitted to the next host in its complex life cycle\u2014a cat. How do some parasites enslave their hosts? Can the hosts fight back? More generally, what can these remarkable interactions tell us about host\u2013parasite relationships? View the script for the video Introduction More than half of the millions of species that live on Earth are symbionts, meaning that they live in or on other organisms. To begin to understand how many symbionts there are, we need look no further than our own bodies (FIGURE 13.3). Our faces are home to mites that feed on exudates from the pores of our skin and on secretions at the base of our eyelashes. There are bacteria and fungi that grow on our skin and under our toenails. Arthropods such as lice may live on our heads, pubic regions, and other parts of our bodies. Moving inward, our tissues, organs, and body cavities can be infested with a rich variety of organisms, from bacteria to worms to fungi to protists. FIGURE 13.3 The Human Body as Habitat for Symbionts Different parts of our bodies provide suitable habitat for a wide range of symbionts, many of which are parasites; only a few examples are shown here. Some of these organisms are pathogens that cause disease. These symbionts can be mutualists (as we will see in Chapter 15) or parasites. A parasite consumes the tissues or body fluids of the organism on or within which it lives, called its host; some parasites, called pathogens, cause diseases. Unlike carnivores but similar to herbivores, parasites typically harm, but do not immediately kill, the organisms they eat. The negative effects of parasites on their hosts vary widely, from mild to lethal. We see this variation in our own species, for which some parasites, such as the fungus that causes athlete\u2019s foot, are little more than a nuisance. Others, such as the protist Leishmania tropica, can cause disfigurement, and still others, such as Plasmodium falciparum, the bacterium that causes malaria, can kill. There is similar variation in the degree of harm caused by parasites that infect other species. Parasites vary in many other ways, as we\u2019ll see next as we examine their basic biology. CONCEPT 13.1 Parasites typically feed on only one or a few host species, but host species have multiple parasite species. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 13.1.1 Know why parasites are abundant and typically specialists. 13.1.2 Compare and contrast ectoparasites and endoparasites. Parasite Natural History Parasites vary in size from relatively large species (macroparasites), such as arthropods and worms, to species too small to be seen with the naked eye (microparasites), such as bacteria, protists, and unicellular fungi. But whether they are large or small, parasites typically feed on only one or a few host individuals over the course of their lives. Thus, defined broadly, parasites include herbivores, such as aphids or nematodes that feed on only one or a few host plants, as well as parasitoids, insects whose larvae feed on a single host, almost always killing it. Most species are attacked by more than one parasite (FIGURE 13.4), and even parasites have parasites. Because parasites spend their lives feeding on one or a few host individuals, they tend to have a close relationship to the organisms they eat. For example, many parasites are closely adapted to particular host species, and many attack only one or a few host species. This specialization at the species level helps to explain why there are so many species of parasites\u2014many host species have at least one parasite that eats only them. Overall, although the total number of parasite species is not known, a rough estimate is that 50% of the species on Earth are parasites (Windsor 1998). FIGURE 13.4 Many Species Are Host to More Than One Parasite Species In a study conducted in Britain, most host species were found to harbor more than one parasite species. The number of parasite species shown here for fishes, birds, and mammals includes only helminth worm parasites and hence is an underestimate of the actual number of parasite species found in these vertebrates. (After P. D. Stiling. 2002. Ecology: Theories and Applications, 4th ed. Prentice Hall: Upper Saddle River, NJ.)", "Averaging across the six groups of organisms other than vertebrates (which we exclude because the data underestimate the true number of parasites), what is the average number of parasite species per host? Suppose the number of parasite species was determined for a previously unstudied host from one of the six groups. Is it likely that the number of parasites in that host would be close to the average you calculated? Explain. Parasites are also specialized for living on or eating certain parts of the host\u2019s body. We\u2019ll focus next on this aspect of parasite specialization by describing both ectoparasites and endoparasites. Ectoparasites live on the surface of their host An ectoparasite lives on the outer body surface of its host (FIGURE 13.5). Ectoparasites include plants such as dodder and mistletoe that grow on, and obtain water and food from, another plant (see Figure 5.3). As described in Concept 5.1, such parasitic plants use modified roots called haustoria to penetrate the tissues of their host. Dodder cannot photosynthesize and hence depends on its host for both mineral nutrients and carbohydrates. In contrast, mistletoes are hemiparasitic: they extract water and mineral nutrients from their hosts, but since they have green leaves and can photosynthesize, they do not rely exclusively on their hosts for carbohydrates. FIGURE 13.5 Ectoparasites A wide range of parasites live on the outer surfaces of their hosts, feeding on host tissues. Examples include (A) the corn smut fungus (Ustilago maydis), seen here growing on an ear of corn, and (B) the velvet mite (Trombidium spp.), which in its larval form feeds parasitically on the blood of insects, such as this sawfly larva. There are also many fungal and animal parasites that live on the surfaces of plants, feeding on their hosts\u2019 tissues or body fluids. More than 5,000 species of fungi attack important crop and horticultural plants, causing billions of dollars of damage each year. Some fungi that attack plants, including mildews, rusts, and smuts, grow on the surface of the host plant and extend their hyphae (fungal filaments) within the plant to extract nutrients from its tissues (see Figure 13.5A). Plants are also attacked by numerous animal ectoparasites, including aphids, whiteflies, and scale insects, which are found on stems and leaves, and nematode worms, beetles, and (juvenile) cicadas, which are found on roots. Animal ectoparasites that eat plants and live on their outer surfaces can sometimes be thought of both as herbivores (because they eat plant tissues) and as parasites (especially if they remain on a single host plant for much of their lives). A similar array of fungal and animal ectoparasites can be found on the surfaces of animals. Familiar examples include Trichophyton rubrum, the fungus that causes athlete\u2019s foot, and fleas, mites, lice, and ticks, which feed on the tissues or blood of their hosts (see Figure 13.5B). Some of these parasites also transmit diseases to their hosts, including fleas that spread the plague and ticks that spread Lyme disease. Endoparasites live inside their host If we ignore the details of their shape, we can think of people and most other animals as being constructed in a similar way: their bodies consist of tissues that surround an open tube called the alimentary canal. The alimentary canal runs through the middle of the body, from the mouth to the anus. Parasites that live inside their hosts, called endoparasites, include species that inhabit the alimentary canal as well as species that live within host cells or tissues. The alimentary canal provides an excellent habitat for parasites. The host brings in food at one end (the mouth) and excretes what it cannot digest at the other (the anus). Parasites that live within the alimentary canal often do not eat host tissues at all; instead, they rob the host of nutrients. A tapeworm, for example, has a scolex, a structure with suckers (and sometimes hooks) that it uses to attach itself to the inside of the host\u2019s intestine (FIGURE 13.6A). Once it is attached, the tapeworm simply absorbs food that the host has already digested. Tapeworms that infect humans can grow up to 10\u201320 m (33\u201366 feet) long; large tapeworms such as these can block the intestines and cause nutritional deficiencies. FIGURE 13.6 Endoparasites Many parasites live within the body of their host, feeding on the host\u2019s tissues or robbing it of nutrients. (A)", "The tapeworm Taenia taeniaeformis uses the suckers and hooks shown here to attach to the intestinal wall of its mammalian host, often a rodent, rabbit, or cat. Once attached, an adult can grow to over 5 m (16 feet) in length. (B) The bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes the lung disease tuberculosis, which kills 1\u20132 million people each year. (C) This section of a potato tuber shows the destruction wrought by Erwinia carotovora, a bacterium that causes soft rot. Affected areas become soft with decay and develop a distinctive foul odor. Many other endoparasites live within the cells or tissues of animal hosts, causing a wide range of symptoms as they reproduce or consume host tissues. Examples in humans include Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the plague, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB) (FIGURE 13.6B). TB is a potentially fatal lung disease, aptly referred to as the \u201cCaptain of Death\u201d; with the possible exception of malaria, it has killed more people than any other disease in human history. TB continues to kill 1\u20132 million adults each year (a number comparable to the roughly 2 million that currently die each year from AIDS). Plants too are attacked by a wide variety of endoparasites, including bacterial pathogens that cause soft rot in various plant parts, such as fruits (e.g., tomatoes) or storage tissues (e.g., potatoes; FIGURE 13.6C). Other plant pathogens include fungi that cause plant parts to rot from the inside out. Some bacteria invade plant vascular tissues, where they disrupt the flow of water and nutrients, causing wilting and often death. Plant pathogens can have large effects on natural communities, as illustrated by the protist Phytophthora ramorum, which causes sudden oak death, a disease that has recently killed more than a million oaks and other trees in California and Oregon (see also the chestnut blight in Figure 13.14). Endoparasitism and ectoparasitism have advantages and disadvantages There are advantages and disadvantages to living in or on a host (TABLE 13.1). Because ectoparasites live on the surface of their host, it is relatively easy for them or their offspring to disperse from one host individual to another. It is much more difficult for endoparasites to disperse to new hosts. Endoparasites solve this problem in a variety of ways. Some, like the enslaver parasites discussed in the Case Study at the opening of this chapter, alter the physiology or behavior of their host in ways that facilitate their dispersal. Other examples include the bacterium, Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera, and the amoeba, Entamoeba histolytica, which causes amoebic dysentery. People with cholera and dysentery have diarrhea, a condition that increases the chance that the parasite will contaminate drinking water and thereby spread to new hosts. Other endoparasites have complex life cycles that include stages that are specialized for dispersing from one host species to another (see Interactive Figure 13.9). TABLE 13.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Living in or on a Host Ectoparasitism Endoparasitism Advantages Dispersal easier Feeding easier Safer from host\u2019s immune system More protection from external environment Disadvantages Feeding more difficult Dispersal more difficult Greater exposure to external environment Greater vulnerability to host\u2019s immune system Greater vulnerability to natural enemies Although dispersal is relatively easy for ectoparasites, there are costs to life on the surface of a host. Compared with endoparasites, ectoparasites are more exposed to natural enemies such as predators, parasitoids, and parasites. Aphids, for example, are attacked by ladybugs, birds, and many other predators, as well as by lethal parasitoids and by parasites such as mites that suck fluids from their bodies. Endoparasites, in contrast, are safe from all but the most specialized predators and parasites. Endoparasites are also relatively well protected from the external environment, and they have relatively easy access to food\u2014unlike an ectoparasite, an endoparasite does not have to pierce the host\u2019s protective outer surfaces to feed. But living within the host does expose endoparasites to a different sort of danger: more exposure to the host\u2019s immune system. Some parasites have evolved ways to tolerate or overcome immune system defenses, as we will see in the following section. Self-Assessment 13.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 13.2 Hosts have mechanisms for defending themselves against parasites, and parasites have mechanisms for overcoming host defenses. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 13.2.1 Describe the mechanisms organisms use for defending themselves against parasites. 13.2.2 List the mechanisms that parasites use to circumvent host defenses.", "Defense and Counterdefenses As we saw in Chapter 12, carnivores and herbivores exert strong pressure on their food organisms, and vice versa. The prey species and plants eaten by carnivores and herbivores have mechanisms that help them avoid being eaten. Similarly, carnivores and herbivores have mechanisms that help them to overcome the defenses of their prey or food plants. The same is true of parasites and their hosts: hosts have ways to protect themselves against parasites, and parasites have countermeasures to circumvent host defenses. Immune systems, biochemical defenses, and symbionts can protect hosts against parasites Host organisms have a wide range of defensive mechanisms that can prevent or limit the severity of parasite attacks. For example, a host may have a protective outer covering, such as the skin of a mammal or the hard exoskeleton of an insect, that can keep ectoparasites from piercing its body or make it difficult for endoparasites to enter. Endoparasites that do manage to enter the host\u2019s body are often killed or rendered less effective by the host\u2019s immune system, biochemical defenses, or defensive symbionts. IMMUNE SYSTEMS The vertebrate immune system includes specialized cells that allow the host to recognize microparasites to which it has been previously exposed; in many instances, the \u201cmemory cells\u201d of the immune system are so effective that the host has lifelong immunity against future attack by the same microparasite species. Other immune system cells engulf and destroy parasites or mark them with chemicals that target them for later destruction. Plants can also mount highly effective responses to invasion by parasites. Some plants have resistance genes, the different alleles of which provide protection against microparasites with particular genotypes; we will describe this defense system in more detail in Concept 13.3. Plants are not helpless, however, even when they lack alleles that provide resistance to a specific attacker. In such a case, the plant relies on a nonspecific immune system that produces antimicrobial compounds, including some that attack the cell walls of bacteria and others that are toxic to fungal parasites (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 13.7). The plant may also produce chemical signals that \u201cwarn\u201d nearby cells of imminent attack, and still other chemicals that stimulate the deposition of lignin, a hard substance that provides a barricade against the invader\u2019s spread. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 13.7 Nonspecific Plant Defenses Plants can mount a nonspecific defensive response that is effective against a broad range of fungal and bacterial microparasites. BIOCHEMICAL DEFENSES Hosts have ways of regulating their biochemistry to limit parasite growth. Bacterial and fungal endoparasites, for example, require iron to grow. Vertebrate hosts\u2014including mammals, birds, amphibians, and fishes\u2014have a protein called transferrin that removes iron from their blood serum (where parasites could use it) and stores it in intracellular compartments (where parasites cannot get to it). Transferrins are so efficient that the concentration of free iron in mammalian blood serum is only 10\u201326 M\u2014so low that parasites cannot grow in vertebrate blood unless they can somehow outmaneuver the host. To do this, some parasites steal iron from the transferrin itself and use it to support their own growth. Similar biochemical battles occur between plants and their parasites. As we saw in Concept 12.2, plants use a rich variety of chemical weapons to kill or deter the organisms that eat them. Plant defensive secondary compounds are so effective that some animals eat specific plants in order to treat or prevent parasite infections. For example, when parasitic flies lay eggs on the bodies of woolly bear caterpillars, the caterpillars switch from their usual food plant (lupines) to a diet of poisonous hemlock (Karban and English-Loeb 1997). The new diet does not kill the parasites, but it does increase the chance that the caterpillar will survive the attack and metamorphose into an adult tiger moth (Platyprepia virginalis). Chimpanzees infected with the nematode Oesophagostomum stephanostomum specifically seek out and eat a bitter plant that scientists have learned contains compounds that kill or paralyze the nematodes and can also deter many other parasites (Huffman 1997). Humans do essentially the same thing: we spend billions of dollars each year on pharmaceuticals that are based on compounds originally obtained from plants. DEFENSIVE SYMBIONTS Some organisms are aided in their defense against parasites by mutualistic symbionts such as bacteria and fungi. For example, fungal symbionts living within leaves protect grasses and plants such as cacao trees (the source of the beans used to make chocolate) from attack by pathogens.", "Growing evidence also indicates that bacterial symbionts living within the human digestive tract can protect us against disease-causing organisms (Britton and Young 2012). Many such \u201cdefensive symbionts\u201d are heritable, meaning the symbiont is reliably transmitted from a host to its offspring. We might expect that hosts harboring heritable defensive symbionts should increase in frequency in a population when parasites are common\u2014and indeed, that frequently happens. For example, in a laboratory experiment, the frequency of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) harboring the bacterial symbiont Hamiltonella defensa increased rapidly in the presence of a lethal wasp parasite (Oliver et al. 2008). This was expected, because the symbiont is heritable and because pea aphids harboring the symbiont survived at higher rates than did pea aphids lacking the symbiont. In another study on pea aphids, the bacterial symbiont Regiella insecticola was found to protect against attack by a deadly fungal parasite (FIGURE 13.8). Defensive symbionts have also been shown to protect against attack by nematode parasites, as you can explore in ANALYZING DATA 13.1. FIGURE 13.8 Protected by a Symbiont Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) of five different genotypes were exposed to the pathogenic fungus Pandora neoaphidis. For each of these genotypes, some aphids were inoculated with the bacterial symbiont Regiella insecticola, while other aphids lacked the symbiont. Aphids harboring the symbiont survived at higher rates than did aphids lacking the symbiont. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After C. L. Scarborough et al. 2005. Science 310: 1781.) Parasites have mechanisms that circumvent host defenses To survive and reproduce, a parasite must be able to tolerate or evade its host\u2019s defensive mechanisms. Aphids and other ectoparasites, for example, must be able to pierce the protective outer covering of the host, and they must be able to tolerate whatever chemical compounds are present in the host tissues or body fluids that they eat. Viewed broadly, the challenges faced by ectoparasites are similar to those faced by herbivores and carnivores as they attempt to cope with the toxins and physical structures that their prey use to defend themselves. We discussed such challenges in Concept 12.2, so here we focus on how endoparasites cope with defenses found inside the host. ANALYZING DATA 13.1 Although we would expect heritable defensive symbionts to increase in frequency in host populations subjected to parasitism, few studies have tested this hypothesis. Jaenike and Brekke (2011)* performed such a test, using laboratory populations of the fruit fly Drosophila neotestacea. These flies harbor a bacterial symbiont of the genus Spiroplasma, which protects flies from the nematode parasite Howardula aoronymphium. Howardula can sterilize female flies and reduce the mating success of male flies. Jaenike and Brekke established five replicate populations in which flies were exposed every generation to the nematode parasite and five replicate populations in which the parasite was absent. Initially, each population had a 50:50 mixture of Spiroplasma-infected and uninfected adult flies. In a second experiment, the researchers established five replicate populations in which all flies were infected with Spiroplasma and five replicate populations in which all flies were uninfected. All populations in this second experiment were exposed to Howardula parasites (but not necessarily infected by Howardula) in the first generation only. Both experiments were run for seven fly generations. The results for each experiment are shown in the tables. 1. Plot the percentage of flies harboring Spiroplasma (y axis) versus generation (x axis) for both treatments in Experiment 1. Describe the hypothesis tested by this experiment. Which treatment represents the control? Do the results support the hypothesis? 2. Plot the percentage of flies infected by Howardula (y axis) versus generation (x axis) for both treatments in Experiment 2. Describe the hypothesis tested by this experiment.

Do the results indicate that there is a cost to flies for harboring Spiroplasma? Explain.

COUNTERDEFENSES AGAINST ENCAPSULATION Endoparasites face formidable challenges from host immune systems and related aspects of host biochemistry. Host species typically have a number of ways to destroy parasite invaders.", "In addition to the strategies we have already described, some hosts can cover parasites or parasite eggs with capsules that kill them or render them harmless, a process called encapsulation. Some insects defend themselves against macroparasites using encapsulation. Insect blood cells can engulf small invaders, such as bacteria, but they cannot engulf large objects, such as nematodes or parasitoid eggs. However, some insects have lamellocytes, which are blood cells that can form multicellular sheaths (capsules) around large objects. When an insect mounts such an encapsulation defense, most or all of the attacking parasites may be destroyed. As a result, the parasites are under strong selection to develop a counterdefense. For example, Drosophila fruit flies have an effective defense against wasp parasitoids: they encapsulate (and hence kill) their eggs. Parasitoid wasps that attack fruit flies avoid encapsulation in several different ways. When wasps in the genus Leptopilina lay their eggs inside a fruit fly host, they also inject virus-like particles into the host. These particles infect the host\u2019s lamellocytes and cause them to self-destruct, thus weakening the host\u2019s resistance and increasing the percentage of wasp eggs that survive (Rizki and Rizki 1990). Other parasitoid wasps, such as Asobara tabida, lay eggs covered with filaments. These filaments cause the eggs to stick to and become embedded in fat cells and other host cells, where they are not detected by circulating lamellocytes. COUNTERDEFENSES INVOLVING HUNDREDS OF GENES Some endoparasites have a complex set of adaptations that allows them to thrive inside their host. One such endoparasite is Plasmodium falciparum, a protist that causes malaria, a disease that kills 1\u20132 million people each year (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 13.9). Plasmodium, like many endoparasites, has a complex life cycle with specialized stages that allow it to alternate between a mosquito and a human host. Infected mosquitoes contain one specialized Plasmodium stage, called a sporozoite, in their saliva. When an infected mosquito bites a human, sporozoites enter the victim\u2019s bloodstream and travel to the liver, where they divide to form another stage, called a merozoite. The merozoites penetrate red blood cells, where they multiply rapidly. After 48\u201372 hours, large numbers of merozoites break out of the red blood cells, causing the periodic chills and fever that are associated with malaria. Some of the offspring merozoites attack more red blood cells, while others transform into gamete-producing cells. If another mosquito bites the victim, it picks up some of the gamete-producing cells, which enter its digestive tract and form gametes. After fertilization occurs, the resulting zygotes produce thousands of sporozoites, which then migrate to the mosquito\u2019s salivary glands, where they await their transfer to another human host. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 13.9 Life Cycle of the Malaria Parasite The life cycle of the protist Plasmodium falciparum includes specialized stages that facilitate the dispersal of this endoparasite from one host to another. The sporozoite stage, for example, enables the parasite to disperse from an infected mosquito to a human host. Which stage in the life cycle enables the parasite to disperse from a human host to a mosquito? Plasmodium faces two potentially lethal challenges from its human host. First, red blood cells do not divide or grow, and hence they lack the cellular machinery needed to import nutrients necessary for growth. A Plasmodium merozoite inside a red blood cell would starve if it did not have a way to obtain essential nutrients. Second, after 24\u201348 hours, a Plasmodium infection causes red blood cells to have an abnormal shape. The human spleen recognizes and destroys such deformed cells, along with the parasites inside. Plasmodium addresses these challenges by having hundreds of genes whose function is to modify the host red blood cell in ways that allow the parasites to obtain food and escape destruction by the spleen (Hiller et al. 2004; Marti et al. 2004). Some of these genes cause transport proteins to be placed on the surface of the red blood cell, thereby enabling the parasite to import essential nutrients into the host cell. Other genes guide the production of unique knobs that are added to the surface of the red blood cell. These knobs cause the infected red blood cell to stick to other human cells, thereby preventing it from traveling in the bloodstream to the spleen, where it would be recognized as infected and then destroyed. The proteins on these knobs vary greatly from one parasite individual to another, making it difficult for the human immune system to recognize and destroy the infected cells. Self-Assessment 13.2", "[Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 13.3 Host and parasite populations can evolve together, each in response to selection pressure imposed by the other. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 13.3.1 Understand how host\u2013parasite interactions can result in coevolution. 13.3.2 Know why host\u2013parasite interactions can result in life history trade-offs. Parasite\u2013Host Coevolution As we have just seen, Plasmodium has specific mechanisms that enable it to live inside a red blood cell. When both a parasite and its host possess such specific mechanisms, that observation suggests that the strong selection pressure that hosts and parasites impose on each other has caused their populations to evolve. Such changes have been directly observed in Australia, where the myxoma virus was introduced to control populations of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). European rabbits were introduced to Australia in 1859, when 24 wild rabbits were released at a ranch in Victoria. Within a decade, rabbit populations had grown so large, and were consuming so much plant material, that they posed a threat to cattle and sheep pasturelands and wool production. Several control measures were enacted, including introductions of predators, shooting and poisoning of rabbits, and the building of fences to limit the spread of rabbits from one region to another (Fenner and Ratcliffe 1965). None of these methods worked: by the 1900s, hundreds of millions of rabbits had spread throughout much of the continent. After years of investigation, Australian government officials settled on a new control measure: introduction of the myxoma virus. A rabbit infected with this virus may suffer from skin lesions and severe swellings, which can lead to blindness, difficulty with feeding and drinking, and death (usually within 2 weeks of infection). The virus is transmitted from rabbit to rabbit by mosquitoes. In 1950, when the virus was first used to control rabbit populations, 99.8% of infected rabbits died. In the ensuing decades, millions of rabbits were killed by the virus and the sizes of rabbit populations dropped dramatically throughout the Australian continent. Over time, however, rabbit populations evolved resistance to the virus, and the virus evolved to become less lethal (FIGURE 13.10). The myxoma virus is still used to control rabbit populations, but doing so requires a constant search for new, lethal virus strains to which the rabbit has not evolved resistance. FIGURE 13.10 Coevolution of the European Rabbit and the Myxoma Virus (A) After the introduction of the myxoma virus to Australia, researchers periodically tested its lethality by collecting rabbits from a wild population and exposing them to a standard strain of the virus that killed 90% of naive (unselected) laboratory rabbits. Over time, mortality in those wild rabbits declined as the population evolved resistance to the virus. (B) The lethality of virus samples collected in the wild also declined, as was determined when they were tested against a standard (unselected) line of rabbits. (A, extracted from P. J. Kerr and S. M. Best. 1998. Myxoma virus in rabbits. In Genetic resistance to animal diseases. M. Mler and G. Brem (Eds.). Rev Sci Tech Off Int Epiz 17(1): 256\u2013268. Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.20506/rst.17.1.1081. World Organisation for Animal Health at www.oie.int; B after R. M. May and R. M. Anderson. 1983. Proc R Soc London 219B: 281\u2013313.) The increased resistance of the rabbit and the reduced lethality of the virus illustrate coevolution, which occurs when populations of two interacting species evolve together, each in response to selection pressure imposed by the other. The outcome of coevolution can vary greatly depending on the biology of the interacting species. In the European rabbit, selection favored the evolution of increased resistance to viral attack, as you might expect. In addition, viral strains of intermediate lethality predominated, perhaps because such strains allowed rabbits to live long enough for one or more mosquitos to bite them and transmit the virus to another host (mosquitos do not bite dead rabbits). In other cases of host\u2013parasite coevolution, the parasite evolves counterdefenses to overcome host resistance mechanisms, as the following examples illustrate. Selection can favor a diversity of host and parasite genotypes As mentioned earlier, plant defense systems include a specific response that makes particular plant gene-for genotypes resistant to particular parasite genotypes. Such -gene interactions are well documented in a number of plant species, including wheat, flax, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Wheat has dozens of different genes for resistance to fungi such as wheat rusts (Puccinia).", "Different wheat rust genotypes can overcome different wheat resistance genes, however, and periodically, mutations occur in wheat rusts that produce new genotypes to which wheat is not resistant. Studies have shown that the frequencies of wheat rust genotypes vary considerably over time as farmers use different resistant varieties of wheat. For example, a rust variety may be abundant in one year because it can overcome the resistance genes of wheat varieties planted that year, yet less abundant the following year because it cannot overcome the resistance genes of the different wheat varieties planted that year. Changes in the frequencies of host and parasite genotypes also occur in natural systems. In the lakes of New Zealand, a trematode worm (Microphallus sp.) parasitizes the snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. The worm has serious negative effects on its snail hosts: it castrates the males and sterilizes the females. The parasite has a much shorter generation time than its host, and hence we might expect that it would rapidly evolve the ability to cope with the snail\u2019s defensive mechanisms. Lively (1989) tested this idea in an experiment that pitted parasites from each of three lakes against snails from the same three lakes. He found that parasites infected snails from their home lake more effectively than they infected snails from the other two lakes (FIGURE 13.11). This observation suggests that the parasite genotypes in each lake had evolved rapidly enough to overcome the defenses of the snail genotypes found in that lake. FIGURE 13.11 Adaptation by Parasites to Local Host Populations The graph shows the frequencies with which Microphallus parasites from three lakes in New Zealand (Lake Mapourika, Lake Wahapo, and Lake Paringa) were able to infect snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) from the same three lakes. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After C. M. Lively. 1989. Evolution 43: 1663\u20131671.) Do snails with poor defenses against parasites from their own lake also have poor defenses against parasites from other lakes? Explain. The snails also evolved in response to the parasites, albeit more slowly. Dybdahl and Lively (1998) documented the abundances of different snail genotypes over a 5-year period in another New Zealand lake. The snail genotype that was most abundant changed from one year to the next. Moreover, roughly a year after a snail genotype was the most abundant one in the population, snails of that genotype had a higher than typical number of parasites. Together with Lively\u2019s earlier study (1989), these results suggest that parasite populations evolve to exploit the snail genotypes found in their local environment. Refining this idea further, Dybdahl and Lively hypothesized that as a result of evolution by natural selection, parasites would be able to infect snails with a common genotype at a higher rate than they could infect snails with a rare genotype. That is exactly what they found in a laboratory experiment (FIGURE 13.12). Hence, snail genotype frequencies may change from year to year because common genotypes are attacked by many parasites, placing them at a disadvantage and driving down their numbers in future years. FIGURE 13.12 Parasites Infect Common Host Genotypes More Easily Than Rare Genotypes In a laboratory experiment, Dybdahl and Lively compared rates of Microphallus infection in four common snail genotypes (A\u2013 D, represented by blue dots) and in a group of 40 rare snail genotypes (E, represented by a red dot). The parasites and snails in this experiment were all taken from the same lake. (After M. F. Dybdahl and C. M. Lively. 1998. Evolution 52: 1057\u2013 1066.) Host defenses and parasite counterdefenses both have costs Parasites and hosts have such a powerful effect on each other that we might expect an ever-escalating \u201carms race\u201d in which host resistance and parasite counterdefenses both get stronger and stronger over time. But such an outcome rarely occurs. In some cases\u2014as in Dybdahl and Lively\u2019s snails and trematodes\u2014host genotypes that are common decrease in frequency because they are attacked by many parasites, leading to an increase in the frequency of a previously rare genotype, and the arms race continually begins anew. An arms race may also stop because of trade-offs: a trait that improves a host\u2019s defenses or a parasite\u2019s counterdefenses may have costs that reduce other aspects of the organism\u2019s growth, survival, or reproduction. Such trade-offs have been documented in a number of host\u2013parasite systems, including Drosophila fruit flies and the parasitoid wasps that attack them (described on p. 299).", "Alex Kraaijeveld and colleagues (2001) have shown that selection can increase both the frequency with which fruit fly hosts encapsulate wasp eggs (from 5% to 60% in five generations) and the ability of wasp eggs to avoid encapsulation (from 8% to 37% in 10 generations). But they have also shown that there are costs to these defenses and counterdefenses. For example, fruit flies from lineages that can mount an encapsulation defense have lower larval survival rates when they compete for food with flies of the same species that cannot. Similarly, wasp eggs that avoid encapsulation by becoming embedded in host tissues take longer to hatch than do other eggs. The evolutionary changes in host and parasite populations that we\u2019ve discussed in this section reflect the profound effects these organisms have on each other. Next, we\u2019ll focus on some of the ecological consequences of host\u2013parasite interactions. Self-Assessment 13.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 13.4 Hosts and parasites can have important effects on each other\u2019s population dynamics. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 13.4.1 Understand how parasites can influence the population dynamics of hosts. 13.4.2 Explain how simple models of host\u2013pathogen dynamics can be used to control the establishment and spread of diseases. Host\u2013Parasite Population Dynamics As we\u2019ve seen, parasites can reduce the survival, growth, or reproduction of their hosts\u2014an observation that is illustrated clearly by the large drop in reproductive success that a sexually transmitted mite can inflict on its beetle host (FIGURE 13.13). At the population level, the harm that parasites cause host individuals translates into a reduction of the host population growth rate, \u03bb (see Concept 11.1). As we will see in this section, the reduction in \u03bb can be drastic: parasites may drive local host populations extinct or even reduce the geographic range of the host species. In other, less extreme cases, parasites may reduce host abundances or otherwise alter host population dynamics without causing the extinction of host populations. FIGURE 13.13 Parasites Can Reduce Host Reproduction Researchers infected experimental populations of the beetle Adalia decempunctata with a sexually transmitted mite parasite (Coccipolipus hippodamiae). Over the next 25 days, they monitored the proportions of the eggs laid by female beetles from (A) control and (B) infected populations that hatched. Each curve represents the eggs laid by a single female. (After K. M. Webberley et al. 2004. J Anim Ecol 73: 1\u201310.) Parasites can drive host populations to extinction The amphipod Corophium volutator lives in North Atlantic tidal mudflats. Corophium is small (1 cm long) and often very abundant, reaching densities of up to 100,000 individuals per square meter. Corophium builds tubular burrows in the mud, from which it feeds on plankton suspended in the water and on microorganisms found in sediments near the burrow opening. It is eaten by a wide range of organisms, including migratory birds and trematode parasites. The parasites can reduce the size of Corophium populations greatly, even to the point of local extinction. For example, in a 4-month period, attack by trematodes caused the extinction of a Corophium population that initially had 18,000 individuals per square meter (Mouritsen et al. 1998). Parasites can also drive host populations to extinction over a large geographic region. The American chestnut (Castanea dentata) once was a dominant member of deciduous forest communities in eastern North America (FIGURE 13.14), but the parasitic fungus Cryphonectria parasitica changed that completely. This fungal pathogen causes chestnut blight, a disease that kills chestnut trees. The fungus was introduced to New York City from Asia in 1904 (Keever 1953). By midcentury, the fungus had wiped out most chestnut populations, greatly reducing the geographic range of this once-dominant species. FIGURE 13.14 Parasites Can Reduce Their Host\u2019s Geographic Range (A) The original distribution of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) is shown in red. Although a few chestnut trees remain standing, a fungal parasite drove this once-dominant species virtually extinct throughout its entire former range. (B) Chestnuts were once important timber trees (note the two loggers shown in the photograph). (Range detail courtesy of Elbert L. Little, Jr. 1970. Atlas of United States Trees. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and other publications.) Isolated chestnut trees still can be found in North American forests, and some of these trees show signs of resistance to the fungus. But it is likely that many of the standing trees simply have not yet been found by the fungus.", "Once the fungus reaches a tree, it enters the tree through a hole or wound in the bark, killing the aboveground portion of the tree in 2\u201310 years. Before they die, infected trees may produce seeds, which may germinate and give rise to offspring that live for 10\u201315 years before they are killed by the fungus in turn. Some infected trees also produce sprouts from their roots, but these are usually killed a few years after they appear aboveground. Efforts are under way to breed resistant chestnut varieties, but at present it is not known whether chestnut populations will ever recover from the onslaught of the chestnut blight fungus. Parasites can influence host population cycles Ecologists have long sought to determine the causes of population cycles. As we saw in Concept 12.3, such cycles may be caused by three-way feeding relationships\u2014by the effects that predators and herbivorous prey have on each other, coupled with the effects that those prey and their food plants have on each other. Population cycles can also be influenced by parasites. Consider the work of Peter Hudson and colleagues, who manipulated the abundances of parasites in red grouse (Lagopus lagopus) populations on moors in northern England. In this region, red grouse populations tend to crash every 4 years. Previous studies had shown that a parasitic nematode, Trichostrongylus tenuis, decreased the survival and reproductive success of individual red grouse. Hudson et al. (1998) investigated whether this parasite might also cause grouse populations to cycle. The researchers studied changes in red grouse numbers in six replicate populations over the course of two population cycles. Long-term data on grouse population cycles indicated that these populations were likely to crash in 1989 and again in 1993. In two of the six study populations, the researchers treated as many grouse as they could catch in 1989 and 1993 with a drug that killed the parasitic nematodes. In two of the other study populations, grouse were caught and treated for parasites in 1989 only. The remaining two populations served as unmanipulated controls. Because each replicate population covered a very large area 2 (17\u201320 km ), it was not possible to count red grouse directly. Instead, Hudson and colleagues used the number of red grouse shot by hunters as an index of the actual population size. In the control populations, red grouse numbers crashed as predicted in 1989 and 1993 (FIGURE 13.15). Although parasite removal did not completely stop the red grouse population cycle, it did reduce the fluctuation in grouse numbers considerably; this was particularly true for the populations that were treated for parasites in both 1989 and 1993. Thus, the experiment provided strong evidence that parasites influence \u2014and may be the primary cause of\u2014red grouse population cycles. FIGURE 13.15 Parasite Removal Reduces Host Population Fluctuations Hudson et al. studied the effects of parasites on the cycling of six red grouse populations subjected to three treatments: (A) two control populations, (B) two populations treated for nematode parasites in 1989, and (C) two populations treated for parasites in 1989 and 1993. The six replicate populations are designated by different colors. (After P. J. Hudson et al. 1998. Science 282: 2256\u20132258.) If parasite removal completely stopped the population cycles, how might the results in (C) differ from those actually obtained? As we\u2019ve seen, parasites that cause diseases (pathogens) can greatly affect the population dynamics of both wild and domesticated plant and animal species. Pathogens also have large effects on human populations\u2014so much so that they are thought to have played a major role in the rise and fall of civilizations throughout the course of human history (McNeill 1976; Diamond 1997). One example is the European conquest of North America, where up to 95% of the native population (19 million of the original 20 million) were killed by new diseases brought to the continent by European trappers, missionaries, settlers, and soldiers. Even with such massive mortality, the conquest took roughly 400 years; without it, the conquest would certainly have taken longer, and might have failed. Pathogens continue to be a major source of human mortality today. Despite medical advances, millions of people die each year from diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Simple models of host\u2013pathogen dynamics suggest ways to control the establishment and spread of diseases Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of mathematical models of host\u2013pathogen population dynamics. These models often differ in three ways from those we have seen in earlier chapters.", "First, the host population is subdivided into categories, such as susceptible individuals, infected individuals, and recovered and immune individuals. Second, it is often necessary to keep track of both host and pathogen genotypes because, as we have seen, host genotypes may differ greatly in their resistance to the pathogen, and pathogen genotypes may differ greatly in their ability to cause disease. Third, depending on the pathogen, it may be necessary to account for other factors that influence its spread, such as (1) differences in the likelihood that hosts of different ages will become infected; (2) a latent period, in which a host individual is infected but cannot spread the disease; and (3) vertical transmission, the spread of the disease from mother to newborn, as can occur in AIDS. Models that include all of these factors can be very complicated. Here we\u2019ll consider a simple model that does not incorporate most of these complicating factors, yet still yields a key insight: a disease will spread only if the density of susceptible hosts exceeds a critical threshold density. To develop a model that can be used to estimate the threshold density, we must determine how to represent the transmission of the disease from one host individual to the next. We\u2019ll denote the density of susceptible individuals by S and the density of infected individuals by I. For a disease to spread, infected individuals must encounter susceptible individuals. Such encounters are assumed to occur at a rate that is proportional to the densities of susceptible and infected individuals; here, we\u2019ll assume that this rate is proportional to the product of their densities, SI. Diseases do not spread with every such encounter, however, so we multiply the encounter rate (SI) by a transmission coefficient (\u03b2) that indicates how effectively the disease spreads from infected to susceptible individuals. Thus, an essential feature of the model\u2014disease transmission\u2014is represented by the term \u03b2SI. The density of infected individuals increases when the disease is transmitted successfully (at the rate \u03b2SI) and decreases when infected individuals die or recover from the disease. If we set the combined death and recovery rate equal to m, these assumptions yield the equation (13.1) where dI/dt represents the change in the density of infected individuals at each instant in time. A disease will become established and spread when the density of infected individuals in a population increases over time. As explained in more detail in WEB EXTENSION 13.2, this occurs when dI/dt is greater than zero, which, according to Equation 13.1, occurs when We can rearrange this equation to get Thus, a disease will become established and spread when the number of susceptible individuals exceeds m/\u03b2; this number of susceptible individuals is the threshold density, denoted by ST. In other words, For some diseases that affect people or animals, the transmission rate \u03b2 and the death and recovery rate m are known, permitting estimation of the threshold density. CONTROLLING THE SPREAD OF DISEASES As Equation 13.1 suggests, to prevent the spread of a disease, the density of susceptible individuals must be kept below the threshold density (ST). There are several ways of achieving this goal. People sometimes slaughter large numbers of susceptible domesticated animals to reduce their density below ST and hence prevent disease spread. This is typically done when the disease in question can spread to humans, as in highly virulent forms of bird flu. In human populations, if an effective and safe vaccine is available, the density of susceptible individuals can be reduced below ST by a mass vaccination program. Such programs work, as illustrated by the dramatic results of a measles vaccination program in Romania (FIGURE 13.16). FIGURE 13.16 Vaccination Reduces the Incidence of Measles in Humans The results of a measles vaccination program in Romania show that lowering the density of susceptible individuals can control the spread of a disease. Measles often kills (especially in populations that are poorly nourished or that lack a history of exposure to the disease) and can cause severe complications in survivors, including blindness and pneumonia. (After P. M. Strebel and S. L. Cochi. 2001. Nature 414: 695\u2013696.) Other public health measures can also be taken to raise the threshold density, thereby making it more difficult for the disease to become established and spread. For example, the threshold density can be raised by taking actions that increase the rate at which infected individuals recover and become immune (thereby increasing m and hence increasing ST = m/\u03b2).", "One way to increase the recovery rate is to improve the early detection and clinical treatment of the disease. The threshold density can also be raised if \u03b2, the disease transmission rate, is decreased. This can be achieved by quarantining infected individuals or by convincing people to engage in behaviors (such as hand washing or condom use) that make it more difficult for the disease to be transmitted from one person to the next. The same principles can be applied to wild populations. Dobson and Meagher (1996) studied bison populations to determine how best to prevent the spread of the bacterial disease brucellosis. Using data from previous studies in which 16 bison herds in six national parks in Canada and the United States had been tested for exposure to the disease, they found that the threshold density (ST) for disease establishment appeared to be a herd size of 200\u2013300 bison (FIGURE 13.17). This field-based estimate of ST was very similar to the estimated threshold density of 240 individuals calculated from a model similar to Equation 13.1. Many of the herds in the six national parks had 1,000\u20133,000 individuals, so reducing herd sizes below a threshold value of 200\u2013300 individuals would require implementing a vaccination program or killing large numbers of bison. An effective vaccine was not available, and killing many bison was not acceptable, either politically or ecologically (since herds as small as 200 individuals would face an increased risk of extinction). Thus, Dobson and Meagher concluded that it would be difficult to prevent the establishment of brucellosis in wild bison populations. FIGURE 13.17 Determining Threshold Population Densities for Disease Control The percentage of bison that showed evidence of previous exposure to brucellosis was monitored in six national parks in the United States and Canada. By plotting this percentage versus the size of each of 16 bison herds, researchers obtained a rough estimate of the threshold density for establishment of the disease (200\u2013300 individuals, the upper bound of which is shown by the dashed line). (After A. Dobson and M. Meagher. 1996. Ecology 77: 1026\u20131036.) Self-Assessment 13.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 13.5 Parasites can alter the outcomes of species interactions, thereby causing communities to change. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 13.5.1 Know how parasites can affect the outcome of species interactions and community structure. 13.5.2 Describe how climate change might influence host\u2013pathogen relationships. Parasites Can Change Ecological Communities The effects of parasites on their hosts can have ripple effects on communities: by reducing the performance of host individuals and the growth rates of host populations, parasites can change the outcome of species interactions, the composition of ecological communities, and even the physical environment in which a community is found. Changes in species interactions When two individual organisms interact with each other, the outcome of that interaction depends on many features of their biology. An individual predator that is young and healthy may be able to catch its prey\u2014 even though the prey organism literally \u201cruns for its life\u201d\u2014whereas a predator that is old or sick may go hungry. Similarly, an individual that is in good condition may be able to compete effectively with others for resources, while an individual in poor condition may not. Because they can affect host performance, parasites can affect the outcome of interactions between their hosts and other species. Thomas Park conducted a series of experiments on factors that influenced the outcome of competition between flour beetle species. In one of those experiments, Park (1948) examined how the protist parasite Adelina tribolii affected the outcome of competition experiments using two species of flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum and T. confusum. In the absence of the parasite, T. castaneum usually outcompeted T. confusum, driving it to extinction in 12 of 18 cases (FIGURE 13.18). The reverse was true when the parasite was present: T. confusum outcompeted T. castaneum in 11 of 15 cases. The outcome of competition was reversed because the parasite had a large negative effect on T. castaneum individuals, but virtually no effect on T. confusum. Parasites can also affect the outcome of competition in the field, as when the malaria parasite Plasmodium azurophilum reduced the competitive superiority of the lizard Anolis gingivinus over its smaller counterpart, A. wattsi (Schall 1992). Finally, parasites can alter the outcome of predator\u2013prey interactions: by decreasing the physical condition of infected individuals, parasites may make predators less able to catch their prey, or prey less able to escape predation.", "FIGURE 13.18 Parasites Can Alter the Outcome of Competition Thomas Park performed competition experiments using populations of the flour beetles Tribolium castaneum and T. confusum that were or were not infected with a protist parasite. (After T. Park. 1948. Ecol Monogr 18: 267\u2013307.) In the examples described in the previous paragraph, parasites affected the outcome of species interactions by altering the physical condition of their host. Parasites can also alter the outcome of species interactions by changing host behavior. For example, when infected by a parasite, the host may behave in an unusual manner that makes it more vulnerable to predation. There are numerous examples of this phenomenon, including protist parasites making rats less wary of cats, as described in the Case Study. Some worm parasites cause amphipods to move from sheltered areas to areas of relatively bright light, where the amphipods are more likely to be seen and eaten by fish or bird predators. In both of these cases, the parasite induces a change in host behavior that makes the host more likely to be eaten by a species that the parasite requires to complete its life cycle. Changes in community structure As we\u2019ll discuss in Chapter 16, ecological communities can be characterized by the number and relative abundances of the species they contain as well as by physical features of the environment. Parasites can alter and be altered by each of these aspects of communities. In this chapter, we have seen several cases in which a parasite reduced the abundance, or even the geographic range, of its host, and we have also seen that parasites can change the outcome of species interactions. Such changes can have profound effects on the composition of communities. For example, a parasite that attacks a dominant competitor can suppress that species, causing the abundances of inferior competitors to increase. Such an effect was observed in six stream communities studied by Kohler and Wiley (1997). Prior to recurrent outbreaks of a fungal pathogen, the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior was the dominant herbivore in each of the six communities. The fungus devastated Glossosoma populations, reducing their densities nearly 25-fold, from an average of 4,600 individuals per square meter to an average of 190 individuals per square meter. This drastic reduction in Glossosoma density allowed increases in the abundances of dozens of other species, including algae, grazing insects that ate algae, and filter feeders such as blackfly larvae. In addition, several species that previously were extremely rare or absent from the communities were able to establish thriving populations, thus increasing the diversity of the communities. Parasites can also cause changes in the physical environment. This can happen when a parasite attacks an organism that is an ecosystem engineer, a species whose actions change the physical character of its environment, as when a beaver builds a dam (see Concept 16.3). As we learned earlier in Concept 13.4, the amphipod Corophium volutator can function as an ecosystem engineer in its tidal mudflat environment: in some circumstances, the burrows it builds hold the mud together, preventing the erosion of silt and causing the formation of \u201cmud islands\u201d that rise above the surface of the water at low tide. As described earlier, trematode parasites can drive local Corophium populations to extinction (FIGURE 13.19A). When this happens, erosion rates increase, the silt content of the mudflats decreases, and the mud islands disappear (FIGURE 13.19B\u2013D). Along with these physical changes, in one instance, the abundances of ten large species in the mudflat community changed considerably in the presence of the parasite, including one species (a ribbon worm) that was driven to local extinction (K. N. Mouritsen, personal communication). FIGURE 13.19 Parasites Can Alter the Physical Environment Infection of the amphipod Corophium volutator by a trematode parasite affects not only the host, but its entire tidal mudflat community. (A) The trematode can drive amphipod populations to local extinction. (B) In the absence of Corophium, the erosion rate increases and the silt content of the mudflats decreases. (C,D) The overall physical structure of the mudflats also changes [compare (C) with (D)]. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (After K. N. Mouritsen et al. 1998. J Mar Biol Assoc U.K. 78: 1167\u20131180; K. N. Mouritsen and R. Poulin. 2002. Parasitology 124: S101\u2013S117.) Finally, certain aspects of a community can be important in pathogen success and disease transmission.", "As we will learn in the Case Study in Chapter 19, the species diversity within a community can reduce the emergence and transmission of infectious diseases in wildlife and humans. CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION CLIMATE CHANGE AND DISEASE SPREAD As we saw in Chapter 12, changes in climate are expected to have wide-ranging effects on species interactions and ultimately ecological communities (see Interactive Figure 12.22). For example, because mosquitoes and other vectors (organisms that transmit pathogens from one host to another) are often more active or produce more offspring under warm conditions, scientists have predicted that ongoing climate change may cause the incidence of some diseases to rise in human and wildlife populations (Epstein 2000; Harvell et al. 2002). A growing body of evidence supports this prediction. In one such study, increases in ocean temperatures were strongly correlated with increases in coral diseases along Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef (Bruno et al. 2007). Similar results have been found in corals at other locations, as well as in a variety of amphibian and shellfish populations (Harvell et al. 2009). Climate change is also expected to change the distributions of some pathogens and their vectors by changing the locations where conditions are suitable for those organisms. For example, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2010) found that climate change is likely to increase the risk of leishmaniasis in North America by increasing the geographic ranges of its reservoir species (rodents in the genus Neotoma that can harbor the pathogen) and its sand fly vectors (FIGURE 13.20). Similarly, the number of people at risk from malaria, cholera, and the plague may increase as global temperatures continue to warm (see citations in Ostfeld 2009). FIGURE 13.20 Climate Change May Increase the Risk of Leishmaniasis in North America Leishmaniasis can cause severe skin sores, difficulty breathing, immune system impairment, and other complications that can lead to death. There are currently 2 million new cases each year. Leishmaniasis is caused by protists in the genus Leishmania and spread by sand flies (bloodsucking insects in the genera Lutzomyia and Phlebotomus). In addition to infecting humans, the pathogen can persist in several reservoir species (rodents in the genus Neotoma). (A) Change in the geographic regions in which people are predicted to be at risk from leishmaniasis due to the presence of at least one vector and reservoir species. (B) Change in numbers of people predicted to be at risk due to the presence of at least one vector and reservoir species. (After C. Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2010. PLOS Neglected Trop Dis 4: 1\u201316.) Overall, these studies and others (see Tylianakis et al. 2008; Gilman et al. 2010), indicate that ecological interactions will influence how future climate change will affect the incidence of disease in humans and many other species. Likewise, Costello et al. (2009) outlined major threats to human health from direct and indirect effects of climate change on disease incidence, food and water insecurity, and extreme climate events (such as hurricanes and floods that create conditions that favor the spread of diseases). It is highly likely that climate change will also have direct and indirect effects on the incidence of disease in the populations of many species other than humans, contributing to the ongoing biodiversity crisis. Self-Assessment 13.5 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Enslaver Parasites Returning to a question that we posed in the Case Study, how do enslaver parasites manipulate the behavior of their hosts? In some cases, we have hints of how they do this. Consider the tropical parasitoid wasp Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga and its host, the orb-weaving spider Plesiometa argyra. The larval stage of this wasp attaches to the exterior of a spider\u2019s abdomen and sucks the spider\u2019s body fluids. When fully grown, the wasp larva induces the spider to make a special \u201ccocoon web\u201d (FIGURE 13.21). Once the spider has built the cocoon web, the larva kills and eats the spider. The larva then spins a cocoon and attaches it to the cocoon web. As the larva completes its development within the cocoon, the cocoon web serves as a strong support that protects the larva from being swept away by torrential rains. FIGURE 13.21 Parasites Can Alter Host Behavior The parasitoid wasp Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga dramatically alters the web-building behavior of the orb-weaving spider Plesiometa argyra. (A) The web of an uninfected spider. (B) The \u201ccocoon web\u201d of a parasitized spider. (After W. G. Eberhard. 2001. J Arachnol 29: 354.)", "A parasitized spider builds normal webs right up to the night when the wasp induces it to make a cocoon web. This sudden change in the spider\u2019s web-building behavior suggested that the wasp might inject the spider with a chemical that alters its behavior. To test this idea, William Eberhard (2001) removed wasp larvae from spider hosts several hours before the time when a cocoon web would usually be made. Wasp removal sometimes resulted in the construction of a web that was very similar to a cocoon web, but more often resulted in the construction of a web that was intermediate in form but differed substantially from both normal and cocoon webs. In the days that followed the removal of the parasite, some spiders partially recovered the ability to make normal webs. These results are consistent with the idea that the parasite induces construction of a cocoon web by injecting a fast-acting chemical into the spider. The chemical appears to act in a dose-dependent manner; otherwise, we would expect spiders exposed to the chemical to build only cocoon webs, not webs that are intermediate in form. Spiders build cocoon webs by repeating the early steps of their normal web-building sequence a large number of times; thus, the chemical appears to act by interrupting the spiders\u2019 usual sequence of web-building behaviors. Other enslaver parasites also appear to manipulate host body chemistry. In the Case Study, we described hairworm parasites that cause crickets to commit suicide by jumping into water. Thomas and colleagues (2003) have shown that the hairworm causes biochemical and structural changes in the brain of its cricket host. The concentrations of three amino acids (taurine, valine, and tyrosine) in the brains of parasitized crickets differ from those in crickets that have not been parasitized. Taurine, in particular, is an important neurotransmitter in insects, and it also regulates the brain\u2019s ability to sense a lack of water. Hence, it is possible that the parasite induces its host to commit suicide by causing biochemical changes in its brain that alter the host\u2019s perception of thirst. The papers by Eberhard (2001) and Thomas et al. (2003) suggest that some parasites enslave their hosts by manipulating them chemically. But even in Eberhard\u2019s work, which indicates that the wasp injects a chemical into its spider host, the chemical in question has not been found. If this chemical were known, it could be injected into unparasitized spiders; if those spiders constructed cocoon webs, we would have a clear understanding of how the parasite manipulates the spider. Although a definitive chemical experiment such as this has yet to be performed, a similar genetic experiment was performed for gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar) enslaved by a virus (Hoover et al. 2011). Gypsy moths infected with this virus move to the tops of trees shortly before they die; after death, the bodies of the moths liquefy and release millions of infective viral particles. Uninfected gypsy moths do not exhibit this climbing behavior before death. Based on previous work, Hoover and colleagues hypothesized that the expression of a particular viral gene (the egt gene) caused infected moths to move to treetops shortly before death. In a laboratory test of this hypothesis, they found that moths infected with the typical, or wild-type, virus strain died at higher positions than did moths infected by viruses from which the suspect gene had been removed (FIGURE 13.22)\u2014strong evidence that they had succeeded in identifying the first known \u201censlaver gene.\u201d FIGURE 13.22 A Parasite Gene That Enslaves Its Host Gypsy moths infected by a virus (Lymantria dispar nucleopolyhedrovirus, or LdMNPV) climb to high locations before they die\u2014a behavior that benefits the virus but not the moth. To test the hypothesis that a particular viral gene (the egt gene) affects this behavior, researchers reported the height at death of gypsy moth caterpillars reared in cages and subjected to the following treatments: WT viruses (two different natural, or wild-type, viruses); EGT\u2013 viruses (two different experimental viruses from which the egt gene had been removed); and EGT+ viruses (two different experimental viruses from which the egt gene was first removed, then replaced). Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After K. Hoover et al. 2011. Science 333: 1401.) Explain why the researchers included the WT and EGT+ treatments. CONNECTIONS in NATURE FROM CHEMICALS TO EVOLUTION AND ECOSYSTEMS Enslaver parasites that manipulate their hosts exert strong selection pressure on host populations, so resistance to the manipulations of enslaver parasites might be expected to evolve in host populations.", "For example, selection would favor host individuals with the ability to recognize and destroy chemicals that a parasite uses to alter host behavior. Likewise, enslaver parasites might be expected to evolve the ability to overcome host resistance mechanisms. To date, we know of no such evidence of ongoing host\u2013enslaver parasite coevolution. However, interactions between enslaver parasites and their hosts do provide evidence of previous evolutionary change. Like any parasite, an enslaver parasite has adaptations that allow it to cope with host defenses (otherwise it would not survive). More specifically, an enslaver parasite that uses a chemical to manipulate a specific host behavior is beautifully adapted to take advantage of the body chemistry of its host. Such evolutionary links between enslaver parasites and their hosts illustrate a central feature of both ecology and evolution: ecological interactions affect evolution, and vice versa, at times making it difficult to distinguish one from the other (see Concept 6.5). As we\u2019ve seen in this chapter, the outcome of such ecological and evolutionary interactions can have profound effects on individuals, populations, communities, and ecosystems. As evolutionary change tips the balance back and forth, first in favor of the host, then in favor of the parasite, we can expect concomitant changes in the population dynamics of other species, such as those that compete with or eat the host or the parasite. Viewed in this way, communities and ecosystems are highly dynamic, always shifting in response to the ongoing ecological and evolutionary changes that are occurring within them. Competition KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 14.1 Competition can be direct or indirect, vary in its intensity, and occur between similar or dissimilar species. CONCEPT 14.2 Competing species are more likely to coexist when they use resources in different ways. CONCEPT 14.3 Competitive interactions can be modeled using the logistic equation. CONCEPT 14.4 The outcome of competition can be altered by predation, the physical environment, and disturbance. Competition in Plants That Eat Animals: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 Despite repeated reports that plants could eat animals, early scientists were skeptical of those claims. Charles Darwin (1875) laid their doubts to rest by providing clear experimental evidence of carnivory by plants. Today, more than 600 species of plants that eat animals have been identified, including bladderworts, sundews, pitcher plants, and the well-known Venus flytrap. Plants use a variety of mechanisms to eat animals. The Venus flytrap has modified leaves that look like fanged jaws yet attract insects with a sweet-smelling nectar (FIGURE 14.1). The inner surface of the leaf has touch-sensitive hairs; if an insect trips those hairs, the leaf snaps shut in less than half a second. Once the insect is captured, the trap tightens further, forming an airtight seal around its victim, which is then digested over the course of 5\u201312 days. Some plants can capture animals at truly blinding speeds. For example, aquatic bladderworts (Utricularia spp.) have a trapdoor that springs inward when touched, creating a suction that pulls in prey in less than half a millisecond. FIGURE 14.1 A Plant That Eats Animals Attracted to the plant\u2019s sweet-smelling nectar, this wasp is about to become a meal. Although the Venus flytrap typically captures insects, it can also feed on other animals, such as slugs and small frogs. Other plants lack moving parts yet still can eat animals. Consider the pitcher plants, which can use nectar or visual cues to lure insects into a pitcher-shaped trap. The inside of the pitcher often has downward-facing hairs, which make it easy for the insect to crawl in, but hard to crawl out. What\u2019s more, in many pitcher plants, once it is about halfway down, the insect encounters a layer of flaky wax. An insect that steps onto this wax is doomed: the wax sticks to its feet, causing it to lose its grip and tumble into a vat that contains either water (in which it drowns) or deadly digestive juices. Why do some plants eat animals? The answer may relate to the subject of this chapter: competition. Because plants are immobile, competition for limiting resources such as nutrients or water can be intense. Many carnivorous plants are found in environments with nutrient-poor soils. Furthermore, evolutionary relationships among plants reveal that in nutrient-poor environments, carnivory has evolved multiple times, in a variety of independent plant lineages.", "Overall, these observations suggest that carnivory in plants is an adaptation for life in nutrient-poor environments\u2014perhaps providing a way to avoid competing with other plants for soil nutrients. Does eating animals allow plants to better deal with competition for nutrients? Typically, the root systems of carnivorous plants are less extensive than those of noncarnivorous plants that live in the same area, which suggests that the carnivorous plants may be poorer competitors for soil resources. Hence, carnivorous plants could use animal prey as an alternative source of nutrients when competition is intense. To test this idea, Stephen Brewer measured how the growth of the pitcher plant Sarracenia alata was affected when he cut off its access to prey (by covering the pitchers) and when he reduced noncarnivorous competitor plant species (\u201cneighbors\u201d) by weeding and clipping. His results show that biomass in Sarracenia increased when neighbors were reduced (FIGURE 14.2), suggesting that competition had an important effect on growth. But further examination of Figure 14.2 reveals that matters are not as simple as they may at first appear. Although the growth of pitcher plants with competition was expected to decline when they were deprived of prey, that did not happen. Instead, it seems that pitcher plants were only able to benefit from animal prey when neighbors were removed. Why is this so? FIGURE 14.2 Competition Decreases Growth in a Carnivorous Plant To test the effects of competition on the carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia alata, the growth of control plants (\u201cneighbors present\u201d) was compared with the growth of plants whose noncarnivorous competitors were weeded and clipped (\u201cneighbors removed\u201d). Neighbor removal increased plant growth, especially when animal prey were available. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After J. S. Brewer. 2003. Ecology 84: 451\u2013462.) View the script for the video Introduction In 1917, A. G. Tansley reported results from a series of experiments designed to explain the distribution in Britain of two species of bedstraw plants, Galium hercynicum and G. pumilum (then known as G. sylvestre). Galium hercynicum was restricted to acidic soils, G. pumilum to calcareous soils. Even in places where the two species grew within inches of each other, each remained confined to its characteristic soil type. In his experiments, Tansley found that when grown alone, each species could survive on both acidic and calcareous soils. However, when he grew the species together on acidic soils, only G. hercynicum survived, and if he grew them together on calcareous soils, only G. pumilum survived. Tansley concluded that the two species competed with each other and that when grown on its native soil type, each species drove the other to extinction. Tansley\u2019s work on bedstraws is one of the first experiments ever performed on competition, a non-trophic interaction between individuals of two or more species in which all species are negatively affected by their shared use of a resource that limits their ability to grow, reproduce, or survive. In this chapter, we specifically focus on interspecific competition (between individuals of different species) as opposed to intraspecific competition (between individuals of a single species), as in density-dependent growth, a topic we addressed in Chapters 10 and 11. What are some of the resources that species compete for? Resources are simply the components of the environment, such as food, water, light, and space that are required by species. Food is an obvious example \u2014when food is scarce, population growth rates fall unless individuals can successfully compete. In terrestrial ecosystems\u2014especially arid ones\u2014water is also a resource. But an organism does not need to consume a substance for it to be a resource. Plants \u201cconsume\u201d light in the sense that they use it to fix carbon, and they can deplete the supply available to other plants by shading them. Space is also an important resource. Plants, algae, and sessile animals require space to attach and grow, and competition for space can be intense. Mobile animals also compete for space as they seek access to foraging grounds, territories to attract mates, or refuges from heat, cold, or predators. Finally, the full set of resources, along with other biotic and abiotic requirements, is what is known as the ecological or fundamental niche of a species (FIGURE 14.3A). However, within the context of species interactions, no one species has exclusive access to all the resources within its fundamental niche. Thus, ecologists recognize a more restricted set of conditions that a species is limited to, in large part because of species interactions.", "These more restricted conditions form the realized niche of a species (FIGURE 14.3B). We will consider the niche concept later in Concept 14.2 and in Chapter 19 when we discuss resource partitioning. For now, let\u2019s begin our exploration of competition by considering some of its general characteristics. FIGURE 14.3 The Concept of a Fundamental and a Realized Niche In this conceptual representation of species 1\u2019s use of two resources, (A) its fundamental niche is contained within the entire blue area, but (B) the use of resources in that area is limited by interactions with other species, which set the limits of its realized niche. CONCEPT 14.1 Competition can be direct or indirect, vary in its intensity, and occur between similar or dissimilar species. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 14.1.1 Define the difference between exploitation competition and interference competition. 14.1.2 Analyze how and why competition can vary in its intensity. 14.1.3 Describe the importance of competition within communities. General Features of Competition The simple definition of competition as two or more species negatively affecting one another because of shared resources belies the complicated ways in which species actually compete with one another. Because resources are the mitigating factor in the interaction, and each species requires and obtains resources in different ways, the mechanisms used to compete and the intensity and ultimate outcome of competition can vary widely among species. Let\u2019s next consider some of the ways in which species compete. Species may compete directly or indirectly Species often compete indirectly through their mutual effects on the availability of a shared resource. Known as exploitation competition, this type of competition occurs simply because individuals reduce the supply of a shared resource as they use it. We have already considered an example of exploitation competition in the Case Study on pitcher plants. The other kind of competition is interference competition, a case in which one species directly interferes with the ability of its competitors to use a limiting resource. Such interactions are perhaps most familiar in mobile animals, as when carnivores fight with one another over animal prey. Similarly, herbivores such as voles may aggressively exclude other vole species from preferred habitat, and members of warring ant colonies may kidnap and slaughter one another. Interference competition can also occur among sessile animals. For example, as it grows, the acorn barnacle Semibalanus balanoides often crushes or smothers nearby individuals of another barnacle species, Chthamalus stellatus. As a result, Semibalanus directly prevents Chthamalus from living in most portions of the rocky intertidal zone (we\u2019ll describe competition between these barnacles in more detail in Concept 14.4). Interference competition also occurs in plants, as when one plant species grows over another, reducing its access to light (FIGURE 14.4). There is also circumstantial evidence that interference competition can take the form of allelopathy, in which individuals of one species release toxins that harm other species. Although allelopathy appears to be important in some crop systems (Minorsky 2002; Belz 2007), there is little experimental evidence for it in natural communities. One reason for this lack of evidence is that in a species in which allelopathy is suspected, all members can usually produce the chemical that is thought to act as a toxin\u2014hence, it has not been possible to compare the performance of individuals that can produce the toxin with that of individuals that cannot. In a promising new line of research, genes that code for allelopathic toxins have been identified in some plant species, which has allowed researchers to develop genetic varieties in which these genes are disabled, or \u201csilenced.\u201d In current experiments, both plants in which the production of allelopathic toxins has been silenced and plants able to produce these toxins are being grown with members of other species, thus providing a rigorous test of the effects of allelopathy in competitive environments. FIGURE 14.4 Interference Competition in Plants A formidable competitor, the kudzu vine (Pueraria montana) has grown over and completely covered these Georgia trees and shrubs, outcompeting them for light. Competition can vary in intensity depending on resource availability and type Plants can compete for aboveground resources, such as light, as well as for belowground resources, such as soil nutrients. Researchers have suggested that the relative importance of aboveground and belowground competition in plants might change depending on whether aboveground or belowground resources are more scarce: belowground competition, for example, might be expected to increase in intensity when the competing plants are growing in nutrient-poor soils.", "Scott Wilson and David Tilman tested this idea by performing transplant experiments with Schizachyrium scoparium, a perennial grass species native to their study site in Minnesota. Wilson and Tilman selected a series of 5 \u00d7 5 m plots of natural vegetation growing in sandy, nitrogen-poor soils. For 3 years, they treated half of the plots with high-nitrogen fertilizer each year. This 3-year period gave the plant communities in the fertilized plots time to adjust to the experimentally imposed change in soil nitrogen levels. At the end of the 3-year period, they planted Schizachyrium individuals in all the plots. Once they were added to the high-nitrogen (fertilized) and low-nitrogen (unfertilized) plots, Schizachyrium individuals were grown under three treatments: (1) with neighbors present (competition), (2) with neighbor roots present but neighbor stems tied back (which prevented aboveground competition with Schizachyrium), or (3) with neighbor roots and stems both removed (no competition). Wilson and Tilman found that while total competition (the sum of belowground and aboveground competition) did not differ between the low-and high-nitrogen plots, belowground competition was most intense in the low-nitrogen plots (FIGURE 14.5A). They also found that aboveground competition increased when light levels were low (FIGURE 14.5B). Thus, their work demonstrates that the intensity of competition can increase when the particular resource being competed for is scarce. FIGURE 14.5 Resource Availability Affects the Intensity of Competition (A) In transplant experiments with the grass Schizachyrium scoparium, belowground competition between plant species for nutrients increased in intensity when soil nutrients were scarce. (B) Similarly, aboveground competition for light increased as light levels decreased. (After S. D. Wilson and D. Tilman. 1993. Ecology 74: 599\u2013611.) Competition is often asymmetrical When two species compete for a resource that is in short supply, each obtains less of the resource than it could if the competitor were not present. Because competition reduces the resources available for the growth, reproduction, and survival of both species, the abundance of each species is reduced to some extent. In many cases, however, the effects of competition are unequal, or asymmetrical: one species is harmed more than the other. This asymmetry is especially clear in situations in which one competitor drives another to extinction. For example, in a laboratory experiment, Tilman et al. (1981) examined competition for silica (SiO )2 between species of freshwater diatoms, which use silica to construct their cell walls. Tilman and colleagues grew two diatom species, Synedra ulna and Asterionella formosa, alone and in competition with each other. They measured how the population densities of the diatoms and silica concentrations in the water changed over time. When grown alone, each species reduced silica (the resource) to a low and approximately constant concentration; each species also reached a stable population size (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 14.6). Synedra had a lower stable population size than Asterionella, and it reduced silica to lower levels than did Asterionella. When the two species competed with each other, Synedra drove Asterionella to extinction, apparently because it reduced silica to such low levels that Asterionella could not survive. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 14.6 Competition Is Often Asymmetrical David Tilman and his colleagues demonstrated competition between two diatom species for silica by growing them alone and in competition with each other. Synedra (A) reduced silica concentrations to lower levels than did Asterionella (B). This result may explain why Synedra outcompeted Asterionella when the two species were grown together (C). (After D. Tilman et al. 1981. Limnol Oceanogr 26: 1020\u20131033.) Suppose a third diatom species reduced the concentration of silica to 5 \u00b5mol/L when grown alone. Predict what would happen if this species were grown in competition with Asterionella. As this example suggests, before the inferior competitor goes extinct, the superior competitor typically loses potential resources to its competitor or invests energy in the competitive interaction. Hence, even when one species drives the other to extinction, both the superior and the inferior competitor are harmed to some extent. However, the effect of the superior competitor is still greater than the effect of the inferior competitor. Indeed, in general, there is a continuum in how strongly each competitor affects the other (FIGURE 14.7). Note that the two ends of this continuum do not represent competitive (\u2013/\u2013) interactions. Instead, such interactions are referred to as amensalism, \u2013/0 interactions in which individuals of one species are harmed while individuals of the other species are not affected at all.", "Possible examples of amensal interactions include small woody plants that grow beneath towering trees, or corals in which the individuals of one species can grow over those of another, depriving them of light. FIGURE 14.7 A Continuum of Competitive Effects Competition may affect members of both species equally, or the members of one species may be harmed more than are members of the other species. Bars that are thick indicate strong competitive effects. Indicate the interactions that represent asymmetrical competition. Competition can occur between closely or distantly related species We\u2019ve seen that competition can occur between pairs of closely related species, such as the diatom species studied by Tilman. Brown and Davidson (1977) examined whether competition also occurs between groups of more distantly related species. In particular, they suspected that rodents and ants might compete because both eat the seeds of desert plants, and the sizes of the seeds they eat overlap considerably (FIGURE 14.8). FIGURE 14.8 Ants and Rodents Compete for Seeds There is extensive overlap in the sizes of seeds eaten by ants and by rodents. Removal experiments showed that these two distantly related groups compete for this food source. (After J. H. Brown and D. W. Davidson. 1977. Science 196: 4292.) 2 Brown and Davidson established experimental plots (each about 1,000 m ) in a desert region near Tucson, Arizona. Their experiment lasted 3 years and used four treatments: (1) plots in which a \u00bc-inch wire mesh fence excluded seed-eating rodents and from which rodents within the fence were removed by trapping; (2) plots in which seed-eating ants were excluded by applying insecticides; (3) plots in which both rodents and ants were excluded by fencing, trapping, and insecticides; and (4) plots in which both rodents and ants were left undisturbed (control plots). The results indicated that rodents and ants do compete for food. Relative to the control plots, the number of ant colonies increased by 71% in the plots from which rodents were excluded, and rodents increased by 18% in number and 24% in biomass in the plots from which ants were excluded. In the plots from which both rodents and ants were excluded (treatment 3), the density of seeds increased by 450% compared with all other plots. Treatments 1 (no rodents), 2 (no ants), and 4 (the control plots, with both rodents and ants present) all resulted in similar densities of seeds. These results suggest that when either rodents or ants were removed, the group that remained ate roughly as many seeds as rodents and ants combined ate in the control plots. Thus, under natural conditions, each group would be expected to eat fewer seeds in the presence of the other group than it could eat when alone. It is not surprising that species as different as ants and rodents compete. After all, people differ greatly from bacteria, fungi, and insects, yet we compete with these organisms for food in farm fields, in grain storage bins\u2014even in our refrigerators. Overall, whether they are closely or distantly related, organisms can compete if they share the use of a limiting resource. Competition for resources is common in natural communities How important is competition in natural communities? To answer this question, results from many field studies must be compiled and analyzed. The findings of three such analyses indicate that competition has important effects on many species. For example, Schoener (1983) examined the results of 164 published studies on competition and found that of 390 species studied, 76% showed effects of competition under some circumstances, and 57% showed effects of competition under all circumstances tested. Connell (1983) examined the results of 72 studies and found that competition was important for 50% of the 215 species studied. Gurevitch et al. (1992) took a different approach: they did not report the percentage of species for which competition was important, but rather analyzed the magnitude of competitive effects found for 93 species in 46 studies published between 1980 and 1989. They showed that competition had significant (though variable) effects on a wide range of organisms. Surveys such as those by Schoener, Connell, and Gurevitch et al. face potential sources of bias, including investigators\u2019 failure to publish studies that show no significant effects and the tendency for investigators to study \u201cinteresting\u201d species (i.e., those they suspect will show competition). Despite such potential sources of bias, the fact that hundreds of studies have documented effects of competition makes it clear that competition is common\u2014though not ubiquitous\u2014in nature.", "We explore the relative importance of competition to community structure in Chapter 19. Self-Assessment 14.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 14.2 Competing species are more likely to coexist when they use resources in different ways. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 14.2.1 Define the competitive exclusion principle and explain how it differs from competitive coexistence. 14.2.2 Define and give examples of resource partitioning (or niche partitioning). 14.2.3 Describe how competition can lead to character displacement and resource partitioning. Competitive Coexistence As indicated above, ecologists have long thought that competition between species was important in communities. For example, although he often focused on competition within species, Darwin (1859) also argued that competition between species could influence both ecological and evolutionary processes. Darwin recognized that interspecific competition could lead to two possible outcomes. At one extreme, if a dominant species prevents another species from using essential resources, the inferior species may become locally extinct, a process known as competitive exclusion. We saw this result in the diatom example tested in a laboratory setting (see Interactive Figure 14.6). However, in reality, most species show some sort of competitive coexistence, or the ability to coexist with one another despite sharing limiting resources. Let\u2019s consider some general features of competition that lead to either competitive exclusion or competitive coexistence. Competitors that use limiting resources in the same way cannot coexist In the 1930s, the Russian ecologist G. F. Gause performed laboratory experiments on competition using three species of the single-celled protist group Paramecium. He constructed miniature aquatic ecosystems by growing paramecia in tubes filled with a liquid medium that contained bacteria and yeast cells as a food supply. He found that grown alone, P. caudatum and P. bursaria populations showed logistic growth and reached a stable carrying capacity (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 14.9A). When grown together, each species showed slower population growth, but they were able to coexist. However, when P. aurelia was grown in competition with P. caudatum, P. aurelia drove P. caudatum to extinction (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 14.9B). The difference in outcome, Gause suggested, was a consequence of P. caudatum and P. aurelia competing for bacteria as a food source, while P. bursaria avoided competition by eating yeast cells that settled to the bottom of the tubes. Thus, P. caudatum and P. bursaria partitioned their food resource in the presence of one another and were able to coexist as a result. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 14.9 Competition in Paramecium G. F. Gause grew three species of Paramecium in tubes filled with a liquid medium containing bacteria and yeast cells. (A) When grown alone, Paramecium caudatum and P. bursaria each showed logistic population growth and reached carrying capacity. When grown together, each species showed slower population growth, but they were able to coexist by feeding on different food items. (B) When P. caudatum was grown with P. aurelia, it experienced local extinction. (A after G. F. Gause. 1935. V\u00e9rifications Exp\u00e9rimentales de la Th\u00e9orie Math\u00e9matique de la Lutte pour la Vie. Hermann et Cie: Paris; B after G. F. Gause. 1934. The Struggle for Existence. Williams & Wilkins: Baltimore, MD.) Predict what would happen if P. aurelia and P. bursaria were grown together. Explain. Experiments with a wide range of other species (e.g., algae, flour beetles, plants, and flies) have yielded similar results: one species drives the other to extinction unless the two species use the available resources in different ways. Such results led to the formulation of the competitive exclusion principle, which states that two species that use a limiting resource in the same way cannot coexist indefinitely. As we\u2019ll see next, field observations are consistent with this explanation of why competitive exclusion occurs in some situations but not others. Competitors may coexist if they use resources differently In natural communities, many species use the same limiting resources yet manage to coexist with one another. This observation does not violate the competitive exclusion principle, because a key point of that principle is that species must use limiting resources in the same way. Field studies often reveal differences in how species use limiting resources. Such differences are referred to as resource partitioning (or, sometimes, niche partitioning). Thomas Schoener studied resource partitioning in four lowland Anolis lizard species that live on the West Indian island of Jamaica.", "Although these species all live together in trees and shrubs and eat similar foods, Schoener (1974) found differences among them in the height and thickness of their perches and in the time they spent in sun or shade. As a result of these differences, members of the different Anolis species competed less intensely than they otherwise would. (We explore this example in more detail in WEB EXTENSION 14.1.) In a marine example, Stomp et al. (2004) studied resource partitioning in two types of cyanobacteria collected from the Baltic Sea. The species identities of these cyanobacteria are unknown, so we will refer to them as BS1 and BS2 (standing for Baltic Sea 1 and Baltic Sea 2). BS1 absorbs green wavelengths of light efficiently, which it uses in photosynthesis. However, BS1 reflects most of the red light that strikes its surface; hence, it uses red wavelengths inefficiently (and is red in color). In contrast, BS2 absorbs red light and reflects green light; hence, BS2 uses green wavelengths inefficiently (and is green in color). Stomp and colleagues explored the consequences of these differences in a series of competition experiments. They found that each species could survive when grown alone under green or red light. However, when they were grown together under green light, the red cyanobacterium BS1 drove the green cyanobacterium BS2 to extinction (FIGURE 14.10A)\u2014as might be expected, since BS1 uses green light more efficiently than does BS2. Conversely, under red light, BS2 drove BS1 to extinction (FIGURE 14.10B), as also might be expected. Finally, when grown together under \u201cwhite light\u201d (the full spectrum of light, including both green and red light), both BS1 and BS2 persisted (FIGURE 14.10C). Taken together, these results suggest that BS1 and BS2 coexist under white light because they differ in which wavelengths of light they use most efficiently in photosynthesis. FIGURE 14.10 Do Cyanobacteria Partition Their Use of Light? Two types of cyanobacteria, BS1 and BS2, were grown together under (A) green light (550 nm), (B) red light (635 nm), and (C) \u201cwhite\u201d light (the full spectrum, which includes both green and red light). BS1 absorbs green light more efficiently than it absorbs red light; the reverse is true for BS2. Only BS1 persists when the two types are grown together under green light, and only BS2 persists when they are grown under red light. However, both types persist under white light, suggesting that BS1 and BS2 coexist by partitioning their use of light. (After M. Stomp et al. 2004. Nature 432: 104\u2013107.) Following up on their laboratory experiments, Stomp et al. (2007) analyzed the cyanobacteria present in 70 aquatic environments that ranged from clear ocean waters (where green light predominates) to highly turbid lakes (where red light predominates). As could be predicted from Figure 14.10, only red cyanobacteria were found in the clearest waters and only green cyanobacteria were found in highly turbid waters\u2014but both types were found in waters of intermediate turbidity, where both green and red light were available. Thus, the laboratory experiments and field surveys conducted by Stomp and colleagues suggest that red and green cyanobacteria coexist because they partition the use of a key limiting resource: the underwater light spectrum. Competition can lead to character displacement and resource partitioning When two species compete for resources, natural selection may favor individuals whose phenotype either (1) allows them to outcompete their competitors, resulting in competitive exclusion (see WEB EXTENSION 14.2 for an example using flies), or (2) allows them to partition their limiting resources, thus decreasing the intensity of competition. For example, when two fish species live apart from each other (each in its own lake), the two species may catch prey of similar size. If some factor (such as dispersal) were to cause members of these two species to live in the same lake, their use of resources would overlap considerably (FIGURE 14.11A). In such a situation, natural selection might favor individuals of species 1 whose morphology was such that they ate smaller prey, hence reducing competition with species 2; similarly, selection might favor individuals of species 2 that ate larger prey, hence reducing competition with species 1. Over time, such selection pressures could cause species 1 and species 2 to evolve to become different when they live together than when they live apart (FIGURE 14.11B). Such a process illustrates character displacement, which occurs when competition causes the phenotypes of competing species to evolve to become different over time.", "FIGURE 14.11 Character Displacement Competition for resources can cause competing species to change over time. Imagine that two fish species that once lived apart and tended to catch prey of about the same size are brought together in a single lake. (A) When the two species first come together, there is considerable overlap in the resources they use. (B) As the two species interact over time, the characteristics they use to obtain prey may evolve such that they tend to catch prey of different sizes. Character displacement appears to have occurred in two species of finches on the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. Specifically, the beak sizes of the two species, and hence the sizes of the seeds the birds eat, are different on islands where both species live than on islands that have only one of the two species (FIGURE 14.12). Field observations suggest that these two finch species probably differ when they live together because of competition, not because of other factors, such as differences in food supplies (Schluter et al. 1985; Grant and Grant 2006). FIGURE 14.12 Competition Shapes Beak Size On islands harboring both Geospiza fuliginosa and G. fortis, competition between these two species of Gal\u00e1pagos finches may have had a selective effect on the sizes of their beaks. (After D. Lack. 1947b. Darwin\u2019s Finches. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.) Data suggestive of character displacement have also been observed in plants, frogs, fishes, lizards, birds, and crabs: in each of these groups, there are pairs of species that consistently differ more where they live together than where they live apart. Additional evidence is needed, however, if we are to make a strong argument that such differences result from competition (as opposed to other factors). Strong support for the role of character displacement can come from experiments designed to test whether competition occurs and has a selective effect on morphology. Such experiments were conducted on sticklebacks of the genus Gasterosteus, a group of fish species whose morphology varies most when different species live in the same lake (Schluter 1994). The results indicated that individuals whose morphology differed the most from that of their competitors had a selective advantage: they grew more rapidly than did individuals whose morphology was more similar to that of their competitors. Support for character displacement has also been found in field experiments with spadefoot toad tadpoles (Pfennig et al. 2007) and in laboratory experiments with the bacterium Escherichia coli (Tyerman et al. 2008). In each of these studies, experimental results suggest that competition caused the observed morphological differences\u2014that is, that character displacement occurred\u2014 and the species were better able to partition their resources as a result. Evidence for resource partitioning has been used as an explanation for the patterns of species diversity found in communities, as we will see in Chapter 19. For now, let\u2019s next turn to mathematical models designed to predict whether the outcome of competition results in competitive exclusion or competitive coexistence. Self-Assessment 14.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 14.3 Competitive interactions can be modeled using the logistic equation. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 14.3.1 Formulate the components of the Lotka\u2013Volterra competition model, including the competition coefficient. 14.3.2 Diagram and interpret the four competitive outcomes of the Lotka\u2013Volterra competition model. The Lotka\u2013Volterra Competition Model Working independently of each other, A. J. Lotka (1932) and Vito Volterra (1926) both modeled competition by modifying the logistic equation. Recall from the discussion under Concept 11.3 that in the logistic equation, the rate at which a population changes in size (dN/dt) is or, alternatively, where N is the population size, r is the intrinsic rate of increase (the maximum possible growth rate for the species, achieved only under ideal conditions), and K is the number at which the population stops increasing in size (which can be interpreted as the carrying capacity of the population). As we have seen in Concept 14.2, competition deprives species of resources and hence reduces population growth rates. Thus, the presence of a competitor should reduce the growth rate of the original population. To incorporate the effects of the competitor species on one another, we can modify the logistic equation of each species by subtracting a competition coefficient, which is a constant used to indicate how strong the competitive effect of one species is on another. The new equations, known as the Lotka\u2013Volterra competition model, can be written as (14.1)", "In these equations, N1 is the population density of species 1, r1 is the intrinsic rate of increase of species 1, and K1 is the carrying capacity of species 1; N2, r2, and K2 are similarly defined for species 2. The competition coefficients (\u03b1 and \u03b2) are constants that describe the effect of one species on the other: \u03b1 is the effect of species 2 on species 1, and \u03b2 is the effect of species 1 on species 2. For example, if \u03b1 = 1, then individuals of the two species have the same effect in depressing the growth of species 1. If \u03b1 = 5, each individual of species 2 decreases the growth of species 1 by the same amount as five additional individuals of species 1. Thus, the competition coefficient \u03b1 is a measure of the effect, on a per individual basis, of species 2 on the population growth of species 1, measured relative to the effect of species 1. Similar reasoning applies to \u03b2, which is the effect, on a per individual basis, of species 1 on the population growth of species 2. We can also think of \u03b1 and \u03b2 as \u201ctranslation terms,\u201d each of which converts the number of individuals of one species into the number of individuals of the other species that has an equivalent effect on population growth rates. For example, if \u03b1 = 3, each individual of species 2 decreases the growth of species 1 by the same amount as would three individuals of species 1. Thus, if there are 100 individuals of species 2, it would take 300 individuals of species 1 to decrease the growth rate of species 1 by the same amount as do the 100 individuals of species 2 (i.e., \u03b1 = 3 and N2 = 100, so it takes \u03b1N2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 individuals of species 1 to have an equivalent effect). In the remainder of this section, we\u2019ll see how Equation 14.1 can be used to predict the outcome of competition; then we\u2019ll explore how competitive coexistence is affected by species interaction strength. Predicting the outcome of competition The outcome of competition can be predicted if we know how the population sizes of species 1 and species 2 are likely to change over time. For example, if the population size of species 2 is likely to increase while that of species 1 is likely to decrease to zero, then species 2 should drive its competitor to extinction, thus \u201cwinning\u201d the competitive interaction. A computer can be programmed to solve Equation 14.1, thereby predicting the population sizes of species 1 and 2 at different times. Here, however, we\u2019ll use a graphical approach to examine the conditions under which each species would be expected to increase or decrease in population size. We begin by determining when the population size of each competing species would stop changing in size. This approach, which we also used for the Lotka\u2013Volterra predator\u2013prey model (see Concept 12.3), is based on the idea that the population size (N) does not change when the population growth rate (dN/dt) equals zero (or reaches an equilibrium). For example, based on the Lotka\u2013Volterra competition model (Equation 14.1), the population size of species 1 does not change when dN1/dt = 0. When we set dN1/dt equal to zero, we find that the population size of species 1 (N1) does not change when (14.2) Likewise, the population size of species 2 (N2) does not change when (14.3) Notice that Equations 14.2 and 14.3 are straight lines, written with N1 as a function of N2 and N2 as a function of N1, respectively. Each of these lines is called the zero population growth isocline (or simply isocline), so named because a population does not increase or decrease in size for any combination of N1 and N2 that lies on these lines. For species 1, the abundance does not change when dN1/dt = 0, which occurs when N2 = K1/\u03b1 and N1 = K1. Similarly, for species 2, the abundance does not change when dN2/dt = 0, which occurs when N1 = K2/\u03b2 and N2 = K2. Once we determine K1/\u03b1 and K2/\u03b2, we can then plot the isoclines for both species 1 (x axis) and species 2 (y axis) in graphical form. For species 1, the isocline will be a diagonal line originating at the value N2 = K1/\u03b1 and ending at the value N1 = K1 (FIGURE 14.13A).", "This isocline represents the number of individuals of species 2 that would keep species 1\u2019s population from changing (or at equilibrium). For example, in Figure 14.13A, because a point to the right of the N1 isocline represents more individuals than zero population growth will allow, the population size of species 1 will decrease until it reaches the isocline. This is true for the entire region shaded in blue: the population size of species 1 decreases for all points to the right of the N1 isocline. In contrast, when the population size of species 1 is to the left of the N1 isocline, the population size of species 1 increases. Similar reasoning applies to species 2\u2019s isocline, which can be plotted as the diagonal line originating at the value N1 = K2/\u03b2 and ending at the value N2= K2(FIGURE 14.13B). This isocline represents the number of individuals of species 1 that would keep species 2\u2019s population from changing (or at equilibrium). Here the population size of species 2 decreases in regions above the N2 isocline and increases in regions below the N2 isocline. FIGURE 14.13 Graphical Analyses of Competition The zero population growth isoclines from the Lotka\u2013 Volterra competition model can be used to predict changes in the population sizes of competing species. (A) The N1 isocline. The change in population size of species 1 (indicated by black arrows or vectors) increases in the yellow region and decreases in the blue region. (B) The N isocline. The change in population size of species 2 (indicated by red arrows or 2 vectors) increases in the yellow region and decreases in the blue region. The graphical approach we have just described can be used to predict the end result of competition between species. To do this, we plot the N1 and N2 isoclines together. Because there are four possible ways that the N1 and N2 isoclines can be arranged relative to each other, we must make four different graphs. In two of these graphs, the isoclines do not cross, and competitive exclusion results: depending on which isocline is above the other, either species 1 (FIGURE 14.14A) or species 2 (FIGURE 14.14B) always drives the other to extinction. Note that in the regions shaded in blue, the population sizes of both species are greater than the population sizes on their isoclines, and hence both species decrease in number (as indicated by the thick black arrows). Similarly, in the regions shaded in yellow, the population sizes of both species are less than those on their isoclines, and hence both species increase in number. In the regions shaded in light or dark gray, one species increases in number (because its population sizes are less than those on its isocline) while the other decreases until the species that increases reaches its carrying capacity (K) and the species that decreases reaches zero and becomes extinct. FIGURE 14.14 Outcome of Competition in the Lotka\u2013Volterra Competition Model The outcome of competition depends on how the N and N isoclines are positioned relative to one another. (A) Competitive exclusion of 12 species 2 by species 1; species 1 always wins. (B) Competitive exclusion of species 1 by species 2; species 2 always wins. (C) The two species cannot coexist; either species 1 or species 2 wins depending on population sizes of both species. (D) Species 1 and species 2 coexist. The box in each graph indicates a stable equilibrium point\u2014a combination of population sizes of the two species that once reached, does not change over time. In (B), if K = 1,000 and if species 1 went extinct when N = 1,200, how would the population size of species 2 change 22 after the extinction of species 1? Competitive exclusion also occurs in the third graph (FIGURE 14.14C), but which species \u201cwins\u201d depends on whether the changing population sizes of the two species first enter the region shown in dark gray (in which case, species 2 drives species 1 to extinction) or the region shown in light gray (in which case, species 1 drives species 2 to extinction). Finally, FIGURE 14.14D shows the only case in which the two species coexist, and hence competitive exclusion does not occur. Although in this case neither species drives the other to extinction, competition still has an effect: the final or equilibrium population size of each species (indicated by the box in the figure) is lower than its carrying capacity, as in Gause\u2019s experiments with Paramecium (Interactive Figure 14.9A).", "Researchers have used the graphical approach described in Figure 14.14 to predict the outcome of competition under different ecological conditions. For example, Livdahl and Willey (1991) used this approach to predict whether competition with a native species of mosquito could prevent the invasion of an introduced mosquito species. You can explore their results in ANALYZING DATA 14.1. ANALYZING DATA 14.1 The mosquito Aedes albopictus breeds in small volumes of water, such as those in tree holes (cavities in trees that can hold water) and in abandoned tires. Introduced from Asia to North America in the 1980s, this species is a public health concern because it can transmit diseases such as dengue fever. Once in North America, A. albopictus colonized tree holes and tires, where it encountered thriving populations of several different native species of mosquitos. Livdahl and Willey (1991)* sought to predict the outcome of competition between A. albopictus and the native mosquito A. triseriatus, a predominant member of tree hole communities. To do this, they estimated competition coefficients and carrying capacities for A. albopictus and A. triseriatus mosquito larvae developing in water obtained from tree holes and from tires. Their results are shown in the table. Water obtained from tree holes Water obtained from tires Competition coefficients \u03b1 = 0.43 \u03b1 = 0.84 \u03b2 = 0.72 \u03b2 = 0.25 Carrying capacities (no. individuals/100 ml of water) K = 42.5 K = 33.4 11 K = 53.2 K = 44.7 22 1. Using Equation 14.1, designate A. triseriatus as species 1 and A. albopictus as species 2. Use the data in the table to plot the N and N isoclines (see Equations 14.2 and 14.3) for these two species competing in tree hole communities. 12 Predict the equilibrium population density (no. individuals per 100 ml of water) for each species. Describe the likely outcome of competition between these two species in tree hole communities. 2. On a separate graph, plot the N and N isoclines for these two species competing in tires. Predict the equilibrium 12 population density (no. individuals per 100 ml of water) for each species. Describe the likely outcome of competition between these two species in tires. 3. Is it likely that competition with the native species (A. triseriatus) will prevent the spread of the introduced species (A. albopictus)? Explain. See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. *Livdahl, T. P. and M. S. Willey. 1991. Prospects for an invasion: Competition between Aedes albopictus and native Aedes triseriatus. Science 253: 189\u2013191. The strength of competitive interactions affects coexistence Now that we\u2019ve seen the four possible outcomes predicted by the Lotka\u2013Volterra competition model, let\u2019s focus on the single case in which competitive coexistence occurs. As described in WEB EXTENSION 14.3, we can use Figure 14.14D to show that coexistence occurs when the values of \u03b1, \u03b2, K1, and K2 are such that the following inequality holds: (14.4) To see what we can learn from this inequality, consider a situation in which the competing species are equally strong competitors, indicating that \u03b1 = \u03b2. If the two species are also very similar in how they use resources, an individual of species 1 will have nearly the same effect on the growth rate of species 2 as would an individual of species 2 (and vice versa). Thus, when the two species use resources in very similar ways and thus strongly compete, \u03b1 and \u03b2 should both be close to 1. Suppose, for example, that \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0.95. If we substitute these values for \u03b1 and \u03b2 into Equation 14.4, we obtain This result suggests that when species strongly compete, coexistence is predicted only when the two species also have similar carrying capacities. In contrast, if the competing species do not compete strongly but rather differ greatly in how they use resources, \u03b1 and \u03b2 will be much lower than 1. To illustrate this case, suppose that \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0.1. In this situation, coexistence is predicted even if the carrying capacity of one species is nearly 10 times that of the other species, namely As you can demonstrate on your own, other values for the competition coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 yield similar results. Taken together, such analyses of the Lotka\u2013Volterra competition model suggest the following refinement of the competitive exclusion principle: competing species are more likely to coexist (and hence competitive exclusion is less likely) when they do not compete strongly but rather use resources in different ways.", "A variety of factors can influence how species divide their use of resources, thereby preventing one competitor from driving the other to extinction. As we\u2019ll see in the next section, some of these factors can alter the outcome of competition entirely, turning the inferior competitor into the superior one. Self-Assessment 14.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 14.4 The outcome of competition can be altered by predation, the physical environment, and disturbance. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 14.4.1 Describe how herbivores or predators can change or reverse the outcome of competition. 14.4.2 Explain how the physical environment can affect the outcome of competition and distribution of species. 14.4.3 Explain how disturbances can allow coexistence in highly asymmetrical competitive interactions. Altering the Outcome of Competition The outcome of competition between species can be changed by a broad suite of factors, including features of the physical environment, disturbance, and interactions with other species. For example, a difference in abiotic conditions\u2014as might occur from one place to another\u2014can cause a competitive reversal, in which the species that was the inferior competitor in one habitat becomes the superior competitor in another. Cases in which the outcome of competition is different under different abiotic conditions include Tansley\u2019s bedstraws, described in the Introduction, and Semibalanus balanoides in North America (see Figure 9.12). Interactions with other species can have similar effects on the outcome of competition between species. The presence of herbivores has been shown to reverse the outcome of competition between species of encrusting marine algae (Steneck et al. 1991) and between ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) and other plant species (FIGURE 14.15). Herbivores can have this effect if they prefer to feed on the superior competitor, thereby reducing the growth, survival, or reproduction of that species. What is true of herbivores is also true of predators, pathogens, and mutualists: an increase or decrease in the abundance of such species can change the outcome of competition among the species with which they interact. FIGURE 14.15 Herbivores Can Alter the Outcome of Competition Ragwort flea beetles are herbivores that feed on ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), an invasive plant species. The graph tracks the biomasses of ragwort, grasses, and forbs (broad-leaved herbaceous plants) at a site in western Oregon after the flea beetle was introduced there in 1980. The results show that in the absence of the flea beetle, ragwort was a superior competitor, but it declined precipitously when the beetle was introduced. (After P. McEvoy et al. 1991. Ecol Appl 1: 430\u2013432.) In later chapters, we\u2019ll explore many examples in which species interactions alter competitive outcomes \u2014sometimes preventing a superior competitor from driving other species to extinction. Here, we\u2019ll focus on the effects of the physical environment and disturbance. The physical environment can affect competition and ultimately the distribution of species In a series of classic experiments, Joseph Connell (1961a,b) examined factors that influenced the local distribution, survival, and reproduction of two barnacle species, Chthamalus stellatus and Semibalanus balanoides. The larvae of barnacles drift through ocean waters, then settle on rocks or other surfaces (such as boat hulls), where they metamorphose into adults, forming a hard outer shell. At Connell\u2019s study site along the coast of Scotland, the distributions of Chthamalus and Semibalanus larvae overlapped considerably: the larvae of both species were found throughout the upper and middle intertidal zones. However, adult Chthamalus were usually found only near the top of the intertidal zone, whereas adult Semibalanus were not found there but were found throughout the rest of the intertidal zone (FIGURE 14.16). What accounted for these differences in distribution? FIGURE 14.16 Squeezed Out by Competition Removal experiments at a field site in Scotland showed that competition mediated by the physical environment determines the local distribution of two species of barnacles, Chthamalus stellatus and Semibalanus balanoides. (After J. H. Connell. 1961. Ecology 42: 710.) To answer this question, Connell examined the effects of competition and of abiotic features of the environment, such as the risk of desiccation (drying out because of exposure to air, which is greatest in the upper intertidal zone). To test the importance of competition under different abiotic conditions, he chose some individual young barnacles of each species that had settled in each zone and removed all nearby members of the other species. For other focal individuals, he left nearby members of the other species in place.", "He found that competition with Semibalanus excluded Chthamalus from all but the top of the intertidal zone, where Chthamalus was able to thrive under reduced competition. As they grew, Semibalanus smothered (by growing on top of), removed (by growing underneath, hence prying off the rocks), and crushed the Chthamalus in the middle intertidal but not in the upper intertidal zone. Averaging across all regions of the intertidal zone, only 14% of Chthamalus survived their first year when faced with competition from Semibalanus, whereas 72% survived where Connell had removed Semibalanus. Chthamalus individuals that survived a year of competition with Semibalanus were small and reproduced poorly. Semibalanus, in contrast, was not affected strongly by competition with Chthamalus. However, whether Chthamalus was removed or not, Semibalanus dried out and survived poorly near the top of the intertidal zone. Thus, Semibalanus appears to have been excluded from that zone by its sensitivity to desiccation rather than its interactions with Chthamalus. As observed for Tansley\u2019s bedstraw plants and Connell\u2019s barnacles, competition can restrict the local distribution of a species to a particular set of environmental conditions\u2014the bedstraws, for example, could be growing inches away from each other, but each species was restricted to a particular soil type. Competition has also been shown to prevent a wide range of species, including mammals, marine invertebrates, birds, and plants, from occupying geographic regions in which they would otherwise thrive. In some cases, a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d\u2014a situation in nature that is similar in effect to a controlled removal experiment\u2014provides evidence that competition can vary depending on environmental conditions and ultimately affect geographic distributions. Such a situation was found for chipmunks in the genus Tamias (previously known as Neotamias or Eutamias). These chipmunks live in forests on mountains in the southwestern United States, where mountain ranges are separated from one another by desert flatlands. Patterson (1980, 1981) studied the distributions of Tamias chipmunks and found that when a species lived alone on a mountain range because it preferred those environmental conditions, it consistently occupied a broader range of habitats and elevations than when it lived with a competitor species (FIGURE 14.17). As in Connell\u2019s removal experiments, this result suggests that competition may have prevented some Tamias chipmunk species from living in areas of otherwise suitable habitat. FIGURE 14.17 A Natural Experiment on Competition between Chipmunk Species Observations of the distributions of Tamias chipmunks on mountain ranges in New Mexico suggest that competition may restrict the habitats in which they live. Similar results were obtained for Tamias species living in Nevada. (After M. V. Lomolino et al. 2006. Biogeography, 3rd ed. Oxford University Press/Sinauer: Sunderland, MA.) Disturbance can prevent competition from running its course As we saw in Concept 9.3, a disturbance such as a fire or major storm may kill or damage some individuals while creating opportunities for others. Some species can persist in an area only if such disturbances occur regularly. Forests, for example, contain some herbaceous plant species that require abundant sunlight and are therefore found only in areas where wind or fire has created an opening in the tree canopy. Over time, a population of such plants is doomed: as trees recolonize the area, shade increases to the point at which the species are competitively excluded. Such species are called fugitive species because they must disperse from one place to another to take advantage of disturbances that open up resources and allow them to avoid competitive exclusion. Robert Paine, a marine ecologist from the University of Washington, has described how periodic disturbance allows a fugitive algal species, the sea palm (Postelsia palmaeformis), to coexist with a competitively dominant species, the mussel Mytilus californianus. The sea palm is a brown alga that lives in the intertidal zone and must attach itself to rocks to grow. It competes for attachment space with mussels. Although a sea palm can outcompete an individual mussel (by growing on top of it), the sea palm is eventually displaced by other mussels that grow in from the side. Competition with mussels causes sea palm populations to decline over time (FIGURE 14.18). Hence, if competition ran its course, mussels would drive sea palm populations to extinction. That is exactly what happens on low-disturbance shorelines (with a mean rate of 1.7 disturbances per year), where waves only occasionally tear patches of mussels from the rocks.", "However, sea palms can persist in shoreline areas where high-energy waves remove mussels more frequently (with a mean rate of 7.7 disturbances per year), thereby creating temporary openings for sea palm individuals. FIGURE 14.18 Population Decline in an Inferior Competitor Lacking Disturbance In this graph, each point represents an observed change in density (N, the number of individuals per square meter) from one year (year x) to the next (year x + 1) at sites where sea palms are growing in competition with mussels and lack disturbance. These points can be used to estimate a replacement curve (blue line), which shows the extent to which sea palm individuals replace themselves over time without disturbance. The exact replacement curve (red line) shows the densities at which the population size would not change from one year to the next. (After R. T. Paine. 1979. Science 205: 685\u2013687.) Based on the observed replacement curve (the blue line), how many years would it take for a sea palm population to decline from 100 individuals to fewer than 20 individuals? Self-Assessment 14.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Competition in Plants That Eat Animals In plants, competition for nutrients can be especially important (see Figure 14.5), but other resources, such as light and water, can also be in short supply. Carnivorous plants live in nutrient-poor soils, and their root systems are usually less well developed than the root systems of their noncarnivorous neighbors. As noted in the Case Study, these observations suggest that carnivorous plants may be poor competitors for soil nutrients and hence may rely on eating animals to obtain the nutrients they need for growth. These observations suggest that carnivorous plants might be especially hard-hit by belowground competition if they were denied access to their unique, alternative source of nutrients (animal prey). Instead, contrary to what would be expected if competition for nutrients were important, Sarracenia alata was not especially hard-hit when neighbors were present and pitchers were deprived of prey (see Figure 14.2). In fact, when neighbors were present, pitcher plants had the same biomass regardless of whether they had access to prey. These results suggest that there was relatively little competition between Sarracenia and noncarnivorous plants for soil nutrients and that some other factor was driving the positive response these plants had to neighbor removal. Further investigation revealed that competition for light appeared to be more important to pitcher plants. Brewer found that neighbors reduced the availability of light to Sarracenia by a factor of 10. When neighbors were removed, Sarracenia responded by greatly increasing its growth, especially if pitchers were open and the plants could capture prey (see Figure 14.2). Hence, Sarracenia responded to higher light levels when neighbors were removed by growing more rapidly\u2014but only if prey were available to supply the extra nutrients they needed for such growth. Overall, it appears that pitcher plants compete with their neighbors for light but avoid competition for soil nutrients by eating animals and by using changes in light levels as a cue for growth. When light levels are low\u2014as would be the case when it is shaded by competitors\u2014Sarracenia grows little and hence requires few nutrients. In such a situation, prey deprivation has little effect because the plant does not need extra nutrients. When light levels are high, however\u2014as would occur after a fire or whenever few competitors are present\u2014Sarracenia is stimulated to grow. Under these circumstances, prey deprivation has a major effect because animal prey supply most of the nutrients that it uses for growth. CONNECTIONS in NATURE THE PARADOX OF DIVERSITY As we\u2019ve seen, some field data show that superior competitors can drive inferior competitors extinct\u2014which is exactly what the competitive exclusion principle states should happen whenever two or more species use the same set of limiting resources. Natural communities, however, contain many species that share the use of scarce resources without driving one another to extinction. Pitcher plants, for example, coexist with a diverse group of other species (FIGURE 14.19), even though they were predicted to be inferior competitors for soil nutrients. In the context of Brewer\u2019s experiments on pitcher plants, let\u2019s reconsider why superior competitors do not always drive inferior competitors to extinction. FIGURE 14.19 Coexistence in a Nutrient-Poor Environment The pitcher plant Sarracenia alata, seen in the close-up at the left, coexists with noncarnivorous plants that can outcompete it for both nutrients and light.", "The concept of resource partitioning suggests that a number of species could coexist in nutrient-poor environments if they avoided competition for scarce nutrients by acquiring them in different ways. This idea helped to motivate Brewer\u2019s study: he wanted to know whether differences in their means of nutrient acquisition could explain the coexistence of carnivorous and noncarnivorous plants. To find out, Brewer deprived carnivorous plants of their unique source of nutrients (animal prey), thus increasing the overlap between the ways in which carnivorous and noncarnivorous plants acquired nutrients. If competition for nutrients was important, pitcher plants that were deprived of prey should have experienced more severe competitive effects, or they should have compensated for reduced nutrient intake by increasing their production of roots or pitchers. Neither of these outcomes occurred, so Brewer sought other explanations of species coexistence. As we\u2019ll see in Concept 19.3, environmental variation provides a second mechanism for the coexistence of species in communities: if environmental conditions fluctuate over space or time (or both), species may coexist if different species are superior competitors under different environmental conditions. Tansley\u2019s bedstraw example (given in the Introduction) illustrates how differences in soils can alter the outcome of competition, thus promoting coexistence in environments that vary over space. With respect to variation over time, an inferior competitor may persist whenever competition fails to run its course. Consider a species such as the sea palm (see Figure 14.18), which competes poorly but tolerates disturbance well. Such a species may persist if a disturbance periodically \u201cresets the clock\u201d by decreasing the abundance of a superior competitor before that species drives the inferior competitor to extinction. Such a scenario may also apply to the pitcher plant Sarracenia alata. The habitat in which it lives is prone to fire; pitcher plants tolerate fire well, and they use changes in light levels as a cue for growth. As a result, Sarracenia grows primarily when its competitors are reduced by fire. This growth strategy may allow it to escape competition for nutrients by reducing its demand for scarce nutrients when competition is potentially most intense (i.e., in years without fire) and increasing its demand for nutrients when competitors have been reduced (years with fire). Mutualism and Commensalism KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 15.1 In positive interactions, no species is harmed and the benefits are greater than the costs for at least one species. CONCEPT 15.2 Each partner in a mutualistic interaction acts in ways that serve its own ecological and evolutionary interests. CONCEPT 15.3 Positive interactions affect the abundances and distributions of populations as well as the structure of ecological communities. The First Farmers: A Case Study Humans first began to farm about 10,000 years ago. Agriculture was a revolutionary development that led to great increases in the size of our population as well as to innovations in government, science, the arts, and many other aspects of human societies. But people were far from the first species to farm. That distinction goes to ants in the tribe Attini, a group of 210 species, most of which live in tropical forests of South America. These ants, known informally as the attines or fungus-growing ants, started cultivating fungi for food at least 50 million years before the first human farmers (FIGURE 15.1). FIGURE 15.1 Collecting Food for Their Fungi Fungus-growing ants (Atta cephalotes) in Costa Rica carry leaf segments to their colony, where the leaves will be fed to the fungus (the gray material) the ants cultivate for food. Like human farmers, the ant farmers nourish, protect, and feed on the species they grow, forming a relationship that benefits both the farmer and the crop. The attines cannot survive without the fungi they cultivate; many of the fungi depend on the ants as well. When a virgin queen ant leaves her mother\u2019s nest to mate and begin a new colony, she carries in her mouth some of the fungi from her birth colony. The fungi are cultivated in subterranean gardens (FIGURE 15.2). An ant colony may contain hundreds of gardens, each roughly the size of a football; these gardens can provide enough food to support 2\u20138 million ants. Some attines occasionally replace the fungi in their gardens with new, free-living fungi that they gather from surrounding soils. Other species, such as leaf-cutter ants in the genera Atta and Acromyrmex, do not cultivate fungi found in the environment. Instead, the fungi in their gardens come only from propagules passed from a parent ant colony to each of its descendant colonies. FIGURE 15.2", "The Fungal Garden of a Leaf-Cutter Ant (A) A diagrammatic representation of a large Atta leaf-cutter ant colony. (B) This photo shows a cutaway view of a garden chamber in a central Paraguay colony of the leaf-cutter ant Atta laevigata. Inside the chamber is a specialized structure called a gongylidia, which is produced by the cultivated fungus and eaten by the ants. (A after B. Hldobler and E. O. Wilson. 1990. The Ants. Belknap Press of Harvard University Press: Cambridge, MA; modified from J. C. M. Jonkman, in Weber 1979.) As their name suggests, leaf-cutter ants cut portions of leaves from plants and feed them to the fungi in their gardens. Back at the nest, the ants chew the leaves to a pulp, fertilize them with their own droppings, and \u201cweed\u201d the fungal gardens to help control bacterial and fungal invaders. In turn, the cultivated fungi produce specialized structures, called gongylidia, on which the ants feed. The partnership between leaf-cutter ants and fungi has been called an \u201cunholy alliance\u201d because each partner helps the other to overcome the formidable defenses that protect plants from being eaten. The ants, for example, scrape a waxy covering from the leaves that the fungi have difficulty penetrating, while the fungi digest and render harmless the chemicals that plants use to kill or deter insect herbivores. But all is not perfect in the gardens. Nonresident fungi, which themselves would benefit from ant cultivation, periodically invade leaf-cutter ant colonies. Furthermore, pathogens and parasites that attack the cultivated fungi occasionally outstrip the ants\u2019 ability to weed them out. What prevents such unwanted guests from destroying the gardens? Introduction Chapters 12, 13, and 14 emphasized interactions between species in which at least one member is harmed (predation, herbivory, parasitism, and competition). But life on Earth is also shaped by positive interactions, those in which one or both species benefit and neither is harmed. Most vascular plants, for example, form beneficial associations with fungi that improve the growth and survival of both species. In fact, fossil evidence indicates that the earliest vascular plants formed similar associations with fungi more than 400 million years ago (Selosse and Le Tacon 1998). These early vascular plants lacked true roots, so their interactions with fungi may have increased their access to soil resources and aided their colonization of land. As this example suggests, positive interactions have influenced key events in the history of life as well as the growth and survival of organisms living today. As we\u2019ll see in this chapter, positive interactions can also influence the outcome of other types of interactions among organisms, thus shaping communities and influencing ecosystems. We will begin our study of positive interactions with definitions of some key terms and an overview of the scope of these interactions in ecological communities. CONCEPT 15.1 In positive interactions, no species is harmed, and the benefits are greater than the costs for at least one species. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 15.1.1 Compare mutualism and commensalism and give examples of their importance in communities. 15.1.2 Describe how positive interactions form and evolve over space and time. 15.1.3 Explain how positive interactions can vary in their strength under different physical environments. Positive Interactions There are two fundamental types of positive interactions: mutualism and commensalism. Mutualism is a mutually beneficial interaction between individuals of two or more species (+/+ relationship). Commensalism is an interaction in which individuals of one species benefit, while those of the other species do not benefit and are not harmed (+/0 relationship). Many ecologists refer to mutualism and commensalism collectively as facilitation. In some cases, the species involved in a positive interaction form a symbiosis, a relationship in which individuals of the two species live in close physical and/or physiological contact with each other. Examples include the relationships between pea aphids and their bacterial symbionts (see Concept 13.2) and between humans and bacteria (we have a diverse set of bacteria living in our guts, many of which are beneficial). However, parasites also form symbiotic associations with their hosts (see Figure 13.3). Thus, symbiotic relationships can range from parasitism (+/\u2013) to commensalism (+/0) to mutualism (+/+). In mutualism and commensalism, the growth, reproduction, or survival of individuals of one or multiple species is increased by their interaction with other species (and no species is harmed). The benefits can take a variety of forms.", "A species may provide its partner with food, shelter, or a substrate to grow on; it may transport its partner\u2019s pollen or seeds; it may reduce heat or water stress; or it may decrease the negative effects of competitors, herbivores, predators, or parasites. In a mutualism, there can be costs to an organism that provides a benefit to its partner, as when supplying food to its partner reduces its own opportunity for growth. Nevertheless, the net effect of the interaction is positive because the benefits are greater than the costs for each of the partners. In the remainder of this section, we will discuss some general observations that apply to both mutualism and commensalism; in Concept 15.2, we\u2019ll examine some characteristics that are specific to mutualism. Mutualism and commensalism are ubiquitous Mutualistic associations literally cover the land surface of Earth. For example, most vascular plant species, including those that dominate terrestrial ecosystems, form mycorrhizae, symbiotic associations between plant roots and various types of fungi that are usually mutualistic (FIGURE 15.3). About 80% of angiosperms (flowering plants) and all gymnosperms (e.g., conifers, cycads, and the ginkgo) form mycorrhizal associations. Mycorrhizae provide clear benefits to the plants, improving their growth and survival in a wide range of habitats (Smith and Read 2008; Booth and Hoeksema 2010). One way in which mycorrhizal fungi benefit plants is by increasing the surface area over which the plants can extract water and nutrients from the soil; in some cases, over 3 m of fungal filaments, known as hyphae, may extend from 1 cm of plant root. The fungi may also protect the plants from pathogens, while the plants typically benefit the fungi by supplying them with carbohydrates. FIGURE 15.3 Mycorrhizal Associations Cover Earth\u2019s Land Surface Each color on the map shows the region in which one of eight major types of mycorrhizal associations is found (see Fitter 2005 to learn which fungi are involved in each of these eight mycorrhizal associations). Notice that the locations of the different types of mycorrhizal associations correspond fairly closely to the locations of major terrestrial biomes (see Interactive Figure 3.5A). (After A. H. Fitter. 2005. J Ecol 93: 231\u2013243; based on D. J. Read. 1991. Experientia 47: 376; D. J. Read et al. 2004. Can J Bot 82: 1243\u20131263.) What types of plants are likely to be involved in the mycorrhizal association shown in light green? (Hint: Refer to Interactive Figure 3.5A.) There are two major types of mycorrhizae (FIGURE 15.4). In ectomycorrhizae, the fungal partner typically grows between root cells and forms a mantle around the exterior of the root; hyphae in the mantle often extend varying distances into the soil. In arbuscular mycorrhizae, the fungal partner also grows into the soil, and it grows between some root cells while penetrating the cell walls of others. Hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizae that penetrate a root cell form a branched network, called an arbuscule. Since their hyphae can penetrate root cells, arbuscular mycorrhizae once were called \u201cendomycorrhizae\u201d (from the Greek entos, \u201cin\u201d). However, most researchers no longer use the term \u201cendomycorrhizae,\u201d because the hyphae of some ectomycorrhizae can also penetrate root cells. FIGURE 15.4 Two Major Types of Mycorrhizae Mycorrhizae can be classified as (A) ectomycorrhizae or (B) arbuscular mycorrhizae. In arbuscular mycorrhizae, hyphae that enter root cells penetrate the cell wall, but not the cell membrane. (After A. D. Rovira et al. 1983. In Inorganic Plant Nutrition [Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology, new series, Vol. 15B], A. L\u00e4uchli and R. L. Bieleski [Eds.], pp. 61\u201393. Springer: New York.) Describe morphological features that distinguish ectomycorrhizae from arbuscular mycorrhizae. Mutualistic associations can be found in many other organisms and habitats. In the oceans, corals form mutualisms with symbiotic algae, as mentioned in Concept 3.3. The corals provide the algae with habitats, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), and access to sunlight; the algae provide the corals with carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis. All the numerous invertebrate and vertebrate species that live in and on coral reefs depend directly or indirectly on the coral\u2013alga mutualism. On land, mammalian herbivores such as cattle and sheep depend on bacteria and protists that live in their guts and help them metabolize otherwise indigestible plant material, such as cellulose. Similarly, insects rely on mutualisms with a number of other species, including plants (e.g., pollination mutualisms, fungi, protists; see FIGURE 15.5), and bacteria. FIGURE 15.5", "A Protist Gut Mutualist This wood-eating cockroach (like other wood-eating insects, such as termites) would starve if gut mutualists such as the protist shown here (a hypermastigote) did not help it to digest wood. The hypermastigote can break down cellulose, a major structural component of wood that the cockroach cannot digest on its own. Commensalism, like mutualism, is everywhere\u2014the ecological world is built on it. As we\u2019ll see in Concept 16.3, millions of species form +/0 relationships with so-called foundation species, which provide the habitat in which they live. In these relationships, a species that depends on the habitat provided by another species often has little or no effect on the species that provides that habitat. Examples include species that live on other species, such as lichens found on the bark of a tree or the harmless bacteria that grow on the surface of your skin. Many algae, invertebrates, and fishes found in marine kelp forests go locally extinct if the kelp are removed (see Case Study in Chapter 9); such species depend on the kelp for a home, but most of them do not harm or benefit the kelp. Likewise, although the numbers are quite uncertain, there may be more than a million insect species and thousands of understory plant species that live in tropical forests and nowhere else. These insects and small plants depend on the forest for their habitat, yet many have little or no effect on the trees that tower above them. Positive interactions can be obligate or facultative and loosely structured Mutualism and commensalism include a broad set of interactions, ranging from those that are obligate (that is, required for species) to those that are facultative (not required). The leaf-cutter ant\u2013fungus mutualism discussed in the Case Study illustrates one end of this spectrum: the ants and the fungi they cultivate have a highly specific, obligate relationship in which neither partner can survive without the other, and their interaction has led each partner to evolve unique features that benefit the other species. Similarly, many tropical fig trees are pollinated by one or a few species of fig wasps. These relationships are mutually beneficial and obligate for both species in that neither species can reproduce without the other. Fig\u2013fig wasp interactions also show clear signs of coevolution (Bronstein 1992). Fig flowers are contained within structures of fleshy stem tissue known as receptacles (FIGURE 15.6). In monoecious figs (those in which each tree has separate male and female flowers), the male and female flowers are located in different parts of the receptacle, and the male flowers mature after the female flowers. The forms of female flowers range from those with short styles to those with long styles. FIGURE 15.6 Fig Flowers and the Wasp That Pollinates Them The receptacle and flowers of a typical monoecious fig tree, Ficus sycomorus. (After J. L. Bronstein. 1992. In Insect-Plant Interactions, Vol. 4, E. A. Bernays [Ed.], pp. 1\u201344. CRC Press: Boca Raton, FL.) A female fig wasp enters the receptacle, carrying pollen she collected from male flowers in another receptacle. Once inside, the wasp inserts her ovipositor through the styles of the female flowers to lay eggs in the ovaries (see Figure 15.6). She then deposits pollen on the stigmas of those flowers. The wasp pollinates both long-styled and short-styled flowers, and hence both flower types develop seeds. Perhaps because wasp ovipositors are not long enough to reach the ovaries of long-styled flowers, wasp larvae typically develop within short-styled flowers and feed on some of their seeds. When the young wasps complete their development, they mate, the males burrow through the receptacle, and the females exit through the passageway the males have made. Before the females leave the receptacle, however, they visit male flowers (which are now mature), collect pollen from them, and store it in a specialized sac for use when they lay their eggs in another receptacle. The wasp\u2019s reproductive behavior is a remarkable example of a specialization that provides a benefit to another species. Unlike the ant\u2013fungus and fig\u2013fig wasp mutualisms, many mutualisms and commensalisms are facultative. In desert environments, for example, the soil beneath an adult plant is often cooler and moister than the soil of an adjacent open area. These differences in soil conditions may be so pronounced that the seeds of many plant species can germinate and survive only in the shade provided by an adult plant; such adults are called nurse plants because they \u201cnurse\u201d or protect the seedlings.", "A single species of nurse plant may protect the seedlings of many different species. Desert ironwood (Olneya tesota), for example, serves as a nurse plant for 165 different species, most of which can also germinate and grow under other plant species. This situation is typical of facultative interactions: a species that requires \u201cnursing\u201d may be found under a variety of nurse plant species (and hence has a facultative relationship with each of them), and the nurse plant and the beneficiary species may evolve little in response to one another. Facultative positive interactions also occur in forest communities. For example, large herbivores such as deer or moose may inadvertently eat the seeds of small herbaceous plants whose leaves they feed on. The seeds may pass unharmed through the herbivore\u2019s digestive tract and be deposited with its feces, often far from the parent plant (FIGURE 15.7). As we saw in Concept 7.4, dispersal of offspring away from parents may be advantageous, so benefits may accrue to both the plant (whose seeds are dispersed) and the herbivore (which feeds primarily on leaves). FIGURE 15.7 Deer Can Move Plant Seeds Long Distances These estimates of the distances that white-tailed deer disperse the seeds of the forest understory plant Trillium grandiflorum are based on observations of deer movements and of the length of time that deer retain plant seeds in their digestive tracts (from the time they eat the seeds until they defecate them). Although T. grandiflorum seeds are also dispersed by ants, deer move the seeds much farther. (After M. Vellend et al. 2003. Ecology 84: 1067\u20131072.) Positive interactions can cease to be beneficial under some circumstances Interactions between two species can be categorized by determining for each species whether the outcome of the interaction is positive (benefits > costs), negative (costs > benefits), or neutral (benefits = costs). However, the costs and benefits experienced by interacting species can vary from one place and time to another (Bronstein 1994). Thus, depending on the circumstances, an interaction between two species may have either positive or negative outcomes. Soil temperature, for example, influences whether a pair of wetland plant species interact as commensals or competitors (Callaway and King 1996). Some wetland plants aerate hypoxic soils by passively transporting oxygen through air channels in their leaves, stems, and roots. Oxygen leaked into the soil from the roots of such plants can become available to other plant species, thereby reducing the negative effects of the hypoxic soil conditions. In a greenhouse experiment, Ragan Callaway and Leah King grew the cattail Typha latifolia, a species that has extensive air channels, together with the small-flowered forget-me-not Myosotis laxa, a species that lacks air channels. They grew these plants under two different temperature regimes (11\u00b0C\u201312\u00b0C and 18\u00b0C\u201320\u00b0C) in pots filled with a mix of natural pond soil and peat, with the soil in the pots submerged under 1\u20132 cm of water to make it hypoxic. They also grew some pots of Myosotis without Typha under the same conditions. At the low soil temperatures, the dissolved-oxygen content of the soil increased when Typha was present, but that did not happen at the high soil temperatures. How did these different oxygen levels affect the outcome of the Myosotis\u2013Typha interaction? At the low soil temperatures, the growth of Myosotis roots and shoots increased when Typha was present (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 15.8A). At the high soil temperatures, however, Myosotis growth decreased when Typha was present (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 15.8B). Overall, these results suggest that at the low soil temperatures, Typha provided benefits to Myosotis (perhaps by aerating the soil), while at the high temperatures, Typha had a negative effect on Myosotis\u2014just one example of how a change in environmental conditions can alter the outcome of an ecological interaction (other examples are discussed in Concepts 16.3 and 17.3 and in Bronstein 1994). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 15.8 Neighbors Increase Plant Growth at High-Elevation Sites The relative neighbor effect (RNE, defined as the growth of the target plant species when neighboring plants are present minus its growth when neighbors are removed) of alpine plants was measured in plots at high and low elevations in 11 regions. Plant growth was measured as change in biomass (for most sites) or in leaf number. RNE values greater than zero (in blue) indicate that neighbors increased the growth of target species; RNE values less than zero (in red) indicate that neighbors decreased the growth of target species. (After R. M. Callaway et al. 2002. Nature 417: 844\u2013848.) Under what conditions does Myosotis laxa best grow?", "Explain. Positive interactions may be more common in stressful environments In recent decades, studies have shown that positive interactions are important in a number of ecological communities, such as oak woodlands, coastal salt marshes, and marine intertidal communities. Many of these studies have focused on how individuals of a target species are affected by nearby individuals of one or more other species. These effects can be assessed by comparing the performance of the target species when neighbors are present with its performance when neighbors are removed. Although results from such studies cannot be used to determine whether mutualism, commensalism, or competition is occurring (because two-way interactions are not examined), they do provide a rough assessment of whether positive interactions are common in ecological communities. In one of the most comprehensive studies of this type, an international group of ecologists tested the effects that neighboring plants had on a total of 115 target plant species in 11 regions worldwide (Callaway et al. 2002). In 8\u201312 replicate plots for each treatment of each target species, neighbors were either left in place or removed from the vicinity of the target species. The \u201crelative neighbor effect\u201d (RNE, defined as the growth of the target species with neighbors present minus its growth when neighbors were removed) was then measured. The researchers found that RNE was generally positive at high-elevation sites, indicating that neighbors had a positive effect on the target species, but negative at low-elevation sites (FIGURE 15.9). In addition, neighbors tended to reduce the survival and reproduction of target species individuals at low-elevation sites, but to increase their survival and reproduction at high-elevation sites. Callaway et al. determined that the RNE was negatively related to the maximum temperature in the summer, suggesting that positive interactions were more common in colder, more stressful environments and competition was more common in warmer, less stressful environments (FIGURE 15.10) and intertidal communities (Bertness 1989; Bertness and Leonard 1997). FIGURE 15.9 Neighbors Increase Plant Growth at High-Elevation Sites The relative neighbor effect (RNE, defined as the growth of the target plant species when neighboring plants are present minus its growth when neighbors are removed) of alpine plants was measured in plots at high and low elevations in 11 regions. Plant growth was measured as change in biomass (for most sites) or in leaf number. RNE values greater than zero (in blue) indicate that neighbors increased the growth of target species; RNE values less than zero (in red) indicate that neighbors decreased the growth of target species. (After R. M. Callaway et al. 2002. Nature 417: 844\u2013848.) FIGURE 15.10 Neighbors Ameliorate Cold Temperatures in Alpine Plants The relative neighbor effect (RNE, defined in Figure 15.9) of alpine plants changes from positive (above zero) to competitive (below zero) as temperature increases at lower elevations. (After R. M. Callaway et al. 2002. Nature 417: 844\u2013848.) With this discussion of positive interactions as background, let\u2019s examine some of the characteristics that are unique to mutualism. Our discussion will place special emphasis on what can be learned from studies that document the costs and benefits of mutualistic interactions. Self-Assessment 15.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 15.2 Each partner in a mutualistic interaction acts in ways that serve its own ecological and evolutionary interests. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 15.2.1 Categorize different types of mutualisms. 15.2.2 Justify why mutualisms are not altruistic. Characteristics of Mutualism In the previous section, we discussed some features that apply to both mutualism and commensalism: these two types of positive interactions are ubiquitous, they can evolve in many ways, and they can cease to be beneficial under some conditions. However, because mutualism is a reciprocal relationship in which both parties benefit, some of its characteristics differ from those of commensalism. A mutualism has costs as well as benefits, and if the costs exceed the benefits for one or both partners, their interaction will change. Before we describe the special characteristics of mutualism, however, we\u2019ll begin with a discussion of how mutualisms are classified. Mutualisms can be categorized according to the benefits they provide Mutualisms are often categorized by the types of benefits that the interacting species provide to each other, such as food or a place to live. As we\u2019ll see, one partner in a mutualism may receive one type of benefit (such as food) while the other receives a different benefit (such as a place to live). In such cases, the mutualism could be classified in two different ways.", "There are many trophic mutualisms, in which a mutualist receives energy or nutrients from its partner. In the leaf-cutter ant\u2013fungus mutualism described in this chapter\u2019s Case Study, each partner feeds the other. (Recall that the ant and the fungus also help each other to overcome plant defenses, so each also provides the other with an ecological service.) In other trophic mutualisms, one organism may receive an energy source while the other receives limiting nutrients. In mycorrhizae, for example, the fungus receives energy in the form of carbohydrates and the plant may get help in taking up water or a limiting nutrient such as phosphorus. An exchange of energy for limiting nutrients also occurs in the coral\u2013alga symbiosis, in which the coral receives carbohydrates and the alga receives nitrogen. In habitat mutualisms, one partner provides the other with shelter, a place to live, or favorable habitat. Alpheid (pistol) shrimps form a habitat mutualism with some gobies (fishes of genera Cryptocentrus and Vanderhorstia) in environments with abundant food but little protective cover. The shrimp digs a burrow in the sediments, which it shares with a goby, thus providing the fish with a safe haven from danger. For its part, the goby serves as a \u201cseeing-eye fish\u201d for the shrimp, which is nearly blind. Outside the burrow, the shrimp keeps an antenna on the fish (FIGURE 15.11); if a predator or some other form of disturbance causes the fish to move suddenly, the shrimp darts back into the burrow. FIGURE 15.11 A Seeing-Eye Fish In environments with little protective cover, a habitat mutualism between an alpheid (pistol) shrimp and a goby benefits both partners. In other habitat mutualisms, a species may provide its partner with favorable habitat by altering local environmental conditions or by improving its partner\u2019s tolerance of existing conditions. The grass Dichanthelium lanuginosum grows next to hot springs in soils whose temperatures can be as high as 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F). Regina Redman, Russell Rodriguez, and colleagues performed laboratory and field experiments in which this grass was grown with and without Curvularia protuberata, a symbiotic fungus that grows throughout the plant body (such fungi are called endophytes). In the laboratory, 100% of the grass plants that had the Curvularia endophyte survived intermittent soil temperatures of 60\u00b0C, while none of the plants without the endophyte survived (Redman et al. 2002). In field experiments in which soil temperatures reached up to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), plants with endophytes had greater root and leaf mass than plants without endophytes. In soils above 40\u00b0C, the grass plants with endophytes continued to grow well, but all the plants without endophytes died. Thus, Curvularia increased the ability of its grass host to tolerate high soil temperatures. Curvularia is not alone: many other fungal endophytes can increase the tolerance of their host plants for soils that are high in temperature or salinity (Rodriguez et al. 2009), as can some mycorrhizal fungi (Bunn et al. 2009). Mutualists are in it for themselves Although both partners in a mutualism benefit, that does not mean that a mutualism has no costs for the partners. In the coral\u2013alga mutualism, for example, the coral receives benefits in the form of energy, but it incurs the costs of supplying the alga with nutrients and space. Likewise, the alga gains limiting nutrients, but it provides the coral with energy that it could have used to support its own growth and metabolism. The costs of mutualism may be especially clear when one species provides the other with a \u201creward\u201d such as food for a service such as pollination. For example, during flowering, milkweeds use up to 37% of the energy they gain from photosynthesis to produce the nectar that attracts insect pollinators such as honeybees. For an ecological interaction to be a mutualism, the net benefits must exceed the net costs for both partners. However, neither partner in a mutualism is in it for altruistic reasons. Should environmental conditions change so as to reduce the benefits or increase the costs for one of the partners, the outcome of the interaction may change. This is especially true if the interaction is not obligate. Ants, for example, often form facultative relationships in which they protect other insects from competitors, predators, and parasites. In one such case, ants protect treehoppers from predators, and the treehoppers secrete honeydew (a sugar syrup substance), which the ants feed on (FIGURE 15.12). Treehoppers always secrete honeydew, so the ants always have access to this food source.", "However, in years when predator abundances are low, the treehoppers may receive no benefit from the ants. In such years, the outcome of the interaction may shift from +/+ (a mutualism) to either +/0 (a commensalism) or +/\u2013 (parasitism), depending on whether the consumption of honeydew by ants reduces treehopper growth or reproduction. FIGURE 15.12 A Facultative Mutualism Ants often form facultative mutualisms with insects that secrete honeydew, a sugar syrup substance on which the ants feed. The ants shown here will protect these Ecuadorian treehoppers from predators and parasites in exchange for honeydew. Finally, under certain conditions, a mutualist may withdraw or modify the reward that it provides to its partner. In high-nutrient environments, for example, some plants reduce the carbohydrate rewards that they usually provide to mycorrhizal fungi. In such environments, the plant can obtain ample nutrients on its own, and hence the fungus is of little benefit. Thus, when nutrients are plentiful, the plant may cease to reward the fungus because the costs of supporting fungal hyphae are greater than the benefits the fungus can provide. Moreover, a recent study found that the plant Medicago truncatula can discriminate among mycorrhizal fungi, allocating more carbohydrate rewards to those fungal hyphae that are supplying the most nutrients (FIGURE 15.13). You can explore this relationship further in ANALYZING DATA 15.1, where you will examine whether the fungus also modifies its provision of nutrients to the plant depending on the rewards it receives from the plant. FIGURE 15.13 Rewarding Those Who Reward You Researchers tested the hypothesis that Medicago truncatula plants allocate more carbohydrates to those mycorrhizal fungi that provide them with higher concentrations of phosphorus, a key plant nutrient. (A) They used a split-plate design to separate the fungal hyphae into two groups. Some fungal hyphae lacked access to phosphorus, while other fungal hyphae were supplied with either 35 or 700 \u00b5M of phosphorus. (B) They then tracked the proportion of sucrose (labeled with 14C) that the plant provided to each group of hyphae. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After E. T. Kiers et al. 2011. Science 333: 880\u2013882.) Some mutualists have mechanisms to prevent overexploitation As we\u2019ve seen, there is an inherent conflict of interest between the partners in a mutualism: the benefit to each species comes at a cost to the other. In such a situation, natural selection may favor cheaters, individuals that increase their production of offspring by overexploiting their mutualistic partner. When one of the partners in a mutualism overexploits the other, it becomes less likely that the mutualism will persist. But mutualisms do persist, as the 50-million-year association between fungus-growing ants and the fungi they cultivate readily attests. What factors allow a mutualism to persist in spite of the conflict of interest between the partners? One answer is provided by \u201cpenalties\u201d imposed on individuals that overexploit a partner. If those penalties are high enough, they can reduce or remove any advantage gained by cheating. Olle Pellmyr and Chad Huth documented such a situation in an obligate, coevolved mutualism between the yucca plant Yucca filamentosa and its exclusive pollinator, the yucca moth Tegeticula yuccasella (Pellmyr and Huth 1994). Female yucca moths collect pollen from yucca plants with their unique mouthparts (FIGURE 15.14A). After collecting pollen, a female moth typically moves to another plant, lays eggs in the ovary of a flower, and then walks up to the top of the style. There, the moth deliberately places some of the pollen she carries on the stigma, thus pollinating the plant (FIGURE 15.14B). The larvae that hatch from the moth\u2019s eggs complete their development by eating some of the seeds, which then develop in the ovary of the flower. FIGURE 15.14 Yuccas and Yucca Moths Yucca filamentosa has an obligate relationship with its exclusive pollinator, the yucca moth Tegeticula yuccasella. (A) The female moth collects pollen from a yucca flower using specialized mouthparts. She may carry a load of up to 10,000 pollen grains, nearly 10% of her own weight. (B) The moth at the lower right of this photo is laying eggs in the ovary of a yucca flower; the moth at the top is placing pollen on the stigma. (From O. Pellmyr. 2003. Ann Mo Bot Gard 90: 35.) The moth and the plant depend absolutely on each other for reproduction. However, the mutualism is vulnerable to overexploitation by moths that lay too many eggs and hence consume too many seeds.", "Yuccas have a mechanism to prevent such overexploitation: they selectively abort flowers in which female moths have laid too many eggs (FIGURE 15.15). On average, yuccas retain 62% of the flowers that contain up to six moth eggs, but only 11% of the flowers that contain nine or more eggs. When the yucca aborts a flower, it does so before the moth larvae hatch from their eggs. Although the cue that determines flower abortion is not known, it is clear that it is a powerful mechanism for reducing overexploitation: all the moth larvae in an aborted flower die. FIGURE 15.15 A Penalty for Cheating Yucca plants selectively abort flowers in which yucca moths have laid too many eggs. (After O. Pellmyr and C. J. Huth. 1994. Nature 372: 257\u2013260.) ANALYZING DATA 15.1 * As seen in Figure 15.13, Kiers et al. (2011) found that the plant Medicago truncatula transfers more carbohydrates to those fungal hyphae that have greater access to phosphorus. The researchers also tested the reciprocal interactions: whether the plant\u2019s mycorrhizal partner, the fungus Rhizophagus irregularis (previously known as Glomus intraradices), behaves in a similar manner, transporting more phosphorus to roots that have greater access to carbohydrates. To do this, Kiers et al. used a split-plate experimental design similar to that in Figure 15.13. They provided fungal hyphae with radioactively labeled phosphorus (33P) and monitored the transfer of phosphorus to plant roots differing in access to carbohydrates (sucrose). Some plant roots had no access to sucrose, while other plant roots were supplied with either 5 or 25 mM of sucrose. In the results shown in the figure, \u201cdpm\u201d refers to disintegrations per minute, a measure of radiation intensity; error bars show one SE of the mean. 1. Draw and label a sketch of the split-plate experimental design, modeling your diagram on the photograph in Figure 15.13A. 2. Interpret the results shown in the figure. 3. Compare the results in the figure here with those in Figure 15.13B. Does the plant or the fungus control the exchange of materials, or do both partners play a role? Explain. See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. *Kiers, E. T. and 14 others. 2011. Reciprocal rewards stabilize cooperation in the mycorrhizal symbiosis. Science 333: 880\u2013882. Few other clear cases of penalties for cheating have been documented, so we do not yet know whether such penalties are common in nature. Be that as it may, the yucca\u2013yucca moth interaction illustrates the theme that runs throughout this section: the partners in a mutualism are not altruistic. Instead, the yucca takes actions that promote its own interests, and the yucca moth does the same. In general, a mutualism evolves and is maintained because its net effect is advantageous to both parties. If the net effect of a mutualism were to impair the growth, survival, or reproduction of one of the interacting species, the ecological interests of that species would not be served, and the mutualism might break down, at least temporarily. Should such a situation continue, the longer-term or evolutionary interests of that species might also fail to be served, and the mutualism might break down on a more permanent basis. Although it is possible for a mutualism to break down, we\u2019ve also seen that mutualism and commensalism are very common and that some of these interactions have been maintained for millions of years. Let\u2019s turn now to the ecological effects of these pervasive interactions. Self-Assessment 15.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 15.3 Positive interactions affect the abundances and distributions of populations as well as the structure of ecological communities. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 15.3.1 Explain the consequences of positive interactions on the distribution and abundance of species. 15.3.2 Describe how positive interactions can increase species diversity in communities. 15.3.3 Illustrate ways in which positive interactions can affect ecosystem processes. Ecological Consequences of Positive Interactions So far in this chapter, we\u2019ve discussed features that are common to commensalism and mutualism as well as characteristics that are unique to mutualism. At various points in these discussions, we\u2019ve mentioned some ecological consequences of positive interactions, including increased survival rates and the provision of habitats. In this section, we\u2019ll take a closer look at how positive interactions affect populations of organisms and the communities in which they are found. Positive interactions influence the abundances and distributions of populations", "As examples earlier in this chapter suggest, mutualism and commensalism can provide benefits that increase the growth, reproduction, or survival of individuals in one or both of the interacting species\u2014a point that was demonstrated recently for a defensive bacterial symbiont that increased the reproductive success of its fruit fly host (FIGURE 15.16). As a result, mutualism and commensalism can affect the abundances and distributions of the interacting species. To explore these issues further, we will first examine how an ant\u2013 plant mutualism affects the abundances of its members. We will then consider how mutualism and commensalism influence the distributions of organisms. FIGURE 15.16 A Symbiont Increases the Fertility of Its Host Bacteria in the genus Spiroplasma are obligate symbionts that live within the cells of their host, the fruit fly Drosophila neotestacea. The graph shows the number of eggs produced by laboratory-reared female flies that either had Spiroplasma symbionts (red bars) or did not have Spiroplasma symbionts (blue bars), and that either were infected by the nematode parasite Howardula (parasitized) or were not infected by it (unparasitized). Howardula can sterilize female flies and reduce the mating success of male flies. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After J. Jaenike et al. 2010. Science 329: 212\u2013215.) EFFECTS ON ABUNDANCE The effects of mutualism on abundance can be seen in the mutualistic relationship between ants in the genus Pseudomyrmex spp. and the bullhorn acacia (Acacia spp.). This plant has unusually large thorns, which provide a home for the ants (FIGURE 15.17A). The thorns have a tough, woody covering but a soft, pithy interior that is easy for the ants to excavate. A queen ant establishes a new colony by burrowing into a green thorn, removing some of its pithy interior, and laying eggs inside the thorn. As the colony grows, it eventually occupies all of the acacia\u2019s thorns. FIGURE 15.17 An Ant\u2013Plant Mutualism (A) Acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex spinicola) tending to larvae and pupae inside an acacia thorn. (B) A nectary at the base of a leaf and Beltian bodies at the leaflet tips. (C) Ants have removed the plants that grew near this acacia, creating a competitor-free zone for the plant. The ants feed on nectar, which the plant secretes from specialized nectaries, and on modified leaflet tips called Beltian bodies, which are high in protein and fat (FIGURE 15.17B). The ants aggressively attack insect and even mammalian herbivores (such as deer) that attempt to eat the plant. The ants also use their mandibles to maul other plants that venture within 10\u2013150 cm of their home acacia, thus providing the acacia with a competitor-free zone in which to grow (FIGURE 15.17C). Do the services provided by the ants benefit the acacias? To find out, Dan Janzen removed ants from some acacia plants and compared the growth and survival of those plants with those of plants that had ant colonies. The results were striking. On average, bullhorn acacias with ant colonies weighed over 14 times as much as acacias that lacked colonies; acacias with ants also had higher survival rates (72% vs. 43%) and were attacked by insect herbivores much less frequently (Janzen 1966). If a bullhorn acacia lacks an ant colony, the repeated loss of its leaves and growing tips to herbivores often kills the plant in 6\u201312 months. The ants, in turn, depend on the acacias for food and a home, and they cannot survive without these plants. Thus, the ant\u2013acacia mutualism has considerable effects on the abundance of each partner. Furthermore, both the ant and the plant have evolved unusual characteristics that benefit their partners. For example, Pseudomyrmex ants that depend on acacias are highly aggressive, remain active for 24 hours a day (patrolling the plant surface), and attack vegetation that grows near their home plants; Pseudomyrmex species that do not form mutualisms with acacias show none of these traits. Similarly, acacias that form mutualisms with ants have enlarged thorns, specialized nectaries, and Beltian bodies on their leaves; few nonmutualistic acacia species show these traits. Overall, both the ants and the acacias appear to have evolved in response to their partners, making the ant\u2013acacia partnership an example of an obligate and coevolved mutualism. EFFECTS ON DISTRIBUTION There are literally millions of positive interactions in which one species provides another with favorable habitat and thus influences its distribution.", "Specific examples include corals that provide their algal symbionts with a home and fungal symbionts that enable plants to live in environments they otherwise could not tolerate (such as the Curvularia protuberata fungi that enable the grass Dichanthelium lanuginosum to live in high-temperature soils). Of course, obligate mutualisms, such as the fig\u2013fig wasp mutualism discussed earlier, have a profound influence on the geographic distribution of the interacting species because neither can live where its partner is absent. It is very common for a group of dominant species, such as the trees in a forest, to determine the distributions of other species by physically providing the habitat on which they depend. Many plant and animal species are found only in forests. Such \u201cforest specialists\u201d either cannot tolerate the physical conditions of more open areas (such as a nearby meadow) or are prevented from living in those open areas by competition with other species. Similarly, at low tide in marine intertidal communities, many species (e.g., crabs, snails, sea stars, sea urchins, barnacles) can be found under the strands of seaweeds that are attached to the rocks. The seaweeds provide a moist and relatively cool environment that enables some species to live in higher regions of the intertidal zone than they otherwise could. Finally, many sandy and cobblestone beaches are stabilized by grasses such as Ammophila breviligulata and Spartina alterniflora. By holding the substrate together, these species enable the formation of entire communities of plants and animals. Many forest specialists have little direct effect on the trees under which they live; hence, they have a commensalism with the trees of the forest. The same is true of many marine species that seek shelter under seaweeds and of many of the organisms that depend on substrate stabilization by grasses. In each of these cases, a positive interaction (often a commensalism) allows one species to have a larger distribution than it otherwise would. Positive interactions can alter communities and ecosystems The effects that commensalism and mutualism have on the abundances and distributions of species can affect interactions among species, and those effects, in turn, can have a large influence on a community. For example, if a dominant competitor depends on a facilitator, loss of the facilitator may reduce the performance of that dominant species and increase the performance of other species\u2014thus changing the mix of species in the community or their relative abundances. As we\u2019ll see, when the structure of a community changes, properties of the ecosystem may also change. COMMUNITY DIVERSITY Coral reefs are known for their astonishing beauty, and they are exceptional ecologically in that their fish communities are the most diverse vertebrate communities in the world. One of the most common interactions among these diverse coral reef fish is a service mutualism in which a small species (the \u201ccleaner\u201d) removes parasites from a larger fish (the \u201cclient\u201d). The cleaner often ventures into the mouth of the client (FIGURE 15.18A). What prevents the client from simply eating the cleaner? FIGURE 15.18 Ecological Effects of the Cleaner Fish Labroides dimidiatus (A) Looking for parasites, a cleaner fish places its head within the mouth of a much larger client fish, this sweetlips. The experimental removal of L. dimidiatus from small reefs within the Great Barrier Reef of Australia led to (B) a drop in the number of fish species found on the reefs and (C) a decrease in the total abundance of fish on the reefs. (B,C after A. S. Grutter et al. 2003. Curr Biol 13: 64\u201367.) The answer appears to be that the benefit a client receives from cleaning (parasite removal) is greater than the energy benefit it could gain by eating the cleaner. In the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, individuals of the cleaner species Labroides dimidiatus were visited by an average of 2,297 clients each day, from which the cleaner removed (and ate) an average of 1,218 parasites per day (0.53 parasites per client). To determine whether the activities of cleaners were translated into a reduction in the number of parasites found on clients, Alexandra Grutter experimentally removed L. dimidiatus from three of five small reefs. After 12 days, on the reefs from which the cleaners had been removed, there were 3.8 times more parasites on Hemigymnus melapterus fish than on the control reefs. In follow-up studies, Grutter and colleagues (2003) examined the effect of L. dimidiatus on the number of species and the total abundance of fish found on coral reefs.", "The results were dramatic: removal and exclusion of L. dimidiatus for a period of 18 months caused large drops in both the number of fish species and the total abundance of fish found on the reefs (FIGURE 15.18B,C). Grutter\u2019s work shows that a mutualism can have a major effect on the diversity of species found in a community. Most of the species lost from the reefs without cleaners were species that typically move among reefs, including some large predators. Large predators can themselves affect the diversity and abundance of species, so the removal of cleaner fish could also result in further, but difficult-to-predict, long-term changes to the community. SPECIES INTERACTIONS AND ECOSYSTEM PROPERTIES Barbara Hetrick and colleagues (1989) performed greenhouse experiments in which the presence of mycorrhizal fungi altered the outcome of competition between two prairie grasses, big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and junegrass (Koeleria macrantha). They found that big bluestem dominated when mycorrhizal fungi were present and that junegrass dominated when they were not. In a natural prairie community of which big bluestem was a dominant member, when David Hartnett and Gail Wilson (1999) suppressed mycorrhizal fungi with a fungicide, the performance of big bluestem decreased. At the same time, the performance of a variety of other plant species, including both grasses and wildflowers, increased. Hartnett and Wilson suggested that big bluestem\u2019s dominance may have come from a competitive advantage conferred by its association with mycorrhizal fungi and that removal of those fungi removed that advantage and released the inferior competitors from the negative effects of competition. Mycorrhizal associations can affect other features of ecosystems in addition to diversity, as shown in a 1998 study by Marcel van der Heijden, John Klironomos, and colleagues. In a large-scale field experiment, these scientists manipulated the number of species of mycorrhizal fungi (from 0 to 14 species) found in soils in which identical mixtures of the seeds of 15 plant species had been sown. After one growing season, plant dry weights and phosphorus content were measured. Plant root and shoot biomass increased as the number of species of fungi increased (FIGURE 15.19A,B), as did the efficiency of phosphorus uptake by plants (FIGURE 15.19C). These results show that mycorrhizal fungal species richness can influence key features of ecosystems such as net primary production (measured as the amount of new plant growth over one growing season) and the supply and cycling of nutrients such as phosphorus. FIGURE 15.19 Mycorrhizal Fungal Species Richness Affects Ecosystem Properties Researchers measured the effects of the number of mycorrhizal fungal species in the soil on (A) average shoot biomass, (B) average root biomass, and (C) phosphorus content in mixtures of 15 species of plants grown from seed in a field experiment. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (After M. van der Heijden et al. 1998. Nature 396: 69\u201372.) Self-Assessment 15.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED The First Farmers The fungal gardens of leaf-cutter ants represent an enormous food resource for any species able to overcome the ants\u2019 defenses. As we saw in Chapter 13, roughly half the world\u2019s species are parasites, and many of them have remarkable adaptations for evading host defenses. Are there any parasites that specialize in attacking fungal gardens? Although you might expect that the answer would be yes, for more than 100 years after the fungus-growing role of leaf-cutter ants was discovered (Belt 1874), no such parasites were known. That changed in the early 1990s, when Ignacio Chapela observed that leaf-cutter ant gardens were plagued by a virulent parasitic fungus of the genus Escovopsis (see also Currie et al. 1999a). This parasite can spread from one garden to the next, and it can rapidly destroy the gardens it invades, leading to the death of ant colonies. Leaf-cutter ants respond to Escovopsis by increasing the rate at which they weed their gardens (FIGURE 15.20) and, in some cases, by increasing how often they dose the garden with antimicrobial toxins, which they produce in specialized glands (Fern\u00e1ndez-Mar\u00edn et al. 2009). FIGURE 15.20 A Specialized Parasite Stimulates Weeding by Ants Currie and Stuart measured the frequency with which the leaf-cutter ant Atta colombica weeded its fungal gardens after colonies were exposed to water, Trichoderma viride (a generalist fungal parasite), and the specialized fungal parasite Escovopsis. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After C. R. Currie and A. E. Stuart. 2001. R Soc 268: 1471.)", "Suppose 2% of ants were observed weeding in colonies exposed to water, 20% in colonies exposed to Trichoderma, and 20% in colonies exposed to Escovopsis. Propose a hypothesis that might explain these results. The ants also enlist the help of other species in combatting Escovopsis (Currie et al. 1999b). On the underside of the ant\u2019s body lives a bacterium that produces chemicals that inhibit Escovopsis. The queen carries this bacterium on her body when she begins a new colony. While the ants clearly benefit from the use of these fungicides, what of the bacterium? Recent work (Currie et al. 2006) indicates that the bacterium also benefits: the ant provides it with both a place to live (it is housed in specialized structures called crypts that are located on the ant\u2019s exoskeleton) and a source of food (glandular secretions). Thus, the bacterium appears to be a third mutualist that benefits from, and contributes to, these unique fungal gardens. CONNECTIONS in NATURE FROM MANDIBLES TO NUTRIENT CYCLING While you have been reading this chapter, billions of pairs of leaf-cutter ant mandibles have been removing leaves from the forests of the Americas. The workers of a single colony can harvest as much plant matter each day as it would take to feed a cow. People have long known that leaf-cutter ants are potent herbivores. Weber (1966) describes reports\u2014the earliest from 1559\u2014of leaf-cutter ants destroying the crops of Spanish colonists, and they still plague farmers today. In tropical regions, these ants tend to increase in abundance after a forest is cut down. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the thriving ant colonies found in deforested areas are one of the reasons why farms in some tropical regions are often abandoned just a few years after trees have been removed to make room for them (other reasons relate to a point made in Chapters 3 and 22: some tropical soils are nutrient-poor). In addition to their effects on human farmers, leaf-cutter ants introduce large amounts of organic matter into tropical forest soils. As a consequence, they affect the supply and cycling of nutrients in the forest ecosystem (a topic we will discuss in more detail in Concept 22.3). Normally, nutrients in the leaf litter that falls to the forest 2 floor enter the soil when the leaves decompose. Bruce Haines (1978) compared the amounts (g/m ) of 13 mineral nutrients contained in leaf litter with the amounts of the same nutrients found in aboveground areas where colonies of the leaf-cutter ant Atta colombica deposit their refuse (other Atta species deposit refuse belowground, as shown in Figure 15.2A). Averaged across the 13 nutrients, the ants\u2019 refuse areas contained about 48 times the nutrients found in the leaf litter. Plants respond to this concentration of nutrients by increasing their production of fine roots in the Atta refuse areas. Furthermore, the activities of leaf-cutter ants have the effect of tilling the soil near their nests, making it easier for plant roots to penetrate the soil (Moutinho et al. 2003). Moutinho and colleagues also found that the leaf material ants bring into their colonies fertilizes the soil, causing soils beneath ant colonies to be 3\u20134 times richer in calcium and 7\u201314 times richer in potassium than are soils 15 m away from the nest. Finally, recent evidence suggests that the fungal gardens tended by ants may also house nitrogen-fixing bacteria (FIGURE 15.21). These bacteria may be part of yet another mutualism found in the gardens\u2014a mutualism that may prove to be an important source of nitrogen in tropical ecosystems. FIGURE 15.21 Nitrogen Fixation in Fungal Gardens When researchers measured nitrogen fixation activity in different parts of the colonies of leaf-cutter ants, they found that most of it was taking place in the fungal gardens. In addition, bacteria from genus Klebsiella were isolated from the fungal gardens and shown to fix nitrogen. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After A. A. Pinto-Tom\u00e1s et al. 2009. Science 326: 1120\u20131123.) The overall effects of leaf-cutter ants on the ecosystems in which they live are complex. In forest ecosystems, net primary production (NPP) is usually measured as new aboveground plant growth (see Concept 20.1); root growth is often ignored, since it is difficult to measure in trees. Although leaf-cutter ants reduce NPP by harvesting leaves, some of the other activities of ants (e.g., tillage, fertilization) may increase NPP. As a result, the net effect of the ants on the NPP of their ecosystem is difficult to estimate.", "While it may prove possible to disentangle such effects in future studies, there is no doubt that the ants and their partners have considerable effects on the ecosystems in which they are found. Unit 5 The Nature of Communities KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 16.1 Communities are groups of interacting species that occur together at the same place and time. CONCEPT 16.2 Species diversity and species composition are important descriptors of community structure. CONCEPT 16.3 Communities can be characterized by complex networks of direct and indirect interactions that vary in strength and direction. \u201cKiller Algae!\u201d: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 In 1988, a French marine biology student dove into the crystal-clear water of the Mediterranean Sea and made an unusual discovery. On the seafloor, just below the cliffs on which stood the palatial Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, grew an unusual seaweed, Caulerpa taxifolia (FIGURE 16.1), a native of the warm tropical waters of the Caribbean. The student told Alexandre Meinesz, a leading expert on tropical algae and a professor at the University of Nice, about the unusual species. Over the following year, Meinesz confirmed its presence and determined that its feathery fluorescent green fronds, interconnected by creeping underground stems called rhizomes, carpeted an underwater area in front of the museum. FIGURE 16.1 Invading Seaweed Caulerpa taxifolia rapidly invaded and dominated marine communities in the Mediterranean Sea. Meinesz was astonished because this species had never been seen in such cold waters, and it had certainly never reached the high densities he recorded. As it later turned out, earlier sightings from 1984 allowed Meinesz to calculate a spread of more than 1 hectare (ha) in 5 years. Over the next few months, he asked himself and his colleagues some important questions. First, how did the seaweed get to the Mediterranean in the first place, and how could it survive in temperatures as cold as 12\u00b0C\u201313\u00b0C (54\u00b0F\u2013 55\u00b0F), given that its normal temperature range is 18\u00b0C\u201320\u00b0C (64\u00b0F\u201368\u00b0F)? Second, did this species occur anywhere else in the Mediterranean, and was it spreading beyond the soft-sediment habitats found in front of the museum? Most importantly, at such high population densities, how was it interacting with native algae and seagrasses, both of which are critical habitats and sources of food for fish and invertebrate species? A definitive answer to the second question came in July 1990, when the alga was found 5 km east of the museum, at a popular fishing location. Evidently, fragments had been caught on the gear and anchors of fishing vessels and transported to new sites of colonization. The find generated media coverage that included information on the toxicity of the seaweed, which produces a peppery secondary compound to deter the fish and invertebrate herbivores that abound in the tropics. The press sensationalized Caulerpa\u2019s natural toxicity with headlines such as \u201cKiller algae!\u201d\u2014a misleading title that suggested that the seaweed was toxic to humans (it is not). As the news spread, so did the sightings of Caulerpa. By 1991, 50 sightings had been reported in France alone. The fluorescent green alga indiscriminately colonized muddy, sandy, and rocky bottoms at a depth of 3\u201330 m. By 2000, the alga had moved from France to Italy, then to Croatia to the east and Spain to the west, eventually spreading as far as Tunisia (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 16.2). It had invaded thousands of hectares, despite frantic but futile efforts to remove it. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 16.2 Spread of Caulerpa in the Mediterranean Sea Caulerpa taxifolia first invaded the waters off Monaco and France. By 2000, this algal species had reached Croatia and Tunisia. (After A. Meinesz et al. 2001. Biol Inv 3: 201. Based on A. Meinesz. 1997. Le roman noir de l\u2019algue \u201ctueuse\u201d: Caulerpa taxifolia contre la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. Belin \u00c9diteur: Paris.) Using the order of appearance on the map, describe the possible invasion pathways of Caulerpa within this region. From the very beginning, Meinesz suspected that the answer to his first question lay with the museum. In 1980, a cold-resistant strain of Caulerpa taxifolia had been discovered and propagated in the tropical aquariums at the Wilhelma Zoo in Stuttgart, Germany. Cuttings were sent to other aquariums, including the one in Monaco, to be grown as aesthetically pleasing backdrops to tropical fish displays. The museum admitted to unintentionally releasing Caulerpa in the process of cleaning tanks but believed the alga would die in the cold waters of the Mediterranean.", "Given that Caulerpa did not die, but instead quickly invaded and overtook shallow areas of the Mediterranean, scientists and fishermen alike wanted to understand how this abundant and fast-spreading seaweed would affect marine habitats and the fisheries dependent on them. How do interactions with one very abundant species influence the hundreds of other species with which it shares a community? View the script for the video Introduction We have emphasized throughout this book that species are connected with one another and with their environment. Ecology is, at its very essence, the study of these interconnections. In Unit 4, we looked at interactions between species as two-way relationships, with one species eating, competing with, or facilitating another species. For ease of mathematical modeling, we considered these pairwise interactions in isolation, even though we have emphasized that, in reality, species experience multiple interactions. In this chapter, we will explore multiple-species interactions and how they shape the nature of communities. We will consider the various ways in which ecologists have defined communities, the metrics used to measure community structure, and the types of species interactions that characterize communities. CONCEPT 16.1 Communities are groups of interacting species that occur together at the same place and time. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 16.1.1 Describe the ways ecologists delineate communities. 16.1.2 Explain why ecologists use subsets of species to define communities and list some of the subsets used. What Are Communities? Ecologists define communities as groups of interacting species that occur together at the same place and time. Interactions among multiple species and their physical environment give communities their character and function. Whether we are dealing with a desert, a kelp forest, or the gut of an ungulate, the existence of the community is dependent on the individual species that are present and on how they interact with one another and their physical surroundings. As we will see in this chapter and others in this unit, the relative importance of species interactions and the physical environment, which can vary among communities, is a major focus of research for community ecologists. Ecologists often delineate communities by their physical or biological characteristics The technical definition of a community given above is more theoretical than operational. In practical terms, ecologists often delineate communities using physical or biological characteristics as a guide (FIGURE 16.3). A community may be defined by the physical characteristics of its environment; for example, a physically defined community might encompass all the species in a hot springs, a mountain stream, or a desert. The biomes and aquatic biological zones described in Chapter 3 are based largely on the physical characteristics thought to be important in defining communities. Similarly, a biologically defined community might include all the species associated with a kelp forest, a freshwater bog, or a coral reef. This way of thinking uses the presence and implied importance of abundant species, such as kelp, wetland plants, or corals, as the basis for community delineation. FIGURE 16.3 Defining Communities Ecologists often delineate communities based on their physical attributes or their biological attributes. Of the four communities shown in this figure, which are mostly defined by physical attributes and which are mostly defined by biological attributes? In most cases, however, communities end up being defined somewhat arbitrarily by the ecologists who are studying them. For example, if ecologists are interested in studying aquatic insects and their amphibian predators, they are likely to restrict their definition of the community to that particular interaction. Unless they broaden their question, researchers are unlikely to consider the roles of birds that forage in wetlands or other inherently important aspects of the wetland in which they are working. Thus, is it important to recognize that ecologists typically define communities based on the questions they are posing. Regardless of how a community is defined, ecologists interested in knowing which species are present in a community must contend with the difficult issue of accounting for them. Merely creating a species list for a community is a huge undertaking, and one that is essentially impossible to complete, especially if small or relatively unknown species are considered. Taxonomists have officially described about 1.9 million species, but we know from sampling studies of tropical insects and microorganisms that this number greatly underestimates the actual number of species on Earth, which could be closer to 9 million or even more. For this reason, and because of the difficulty of studying many species at one time, ecologists usually consider a subset of species when they define and study communities.", "Ecologists may use subsets of species to define communities One common way of subdividing a community is based on taxonomic affinity\u2014that is, by groups of species classified together because of evolutionary lineage (FIGURE 16.4A). For example, a study of a forest community might be limited to all the bird species within that community (in which case an ecologist might speak of \u201cthe forest bird community\u201d). Another useful subset of a community is a guild, a group of species that use the same resources, even though they might be taxonomically distant (FIGURE 16.4B). For example, some birds, bees, and bats feed on flower pollen, thus forming a guild of pollen-eating animals. Finally, a functional group is a subset of a community that includes species that function in similar ways but may or may not use similar resources (FIGURE 16.4C). For example, nitrogen-fixing plants (legumes) can be placed in the same functional group. FIGURE 16.4 Subsets of Species in Communities Ecologists may use subsets of species to define communities. These examples show three ways in which such subsets could be designated. (A) All the bird species in a community could be grouped together by taxonomic affinity. (B) All the species that use pollen as a resource could be grouped together as a guild. (C) All the plant species in a community that have nitrogen-fixing bacteria (e.g., legumes) could be placed in the same functional group. There are other subsets of communities that allow ecologists to organize species based on their trophic, or energetic, interactions (FIGURE 16.5A). Species can be organized in a food web, a representation of the trophic or energetic connections among species within a community. Food webs can be further organized into trophic levels, or groups of species that have similar ways of interacting and obtaining energy. The lowest trophic level contains primary producers, which are autotrophs such as plants. The primary producers are fed on by organisms at the second level, the primary consumers, which are herbivores. The third level contains secondary consumers, which are carnivores, or animals that eat animals. Secondary consumers are fed on in turn by tertiary consumers, also carnivores. FIGURE 16.5 (A) Food webs describe trophic or energetic connections among species within a community. (B) Interaction webs include both trophic interactions (vertical arrows) and non-trophic (horizontal) competitive and positive interactions. Traditionally, food webs have been used as a descriptive or idealized method of understanding the trophic relationships among the species in a community. Food webs tell us little, however, about the strength of those interactions or their importance in the community. In addition, the use of trophic levels can create confusion for a number of reasons: for example, some species span two trophic levels (e.g., corals can be classified as both carnivores and herbivores because they eat zooplankton and they have symbiotic algae), some species change their feeding status as they mature (e.g., amphibians can be herbivores as tadpoles and carnivores as adults), and some species are omnivores, feeding on more than one trophic level (e.g., some fish feed on both algae and invertebrates). Moreover, idealized food webs often do not include certain important resources and consumers that are common within communities. For example, all organisms that die without being consumed become organic matter known as detritus and can be consumed by detritivores (mostly fungi and bacteria) through a process known as decomposition; see Concept 22.2. Another example is symbionts, including parasites and mutualists, which are present at almost all trophic levels (see Chapters 13 and 15). Another characteristic of food webs is that they do not include non-trophic interactions (so-called horizontal interactions, such as competition and some positive interactions), which, as we have seen in Unit 4, can also influence community character. The concept of an interaction web has been introduced to more accurately describe both the trophic (vertical) and non-trophic (horizontal) interactions among the species in a traditional food web (FIGURE 16.5B). Despite these drawbacks, the food web concept remains a strong one, if only for its visual representation of important consumer relationships within a community. We will learn much more about food webs in Chapter 21. Next let\u2019s consider the important properties of communities that allow us to characterize them and to distinguish one from another. Self-Assessment 16.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 16.2 Species diversity and species composition are important descriptors of community structure. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 16.2.1 Define and quantify species diversity and compare to biodiversity. 16.2.2", "Define and graph rank abundance and species accumulation relationships. 16.2.3 Define species composition and explain why it is an important characteristic of communities. Community Structure We have seen that communities vary greatly in the number of species they contain. A tropical rainforest, for example, has many more tree species than a temperate rainforest, and a midwestern prairie has many more insect species than a New England salt marsh. Ecologists have devoted substantial effort to measuring this variation at a number of spatial scales. Species diversity and species composition are important descriptors of community structure, the set of characteristics that shape a community. Community structure is descriptive in nature but provides the necessary quantitative basis for generating hypotheses and experiments directed at understanding how communities work. Species diversity is an important measure of community structure Species diversity is the most commonly used measure of community structure. Even though the term is often used generally to describe the number of species within a community, it has a more precise definition. Species diversity is a measure that combines the number of species (species richness) and their abundances compared with those of the other species (species evenness) within the community. Species richness is the easiest metric to determine: one simply counts all the species in the community. Species evenness, which tells us about the commonness or rarity of species, requires knowing the abundance of each species relative to those of the other species within the community, a harder value to obtain. (See Ecological Toolkit 9.1 for methods of estimating abundances in terms of number, biomass, or percentage of cover.) The contributions of species richness and species evenness to species diversity can be illustrated using a hypothetical example (FIGURE 16.6). Let\u2019s imagine two meadow communities, each containing four species of butterflies. Both communities have the same butterfly species richness, but their species evenness differs. In community A, one species constitutes 85% of the individuals in the community, while the other four species constitute only 5% of the individuals in the community; thus, species evenness is low. In community B, the number of individuals are evenly divided among the four species (25% each), so species evenness is high. In this case, even though each community has the same species richness (four species), community B has the higher species diversity because it has higher species evenness. FIGURE 16.6 Species Richness and Species Evenness These two hypothetical butterfly communities have the same number of species (species richness) but different relative abundances (species evenness). Species diversity, as measured using the Shannon index, is lower in community A (see Table 16.1). A number of species diversity indices can be used to describe species diversity quantitatively. By far the most commonly used is the Shannon index, where H = the Shannon index value p = the proportion of individuals found in the ith species i ln = the natural logarithm s = the number of species in the community The lowest possible value of H is zero. The higher a community\u2019s H value, the greater its species diversity. TABLE 16.1 calculates the Shannon index for the two butterfly communities in Figure 16.6. These calculations show that community A has the lower Shannon index value (H), confirming mathematically that this community has lower species diversity than community B. Given that both communities have the same species richness, the difference in species diversity is driven by the lower species evenness in community A. You can practice calculating the Shannon index in ANALYZING DATA 16.1, which explores how an invasive plant affects community structure in central European grasslands. As we mentioned earlier, the term \u201cspecies diversity\u201d is often used imprecisely to describe the number of species in a community without regard to the relative abundances of species or species diversity indices. For example, one commonly hears the assertion that \u201cspecies diversity\u201d is higher in tropical communities than in temperate communities, without any accompanying information about the actual relative abundances of species in the two community types. Another term that is often used interchangeably with \u201cspecies diversity\u201d is \u201cbiodiversity.\u201d Technically, biodiversity is a term used to describe the diversity of important ecological entities that span multiple spatial scales, from genes to species to communities (FIGURE 16.7). Implicit in the term is the interconnectedness of genes, individuals, populations, species, and even community-level components of diversity. As we saw in Chapter 11, the genetic variation among individuals within a population influences that population\u2019s viability (its chance of persistence).", "Population viability, in turn, has important consequences for species persistence, and ultimately for species diversity within communities. Moreover, the number of different kinds of communities in a region is critical to diversity at larger regional and latitudinal scales (see Interactive Figure 18.5). We will discuss the importance of spatial scale and biodiversity in chapters to come, but it is worth understanding some of the ways in which the term \u201cdiversity\u201d is used, as a starting point for those later discussions. FIGURE 16.7 Biodiversity Considers Multiple Spatial Scales Diversity can be measured at spatial scales that range from genes to species to communities. The term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d encompasses diversity at all of these scales. ANALYZING DATA 16.1 Invasions of non-native species have been implicated in both increases and decreases of species diversity within communities. One study looked at the effects of 13 \u201cneophyte\u201d plant species (i.e., those introduced since 1500) on the species diversity of a variety of plant communities in the Czech Republic in Central Europe (Hejda et al. 2009). * To understand the importance of species invasions to species diversity, the researchers measured species richness and abundance (percent plant cover) in plots with similar site conditions that differed in whether they had been invaded or not (i.e., native) by particular invasive species. They then subtracted the species richness of the invaded plots from that of the native plots, averaged the resulting values, and obtained an average change in species richness (y axis) for each species invasion (x axis). The results are shown in FIGURE A. The researchers also calculated the Shannon index (H) for each of the plots and conducted the same analysis: they calculated an average change in species diversity (y axis) for each invasive species (x axis). These values are given in FIGURE B. Error bars show one SE of the mean. 1. Based on the average changes in species richness in Figure A, how many invasive species probably had negative effects on species richness, how many probably had positive effects on species richness, and how many probably had no effect on species richness? 2. Above (or below) each bar in Figure A is the percentage change in species richness for that invader. What do these percentages tell you about the likely direction and strength of the effect of invasive species on native community richness? Compare the rank order of the magnitude of the average change in species richness from Figure A with that of the change in species diversity (H) in Figure B. Does the order differ between the two measures and, if so, why? See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. *Hejda, M., P. Pysek, and V. Jorosik. 2009. Impact of invasive plants on the species richness, diversity, and composition of invaded communities. Journal of Ecology 97: 393\u2013403. Species within communities differ in their commonness or rarity Although species diversity indices allow ecologists to compare different communities, graphical representations of species diversity can give us a more explicit view of the commonness or rarity of the species in communities. Such graphs, called rank abundance curves, plot the proportional abundance of each species (pi) relative to the others in rank order, from most abundant to least abundant (FIGURE 16.8). If we use rank abundance curves to compare our two butterfly communities from Figure 16.6, we can see that community A has one abundant species (i.e., the blue butterfly) and three rare species (i.e., the yellow, pink, and orange butterfly species), whereas in community B, all the species have the same abundance. FIGURE 16.8 Are Species Common or Rare? Using rank abundance curves, we can see that the two hypothetical butterfly communities in Figure 16.6 differ in the commonness and rarity of the same four species. These two patterns could suggest the types of species interactions that might occur in these two communities. For example, the dominance of the blue butterfly in community A might indicate that it has a strong effect on one or more of the other species in the community. In community B, where all the species have the same abundance, their interactions might be fairly equivalent, with no one species dramatically affecting the others. To test these hypotheses, we can design manipulative experiments to explore relationships between species abundances and the types of interactions that occur among the species in a community.", "As we will see in the next section, experiments of this kind typically involve adding or removing a species and measuring the responses of other species in the community to the manipulation. For simplicity, we have considered a hypothetical example of species diversity patterns in butterfly communities. What do real communities reveal in this regard? An example from soil bacterial communities in Scotland can be found in WEB EXTENSION 16.1. Species diversity estimates vary with sampling effort and scale Let\u2019s imagine that you are sampling your backyard for insect species. It makes sense that the more samples you collect, the more species you are likely to find. However, eventually you reach a point in your sampling effort at which any additional sampling will reveal so few new species that you could stop sampling and still have a good notion of the species richness of your backyard. That point of \u201cno significant return\u201d for your effort can be determined using a species accumulation curve (FIGURE 16.9). These curves are calculated by plotting species richness as a function of sampling effort. In other words, each data point on a species accumulation curve represents the total number of species and the sampling effort up to that point. The more samples taken, the more individuals will be added, and the more species will be found. In theory, one could imagine, a threshold could be reached at which no new species would be added by additional sampling. In reality, this never occurs in natural systems, because new species are constantly being found. FIGURE 16.9 When Are All the Species Sampled? Species accumulation curves can help us determine when most or all of the species in a community have been observed. In this hypothetical example, the number of new species observed in each sample decreases after about half the individuals in the samples have accumulated. Jennifer Hughes and colleagues (2001) used species accumulation curves to ask how communities differ in the relationship between species richness and sampling effort. Are there some very diverse communities in which we are unable to estimate species richness accurately despite intensive sampling? Hughes and colleagues calculated species accumulation curves for five different communities: a temperate forest plant community in Michigan, a tropical bird community in Costa Rica, a tropical moth community in Costa Rica, a bacterial community from the human mouth, and a bacterial community from tropical soils in the eastern Amazon (FIGURE 16.10). To compare the curves properly, given that the communities differed substantially in organismal abundance and species richness, the data sets were standardized by calculating for each data point the proportions of the total number of individuals and species that had been sampled up to that point. The results showed that the species richnesses of the Michigan forest plant and Costa Rican bird communities were adequately represented well before half the individuals were sampled. Human oral bacteria and Costa Rican moth communities had species accumulation curves that never completely leveled off, suggesting that their species richness was high and that additional sampling would be required to achieve an approximation of that richness. Finally, the eastern Amazon soil bacterial community had a linear species accumulation curve, demonstrating that each new sample resulted in the observation of many new bacterial species. Based on this analysis, it is clear that the sampling effort for tropical bacteria was well below that needed to adequately estimate species richness in these hyperdiverse communities. FIGURE 16.10 Communities Differ in Their Species Accumulation Curves Hughes and colleagues found that communities of five different types varied greatly in the sampling effort that would be needed to estimate their species richness. The data sets were standardized by calculating for each data point the proportions of the total number of individuals and species that had been sampled up to that point. (After J. B. Hughes et al. 2001. Appl Environ Microbiol 67: 4399\u20134406.) Based on the graph, which of these communities would require more sampling to adequately estimate their species richness? Which would require very little additional sampling? A comparison of species accumulation curves not only provides valuable insight into the differences in species richness among communities, but also demonstrates the influence of the spatial scale at which sampling is carried out. For example, if we were to sample the richness of bacteria in tropical soils at the same scale at which we sampled Costa Rican moths, the bacterial richness would be immense in comparison.", "But such comparisons do suggest that our ability to sample all the bacteria in the human mouth is roughly equivalent to our ability to sample all the moth species in a few hundred square kilometers of tropical forest. The work of Hughes et al. also reminds us how little we know about the community structural characteristics of rarely sampled assemblages, such as microbial communities. Species composition tells us who is in the community A final element of a community\u2019s structure is its species composition: the identity of the species present in the community. Species composition is an obvious but important characteristic that is not revealed in species diversity indices. For example, two communities might have the same species diversity value but have completely different members. In the case of the bacterial communities in Scottish pastures that we considered in WEB EXTENSION 16.1, although diversity indices for two communities were nearly identical, their composition differed. Five taxonomic groups of bacteria out of the 20 the researchers found were present in one or the other pasture, but not in both. In many ways, community structure is the starting point for more interesting questions: How do species in the community interact with one another? Do some species play greater roles in the community than others? How is species diversity maintained? How does this information shape our view of communities in terms of conservation and the services they provide to humans? Let\u2019s move from the rather static view of communities as groups of species occurring together in space and time to a more active view of them as complex networks of species with connections and interactions that vary in strength, direction, and significance. Self-Assessment 16.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED \u201cKiller Algae!\u201d The introduction of Caulerpa taxifolia into the Mediterranean Sea in the early 1980s set in motion a series of unfortunate events that resulted in large carpets of fluorescent green algae dominating formerly species-rich nearshore marine communities. Caulerpa thrived because humans facilitated its dispersal and its physiological tolerance. Even in the early stages of the invasion, Meinesz documented the seaweed in at least three types of communities, with different species compositions, on rocky, sandy, and muddy substrates. Together, these communities are home to several hundred species of algae and three marine flowering plants, as well as a number of animal species. Once Caulerpa arrived, native competitor and herbivore species were unable to keep it from spreading. The invasion of Caulerpa has changed the ways in which native species interact with one another, and thus the structure and function of the native communities. One obvious consequence of the presence of Caulerpa is the decline of seagrass meadows dominated by Posidonia oceanica (FIGURE 16.21). This seagrass has been likened to an \u201cunderwater tree\u201d because of its long life span and slow growth (patches grow to 3 m in diameter in 100 years). Just like forests, seagrass meadows support a multitude of species that use the vegetation as habitat. Research showed that Posidonia and Caulerpa have different growth cycles: Posidonia loses blades in summer, when Caulerpa is most productive. Over time, these asynchronous growth patterns result in Caulerpa overgrowing the existing seagrasses and establishing itself as the foundation species. Additional research has shown that Caulerpa acts as an ecosystem engineer, accumulating sediments around its roots more readily than Posidonia, which can change the species composition of the small invertebrates that live on the seafloor. Some surveys have revealed a significant drop in the numbers and sizes of fish using the communities invaded by Caulerpa, suggesting that these habitats may be less suitable for some commercially important species. FIGURE 16.21 A Mediterranean Seagrass Meadow Native communities like this one, dominated by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, can be replaced by invasive Caulerpa taxifolia. Compare this photograph with Figure 16.1. Future changes in Mediterranean seagrass meadows, and in the species dependent on them, will be difficult to predict, given the sheer number of species that are potentially affected by Caulerpa, the indirect effects that will be generated by changing interactions, and the relatively short time that has elapsed since the invasion began. A scientific approach, guided by a combination of theory and real-world observations, will be necessary if future predictions are to be made about the ultimate effect of Caulerpa on this potentially vanishing underwater community. CONNECTIONS in NATURE STOPPING INVASIONS REQUIRES COMMITMENT", "Even though it may be too late to stop the invasion of Caulerpa taxifolia in the Mediterranean, the lessons learned there have been important in other regions of the world. In 2000, just as Meinesz was making progress in banning international trade of the alga, he received an e-mail from an environmental consultant in San Diego, California. While surveying eelgrass in a lagoon, she had noticed a large patch of what was later identified as Caulerpa taxifolia. Acting on Meinesz\u2019s recommendation, a team of scientists and managers from county, state, and federal agencies immediately assembled to design an eradication plan. This plan involved treating the alga with chlorine gas injected under tarps placed on top of algal patches. More than $1 million was initially budgeted for the project in 2000, but it eventually took 6 years and $7 million to eradicate the alga. The invasion was widely publicized, resulting in the discovery of another patch of Caulerpa in another lagoon near Los Angeles, which was also eradicated. The California experience is a rare success story only because immediate action was taken by scientists, managers, and policymakers to deal with the invasion before eradication became an ecological and fiscal impossibility. To determine the origin of the Caulerpa that invaded California, molecular evidence was needed. This shift in the team\u2019s focus from communities to genes illustrates a point made in Chapter 1: ecologists must study interactions in nature across many levels of biological organization. The team sent specimens of the alga to geneticists at two universities, who analyzed the sequences of its ribosomal DNA and quickly determined that they were identical to those of Caulerpa from the Mediterranean, the Wilhelma Zoo (where the strain was first cultivated), and many other public aquariums around the world (Jousson et al. 2000). Unfortunately, it is still unknown how the species was introduced into the two California lagoons, but hypotheses range from amateur aquarists cleaning their tanks in the lagoons to an accidental release from aquariums on board a Saudi Arabian prince\u2019s yacht, which was being repainted in San Diego at about the time the alga probably arrived. Through the use of DNA analysis, it has been determined that the Caulerpa algae involved in subsequent invasions in Australia and Japan are genetically identical to the original German Caulerpa taxifolia strain. The molecular evidence makes it clear that the trade of this alga in aquarium circles poses a global threat to nearshore temperate marine environments. Legislation is now in place to ban the \u201ckiller alga\u201d from a number of other countries where it has a good chance of invading successfully. Change in Communities KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 17.1 Agents of change act on communities across all temporal and spatial scales. CONCEPT 17.2 Succession is the process of change in species composition over time as a result of abiotic and biotic agents of change. CONCEPT 17.3 Experimental work on succession shows its mechanisms to be diverse and context dependent. CONCEPT 17.4 Communities can follow different successional paths and display alternative states. A Natural Experiment of Mountainous Proportions: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 The eruption of Mount St. Helens was a defining moment for ecologists interested in natural catastrophes. Mount St. Helens, located in Washington State, is part of the geologically active Cascade Range, located in the Pacific Northwest region of North America (FIGURE 17.1). The once frosty-topped mountain had a rich diversity of ecological communities. If you had visited Mount St. Helens in the summer, you could have seen alpine meadows filled with colorful wildflowers and grazing elk. At lower elevations, you could have hiked across the cool fern- and moss-covered forest floor under massive old-growth trees. You could have swum in the blue, clear water of Spirit Lake, or fished along its shores. But a few minutes after 8:30 a.m. on May 18, 1980, all that was living on Mount St. Helens would be gone. On the north side of the mountain, a huge magma-filled bulge had been forming for months. The bulge gave way that morning in an explosive eruption and the largest avalanche in recorded history. FIGURE 17.1 Once a Peaceful Mountain Before the eruption on May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens, in southwestern Washington State, had a diversity of communities, including alpine meadows, old-growth forests, and lakes and streams.", "Photos of the eruption show that mud and rock flowed down the face of Mount St. Helens and were deposited tens of meters deep in some areas (FIGURE 17.2). The wave of debris that passed over Spirit Lake was 260 m (858 feet) deep and decreased the lake\u2019s water depth by 60 m (200 feet). The bulk of the avalanche traveled 23 km (14 miles) in about 10 minutes to the North Fork Toutle River, where it scoured the entire valley, from floor to rim, with material from the volcano and left a truly massive pile of tangled vegetation at its tail end. In addition to the avalanche, the blast produced a cloud of hot air that burned forests to ash near the mountain, blew down trees over a large area, and left dead but standing trees stretching for miles away from the mountain. Ash from the explosion blanketed forests, grasslands, and deserts located hundreds of kilometers away. FIGURE 17.2 A Transformed Mount St. Helens Organisms on Mount St. Helens were scorched, pounded by pumice, covered in mud, and blown down by the eruption. The eruption had different effects on the geology of the mountain at different locations, creating many new habitats. (Map after V. H. Dale et al. 2005. Ecological Responses to the 1980 Eruption of Mount St. Helens. Springer: New York.) Given that the blast was directed to the north, which habitats experienced the most change and which experienced the least? The destruction that ensued on that day created whole new habitats on Mount St. Helens, some of which were completely devoid of any living organisms. At one extreme, there was the Pumice Plain, a large, gently sloping moonscape of a place below the volcano, that had been pelted with hot, sterilizing pumice (see Figure 17.2). This harsh and geologically monotonic environment lacked life, or even organic matter, of any form. All life in Spirit Lake was extinguished, and huge amounts of woody debris were deposited there, some of which still floats on top of the lake today. But, not surprisingly, given the large forests that had surrounded the mountain, the majority of the landscape consisted of downed or denuded trees covered with rock, gravel, and mud tens of meters deep in some places (see Figure 17.2). Compared with the Pumice Plain, this blowdown zone had some hope of a biological legacy buried under the piles of trees and ash. Shortly after the eruption, helicopters delivered the first scientists to the mountain to begin studying what was essentially a natural experiment of epic proportions. A few lucky ecologists recorded the first observations of the sequence of biological changes that began soon after the eruption. Field excursions in the summers of 1980 and 1981 were organized, and valuable baseline data were collected. Now, 40 years later, hundreds of ecologists have studied the reemergence of life on Mount St. Helens. For many, the experience has been life-changing, and their careers have been consumed by research on this fascinating study system. Much of what has been learned has been unexpected and has changed the way we view the recovery of communities and the persistence of life on Earth. View the script for the video Introduction One constant that all ecologists can agree on is that communities are always changing. Some communities show more dynamism than others. For example, it is hard to imagine that desert communities, with their large, stoic cacti, have changed much over time. This is especially true if you compare deserts with, for example, high mountain streams or rocky intertidal zones, where species are coming and going on a regular basis. But community change is relative, and there is no question that even deserts change, though at a much slower pace than we might realize on the basis of one visit, or even one ecological study. Unfortunately, we humans cannot deny that our actions are becoming one of the strongest forces of change in communities, and that we are taking those actions with an imperfect understanding of their consequences. In this chapter, we will consider the agents of change in communities, from subtle to catastrophic, and their effects on community structure over time. CONCEPT 17.1 Agents of change act on communities across all temporal and spatial scales. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 17.1.1 Define abiotic and biotic agents of change including disturbance and stress. 17.1.2 Compare disturbance intensity with disturbance frequency and describe their differential effects on communities.", "Agents of Change Let\u2019s imagine for a moment that you have the ability to look back in time and follow the change in a typical coral reef community in the Indian Ocean (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 17.3). Over the last few decades, you might have seen considerable change, both subtle and catastrophic. Subtle changes might include the slow rise to dominance of certain coral species, and the slow decline of others, due to the effects of competition, predation, and disease. More catastrophic changes might include the massive deaths of corals in the last decade due to bleaching (loss of symbiotic algae, as described in Concept 3.3) and the great tsunami of 2004, resulting in the replacement of some coral species with other species, or no replacement at all. Taken together, these changes make the community what it is today: a community that has fewer coral species than it did a few decades ago, the effect of a combination of natural and human-caused agents of change. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 17.3 Change Happens Coral reef communities in the Indian Ocean have experienced large changes over the last few decades. The agents of change have been both subtle and catastrophic, natural and human-caused. Succession is change in the species composition of communities over time. Succession is the result of a variety of abiotic (physical and chemical) and biotic agents of change. In Concepts 17.2\u201317.4, we will consider the theory behind succession and examples that illustrate how it works in a variety of systems. But first, in this section, we will identify and define the agents of change that are most responsible for driving succession. Agents of change can be abiotic or biotic Communities, and the species contained within them, change in response to a number of abiotic and biotic factors (TABLE 17.1). We have considered many of these factors in previous chapters. In Unit 1, we learned that abiotic factors, in the form of climate, soils, nutrients, and water, vary over daily, seasonal, decadal, and even 100,000-year time scales. This variation has important implications for community change. For example, in Indian Ocean coral reef communities (see INTERACTIVE Figure 17.3), unusually high water temperatures driven by large-scale climate change have been implicated in recent losses of symbiotic algae from corals, resulting in coral bleaching. If the symbiotic algae do not return, the corals will eventually die, thus creating the conditions for species replacement. Likewise, increases in sea level can decrease the amount of light that reaches the corals. If light availability falls below the physiological limits of some coral species, they could slowly be replaced by more tolerant species, or even by macroalgae (seaweeds). Finally, increasing ocean acidification can dissolve the skeletons of corals, hindering their growth (see Chapter 25 and Chapter 16\u2019s Climate Change Connection for more information on climate change and ocean acidification). Because these abiotic conditions are constantly changing, communities are doing the same, at a pace consistent with their environment. TABLE 17.1 Examples of Abiotic and Biotic Agents of Stress, Disturbance, and Change in Communities Agent of change Examples Abiotic factors Waves, currents Storms, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, ocean upwelling Wind Storms, hurricanes and tornados, wind-driven sediment scouring Water supply Droughts, floods, mudslides Chemical composition Pollution, acid rain, high or low salinity, high or low nutrient supply Freezing, snow and ice, avalanches, excessive heat, fire, sea level rise orTemperature fall Volcanic activity Lava, hot gases, mudslides, flying rocks and debris, floods Biotic factors Competition, predation, herbivory, disease, parasitism, trampling,Negative interactions digging, boring Source: Adapted, with additions, from W. P. Sousa. 2001. In Marine Community Ecology, M. D. Bertness et al. (Eds.), pp. 85\u2013130. Oxford University Press/Sinauer: Sunderland, MA. Abiotic agents of change can be placed into two categories, both of which can have either natural or human origins, but which differ in the effects they have on species: disturbances and stresses. A disturbance is an abiotic event that physically injures or kills some individuals and creates opportunities for other individuals to grow or reproduce. Some ecologists also consider biotic events such as digging by animals to be disturbances. In our coral reef example, the 2004 tsunami can be viewed as a disturbance because the force of water passing over the reef injured and killed many coral individuals. Likewise, the outlawed practice of blast fishing, which involves using dynamite to stun or kill fish for easy collection, can cause massive injury and death in coral reefs.", "Even biotic events such as coral boring by snails or predation by parrot fishes can be considered disturbances because they remove coral tissue and weaken coral skeletons. Stress, on the other hand, occurs when some abiotic factor reduces the growth, reproduction, or survival of individuals and creates opportunities for other individuals. A stress in our coral reef might be the effect of warmer water temperatures or sea level rise on the growth, reproduction, or survival of corals. Examples of other stresses and disturbances are included in Table 17.1. Both disturbance and stress are believed to play critical roles in driving succession. How do biotic factors influence community change? In Unit 4, we saw that species interactions, both negative and positive, can result in the replacement of one species with another through stress and disturbance. In our coral reef (see INTERACTIVE Figure 17.3), change might be driven by competition between, for example, platelike corals and branched corals, with the platelike forms eventually dominating over time. Coral diseases are another example of a species interaction that can initiate change in communities by causing particular coral species to grow more slowly or eventually die. Equally common agents of change are the actions of ecosystem engineers and keystone species (see Figures 16.16 and 16.17). Both types of species have large effects on other species that result in community change. Finally, it is important to realize that abiotic and biotic factors often interact to produce change in communities. We can see this interaction in the case of ecosystem engineers such as beavers, which cause changes in abiotic conditions that in turn cause species replacement (see Figure 16.18). Similarly, abiotic factors such as wind, waves, or temperature can act by modifying species interactions, either positively or negatively, thus creating opportunities for other species. We have seen examples of this kind of effect on sea palms in the rocky intertidal zone (see Figure 14.18), plants in alpine regions (see Figure 15.9), and stream insects in Northern California (see Figure 16.19). Agents of change vary in their intensity, frequency, and extent As you might guess, the tempo of succession is largely determined by how often, at what magnitude, and to what areal extent agents of change act. For example, when the avalanche produced by Mount St. Helens ripped through the alpine community back in 1980, it produced a disturbance that was larger and more severe than any others that had occurred that year, that decade, or that century. The intensity, or severity, of that disturbance\u2014the amount of damage and death it caused\u2014was huge, both because of the massive physical force involved and because of the area covered. In contrast, the frequency of that kind of disturbance is low because such eruptive episodes are so rare (occurring once every few centuries). Extremely intense and infrequent events, such as the eruption of Mount St. Helens, are at the far end of the spectrum of disturbances organisms experience in communities (FIGURE 17.4). In this case, the entire community is affected, and recovery involves the complete reassembly of the community over time. We will consider the mechanisms of that reassembly in Concepts 17.2\u201317.4. FIGURE 17.4 The Spectrum of Disturbance How much biomass is removed (the intensity, or severity, of disturbance) and how often it is removed (the frequency of disturbance) can influence the amount of change (represented by the size of the red circles) that occurs and the type of succession that is possible afterward (right side of the graph). Describe how the type of organism being studied might influence whether we classify a disturbance as being intense or frequent. At the other end of the spectrum are weak and frequent disturbances that may have more subtle effects or affect a smaller area (see Figure 17.4). Prior to the eruption of Mount St. Helens, such disturbances might have included wind blowing down old trees living in the Douglas fir forests surrounding the mountain. These more frequent disturbances open up patches of resources that can be used by individuals of the same or different species. A mosaic of disturbed patches can promote species diversity in communities over time but may not lead to much successional change. We will learn more about these smaller disturbances and their effects on species diversity in Chapter 19. For now, let\u2019s turn our attention from the agents of change to their consequences for community succession. Self-Assessment 17.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.]", "CONCEPT 17.2 Succession is the process of change in species composition over time as a result of abiotic and biotic agents of change. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 17.2.1 Compare primary succession with secondary succession. 17.2.2 Discuss the early research and differential views of early ecologists with regard to succession. 17.2.3 Outline the multiple models of succession and compare their differences. The Basics of Succession At the most basic level, the term \u201csuccession\u201d refers to the process by which the species composition of a community changes over time. Mechanistically, succession involves colonization and extinction due to abiotic and biotic agents of change. Even though studies of succession often focus on changes in vegetation, the roles of animals, fungi, bacteria, and other microbes are equally important. Theoretically, succession progresses through various stages that include a climax stage (FIGURE 17.5). The climax is thought to be a stable end point that experiences little change until a particularly intense disturbance sends the community back to an earlier stage. As we will see in Concepts 17.3 and 17.4, there is some argument about whether succession can ever lead to a stable end point. FIGURE 17.5 The Trajectory of Succession A simple model of succession involves transitions between stages driven by species replacements over time. Theoretically, these changes ultimately result in a climax stage that experiences little change. There is some argument, however, about whether succession can ever lead to a stable end point. Primary succession and secondary succession differ in their initial stages Ecologists recognize two types of succession that differ in their initial stages. The first type, primary succession, involves the colonization of habitats that are devoid of life (see Figure 17.5), either as a result of catastrophic disturbance, as we see on the Pumice Plain at Mount St. Helens, or because they are newly created habitats, such as volcanic rock. As you can imagine, primary succession can be very slow because the first arrivals (known as pioneer or early successional species) typically face extremely inhospitable conditions. Even the most basic resources needed to fuel life, such as soil, nutrients, and water, may be lacking. The first colonizers, then, tend to be species that are capable of withstanding great physiological stress and transforming the habitat in ways that benefit their further growth and expansion (and that of other species, as we will see). The other type of succession, known as secondary succession, involves the reestablishment of a community in which most, but not all, of the organisms or organic constituents have been destroyed (see Figure 17.5). Agents of change that can create such conditions include fire, hurricanes, logging, and herbivory. Despite the catastrophic effect of the eruption on Mount St. Helens, there were many areas, such as the blowdown zone, where some organisms survived and secondary succession took place. As you might expect, the legacy of the preexisting species and their interactions with colonizing species can play a large role in the trajectory of secondary succession. The early history of ecology is a study of succession The modern study of ecology had its beginnings at the turn of the twentieth century. At that time, it was dominated by scientists who were fascinated with plant communities and the changes they undergo over time. One of these pioneers was Henry Chandler Cowles, who studied the successional sequence of vegetation in sand dunes on the shore of Lake Michigan (FIGURE 17.6). In this ecosystem, the dunes are continually growing as new sand is deposited at the shoreline. This new sand is blown onshore when shorelines are exposed during droughts. Cowles was able to infer the successional pattern along a dune by assuming that the plant assemblages farthest from the lake\u2019s edge were the oldest and that the ones nearest the lake, where new sand was being deposited, were the youngest. As you walked from the lake to the back of the dune, he believed, you were traveling forward in time and able to imagine what the areas you had just passed through would look like in centuries to come. The first stages were dominated by a hardy ecosystem engineer, American beach grass (Ammophila breviligulata). Ammophila (whose genus name literally means \u201csand lover\u201d) is excellent at trapping sand and creating hills, which provide refuge on their leeward side for plants less tolerant of the constant burial and sand scouring experienced on the beachfront. FIGURE 17.6 Space for Time Substitution (A) The portion of a dune nearest the shoreline on Lake Michigan is covered with Ammophila.", "(B) When Henry Chandler Cowles studied succession on these dunes, he assumed that the earliest successional stages occurred on the newly deposited sand at the front of the dune, and that later successional stages occurred at the back of the dune. Cowles (1899) made the assumption that the different plant assemblages\u2014or \u201csocieties,\u201d as he called them\u2014that he saw in different positions on a dune represented different successional stages. That assumption allowed him to predict how a community would change over time without actually waiting for the pattern to unfold, which would have taken decades to centuries. This idea, known as the \u201cspace for time substitution\u201d (Pickett 1989), is used frequently as a practical way to study communities over time scales that exceed the life span of an ecologist. It assumes that time is the main factor causing communities to change and that unique conditions in particular locations are inconsequential. These are big assumptions, and they have fueled a debate about the predictability of community dynamics over time. We will discuss this debate in more detail in Concept 17.4, when we deal with alternative stable state theory. Henry Cowles was not alone in his interest in plant succession. His peers included Frederick Clements and Henry Gleason, two men who had completely different and contentious views on the mechanisms driving succession (Kingsland 1991). Clements, one of the first to write a formal book in 1907 on the new science of ecology, believed that plant communities were like \u201csuperorganisms,\u201d groups of species that worked together in a mutual effort toward some deterministic end. Succession was similar to the development of an organism, complete with a beginning (embryonic stage), middle (adult stage), and end (death). Clements (1916) thought that each community had its own predictable life history and, if left undisturbed, ultimately reached a stable end point. This \u201cclimax community\u201d was composed of species that dominated and persisted over many years and provided the type of stability that could potentially be maintained indefinitely. Gleason (1917) thought that viewing a community as an organism, with various interacting parts, ignored the responses of individual species to prevailing conditions. In his view, communities were not the predictable and repeatable result of coordinated interactions among species, but rather the random product of fluctuating environmental conditions acting on individual species. Each community was the product of a particular place and time and was thus unique in its own right. Looking back, it is clear that Gleason and Clements had extreme views of succession. As we will see in the next section, we can find elements of both theories in the results of studies that have accumulated over the last century. First, however, it is important to mention one last ecologist, Charles Elton (FIGURE 17.7A), whose perspective on succession was shaped not only by those of the botanists who came before him, but also by his interest in animals. He wrote his first book, Animal Ecology (1927), in 3 months\u2019 time at the age of 26. The book addresses many important ideas in ecology, including succession. Elton believed that organisms and the environment interact to shape the direction succession will take. He presented an example from pine forests in England that were being subjected to deforestation. After the felling of the pines, the trajectory of succession varied depending on the moisture content of the environment (FIGURE 17.7B). Wetter areas developed into sphagnum bogs, while slightly drier areas developed into wetlands containing rushes and grasses. Eventually, these communities all became birch scrub, but then ultimately diverged into two types of forest. Through these observations, Elton demonstrated that the only way to predict the trajectory of succession was to understand the biological and environmental context in which it occurred. FIGURE 17.7 Elton\u2019s Context-Dependent View of Succession (A) Charles Elton at the age of 25, a year before the publication of his first book, Animal Ecology (1927). (B) Elton\u2019s book contained this diagram of succession in pine forests after logging. The successional trajectory differed depending on the moisture content of a particular area: wetter areas became sphagnum bogs, while slightly drier areas became wetlands containing rushes (Juncus) and grasses (Molinia). Eventually, these communities all became birch scrub but then ultimately diverged into pine woods or mixed woods, again depending on moisture. (B from V. S. Summerhayes and P. H. Williams. 1926. J Ecol 14: 203\u2013243.) Elton\u2019s greatest contribution to the understanding of succession was his acknowledgment of the role of animals.", "Up to that point, most ecologists believed that plants drove succession, while animals were passive followers. Elton provided many examples showing how animals could create successional patterns by eating, dispersing, trampling, and destroying vegetation in ways that greatly affected the sequence and timing of succession. We will review some examples of animal-driven succession in the next section, but it is clear that the observations and conclusions Elton made 90 years ago still hold today. Multiple models of succession were stimulated by lack of scientific consensus Fascination with the mechanisms responsible for succession, and attempts to integrate the controversial theories of Clements, Cowles, and Elton, led ecologists to use more scientifically rigorous methods to explore succession, including comprehensive reviews of the literature and manipulative experiments. Joseph Connell and his collaborator Ralph Slatyer (1977) surveyed the literature and proposed three models of succession that they believed to be important (FIGURE 17.8). FIGURE 17.8 Three Models of Succession Connell and Slatyer proposed three conceptual models\u2014the facilitation, tolerance, and inhibition models\u2014to describe succession. (After J. H. Connell and R. O. Slatyer. 1977. Am Nat 111: 982.) \u2022 The facilitation model, inspired by Clements, describes situations in which the earliest colonizers modify the environment in ways that ultimately benefit later-arriving species but hinder their own continued dominance. These early successional species have characteristics that make them good at colonizing open habitats, dealing with physical stress, growing quickly to maturity, and ameliorating the harsh physical conditions often characteristic of early successional stages. Eventually, however, a sequence of species facilitations leads to a climax community composed of species that no longer facilitate other species and are displaced only by disturbances. \u2022 The tolerance model also assumes that the earliest colonizers modify the environment, but in neutral ways that neither benefit nor inhibit later species. These early successional species have life history strategies that allow them to grow and reproduce quickly. Later species persist merely because they have life history strategies such as slow growth, few offspring, and long life that allow them to tolerate increasing environmental or biological stresses that would hinder early successional species. \u2022 The inhibition model assumes that early successional species modify the environment in ways that hinder later successional species. For example, these early colonizers may monopolize resources needed by subsequent species. This suppression of the next stage of succession is broken only when stress or disturbance decreases the abundance of the inhibitory species. As in the tolerance model, later species persist merely because they have life history strategies that allow them to tolerate environmental or biological stresses that would otherwise hinder early successional species. Self-Assessment 17.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 17.3 Experimental work on succession shows its mechanisms to be diverse and context dependent. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 17.3.1 Analyze multiple studies to understand the diverse mechanisms involved in primary and secondary succession. 17.3.2 Summarize the results of experiments designed to determine the mechanisms of succession. Mechanisms of Succession More than 30 years have gone by since Connell and Slatyer wrote their influential theoretical paper on succession. Since that time, there have been a number of experimental tests of their three models. Those studies show that the mechanisms driving succession rarely conform to any one model, but instead are dependent on the community and the context in which experiments are conducted. No one model fits any one community To illustrate the types of successional mechanisms that have been revealed by experiments, we will focus on three studies: communities that form (1) after glacial retreat in Alaska, (2) after vegetation disturbance in salt marshes in New England, and (3) after wave disturbance in the rocky intertidal zone of the U.S. Pacific coast. PRIMARY SUCCESSION IN GLACIER BAY, ALASKA One of the best-studied examples of primary succession occurs in Glacier Bay, Alaska, where the melting of glaciers has led to a sequence of community change that reflects succession over many centuries (FIGURE 17.9). Captain George Vancouver first recorded the location of glacial ice there in 1794, while exploring the west coast of North America. Over the last 200 years, the glaciers have retreated up the bay, leaving behind bare, broken rock (known as glacial till). John Muir, in his book Travels in Alaska (1915), first noted how much the glaciers had melted since Vancouver\u2019s time.", "When he visited Glacier Bay in 1879, he camped among ancient tree stumps that had once been covered by ice and saw forests that had grown up in previously glaciated areas. He was impressed with the dynamic nature of the landscape and how the plant community responded to the changes. FIGURE 17.9 Glacial Retreat in Glacier Bay, Alaska Over more than 200 years, the melting of glaciers has exposed bare rock to colonization and succession. (After F. S. Chapin et al. 1994. Ecol Monogr 64: 149\u2013175.) Based on the locations of the glaciers over time, describe where the oldest and youngest communities are located. Muir\u2019s book sparked the interest of William S. Cooper (1923a), who began his studies of Glacier Bay in 1915. A former student of Henry Chandler Cowles, Cooper saw Glacier Bay as an example of the \u201cspace for time substitution\u201d so well documented by his advisor in the Lake Michigan dunes. He established permanent plots (Cooper 1923b) that have allowed researchers to observe the pattern of community change along the bay from Vancouver\u2019s time to today. This pattern is generally characterized by an increase in plant species richness and a change in plant species composition with time and distance from the melting ice front (FIGURE 17.10). In the first years after new habitat is exposed, a primary or pioneer stage develops, dominated by a few species that include lichens, mosses, horsetails, willows, and cottonwoods. Roughly 30 years after exposure, a second community develops, named the Dryas stage after the small shrub (Dryas drummondii) that dominates this community. In this stage, species richness increases, with willows, cottonwoods, alders (Alnus sinuata), and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) sparsely distributed among the carpet of Dryas. After about 50 years (or some 20 km from the ice front), alders dominate, forming the third community, referred to as the alder stage. Finally, a century after glacial retreat, a mature Sitka spruce forest (the spruce stage) is in place, which fosters a diverse array of lichens, low shrubs, and herbs. Reiners et al. (1971) documented that 200 years after exposure, species richness decreases somewhat as Sitka spruce forests are transformed into forests of longer-living western hemlocks. FIGURE 17.10 Successional Communities at Glacier Bay, Alaska Plant species richness has generally increased over the 200 years following glacial retreat. (After W. A. Reiners et al. 1971. Ecology 52: 55\u201369.) The mechanisms underlying succession in this system have been studied extensively by F. Stuart Chapin and colleagues (1994). They wondered, given the harsh physical conditions experienced by most species in the pioneer stage, whether the facilitation model could explain the pattern of succession observed by Cooper and Reiners et al. First, they analyzed the soils of the different successional stages. They found significant changes in soil properties that were coincident with the increases in plant species richness (FIGURE 17.11). Not only were there increases in soil organic matter and soil moisture in later stages of succession, but nitrogen increased more than fivefold from the alder stage to the spruce stage. (This increase resulted from the action of nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with plant roots, which we\u2019ll describe in more detail in this chapter\u2019s Connections in Nature.) Chapin hypothesized that the assemblage of species at each stage of succession was having effects on the physical environment that largely shaped the pattern of community formation. The question remained, however, whether those effects were facilitative or inhibitory, and how they varied across the different successional stages. FIGURE 17.11 Soil Properties Change with Succession Chapin and colleagues studied the properties of the soils in each of four successional stages at Glacier Bay. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After F. S. Chapin et al. 1994. Ecol Monogr 64: 149\u2013175.) To test their facilitation hypothesis, Chapin et al. (1994) conducted manipulative experiments. They added spruce seeds to each of the successional stages and observed their germination, growth, and survival over time. These experiments, along with observations of unmanipulated plots, showed that neighboring plants had both facilitative and inhibitory effects on the spruce seedlings but that the directions and strengths of those effects varied with the stage of succession (FIGURE 17.12). For example, in the pioneer stage, spruce seedlings had a low germination rate, but a higher survival rate, than in later successional stages.", "In the Dryas stage, spruce seedlings had low germination and survival rates due to increases in seed predators, but those individuals that did survive grew better because of the presence of nitrogen fixed by symbiotic bacteria associated with Dryas. In the alder stage, a further increase in nitrogen (alders also host nitrogen-fixing bacteria) and an increase in soil organic matter had positive effects on spruce seedlings, but shading and seed predators led to overall low germination and survival rates. In this stage, alders had a net positive effect on spruce seedlings that germinated before alders were able to dominate. Finally, in the spruce stage, the effects of large spruce on spruce seedlings were mostly negative and long-lasting. Growth and survival rates were low because of competition with adult spruce for light, space, and nitrogen. Interestingly, seed production by adults was enhanced, which led to relatively high seedling numbers merely as a consequence of the many more seeds available for germination. FIGURE 17.12 Both Positive and Negative Effects Influence Succession The relative contributions of positive and negative effects of other species on spruce seedling establishment changed across successional stages in Glacier Bay, Alaska. Positive effects equaled or outweighed negative effects in the first three stages, but the opposite was seen in the last spruce stage. (After F. S. Chapin et al. 1994. Ecol Monogr 64: 149\u2013175.) Thus, in Glacier Bay, the mechanisms outlined in Connell and Slatyer\u2019s models were operating in at least some stages of succession. Early on, aspects of the facilitation model were seen as plants modified the habitat in positive ways for other plants and animals. Species such as alders had negative effects on later successional species unless they were able to colonize early, supporting the inhibition model. Finally, some stages\u2014such as the spruce stage, in which dominance was a result of slow growth and long life\u2014were driven by life history characteristics, a signature of the tolerance model. SECONDARY SUCCESSION IN A NEW ENGLAND SALT MARSH What do other studies show with regard to Connell and Slatyer\u2019s three models? Mark Bertness and Scott Shumway studied the relative importance of facilitative versus inhibitory interactions in controlling secondary succession in a New England salt marsh. Salt marshes are characterized by different species compositions and physical conditions at different tidal elevations. The shoreline border of the marsh is dominated by the cordgrass Spartina patens, whereas dense stands of the black rush Juncus gerardii are found between the shoreline and the terrestrial border. A common natural disturbance in salt marsh habitats is the deposition of tidally transported dead plant material known as wrack (FIGURE 17.13). The wrack smothers and kills plants, creating bare patches where secondary succession takes place. Soil salinity is high in these patches because, without shading by plants, water evaporation increases, leaving behind salt deposits. The patches are initially colonized by the spike grass Distichlis spicata, an early successional species that is eventually outcompeted by Spartina and Juncus in their respective zones. FIGURE 17.13 Wrack Creates Bare Patches in Salt Marshes A tidal deposit of wrack at Rumstick Cove, Rhode Island, where Bertness and Shumway conducted their research on secondary succession. This dead plant material smothers living plants, creating bare patches with high soil salinity. Bertness and Shumway (1993) hypothesized that Distichlis could either facilitate or inhibit later colonization by Spartina or Juncus depending on the salt stress experienced by the interacting plants. To test this idea, they created bare patches in two zones of a marsh and manipulated plant interactions shortly after the patches had been colonized (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 17.14). In the low intertidal zone (the Spartina zone, close to the shoreline), they removed Distichlis from half the newly colonized patches, leaving Spartina, and removed Spartina from the other half, leaving Distichlis. In the middle intertidal zone (the Juncus zone, closer to the terrestrial border of the marsh), they performed similar manipulations, with Juncus and Distichlis as the target species. Control patches, in which the colonization process was not manipulated, were maintained in both zones. In addition, they watered half the patches in each treatment group with fresh water to alleviate salt stress, and left half as controls. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 17.14 New England Salt Marsh Succession Is Context Dependent The trajectory of succession in salt marshes depends on soil salinity and the physiological tolerances of plant species. The kinds of interactions observed differed between the low intertidal zone (A) and the middle intertidal zone (B). Error bars show one SE of the mean.", "(After M. D. Bertness and S. W. Shumway. 1993. Am Nat 142: 718\u2013724.) After observing the patches for 2 years, Bertness and Shumway found that the mechanisms of succession differed depending on the level of salt stress experienced by the plants and the species interactions involved. In the low intertidal zone, Spartina always colonized and dominated the plots, whether or not Distichlis was present or watering occurred (INTERACTIVE Figure 17.14A). Distichlis was able to dominate only if Spartina was removed from the plots, so it was clearly inhibited by Spartina, the dominant competitor. In the middle intertidal zone, Juncus was able to colonize only if Distichlis was present or watering occurred (INTERACTIVE Figure 17.14B). Measurements of soil salinity confirmed that the presence of Distichlis helped to shade the soil surface, thus decreasing salt accumulation and reducing stress for Juncus. Distichlis, however, was able to colonize plots with Juncus only when salt stress was high\u2014that is, under the control conditions. If plots were watered, Distichlis was easily outcompeted by Juncus. These experimental manipulations confirmed that the mechanisms important to succession are context dependent. No single model is sufficient to explain the underlying causes of succession. In the middle intertidal zone, Distichlis was a strong facilitator of colonization by Juncus. Once this facilitation occurred, the balance was tipped in favor of Juncus, which outcompeted Distichlis (see INTERACTIVE Figure 17.14B). In the low intertidal zone, Distichlis and Spartina were equally able to colonize and grow in salty patches. If Spartina arrived first, it inhibited Distichlis colonization. If Distichlis arrived first, it persisted only if Spartina did not arrive and displace it (see INTERACTIVE Figure 17.14A). PRIMARY SUCCESSION IN ROCKY INTERTIDAL COMMUNITIES Our final examples come from an environment where succession has been studied extensively: the rocky intertidal zone. Here, disturbances are created mainly by waves, which can tear organisms from the rocks during storms or propel objects such as logs or boulders into them. In addition, stresses caused by low tides that expose organisms to high or low air temperatures can easily kill them or cause them to lose their attachment to the rocks. The resulting bare rock patches become active areas of colonization and succession. Some of the first experimental work on succession in the rocky intertidal zone was done on boulder fields in Southern California by Wayne Sousa, a graduate student at the time. Sousa (1979b) noticed that the algae-dominated communities on these boulders experienced disturbance every time the boulders were overturned by waves. When he cleared some patches on the boulders and observed succession in those patches over time, he found that the first species to colonize and dominate a patch was always the bright green alga Ulva lactuca (FIGURE 17.15A). It was followed by the red alga Gigartina canaliculata. To understand the mechanisms controlling this successional sequence, Sousa performed removal experiments on concrete blocks that he had allowed Ulva to colonize. He found that colonization by Gigartina was accelerated if Ulva was removed (FIGURE 17.15B). This result suggested inhibition as the main mechanism controlling succession, but a question remained: if Ulva is able to inhibit other seaweed species, why doesn\u2019t it always dominate? Through a series of further experiments, Sousa found that grazing crabs preferentially fed on Ulva, thus initiating a transition from the early Ulva stage to other mid-successional algal species. In turn, the mid-successional species were more susceptible to the effects of stress and parasitic algae than the late successional Gigartina. Gigartina dominated because it was the least susceptible to stress and consumer pressures. FIGURE 17.15 Algal Succession on Southern California Boulders Is Driven by Inhibition (A) Drawings and data from a 2-year study of the successional sequence of algae in bare patches on boulder fields in the rocky intertidal zone of Southern California. (B) In a study that lasted 4 months, Sousa performed removal experiments on concrete blocks to understand the mechanisms of succession in this ecosystem. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (After W. P. Sousa. 1979b. Ecol Monogr 49: 227\u2013254.) This view of rocky intertidal succession as driven by inhibition was the accepted paradigm for many years. Facilitation and tolerance were thought to be much less important in a system where competition for space was strong. More recent work by Terence Farrell and others (e.g., Berlow 1997) demonstrated that the relative importance of inhibition is probably much more context dependent than previously thought.", "In the more productive rocky intertidal zone of the Oregon coast, the communities include many more sessile invertebrates, such as barnacles and mussels, than Sousa\u2019s communities of the Southern California coast, where seaweeds dominate. In the high intertidal zone of Oregon, Farrell (1991) found that the first colonizer of bare patches was a barnacle, Chthamalus dalli. It was replaced by another, larger barnacle species, Balanus glandula, which was then replaced by three species of macroalgae, Pelvetiopsis limitata, Fucus gardneri, and Endocladia muricata. A series of removal experiments showed that Chthamalus did not inhibit colonization by Balanus, but that Balanus was able to outcompete Chthamalus over time, thus supporting the tolerance model. Likewise, Balanus did not hinder macroalgal colonization, but in fact facilitated it, lending credibility to the facilitation model. But why and how would Balanus facilitate macroalgal colonization? Farrell suspected that Balanus protected the algae in some way, possibly from desiccation stress or grazing by limpets (herbivorous marine snails). To test this idea, Farrell created experimental plots from which Balanus, limpets, or both were removed, then observed macroalgal colonization in those plots. He found that macroalgae colonized all of the plots without limpets but had a much higher density in the plots with barnacles than in those without barnacles (FIGURE 17.16A). These results suggested that Balanus did indeed act to impede limpets from grazing on newly settled macroalgal sporelings. FIGURE 17.16 Algal Succession on the Oregon Coast Is Driven by Facilitation (A) Changes in macroalgal densities over time were measured in plots from which Balanus barnacles, limpets, or both had been removed. The results suggested that Balanus facilitates macroalgae by reducing limpet grazing. (B) To understand the mechanisms of the facilitation, large barnacle mimics were added to some plots and compared with plots from which the real barnacle species \u2014Balanus, Chthamalus, or both\u2014had been removed. The results suggested that the larger the barnacle species, the better it protects macroalgae against limpet grazing and desiccation. (After T. M. Farrell. 1991. Ecol Monogr 61: 95\u2013113.) You might be asking yourself, Why doesn\u2019t Chthamalus have the same facilitative effect on macroalgae that Balanus does? Farrell suspected that the reason was Balanus\u2019s larger size (it is nearly three times wider than Chthamalus). By using plaster casts to mimic barnacles that were slightly larger than Balanus, Farrell found that these barnacle mimics had an even more positive effect on macroalgal colonization than did smaller-sized live barnacles of either species (FIGURE 17.16B). It seems likely that the smaller and smoother Chthamalus does not retain as much moisture, or block as many limpets, as the larger and more sculpted Balanus\u2014or the mimics, for that matter. Experiments show facilitation to be important in early stages A number of experimental studies like the ones we have just described, initially stimulated by Connell and Slatyer\u2019s 1977 paper, suggest that succession in any community is driven by a complex array of mechanisms (see ANALYZING DATA 17.1). No one model fits any one community; instead, each community is characterized by elements of all three of Connell and Slatyer\u2019s models. In most successional sequences, especially those in which a pioneer stage is exposed to physically stressful conditions, facilitative interactions are important drivers of early succession. Organisms that can tolerate and modify these physically challenging environments will thrive and facilitate other organisms that lack those capabilities. As succession progresses, slow-growing and long-lived species begin to dominate. Those species tend to be larger and more competitively dominant than early successional species. For this reason, one might expect competition to play a more dominant role than facilitation later in succession. ANALYZING DATA 17.1 We learned in Concept 17.3 that successional patterns are often the result of complex species interactions. Such interactions are exemplified in a study investigating the patterns of succession in mountain forests in Utah dominated by quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) (Calder and St. Clair 2012). * In some cases, aspen can form stable and self-sustaining populations, but more commonly these trees occur in mixed stands with firs. Observations show that aspen initiate the earliest stage of secondary succession in open meadows created by fire or deforestation, using root suckers (underground shoots that produce clonal plants; see Figure 9.5) to colonize open meadows. Over time, mixed aspen\u2013fir stands are formed as the shade-tolerant firs become established and increase in abundance while aspen decline.", "The stands are eventually dominated by firs, which are more susceptible to fire than pure stands of aspen, thus increasing the chance of starting the successional cycle anew. To understand the transition from one successional stage to another, Calder and St. Clair counted the aspen suckers and fir seedlings in four successional stages\u2014meadow, aspen, mixed aspen\u2013fir, and fir\u2014with the results shown in FIGURE A. To test for the type of interaction important in the transition from one stage to another, the researchers then measured the mortality of canopy aspen and subalpine fir trees as a function of their distance from the nearest neighboring tree of the other species. These results are given in FIGURE B. Error bars show one SE of the mean. 1. Based on the data in Figure A, what is the pattern of aspen abundance over the four successional stages? How does the abundance pattern of subalpine fir differ? Do these patterns of abundance of aspen and fir support the successional sequence described in the first paragraph above? 2. What type of interspecific interaction would you hypothesize could account for the difference between the number of fir seedlings in the aspen stage and in the meadow stage in Figure A? What type of interspecific interaction might explain the difference between the number of aspen suckers in the mixed and the fir stages? 3. Now consider Figure B. What happens to fir trees when they live close (<0.5 m) to aspen trees? What happens to aspen when they live close (<0.5 m) to fir trees? Do these data support your previous hypotheses (from question 2) about the types of species interactions driving succession? 4. Which of Connell and Slatyer\u2019s three models (see Figure 17.8) best fits the results of this study? Why? See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. *Calder, W. J. and S. B. St. Clair. 2012. Facilitation drives mortality patterns along successional gradients of aspen-conifer forest. Ecosphere 3: 1\u201311. CC BY 3.0. As succession proceeds, species richness typically increases (see Figure 17.10); thus, we must recognize that vast arrays of both positive and negative interactions are operating in mid- to late successional stages. We will learn more about the mechanisms responsible for controlling species diversity in Chapter 19, but let\u2019s turn our attention next to the question of whether succession always takes one predictable path, as Clements believed, or whether other paths are possible. Self-Assessment 17.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 17.4 Communities can follow different successional paths and display alternative states. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 17.4.1 Define alternative stable states and stability using empirical data and models. 17.4.2 Describe how human activities have caused regime shifts. Alternative Stable States Up to this point, we have assumed that the trajectory of succession is repeatable and predictable. But what if, for example, a boulder in the rocky intertidal zone of Southern California turns over and, instead of a seaweed community forming, as Sousa (1979b) observed, a sessile invertebrate community forms instead? Or what if Dryas never colonizes the till left behind by a glacier at Glacier Bay, but is replaced by a grass that competes with, rather than facilitates, later successional species such as Sitka spruce? Might spruce forests never develop? Possibly. There are cases in which different communities develop in the same area under similar environmental conditions. Ecologists refer to such alternative scenarios as alternative stable states. Richard Lewontin (1969) was one of the first to formally define and model alternative stable states in natural communities. A community is said to have stability, or to be stable, when it remains in or returns to the original structure and function after some perturbation. How stable are natural communities? This question has perplexed ecologists for some time, partly because the notion of stability depends on spatial and temporal scale. At a small spatial scale, such as a 1-m2 plot in a midwestern prairie, there might be considerable change or instability over time. If all the plants were removed from the plot, it is unlikely that all the same species would recolonize that particular plot, and certainly not in the exact same locations. However, if a larger area is considered (e.g., a 100-m2 plot), the chance of finding the same species increases. Similarly, if one followed the plot for a short time, the chance that its species composition would change would be low.", "But the longer you observed it, the more likely it would be that the community would change and thus appear unstable. With these caveats in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at examples of communities that, once disturbed, do not revert to previous states, but instead show alternative stable states. Alternative states are controlled by strong interactors John Sutherland (1974) studied alternative states in marine fouling communities: the sponges, hydroids, tunicates, and other invertebrates that encrust ships, docks, and other hard surfaces in bays and estuaries. He suspended ceramic tiles from the dock at Duke University Marine Lab in Beaufort, North Carolina, in early spring and allowed them to be colonized by planktonic invertebrate larvae (FIGURE 17.17A). At the end of 2 years, even though a handful of species had colonized the tiles, most of them were dominated by a solitary tunicate species, Styela. Its dominance was not universal, however. Styela actually declined on Sutherland\u2019s tiles during the first winter and was replaced by the hydroid species Tubularia. This effect was due to the annual nature of Styela, which dies off in winter, and the tunicate quickly regained dominance the following spring when larvae started to settle. FIGURE 17.17 Fouling Communities Show Alternative States John Sutherland studied succession in fouling communities by suspending ceramic tiles from a dock in North Carolina and allowing invertebrates to colonize them. (A) Two types of communities developed on the tiles over time, one dominated by Styela and another by Schizoporella. (B) Different communities developed depending on whether the tiles were protected from fish predation. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (After J. P. Sutherland. 1974. Am Nat 108: 859\u2013873.) Based on the results shown in (B), which fouling species did fish prefer to eat? Which species was the competitive dominant? By placing new tiles out periodically, Sutherland also showed that Styela was able to persist despite the existence of other potential colonizers. These colonizers fouled the new tiles but were unable to colonize those dominated by Styela. For this reason, Sutherland viewed this fouling community as stable. Within a few months, he also identified what he believed to be another stable fouling community, this one dominated by Schizoporella, an encrusting bryozoan (see Figure 17.17A). This community developed on new tiles suspended from the dock in late summer and was also impervious to colonization by other species, including Styela. To understand what might be controlling these two alternative outcomes of succession, Sutherland submerged new tiles at the same spot on the dock but excluded fish predators from half of the tiles by surrounding them with cages (FIGURE 17.17B). After a year, Sutherland found that the tiles protected from fish predation had formed communities dominated by Styela, while those exposed to fish predation had formed communities dominated by Schizoporella. He also noticed that the abundances of both species on the tiles protected from predators were reversed when Styela began to die off in the winter. These results suggested that Styela is competitively dominant if left undisturbed but is outcompeted by Schizoporella when disturbed. Sutherland explained his original observations of Styela dominance by suggesting that fish predation was spotty and that the tunicates themselves, once they reached a certain large size, might have acted as a natural \u201ccage\u201d or predator exclusion mechanism. Lewontin (1969) and Sutherland (1974) both believed that multiple stable states existed in communities and could be driven by the addition or exclusion of particularly strongly interacting species. If those species were missing or ineffective, communities could follow alternative successional trajectories that might never lead back to the original community type (state) but might instead form a new community type. We can visualize the theory behind alternative stable states by imagining a landscape in which different states are represented by valleys and in which a community is represented by a ball (FIGURE 17.18A). Just as the ball can move from one valley to another, the community can move from one state to another, depending on the presence or absence of strongly interacting species and how they affect the community (FIGURE 17.18B). For example, it may take only a slight change in the abundance of one or more dominant species to force the community (ball) into an alternative state (valley), or it may require complete removal of a species to cause this change. If we use Sutherland\u2019s work as an example, we can think of the Styela and Schizoporella community types as two different valleys.", "Whether the ball resides in the Schizoporella valley or the Styela valley depends on the presence of fish predators. Interestingly, in this system, the ball may not simply move back to the Schizoporella valley if access is restored to fish predators (FIGURE 17.18C). As Sutherland noted, Styela is able to escape predation once it reaches a certain size. Thus, this system might show hysteresis, an inability to shift back to the original community type even when the original conditions are restored. FIGURE 17.18 A Model of Alternative Stable States (A) A community is represented by a ball that moves within a landscape of community states (valleys). (B) Note that some valleys can be deeper than others, suggesting the magnitude of change (\u0394X) needed to shift the community from one state to another. (C) Hysteresis occurs when reversal of the change (\u2013\u0394X ) does not return the community to its original state. (After B. E. Beisner et al. 2003. Front Ecol Environ 1: 376\u2013382.) Connell and Sousa (1983) were skeptical that Sutherland had demonstrated the existence of alternative stable states, for several reasons. First, they thought that his tile communities did not persist long enough, or have a spatial scale large enough, to be considered stable. If the tiles could be followed over multiple years, they asked, would they not all end up being dominated by one or the other species? In addition, they wondered whether the fouling communities could have been sustained outside of an experimental setting in which predators were removed. Their final argument, although it was not a criticism of Sutherland\u2019s study per se, was that alternative stable states could be driven only by species interactions and not by physical changes in the community. They argued that many of the examples Sutherland had used to bolster the importance of alternative stable states fell into the latter category. Their requirement that the physical environment not change is problematic because it excludes as drivers of succession all species that interact with other species by modifying their physical environment\u2014that is, all ecosystem engineers. We know that ecosystem engineers can have strong effects on communities, so excluding them is unrealistic to most ecologists. Human actions have caused communities to shift to alternative states The stringent requirements suggested by Connell and Sousa had the effect of delaying alternative stable state research for 2 decades. Recently, however, there has been renewed interest in alternative stable states, spurred by the increasing evidence that human activities, such as habitat destruction, species introductions, and overharvesting of wild species, are shifting communities to alternative states. We have already seen examples of such changes in several of the Case Studies in this book, including the change from kelp forests to urchin barrens due to the decline of sea otters (see Chapter 9), the crash of the anchovy fishery in the Black Sea due to the introduction of Mnemiopsis (see Chapter 11), and the invasion of the aquarium strain of Caulerpa taxifolia in the Mediterranean, Australia, Japan, and North America (see Chapter 16). These so-called regime shifts are caused by the removal or addition of strongly interacting species that maintain one community type over others. Ecologists are uncertain whether the results can be reversed or whether hysteresis will occur once communities have been \u201cmanipulated\u201d by human activities and new regimes are in place. Will recolonization by sea otters rejuvenate kelp forests? Will the cessation of nutrient enrichment in the Black Sea revitalize the anchovy fishery? And will the removal of Caulerpa restore seagrass communities? These are all questions whose answers may be found in a better understanding of the factors that drive alternative stable states and of the role restoration of the original conditions can play in reversing the effects of those factors. Self-Assessment 17.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED A Natural Experiment of Mountainous Proportions On the twentieth anniversary of the eruption of Mount St. Helens, in 2000, a group of ecologists gathered on the once smoking and ash-covered volcano to participate in a week-long field camp. They gathered their gear, including tape measures, quadrat frames, and maps, and visited the same sites they had explored 2 decades earlier. This visit, termed a \u201cpulse,\u201d was an opportunity to establish a 20-year benchmark of data comparable to those first collected in 1980 and 1981.", "Many of the participants had spent the past 20 years\u2014 for some, their entire careers\u2014studying recolonization and succession patterns in those once-devastated landscapes. When they departed, they agreed to write a book, the chapters of which would contain all that was known about the extraordinary ecology of this ecosystem, with the hope that young ecologists would be motivated to continue the research and carry on their legacy. The book, Ecological Responses to the 1980 Eruption of Mount St. Helens (Dale et al. 2005), was published 5 years later. What does the book tell us about succession on Mount St. Helens? First, the eruption created disturbances that varied in their effects depending on distance from the volcano and habitat type (e.g., aquatic vs. terrestrial). Although areas close to the summit, such as the Pumice Plain, were literally sterilized by the heat of the eruption, ecologists were surprised to discover how many species actually survived on the mountain (TABLE 17.2). Because the eruption occurred in spring, many species had been still dormant under the winter snows. Survivors included plants with underground buds or rhizomes, animals such as rodents and insects with burrows, and fish and other aquatic species in ice-covered lakes. In the blowdown zone, large trees and animals perished while smaller organisms survived in the protection of their larger neighbors. The opposite was true in areas outside the blowdown zone, where falling rocks and ash smothered smaller plants and animals, but not larger organisms.

A second important research discovery from Mount St. Helens is the role survivors have played in controlling the pace and pattern of succession. In many cases, these species were thrust into novel physical environments and species assemblages without time to adapt over evolutionary time scales. Some species thrived, while others fared poorly, but their adaptability and unpredictability were surprising. Unlikely alliances were formed that hastened succession in particular habitats. For example, newly formed and isolated ponds and lakes were colonized by amphibians much faster than had been thought possible (FIGURE 17.19). Scientists discovered that frogs and salamanders were using tunnels created by northern pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides) to make their way from one pond to another across the arid landscape (Crisafulli et al. 2005). The gophers were particularly successful on Mount St. Helens, both because they survived the eruption in their tunnels and because grassy meadows\u2014their preferred habitat\u2014expanded greatly after the eruption. Interestingly, the gophers were also responsible for facilitating plant succession: their burrowing activity brought to the soil surface organic matter, seeds, and fungal spores buried deep under the volcanic rock and ash (Crisafulli et al. 2005) (FIGURE 17.20). FIGURE 17.19 Rapid Amphibian Colonization Frog and salamander species rapidly colonized a wetland complex in the Pumice Plain on Mount St. Helens. (After C. M. Crisafulli et al. 2005. In Ecological Responses to the 1980 Eruption of Mount St. Helens, V. H. Dale et al. [Eds.], pp. 183\u2013197. Springer: New York.) FIGURE 17.20 Pocket Gophers to the Rescue The burrowing activity of northern pocket gophers, some of which survived the eruption underground, brought organic matter, seeds, and fungal spores to the soil surface, creating microhabitats, like this one in the Pumice Plain, where plants could grow. A third important discovery was the realization that multiple mechanisms were responsible for primary succession on Mount St. Helens. Facilitation on the Pumice Plain was exemplified by the dwarf lupine (Lupinus lepidus), the first plant to arrive there. Dwarf lupines trapped seeds and detritus and increased the nitrogen content of the soil though their symbiotic association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (del Moral et al. 2005). The lupines, in turn, were inhibited by multiple insect herbivores, which essentially controlled the pace of primary succession (Bishop et al. 2005).", "Tolerance was evident in some primary successional habitats, where Douglas fir lived in concert with annual herbs. The diversity of strategies species used, and the resulting community compositions, never ceased to amaze ecologists, who up to that point had been guided mostly by the models of Connell and Slatyer (1977). Despite decades of data and a treasure trove of novel discoveries, research on Mount St. Helens has only just begun. Will communities there follow paths of succession that lead to predictable and repeatable outcomes? Or will they form alternative states that are highly dependent on their historical legacies? Geologic studies suggest that Mount St. Helens erupts roughly every 300 years. The life span of its community succession thus greatly exceeds our own life span by hundreds of years, so we must be content with the limited knowledge we have gained from studying what is arguably the most interesting phase of succession on Mount St. Helens and with the hope that ecologists will continue their research there for years to come. CONNECTIONS in NATURE PRIMARY SUCCESSION AND MUTUALISM We saw in Chapter 15 that positive relationships can alter communities, and that they may be particularly important in stressful environments. Primary succession in terrestrial environments illustrates both of these effects: some of the examples presented in this chapter involve plants that interact in a mutualistic way with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These bacteria form nodules in the roots of their plant hosts, where they convert nitrogen gas from the atmosphere (N ) into a form that is usable by plants 2 (ammonia [NH4+]). The plants provide the bacteria with sugars produced by photosynthesis. This interaction appears to be extremely important for plants and animals colonizing completely sterile environments. We have seen that Dryas and alders, both species that form tight mutualisms with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, were some of the first species to colonize the till left behind by glaciers at Glacier Bay, Alaska. Similarly, Lupinus lepidus was able to use the nitrogen produced by its bacterial symbionts to colonize the sterile Pumice Plain of Mount St. Helens after the eruption. Lupines were the major source of nitrogen for subsequent plants and herbivorous insects for many years. Thus, lupines and their symbiotic bacteria play a large role in controlling the rate of primary succession on Mount St. Helens. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria involved in symbioses are extremely diverse. Only a few groups of bacteria live in root nodules; all the rest are associated with either the surfaces of roots or the guts of ruminants. The nodule-forming bacteria include the rhizobia, a taxonomic group associated with legumes (such as lupines), and actinomycetes of the genus Frankia, which are associated with woody plants such as alders and Dryas. Nodule formation involves a complex series of chemical and cellular interactions between the root and the bacteria (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 17.21). Free-living bacteria are attracted to root exudates that cause the microbes to attach to the roots and multiply. Sets of genes are activated in both bacterial and root cells that allow the bacteria to enter the root, the root cells to divide, and the nodule to be formed. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 17.21 Dwarf Lupines and Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria (A) Dwarf lupine (Lupinus lepidus), a legume with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, was the first plant to colonize Mount St. Helens. (B) Root nodule development is the result of a strong interaction between the plant and the bacteria. The enzyme involved in nitrogen fixing (nitrogenase) is highly sensitive to oxygen and requires anaerobic conditions. Thus, wherever nitrogen-fixing symbioses occur, there are structural components to the interaction (such as membranes within the root nodules) that produce anaerobic conditions. The bacteria, however, need oxygen to metabolize, so a hemoglobin protein known as leghemoglobin, which has a high affinity for oxygen, is produced in the nodules to deliver oxygen to the bacteria in an essentially anaerobic environment. The nodules often have an eerie pink color that is associated with the leghemoglobin. In addition, the nodule develops a specialized vascular system that supplies sugars to the bacteria and carries fixed nitrogen to the plant. Maintaining a symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria is costly to plants. Estimates suggest that creating and maintaining the nodules alone costs a plant 12%\u201325% of its total photosynthetic output. Plants may be able to shoulder this cost, especially if it allows them to live in environments free of competitors and herbivores.", "But as they increase the nitrogen content of the soils in which they live, plants with symbionts make conditions better for other plant species as well\u2014some of which are likely to be competitors. Thus, these plants face a trade-off between improving the environment for themselves and competing with other species, which makes their role in early successional environments important, if somewhat ironic. Biogeography KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 18.1 Patterns of species diversity and distribution vary at global, regional, and local spatial scales. CONCEPT 18.2 Global patterns of species diversity and composition are influenced by geographic area and isolation, evolutionary history, and global climate. CONCEPT 18.3 Regional differences in species diversity are influenced by area and distance, which determine the balance between immigration and extinction rates. The Largest Ecological Experiment on Earth: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 There is probably only one place on Earth where a person can hear the calls of 100 species of birds or smell the fragrances of 1,000 species of flowering plants or see the leaf patterns of 300 species of trees, all in 1 hectare (2.5 acres) of land. That place is the Amazon, where half the world\u2019s remaining tropical rainforests and species reside. Just 1 hectare (ha) of rainforest in the Amazon contains more plant species than all of Europe! Of course, not all of the species diversity of the Amazon is confined to the rainforest itself. The Amazon Basin contains the largest watershed in the world; one-fifth of all the fresh water on Earth falls on its slopes, collects in over 1,000 forested tributaries, and eventually flows into the Amazon River and out to sea. A trip to a fish market in Manaus, Brazil, would reveal the amazing diversity of aquatic life in these rivers (FIGURE 18.1). The number of fish species in the Amazon Basin exceeds that of the entire Atlantic Ocean. FIGURE 18.1 Diversity Abounds in the Amazon Freshwater fish caught in the Amazon River on display in a market in Manaus, Brazil. Ironically, with this incredible species diversity can come devastating species losses when these ecosystems are disturbed. The main destructive force in the Amazon Basin has been deforestation, which began in earnest with the building of roads in the 1960s (Bierregaard et al. 2001). Before then, most of the region had no roads and was relatively isolated from the rest of society. Within 50 years, however, 20% of the rainforest has been converted to pastureland, towns, roads, and mines. Although this percentage might seem modest, it is deceiving, both because of the sheer number of species involved and because of the pattern of deforestation. Logging practices have caused extreme habitat fragmentation, sometimes resulting in a \u201cfishbone\u201d pattern in which thin linear fragments of rainforest are surrounded by strips of nonforested land. These fragments of forest can be thought of as isolated \u201cislands\u201d of forest within a \u201csea\u201d of deforested habitat. As we will see, habitat fragmentation, by isolating species, can have serious consequences for species diversity. The fragmentation of the Amazon rainforest motivated Thomas Lovejoy and his colleagues to initiate one of the largest and longest-running ecological experiments ever conducted. The Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) began in 1979, and Lovejoy seized a unique opportunity to find out what was happening to the species diversity of the Amazon as logging eliminated more and more of the forest. He was guided by an elegant model in Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson\u2019s 1967 book The Theory of Island Biogeography, which presents an explanation for the observation that more species are found on large islands than on small islands. By taking advantage of a Brazilian law requiring landowners to leave half of their land as forest, Lovejoy arranged to designate different-sized forest plots (\u201cislands\u201d) that would be surrounded by either forested land (controls) or deforested land (\u201csea\u201d) (FIGURE 18.2). The control plots and fragments were designated before logging took place and were either 1, 10, 100, or 1,000 ha in size. Baseline data collected immediately after logging showed little difference in species diversity between control plots and fragments. FIGURE 18.2 Studying Habitat Fragmentation in Tropical Rainforests The Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) near Manaus, Brazil, was designed to study the effects of habitat fragment size on species diversity.", "(A) Plots of four sizes (1, 10, 100, and 1,000 ha) were designated before logging took place, then either isolated by logging or left surrounded by forest as controls. (B) Aerial photo of a 10-ha and a 1-ha fragment isolated in 1983. (A after R. O. Bierregaard, Jr. et al. 2001. Lessons from Amazonia: The Ecology and Conservation of a Fragmented Forest. Yale University Press: New Haven, CT.) Why didn\u2019t the experimental manipulation involve removing forest from the fragments? By the mid-1980s, the ecologists had a fully replicated experiment at a scale unimaginable in the past. Over the last 41 years, the BDFFP has evolved from a study that asks the simple question, What is the minimum area of rainforest needed to maintain species diversity? to one that asks, What roles do the shape, configuration, and connectivity of forest fragments play in maintaining species diversity? How does the surrounding habitat influence that diversity? And what is the prognosis for the Amazon rainforest, one of the most deforested but species-rich terrestrial biomes on Earth? View the script for the video Introduction Looking out over a community such as a rocky intertidal zone on the Northern California coast, it is obvious that the locations of species on the shoreline are influenced not only by physical factors, such as tide height and wave action, but also by a variety of biological interactions. Sea stars eat sessile mussels in the low intertidal zone, thus limiting them to the higher intertidal zones. In those zones, the crevices between mussels provide habitat for many species that otherwise would be absent. Local conditions such as these are important regulators of species distributions. However, as important as these conditions appear to us, we must always be cognizant of the influence of processes operating at larger geographic scales. Oceanographic processes, such as currents and ocean upwelling, regulate the delivery of invertebrate larvae to rocky shorelines. At a global scale, oceanic circulation patterns control current direction. By limiting dispersal, those patterns can isolate species over ecological and evolutionary time. As a result, the local assemblage of species on the Northern California coast is ultimately based on a foundation of global and regional processes. In this chapter, we will consider the effects of these large-scale geographic processes on one of the most recognizable ecological patterns known: the distribution and diversity of species on Earth. CONCEPT 18.1 Patterns of species diversity and distribution vary at global, regional, and local spatial scales. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 18.1.1 Define biogeography and explain how patterns of species diversity and composition are connected across different spatial scales. 18.1.2 Outline the processes important to global-, regional-, and local-scale biogeography. 18.1.3 Analyze the relative importance of species pools versus local scale processes in determining local community species diversity. Biogeography and Spatial Scale One of the most obvious ecological patterns on Earth is the variation in species composition and diversity among geographic locations. The study of this variation is known as biogeography. Pretend for a moment that you have a lifelong desire to see all the forest biomes on Earth. In this imaginary scenario, you have the ability to move from one geographic region on Earth to another. Think Google Earth, but with the ability to fly down into a community and see species up close. You start in the tropics at 4\u00b0S latitude and 60\u00b0W longitude and fly into the Amazon rainforest, the most species-rich forest on Earth (TABLE 18.1).At 20 m altitude, you fly through the middle of the humid forest, and as you travel over each hectare, you see new tree species (FIGURE 18.3A). You may have encountered half of them in the previous hectare, but at least half are completely new. The more area you cover, the more tree species you see. The richness is almost overwhelming, and the heat and humidity are stifling, so you decide to head north to drier climes. FIGURE 18.3 Forests around the World Forest biomes vary greatly in their species composition and species richness. (A) A tropical rainforest in Brazil. (B) Oak woodland in Southern California. (C) Lowland temperate evergreen forest in the Pacific Northwest. (D) Boreal spruce forest in Denali National Park, Alaska. TABLE 18.1 Tree Species Richness in Different Forests around the World Approximate tree Forest location/type Latitude, longitude Source species richness Amazon, Brazil 4\u00b0S, 60\u00b0W Laurance 2001 1,300 Southern California, USA 35\u00b0N, 125\u00b0W Allen et al. 2007 57 Franklin and Dyrness Pacific Northwest, USA 1988", "Douglas fir forest 45\u00b0N, 123\u00b0W 7 Garry oak forest 45\u00b0N, 123\u00b0W 4 Boreal forest, Canada 64\u00b0N, 125\u00b0W Kricher 1998 2 New Zealand Dawson and Lucas 2000 Beech forest 45\u00b0S, 170\u00b0E 20 Flowering tree forest 35\u00b0S, 170\u00b0E 100 You arrive at 35\u00b0N, 125\u00b0 W. This is the southern coast of California, where the forests are oak woodland \u2014a dry biome, as we learned in Chapter 3. Most of the trees and shrubs are evergreen, but they are not conifers. Instead, they are flowering plants with small, tough (sclerophyllous) leaves. The woodlands are interspersed with grasslands (FIGURE 18.3B). Flying down through the vegetation, you notice the many kinds of trees and shrubs, all with small leaves and thick bark. The woodland is aromatic because of the volatile oils contained in the shrubs and herbaceous plants. Plant species richness is high, but just a fraction of that in the Amazon (see Table 18.1). It\u2019s still warm, so you decide to head north to 45\u00b0N, 123\u00b0W, where the forest is cool and very wet. You are in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, where the forests are dominated by large conifers. As you fly through, you notice the lushness of the forest, with its lichen-filled canopy and fern-covered floor (FIGURE 18.3C). Tree species richness in these lowland temperate evergreen forests is a fraction of that in the two previous forests you\u2019ve visited (see Table 18.1). There are only a handful of tree species: Douglas fir, western hemlock, western red cedar, red alder, and big leaf maple. What these forests lack in species richness, however, is made up by their huge biomass. You want to see the extremes in species richness, so your next stop is 64\u00b0N, 125\u00b0W, in the boreal forests of Canada. Flying over the cold landscape, you notice rows and rows of identical spruce trees, broken once in a while by large wetlands (FIGURE 18.3D). Dipping down into the canopy, you are struck by the dense and monotonous nature of the forest. It\u2019s dark down under those spruce boughs, but low-lying berry bushes are a reminder that light does penetrate the canopy, especially in the summer months. You continue to fly north, and the forests thin until the landscape is one long expanse of treeless tundra. Your trip could end here, but you have always wanted to visit New Zealand, so you take the time to fly back to the Southern Hemisphere. New Zealand was separated from the ancient continent of Gondwana roughly 80 million years ago, and since that time, evolution has produced unique forests there (FIGURE 18.4). Roughly 80% of the species in New Zealand are endemic, meaning that they occur nowhere else on Earth. Dialed into 45\u00b0S, 170\u00b0E, on the South Island of New Zealand, you fly through the Southern Hemisphere equivalent of the Pacific Northwest. Instead of conifers, the forests are dominated by four species of southern beech trees with billowy layers of twisted branches (see Figure 18.4A). Below the canopy are \u201cdivaricating shrubs,\u201d whose multiple-angled branches give them a zigzag appearance. Plants with this growth form are found in highest abundance in New Zealand. Although temperate evergreen forests in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are similar in some ways (e.g., each has low tree species richness compared with forests in the tropics), they are made up of completely different species assemblages with very different evolutionary histories. FIGURE 18.4 Forests of the North and South Islands, New Zealand The two islands of New Zealand span a large latitudinal gradient (35\u00b0S\u201347\u00b0S) and thus have different forest types. (A) The forests of the South Island are dominated by beeches. (B) The forests of the warmer North Island have greater tree species diversity and a different species composition than those on the South Island (see Table 18.1). Even within New Zealand, over a distance that extends from 35\u00b0S to 47\u00b0S (a latitudinal distance identical to that from Southern California to British Columbia in the Northern Hemisphere), there are big differences in tree species richness and composition. The North Island is warmer (closer to the equator) than the South Island and has more diverse forests, consisting of many flowering tree species with a few tall emergent conifers (see Figure 18.4B). These forests have a tropical feel to them because of all the flowering trees and the multitude of vines and epiphytes (plants and lichens that live on larger plants). The tree ferns growing here are similar to those that were dominant 100 million years ago, during the age of the dinosaurs.", "One of the most extraordinary trees is the kauri (Agathis australis), which is among the largest tree species on Earth (interestingly, the largest is the giant sequoia, Sequoiadendron giganteum, which occurs at roughly the same latitude in the Northern Hemisphere). Some kauri trees are 60 m (200 feet) high and 7 m (23 feet) in diameter. Unfortunately, like redwoods, kauris have been extensively logged, and they exist in a forest community in only two small reserves, 100 km2 in total size. Given that old-growth stands of kauris take 1,000\u20132,000 years to generate, these forests are virtually irreplaceable. If we contrast the tree species richness of the forests characteristic of the North Island with those on the South Island, we find more than 100 tree species in the warmer northern forests, compared with the 10\u201320 species in the less diverse beech forests characteristic of the temperate south (see Table 18.1). With our world forest tour at its end, what can we conclude about biogeographic patterns on Earth, assuming that forest communities are good global representatives? \u2022 First, species richness and composition vary with latitude: the lower tropical latitudes have many more, and different, species than the higher temperate and polar latitudes. \u2022 Second, species richness and composition vary from continent to continent, even where longitudes or latitudes are roughly similar. \u2022 Third, the same community type or biome can vary in species richness and composition depending on its location on Earth. As we will see in the rest of this chapter, these are reliable patterns that have been demonstrated over and over again for many regions of the world and many community types. What has puzzled naturalists for centuries is just what processes control these biogeographic patterns. Why are more species found in some areas than in other areas? Why do some regions harbor species assemblages that are not found anywhere else on Earth? A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain biogeographic variation in species diversity and composition. As we\u2019ll see, these hypotheses are highly dependent on the spatial scale at which they are applied. Patterns of species diversity at different spatial scales are interconnected On our world forest tour, we saw that patterns of species diversity and composition varied at global, regional, and local spatial scales. We can think of these spatial scales as interconnected in a hierarchical way, with patterns of species diversity and composition at one spatial scale setting the conditions for patterns at smaller spatial scales (Whittaker et al. 2001). Let\u2019s start with the largest spatial scale and work downward. The global scale, as the term suggests, includes the entire world, a huge geographic area over which there are major variations with changes in latitude and longitude (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 18.5A). Species have been isolated from one another, often on different continents or in different oceans, by long distances and over long time periods. Differences in the rates of three processes\u2014speciation, extinction, and dispersal\u2014help determine differences in species diversity and composition at the global scale. We will consider these processes in more detail in the following section. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 18.5 Interconnected Spatial Scales of Species Diversity The arrows represent the relationships between, and processes important to, species diversity and composition at (A) global, (B) regional, (C) landscape, and (D) local scales. The regional scale encompasses smaller geographic areas in which the climate is roughly uniform and to which species are restricted by dispersal limitation (see Concept 9.3). The regional species pool, sometimes called the gamma diversity of the region, encompasses all the species contained within a region (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 18.5B). Earth\u2019s regions differ in species diversity and composition because of differences in the rates of speciation, extinction, and dispersal at the global scale, as mentioned above. The Amazon, for example, has many more species, and thus a larger species pool, than the Canadian boreal forest. The physical geography of a region, such as the number, area, and distance from one another of mountains, valleys, deserts, islands, and lakes\u2014referred to collectively as the landscape\u2014is critical to within-region biogeography. Species diversity and composition vary within a region depending on how the landscape shapes the rate of extinction in, and the rates of immigration to and emigration from, local habitats (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 18.5C).", "Ecologists consider within-region biogeography in two related ways: \u2022 The local scale, which is essentially equivalent to a community, reflects the suitability of the abiotic and biotic characteristics of habitats for species from the regional species pool once they reach those habitats through dispersal (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 18.5D). Species physiology and interactions with other species both influence species diversity at the local scale (sometimes called alpha diversity). \u2022 The connection between local and regional scales of species diversity is expressed by a measurement known as beta diversity. Beta diversity tells us the change in species diversity and composition, or turnover of species, as one moves from one community type to another across the landscape (see Interactive Figure 18.5C). Knowing how spatial scales are related to one another in a hierarchical way is important, but are there actual area values one could apply to local and regional spatial scales? For example, how much area does a region or locality encompass? The answer is highly dependent on the species and communities of interest. For example, Shmida and Wilson (1985) suggest that terrestrial plants might have a local scale of 102\u2013104 2 682 2 m and a regional scale of 10 \u201310 m . But for bacteria, the local scale might be something more like 10 cm2. As we will see, the actual area we use to define species diversity measurements can be critical to our interpretation of the processes controlling biogeographic patterns. Local and regional processes interact to determine local species diversity Interactive Figure 18.5 shows that patterns of species diversity, and the processes that control them, are interconnected across spatial scales. Given these interconnections, ecologists are interested in knowing just how much variation in species diversity at the local scale is dependent on larger spatial scales. The regional species pool provides the raw material for local species assemblages and sets the theoretical upper limit on species richness for communities in the region. But is local species richness also determined by local conditions, including species interactions and the physical environment? One way we can consider this question quantitatively is by plotting the local species richness for a community against the regional species richness for that community (FIGURE 18.6). Three basic types of relationships can be seen in such plots. First, if local species richness and regional species richness are equal (slope = 1), then all the species within a region will be found in the communities of that region. Although this pattern is theoretically possible, we would not expect to find it in the real world, for the simple reason that all regions have varying landscape and habitat features that exclude some species from some communities (e.g., lowland tree species will not be found in alpine forests). Second, if local species richness is simply proportional to regional species richness (i.e., local species richness increases with increasing regional species richness, but the relationship is not 1:1), then we can assume that local species richness is largely determined by the regional species pool, with local processes such as species interactions and physical conditions playing a more minor role. Finally, if local species richness levels off despite an increasing regional species pool, then local processes can be assumed to limit local species richness. The degree to which local richness levels off can tell us something about how important species interactions and physical conditions are in setting a saturation point\u2014a limit on species richness\u2014for communities. FIGURE 18.6 What Determines Local Species Richness? The relative influences of local and regional processes in a community can be determined by plotting local species richness against regional species richness. (After H. V. Cornell and J. H. Lawton. 1992. J Anim Ecol 61: 1\u201312.) Would you ever have a local to regional species richness relationship that had a slope of more than 1? Why or why not? Let\u2019s move away from these theoretical constructs and look at what real data show us about the relationship between local and regional species richness. Witman and colleagues (2004) considered this relationship for marine invertebrate communities living on subtidal rock walls at a variety of locations throughout the world (FIGURE 18.7A). At 49 local sites in 12 regions, they surveyed species richness in 0.25-m2 plots on rock walls at a 10\u201315 m (33\u201350 feet) water depth. They then compared the local species richness values they found at the sites with regional species richness values from published lists of invertebrate species capable of living on hard substrates at similar depths.", "A plot of local versus regional species richness at all the sites (FIGURE 18.7B) showed that local species richness was always proportionally lower than regional species richness. Furthermore, local species richness never leveled off\u2014 that is, the communities never became saturated\u2014at high regional richness values. Instead, regional species richness explained approximately 75% of the variation in local species richness. The results of this study suggest that regional species pools largely determine the number of species present in these marine invertebrate communities. FIGURE 18.7 Marine Invertebrate Communities May Be Limited by Regional Processes Among shallow subtidal marine invertebrate communities, regional species richness explains approximately 75% of the local species richness. (A) The 12 regions of the world where the 49 sampling sites were located. (B) A plot of local species richness against regional species richness. Each dot represents one of the 49 sampling sites. (After J. D. Witman et al. 2004. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101: 15664\u201315669. \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.) Does the lack of saturation detected in this study and others indicate that local processes are unimportant in determining local species richness? The answer is no, for at least two reasons. First, there was still considerable unexplained variation among local communities within regions, which could be attributable to the effects of local processes such as species interactions, abiotic conditions, or dispersal limitation (see Interactive Figure 19.4). Second, the effects of species interactions, in particular, are likely to be highly sensitive to the local spatial scale chosen. Although the small spatial scale of Witman and colleagues\u2019 study is probably appropriate for species interacting on subtidal rock walls, other studies have used inappropriate (usually too large) spatial scales that were unlikely to detect local effects. Nevertheless, the strong influence of regional-scale processes on local species richness suggests that both marine and terrestrial communities are likely to be much more susceptible to changes such as species invasions from outside their regions than previously thought. In the remainder of this chapter, we will explore the factors controlling variation in species diversity at global and regional biogeographic scales. Chapter 19 will delve in more detail into the causes and consequences of species diversity differences at the local scale.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 18.2.1 Describe the two major biogeographic patterns\u2014biogeographic regions and latitudinal gradients in species diversity\u2014at the global scale. 18.2.2 Explain the underlying forces thought to be important in creating biogeographic regions. 18.2.3 Outline the hypotheses proposed to explain the latitudinal gradient in species diversity pattern. Global Biogeography It must have been incredible to be a European scientific explorer 200 years ago. You would have left the safety of your home to travel by ship to a destination largely unknown. You would have had to endure seasickness, disease, accidents of all kinds, and years away from your family, friends, and colleagues. You might have had many years of financial debt to repay unless you were independently wealthy or could sell your collections. But you would have been the first scientist to document and collect animal and plant species of beauty, novelty, and rarity. It was under these circumstances that the science of biogeography was born and many important discoveries were made. Up to that point, European scientists had very little information about the natural history and ecology of other parts of the world; most was secondhand or anecdotal. What these early naturalists were able to bring back were specimens and, most of all, theories to help make sense of their observations. Although not the first in his field, Alfred Russel Wallace (1823\u20131913) rightly earned his place as the father of biogeography (FIGURE 18.8). Inspired by naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin, and Joseph Hooker, Wallace came on the scene with considerably less wealth or education, but his intellect and motivation more than made up for what he lacked in financial resources and training. Wallace is best known, along with Charles Darwin, as the co-discoverer of the principles of natural selection, although he has always stood in the shadow of Darwin in that regard. But his main contribution was the study of species distributions across large spatial scales. FIGURE 18.8 Alfred Russel Wallace and His Collections (A) A photograph of Wallace taken in Singapore in 1862, during his expedition to the Malay Archipelago.", "(B) Part of Wallace\u2019s rare beetle collection from the Malay Archipelago, found in an attic by his grandson in 2005. (C) A map of the Malay Archipelago illustrating Wallace\u2019s travels. Wallace left England for Brazil in 1848 and explored the Amazon rainforest for 4 years. On his way back, the ship he was traveling on burned in the middle of the Sargasso Sea, destroying all his specimens and most of his notes and illustrations. After 10 days in a lifeboat, he was rescued and made his way back to England, where he published an impressive six papers on his observations. Even though he had vowed never to travel again, in 1852 Wallace left England for the Malay Archipelago (present-day Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, East Malaysia, and East Timor). It was here that he made the puzzling observation described in his 1869 book The Malay Archipelago: that the mammals of the Philippines were more similar to those in Africa (5,500 km away) than they were to those in New Guinea (750 km away). Wallace was the first to notice the clear demarcation between these two faunas, which came to be known as Wallace\u2019s line. It turns out, as we\u2019ll see shortly, that these separate groups of mammals evolved on two different continents that have come into close proximity only within the last 15 million years. Wallace\u2019s biogeographic research culminated in the publication of a two-volume work called The Geographical Distribution of Animals, published in 1876. In this book, Wallace overlays species distributions on top of geographic regions and reveals two important global patterns: \u2022 Earth\u2019s land masses can be divided into six recognizable biogeographic regions containing distinct biotas that differ markedly in species diversity and composition. \u2022 There is a gradient of species diversity with latitude: species diversity is greatest in the tropics and decreases toward the poles. These two patterns are necessarily interrelated; the latitudinal gradient is superimposed over the biogeographic regions. For ease of explanation, we\u2019ll begin by exploring the biogeographic regions described by Wallace and the underlying forces that created them. We will then consider some of the processes likely to be responsible for the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. The biotas of biogeographic regions reflect evolutionary isolation The six biogeographic regions described by Wallace are the Nearctic (North America), Neotropical (Central and South America), Palearctic (Europe and parts of Asia and Africa), Ethiopian (most of Africa), Oriental (India, China, and Southeast Asia), and Australasian (Australia, the Indo-Pacific, and New Zealand) (FIGURE 18.9). It is no coincidence that these regions correspond roughly to Earth\u2019s six major tectonic plates. These plates are sections of Earth\u2019s crust that move across Earth\u2019s surface through the action of currents generated deep within its molten rock mantle (FIGURE 18.10). Before scientists understood the processes driving the movement of these plates, they hypothesized that the continents drifted over Earth\u2019s surface; thus, the name continental drift was given to the early theory describing these movements. There are three major types of boundaries between tectonic plates. In areas known as mid-ocean ridges, molten rock flows out of the seams between plates and cools, creating new crust and forcing the plates apart in a process called seafloor spreading. In some areas where two plates meet, known as subduction zones, one plate is forced downward under another plate. These areas are associated with strong earthquakes, volcanic activity, and mountain range formation. In other areas where two plates meet, the plates slide sideways past each other, forming a fault. FIGURE 18.9 Six Biogeographic Regions Wallace identified six biogeographic regions using the distributions of terrestrial animals. These six regions roughly correspond to Earth\u2019s major tectonic plates. (Based on A. R. Wallace. 1876. The Geographical Distribution of Animals. Harper and Brothers: New York.) Compare Wallace\u2019s 6 regions with the 11 biogeographic divisions shown in Figure 1.2. What types of data were used to expand the number of regions to 11? FIGURE 18.10 Mechanisms of Continental Drift Over geologic time, currents generated deep within Earth\u2019s molten rock mantle move sections of Earth\u2019s crust across its surface. As a result of processes such as seafloor spreading and subduction, the positions of the plates, and of the continents that sit on them, have changed dramatically over geologic time (for an animation, see WEB EXTENSION 18.1).", "For our purposes, let\u2019s consider the movements of the major tectonic plates since the early Triassic period (251 million years ago), when all of Earth\u2019s land masses, a single continent named Pangaea, began to break up (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 18.11A), At that time, there was a mass extinction (see Figure 6.18), which eventually led to the rise of the first archosaurs (precursors to dinosaurs) and the cynodonts (precursors to mammals). About 100 million years ago, during the mid-Cretaceous period, Pangaea had split into Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south. During that time, dinosaurs were in their heyday and mammals were small and a relatively minor component of the fauna. The end of the Cretaceous period was marked by another mass extinction, which resulted in the disappearance of dinosaurs. By the early Paleogene period (60 million years ago), Gondwana had separated into the present-day continents of South America, Africa, India, Antarctica, and Australia. Laurasia eventually split apart to form North America, Europe, and Asia. Most of these movements resulted in the separation of continents from one another, but some continents were brought together (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 18.11B). For example, North and South America joined at the Isthmus of Panama, India collided with Asia to create the Himalayas, Africa and Europe united at the Mediterranean Sea, and a land bridge formed between North America and Asia at the Bering Strait (for an animation, see WEB EXTENSION 18.2). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 18.11 The Positions of Continents and Oceans Have Changed over Geologic Time The locations of continents and oceans have changed dramatically over the last 251 million years because of continental drift. (A) The breakup of Pangaea. (B) A summary of the movements that led to the configuration of the continents we know today. Red arrows are labeled with the time (in millions of years) since land masses joined; black arrows are labeled with the time since land masses separated. (After E. C. Pielou. 1979. Biogeography. Wiley: Hoboken, NJ.) As land masses separated, would you expect speciation to increase? Why or why not? The movement of Earth\u2019s tectonic plates thus separated the terrestrial biota of Pangaea, united by geography and phylogeny, into biogeographically distinct groups of species by isolating them on different continents. The sequence and tempo of the continental movements has resulted in some biogeographic regions having very different flora and fauna than others. For example, the Neotropical, Ethiopian, and Australian regions, all once part of Gondwana, have been isolated for quite some time and have very distinctive forms of life. In other cases, however, distinct groups of species have been united. For example, the biota of the Nearctic region differs substantially from that of the Neotropical region despite their modern-day proximity. Because North America was part of Laurasia while South America was part of Gondwana, North and South America had no contact until about 6 million years ago. Within that time, however, many species have moved from one continent to the other (e.g., mountain lions, wolves, and the precursors of llamas spread to South America, while armadillos and opossums spread to North America), somewhat homogenizing the biotas of the two regions. Interestingly, there is also evidence that several families of terrestrial mammals went extinct once the two continents merged, suggesting that ecological coexistence was not possible for some species (Flessa 1975). Finally, the Nearctic and Palearctic, both part of ancient Laurasia, have similarities in biota across what is now Greenland as well as across the Bering Strait, where a land bridge has intermittently allowed exchanges of species over the last 100 million years. The legacy of continental movements can be found in a number of existing taxonomic groups as well as in the fossil record. The evolutionary separation of species due to barriers such as those formed by continental drift is known as vicariance. Tracing the threads of vicariance over large geographic areas and long periods provided important evidence for early theories of evolution. For example, as Wallace began to amass knowledge of the distributions of more and more species and make geographic connections between them, his ideas about the origin of species started to solidify. In an 1855 paper titled \u201cOn the law which has regulated the introduction of new species,\u201d he wrote, \u201cEvery species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species.\u201d", "Despite the biogeographic evidence of evolutionary connections among species, it took a few more years for one mechanism of evolution (i.e., natural selection) and its role in the origin of new species to be formally proposed by both Wallace (1858) and Darwin (1859). Before we move on, it is important to consider contemporary research that updates and expands on the biogeographic regions first identified by Wallace. One recent study (Holt et al. 2013) used phylogenetic information acquired from DNA analysis and recent observations of global species distribution patterns to test whether Wallace\u2019s original biogeographic regions are supported by modern data. The researchers identified more biogeographic regions (a total of 11), some of which were the same and others of which were different from Wallace\u2019s original 6 regions (compare Figure 18.9 with Figure 1.2). This new analysis suggests that additional isolation mechanisms beyond continental drift are responsible for the different regions. Interestingly, New Guinea and the Pacific Islands, separated from the Philippines by Wallace\u2019s line, emerge as a new biogeographic region, completely separate from the Australian or Oriental regions. Another recent analysis of biogeographic regions involved mapping the distribution of species in the oceans. After all, the oceans make up 71% of Earth\u2019s surface area and, just as we have seen for continents, they are dynamic, in the sense that they are created, merged, and destroyed by the movements of Earth\u2019s tectonic plates (see Interactive Figure 18.11). The main question, then, is whether there are barriers to dispersal between oceans as there are between continents. Despite their appearance of connectivity, oceans do have significant impediments to the exchange of biotas: these impediments take the form of continents and currents; thermal, salinity, and oxygen gradients; and differences in water depth. Oceanographic discontinuities have isolated species from one another, allowed for evolutionary change, and created unique oceanic biogeographic regions (Briggs 2006). Unfortunately, delineation of marine biogeographic regions has been hindered by the extra complicating factor of water depth and by our basic lack of natural history and taxonomic knowledge of the deep oceans. One recent model by Adey and Steneck (2001) identifies 24 recognizable biogeographic regions for intertidal benthic marine macroalgae. Although it is hard to compare these macroalgal regions with terrestrial biogeographic regions, the analysis does suggest that the marine realm has much more biogeographic variation than previously realized. Species diversity varies with latitude If you recall our Google Earth\u2013style tour of the globe in the previous section, it was clear that plant species diversity and community composition changed dramatically with latitude: species diversity was highest at tropical latitudes and decreased toward the poles. Wallace and other nineteenth-century European scientific explorers became keenly aware of this pattern as they collected thousands of species in the tropics and compared them with their more meager European collections. As more data have accumulated over the last 200 years, the latitudinal gradient in species diversity has been more firmly established (FIGURE 18.12). Willig and colleagues (2003) tallied the results of 162 studies on a variety of taxonomic groups extending over broad spatial scales (20\u00b0 latitude or more) that considered whether diversity and latitude showed a negative relationship (with diversity decreasing toward the poles), a positive relationship (increasing toward the poles), a unimodal relationship (increasing toward mid-latitudes and then declining toward the poles), or no relationship. Negative relationships were by far the most common. FIGURE 18.12 Studies of Latitude and Species Diversity Confirm Conventional Wisdom The relationship between species diversity and latitude (measured at 20\u00b0 increments), tallied for a variety of taxonomic groups, shows that most are negative correlations (i.e., increasing species diversity with decreasing latitude). (After M. R. Willig et al. 2003. Annu Rev Ecol Syst 34: 273\u2013309.) In addition to this undeniably strong latitudinal gradient, biogeographers have observed an important pattern of longitudinal variation. Gaston et al. (1995) measured the numbers of families along multiple transects running north to south and separated by 10\u00b0 longitude. Families of seed plants, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals all increased in number toward the equator and declined at higher latitudes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. These researchers determined, however, that the number of families also depended on the longitude chosen. Their observations showed that there were areas of particularly high species richness at some locations, sometimes secondary to latitude. These areas are known as biodiversity hot spots in situations in which they are under threat from humans. Of course, not all groups of organisms show decreases in species richness at higher latitudes; some groups display the opposite pattern.", "Seabirds, for example, have their highest diversity at temperate and polar latitudes (Harrison 1987) (FIGURE 18.13A). Seabirds of the Antarctic and subantarctic include penguins, albatrosses, petrels, and skuas (FIGURE 18.13B). In the Arctic and subarctic, auks replace penguins, and gulls, terns, and grebes are common. In the tropics and subtropics, seabird diversity declines: the seabird community there is composed mostly of pelicans, boobies, cormorants, and frigatebirds. This pattern of seabird diversity correlates well with marine productivity, which is substantially higher in temperate and polar oceans than in the tropics (see Figure 20.10). The same pattern of diversity has been observed in marine benthic communities, which also experience much higher productivity at higher latitudes. FIGURE 18.13 Seabirds Defy Conventional Wisdom Global seabird species richness shows a latitudinal pattern opposite to that of most faunas. (A) Species richness among seabirds is high in temperate and polar regions and much lower in the tropics. (B) Species composition also shows strong latitudinal differences. (A, data from P. Harrison. 1987. A Field Guide to Seabirds of the World. Penguin Random House: London.) As we will see, productivity differences are one possible cause of latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Let\u2019s turn now to some other possible explanations. Latitudinal gradients have multiple, interrelated causes As we have seen, global patterns of species richness are ultimately controlled by the rates of three processes: speciation, extinction, and dispersal. Let\u2019s assume here, for simplicity\u2019s sake, that the rate of species dispersal is roughly the same worldwide. We can then predict that the number of species at any particular location will reflect a balance, or equilibrium, between the rates of two fundamental processes: speciation and extinction. Subtracting the extinction rate from the speciation rate gives us the rate of species diversification: the net increase or decrease of species diversity over time. What ultimately controls this rate? Dozens of hypotheses have been proposed to explain species diversification with latitude, but there is very little agreement among biogeographers and ecologists. Part of the reason lies in the fact that there are multiple and confounding latitudinal gradients in area, evolutionary age, and climate that are correlated with species diversity gradients. In addition, because speciation and extinction occur at a global spatial scale and over evolutionary time scales, it is impossible to conduct manipulative experiments to isolate various factors and separate correlation from causation. In an effort to summarize the most convincing ideas, Gary Mittelbach and colleagues (2007) suggested that hypotheses proposed to explain latitudinal gradients in species richness fall into three broad categories. The first category of hypotheses is based on the assumption that the rate of species diversification in the tropics is greater than that in temperate regions (FIGURE 18.14A). The second category of hypotheses suggests that the rates of diversification in the tropics and at higher latitudes are similar, but that the evolutionary time available for diversification has been much greater in the tropics (FIGURE 18.14B). The third category of hypotheses suggests that resources are more plentiful in the tropics because of higher productivity, and thus that species there have higher carrying capacities and a greater ability to coexist (FIGURE 18.14C). Let\u2019s take a look at each category of hypotheses in more detail. FIGURE 18.14 Hypotheses Proposed to Explain the Latitudinal Gradient in Species Richness (A) The tropics have a higher diversification rate (speciation rate \u2013 extinction rate) than temperate areas do, so they have accumulated species faster. (B) The tropics have had more time for diversification than temperate areas have, so they have accumulated more species. (C) Because their productivity is higher, the tropics have a higher carrying capacity than temperate areas, so more species can coexist there. (After G. G. Mittelbach et al. 2007. Ecol Lett 10: 315\u2013331.) SPECIES DIVERSIFICATION RATE There are a number of hypotheses that seek to explain why species diversification might be higher in the tropics. One hypothesis relates diversification to geographic area and temperature. John Terborgh (1973) and Michael Rosenzweig (1992) proposed that terrestrial species diversity is highest in the tropics because the tropics have the largest land area (FIGURE 18.15A). Rosenzweig calculated that the region between 26\u00b0N and S has 2.5 times more land area than any other latitude range on Earth. This makes intuitive sense, given that this latitude range is at the middle, and thus at the widest part, of the planet. Equally interesting are data showing that this very large area is also the most thermally homogeneous region on Earth (FIGURE 18.15B).", "A plot of average annual temperature against latitude by Terborgh showed that land temperatures are remarkably uniform over a wide area between 25\u00b0N and S, but then drop off rapidly at higher latitudes. FIGURE 18.15 Do Land Area and Temperature Influence Species Diversity? Michael Rosenzweig hypothesized that two characteristics of the tropics lead to high speciation rates and low extinction rates: (A) their land area and (B) their stable temperatures. (After M. L. Rosenzweig. 1992. J Mammol 73: 715\u2013730.) Why would a larger land area and more constant temperatures foster greater species diversity? Rosenzweig suggested that these two factors combine to decrease extinction rates and increase speciation rates in tropical regions. He argued that a larger and more thermally stable area should decrease extinction rates in two ways: first, by increasing the population sizes of species (assuming that their densities are the same worldwide), and thus decreasing their risk of extinction due to chance events, and second, by increasing the geographic ranges of species, and thus decreasing their chances of extinction by spreading the risk over a larger geographic area (see Concept 11.3). He further suggested that speciation should increase in larger areas because species should have larger geographic ranges, and thus should have a greater chance of reproductive isolation of populations (see Concept 6.4). Rosenzweig\u2019s theory is controversial for a number of reasons, however. WEB EXTENSION 18.3 describes several alternative hypotheses proposed to explain species diversification rates in the tropics. SPECIES DIVERSIFICATION TIME The second category of hypotheses, which proposes that latitudinal gradients in species diversity are influenced by evolutionary history, was first championed by Wallace (1878). He suggested that tropical regions, because they are thought to have been more climatically stable over time (see Figure 18.15B), could have considerably longer evolutionary histories than temperate or polar regions, where severe climate conditions (such as ice ages) might have disrupted species diversification. Thus, even if rates of speciation and extinction were the same worldwide, the tropics should have accumulated more species over time merely because species should have had more uninterrupted time to evolve there. With these ideas in mind, we can consider another possibility: that most species actually originate in the tropics and then disperse to temperate regions during warmer periods of greater climate homogeneity. The idea that the tropics serve as a \u201ccradle\u201d for diversity was originally proposed by Stebbins (1974). Jablonski et al. (2006) recently examined this hypothesis by comparing modern marine bivalve faunas with marine bivalve fossils from as far back as 11 million years ago. They found that the majority of extant marine bivalve taxa originated in the tropics (FIGURE 18.16A) and spread toward the poles (FIGURE 18.16B), but without losing their tropical presence. Thus, in this particular case, we can think of the tropics as a cradle of species diversity because the majority of extant taxa originated there. But, as Jablonski and colleagues also pointed out, the tropics can serve as a \u201cmuseum\u201d as well as a cradle. If extinction rates in the tropics are low, then species that diversify there will tend to stay there \u201con display,\u201d if you will. Jablonski and colleagues suggested that the current loss of biodiversity in the tropics is likely to have profound effects because it not only compromises species richness today, but also could conceivably cut off the supply of new species to higher latitudes in the future. FIGURE 18.16 The Tropics Are a Cradle and a Museum for Speciation Extant and fossil marine bivalve taxa were examined to evaluate the hypothesis that longer evolutionary histories in the tropics contribute to the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. (A) Climate zones of first occurrence of marine bivalve taxa (based on families of fossils). (B) Range limits of modern marine bivalve taxa with tropical origins. (After D. Jablonski et al. 2006. Science 314: 102\u2013106.) What is meant by the tropics being a cradle and a museum for diversity? PRODUCTIVITY The final category of hypotheses for the latitudinal gradient in species diversity that we will consider is based on resources\u2014in particular, productivity. The productivity hypothesis, proposed as long ago as 1959 by G. E. Hutchinson, posits that species diversity is higher in the tropics because that is where productivity is highest, at least for terrestrial systems (see Figure 20.7). The thought is that higher productivity promotes larger population sizes because species will have higher carrying capacities. This higher productivity will lead to lower extinction rates, greater species coexistence, and overall higher species richness.", "The productivity hypothesis might explain why we see a reversal in the latitudinal gradient for some marine organisms, such as seabirds (see Figure 18.13), given that productivity is generally higher in temperate coastal marine habitats than in tropical regions (see Figure 20.10). But we also know that some of the most productive habitats on Earth, such as estuaries, typically have very low species diversity. Suffice it to say, the productivity hypothesis is complex and unsatisfactory in many cases. In Chapter 19, we will consider how productivity influences diversity at local scales, where manipulative experiments can give us more insight into its effects. CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS IN DIVERSITY UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE One way to explore the potential causes of latitudinal gradients in species diversity is to consider them over evolutionary time and with major changes in climate. We can ask, Did the fundamental pattern of increasing species diversity toward the tropics exist in the past, and if not, why? Philip Mannion and colleagues (2014) used the fossil record and fluctuations in past global temperatures as a window into past latitudinal and species diversity gradients and their potential causes. Their analysis showed that a tropical peak in species diversity has not been a universal pattern but has been restricted to particular intervals of time throughout the Phanerozoic when the Earth experienced colder, \u201cicehouse\u201d conditions (FIGURE 18.17). Likewise, they found that during warmer, \u201cgreenhouse\u201d conditions, species diversity peaked in temperate latitudes, exhibiting a more unimodal relationship. These switches from temperate to tropical peaks in species diversity corresponded to transitions in greenhouse to icehouse climate conditions, lending support for the notion that polar to temperate glaciations could drive species to the tropics where extinctions would be lower. Conversely, during greenhouse conditions, the tropics might become too hot for many organisms, leading to increased extinction rates and dispersal out of the tropics. One might speculate, in fact, that with global warming, latitudinal gradients in species diversity could become shallower or more unimodal as warming causes species to disperse poleward or become increasingly extinct within tropical latitudes. FIGURE 18.17 Latitudinal Species Diversity Gradients Vary with Climate The latitudinal species diversity gradients under fluctuating global temperature through the Phanerozoic. Tropical peaks in species diversity (blue symbols) are restricted to cold, \u201cicehouse\u201d conditions, whereas temperate peaks in diversity (red symbols) occur during warm, \u201cgreenhouse\u201d intervals. Note that during the icehouse conditions of the Neogene, a short warming period during the Pleistocene interglacial period led to a peak in diversity at temperate latitudes. Circles are terrestrial examples, and triangles are marine examples. (After P. D. Mannion et al. 2014. Trends Ecol Evol 29: 42\u201350. CC BY 3.0) As we have seen, biogeographic patterns have motivated and inspired some of the best and brightest scientists of modern times. Their fascination with the differences in the numbers and kinds of species at the global scale and their overwhelming drive to understand why these differences exist have resulted in some of the most influential scientific theories of all time, including that of the origin of species. In the next section, we will consider another important theory that strives to understand species diversity at smaller spatial scales. Self-Assessment 18.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 18.3 Regional differences in species diversity are influenced by area and distance, which determine the balance between immigration and extinction rates. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 18.3.1 Graph and explain the species\u2013area relationship and know why it differs between islands and mainland areas. 18.3.2 Explain regional species diversity for islands and island-like areas using the equilibrium theory of island biogeography. Regional Biogeography An important thread that runs through this chapter, and through biogeography generally, is the relationship between species richness and geographic area. We saw in the Case Study that large fragments of Amazon rainforest had greater species richness than smaller fragments. In our global tour of the world\u2019s forests, we saw that species diversity was greatest in the tropics (see Table 18.1), the climate zone whose geographic area is largest (see Figure 18.15A). This so-called species\u2013area relationship, in which species richness increases with the area sampled, has been documented at a variety of spatial scales, from small ponds to whole continents. Most studies of species\u2013area relationships have been targeted at regional spatial scales, where these relationships tend to be good predictors of differences in species richness.", "Species richness increases with area and decreases with distance In 1859, H. C. Watson plotted the first curve showing a quantitative species\u2013area relationship\u2014in this case, for plants within Great Britain (FIGURE 18.18) (Williams 1943). The curve starts with a small \u201cbit\u201d of the county of Surrey and expands to ever-increasing areas that eventually encompass all of Surrey, southern England, and finally Great Britain. With each increase in area, species richness increases until it reaches a maximum number bounded by the largest area considered. (ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 18.1 and ANALYZING DATA 18.1 provide further insight on how species\u2013area curves are plotted and interpreted.) FIGURE 18.18 The Species\u2013Area Relationship The first species\u2013area curve, for British plants, was constructed by H. C. Watson in 1859. (After M. Rosenzweig. 1995. Species Diversity in Space and Time. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge; based on data in C. B. Williams. 1964. Patterns in the Balance of Nature. Academic Press: London; H. C. Watson. 1859. Cybele Britannica: or British Plants and Their Geographical Relations 4: 379. Longman and Company: United Kingdom.) Most species\u2013area relationships have been documented for islands (FIGURE 18.19). Islands, in this case, include all kinds of isolated areas surrounded by a \u201csea\u201d of dissimilar habitat (referred to as matrix habitat). So \u201cislands\u201d can include real islands surrounded by ocean, lake \u201cislands\u201d surrounded by land, or mountain \u201cislands\u201d surrounded by valleys. They can also include habitat fragments, like those produced by the deforestation of the Amazon (see Figure 18.2). Nonetheless, all of these islands and island-like habitats display the same basic pattern: large islands have more species than small islands. FIGURE 18.19 Species\u2013Area Curves for Islands and Island-Like Habitats Species\u2013area curves plotted for (A) reptiles on Caribbean islands, (B) mammals on mountaintops in the American Southwest, and (C) fishes living in desert springs in Australia all show a positive relationship between area and species richness. (A after S. J. Wright. 1981. Am Nat 118: 726\u2013748; B after M. V. Lomolino et al. 1989. Ecology 70: 180\u2013194; C after A. Kodric-Brown and J. H. Brown. 1993. Ecology 74: 1847\u20131855.) In addition, because of the isolated nature of islands, species diversity on islands shows a strong negative relationship to distance from the main source of species. For example, Lomolino et al. (1989) found that mammal species richness on mountaintops in the American Southwest decreases as a function of the distance from the main source of species\u2014in this case, two large mountain ranges in the region. This and other examples generally show that islands more distant from source populations, such as those in mainland areas or unfragmented habitats, have fewer species than islands of roughly the same size closer to source populations. ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 18.1 Species\u2013area curves are the result of plotting the species richness (S) of a particular sample against the area (A) of that sample. A linear regression equation estimates the relationship between S and A in the following manner: where z is the slope of the line and c is the y intercept of the line. Because species\u2013area data are typically nonlinear, ecologists transform S and A into logarithmic values so that the data fall along a straight line and conform to a linear regression model. The figure shows species\u2013area curves for plants on the Channel Islands (off the coast of France) and on the French mainland (Williams 1964). Log transformations were conducted on both the island and mainland data, the two data sets were plotted separately, and a linear model was used to estimate the best-fit curve for each of the data sets. An important characteristic of species\u2013area curves is evident in this figure: the steeper the slope of the line (i.e., the greater the z value), the greater the difference in species richness among the sampling areas. The Channel Islands have a much steeper slope than the French mainland areas, for the reasons outlined at the end of Concept 18.3. Species\u2013Area Relationships of Island versus Mainland Areas Species\u2013area curves for plant species on the Channel Islands and in mainland France show that the slope of a linear regression equation (z) is greater for the islands than for the mainland areas. (After M. Rosenzweig. 1995. Species Diversity in Space and Time. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge; based on data in C. B. Williams. 1964. Patterns in the Balance of Nature. Academic Press: London.) ANALYZING DATA 18.1 As we learned in Analyzing Data 16.1, the invasion of non-native species has been implicated in both increases and decreases of species diversity within communities.", "In the study we considered in that exercise, the majority of the non2 native species had negative effects on species diversity at relatively small scales (16 m ). Does this pattern hold as we increase the spatial scale over which we sample species diversity? Kristin Powell and colleagues (2013)* considered this question by comparing the effect of native and non-native plants on forest communities at different spatial scales. They used species\u2013area curves to plot the number of plant species versus the area sampled for three separate tree communities across the United States: tropical forests in Hawaii being invaded by the fire tree (Morella faya), oak\u2013hickory forests in Missouri being invaded by Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), and hardwood hammock forests in Florida being invaded by the cerulean flax lily (Dianella ensifolia). In each of the forests, they identified multiple pairs of sites on opposite sides of an invasion front that had been ongoing for at least 30 years. At invaded sites, more than 90% of the plant cover was invaders, while the second site remained uninvaded. Powell et al.\u2019s results for the Florida forest community are shown in the figure. (Their studies of forests in Hawaii and Missouri are explored in ONLINE ANALYZING DATA 18.1.) 1. How do the slope (z) and y intercept (c) of the curve differ for invaded and uninvaded sites? What does this difference tell us about the effect of invaders on species richness at small versus large spatial scales? 22. Convert the log area (m ) and log species richness to non-log values at the smallest and largest spatial scales for invaded and uninvaded sites. What is the approximate range in spatial extent and in species richness for invaded and uninvaded plots? 3. Provide a hypothesis that could explain the difference between the species\u2013area curves for invaded versus uninvaded areas. See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. *Powell, K. I., J. M. Chase, and T. M. Knight. 2013. Invasive plants have scale-dependent effects on diversity by altering species\u2013area relationships. Science 339: 316\u2013318. Almost always, however, island isolation and size are confounded. Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson (1963) illustrated this problem by plotting the relationship between bird species richness and island area for a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean off New Guinea (FIGURE 18.20). Here, the islands varied in both size and degree of isolation from the mainland, but some patterns were evident. For example, if we compare islands of equivalent size, the island farthest from source populations (on New Guinea) has fewer bird species than the island closest to source populations. FIGURE 18.20 Area and Isolation Influence Species Richness on Islands MacArthur and Wilson plotted species\u2013area relationships for birds on islands of different sizes and at different distances from source populations (on New Guinea). (After R. H. MacArthur and E. O. Wilson. 1963. Evolution 17: 373\u2013387.) Let\u2019s turn now to the question of how island area and isolation could together act to produce these commonly observed species diversity patterns. Species richness is a balance between immigration and extinction The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967) represented one of the most important breakthroughs in the science of biogeography since Wallace\u2019s time. The book was born out of the common interests of two scientists: an ecologist, Robert MacArthur, and a taxonomist and biogeographer, Edward O. Wilson. Wilson, who had studied the biogeography of ants for his Ph.D. thesis work, had made a few key observations about islands in the South Pacific, which he found himself discussing with MacArthur when they met at a scientific meeting (Wilson 1994). The first observation was that for every tenfold increase in island area, there was a rough doubling of ant species richness. The second was that as ant species spread from mainland areas to islands, the new species tended to replace the existing species, but there was no net gain in species richness. There appeared to be an equilibrium number of species on the islands, which was dependent on their size and distance from the mainland, but species composition on the islands could, and did, change over time. MacArthur, a gifted mathematical ecologist, was just 31 years old when he and Wilson developed these observations into the beginnings of a simple but elegant theoretical regional biogeographic model. The model, published in their book 5 years later, became more commonly known as the equilibrium theory of island biogeography.", "The theory is based on the idea that the number of species on an island, or in an island-like habitat, depends on a balance between immigration or dispersal rates and extinction rates. The theory works something like this: Imagine an empty island open for colonization by species from mainland, or source, populations. As new species arrive on the island, by whatever means necessary, the island starts to fill up. The rate of immigration (the number of new species arriving) decreases over time as more and more species are added, eventually reaching zero when the entire pool of new species that could reach the island and be supported there is exhausted. But as the number of species on the island increases, there should also be an increase in the rate of extinction. This assumption makes sense according to the simple principle of balance mentioned above: with more species, there are more species extinctions. Additionally, as the number of species increases, the population size of each species should get smaller. Conceivably, this could occur for two reasons. First, competition may increase, thus decreasing the population sizes of species as they vie for the same space and resources. Second, predation may increase as more consumer species are added to the island. The result of either interaction is smaller population sizes and thus a greater risk of species extinction. If we plot the immigration rate against the extinction rate, the actual number of species on the island should fall where the two curves intersect, or where species immigration and extinction are in balance (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 18.21). This equilibrium number is the number of species that should theoretically \u201cfit\u201d on the island, irrespective of the turnover, or replacement of one species with another, that occurs on the island over time. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 18.21 The Equilibrium Theory of Island Biogeography MacArthur and Wilson\u2019s theory emphasized the balance between species immigration rates and species extinction rates for islands of different sizes and at different distances from a source of colonizing species. (After R. H. MacArthur and E. O. Wilson. 1963. Evolution 17: 373\u2013387.) To understand the influence of island size and isolation on island species richness, MacArthur and Wilson simply adjusted their curves up or down to reflect their effects (see Interactive Figure 18.21). They assumed that island size mainly controls the extinction rate. They reasoned that small islands should have higher extinction rates than large islands, for the same two reasons described above, resulting in an extinction curve for small islands that is higher than that for large islands. Likewise, they reasoned that the distance of an island from the mainland mainly controls the immigration rate. Distant islands should have lower rates of immigration than islands near the mainland, resulting in an immigration curve for distant islands that is lower than that for islands near the mainland. To test their theory, MacArthur and Wilson (1967) applied it to observations from the small volcanic island of Krakatau, between Sumatra and Java, which erupted violently in 1883, wiping out all life on the island (FIGURE 18.22). Surprisingly, animal and plant species began returning to what little remained of the island within a year of the explosion. MacArthur and Wilson used data from three surveys at various times since the eruption to calculate the immigration and extinction rates of birds on the island. Based on these rates, they predicted that the island should sustain roughly 30 bird species at equilibrium, with a turnover of 1 species. The data showed that bird species richness on the island had indeed reached 30 species within 40 years after the eruption and had remained close to that number thereafter. However, they also found that turnover was much higher, at 5 species. Whether this difference was due to a sampling error or a problem with the model is unknown, but this example motivated Wilson and others (e.g., the BDFFP researchers whose work is described in this chapter\u2019s Case Study) to start testing the model using manipulative experiments. FIGURE 18.22 The Krakatau Test (A) The eruption of the small volcanic island of Krakatau, near Sumatra and Java, in 1883 provided a natural test of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography. (B) Krakatau is still an active volcano, as this recent photo shows. (C) By 1921, the number of bird species had reached 31, and in 1934, it was at 30\u2014 the equilibrium number predicted by MacArthur and Wilson\u2019s theory. Turnover, however, was five times higher than the theory had predicted.", "(C after R. H. MacArthur and E. O. Wilson. 1963. Evolution 17: 373\u2013387; based on data from K. W. Dammerman. 1948. The Fauna of Krakatau: 1883\u20131933. Noord-Hollandsche Uitg.-Mig.) One of the best-known experiments to test the equilibrium theory of island biogeography was conducted by Daniel Simberloff and his advisor, Edward O. Wilson, on small mangrove islands and their arthropod inhabitants in the Florida Keys (Simberloff and Wilson 1969; Wilson and Simberloff 1969). These islands were scattered at various distances from large \u201cmainland\u201d mangrove stands (FIGURE 18.23A). After surveying species richness on the islands, Simberloff and Wilson manipulated a handful of them by fumigating them with an insecticide to remove all of their insects and spiders (FIGURE 18.23B). They then surveyed the defaunated islands over a year-long period (FIGURE 18.23C). By the end of the year, species numbers on the islands were similar to those before the defaunation; furthermore, the island closest to a source of colonists had the most species, and the farthest island had the least (FIGURE 18.23D). Interestingly, the farthest island had not quite regained its original species richness even after 2 years. All the islands showed considerable turnover of species, as might be expected for small islands where extinction rates are predicted to be high (see Interactive Figure 18.21). FIGURE 18.23 The Mangrove Experiment (A) To test the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, Simberloff and Wilson surveyed small mangrove islands located at different distances from larger mangrove stands. (B) They then defaunated some of the islands using fumigation tents. (C) They sampled and recorded the number of insect species that recolonized the islands, using scaffolding to reach all parts of the canopy. (D) Results for two islands, one near and one far from a source of colonists. (D after D. S. Simberloff and E. O. Wilson. 1969. Ecology 50: 278\u2013296.) The equilibrium theory of island biogeography holds true for mainland areas Do the effects of area and isolation influence differences in species richness in mainland areas as well as on islands? As we saw in Watson\u2019s graph of plant species richness in Great Britain (see Figure 18.18), the species\u2013area relationships observed on islands can also hold for mainland areas. How, then, does the biogeography of mainland areas differ from that of islands and island-like areas? Let\u2019s consider a plot of plant species richness in mainland areas of France and on the Channel Islands in the English Channel (see Ecological Toolkit 18.1). Williams (1964) showed that plant species richness increases with area in both locations but that the slope of the line representing the increase is steeper for the Channel Islands than for the French mainland (i.e., the z value was greater on the islands). How can we interpret this difference? In mainland areas, just as on islands, species richness is theorized to be controlled by rates of immigration and extinction. In mainland areas, however, these rates are likely to be different from those on islands. Immigration rates should be greater in mainland areas because the barriers to dispersal are lower. Species can move from one area to the next, presumably through continuous, non-island habitat. In addition, extinction rates should be much lower in mainland areas because of the continual immigration of new individuals from the larger mainland population. The idea is that species will always have a good chance of being \u201crescued\u201d from local extinction by other population members. The end result of these higher immigration and lower extinction rates in mainland areas is a lower rate of increase in species richness with increasing area, and thus a gentler slope, than in island areas. We have seen over and over again in this chapter that geographic area has a large influence on species diversity at global and regional spatial scales. This effect takes on heightened significance as more habitats become \u201cisland-like\u201d because of human influences. As we will see in the Case Study Revisited, the theory and practice of island biogeography is timely and relevant to the issues of conservation that we deal with today. Self-Assessment 18.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED The Largest Ecological Experiment on Earth One goal of ecologists is to understand the science behind the conservation of species threatened by habitat destruction and fragmentation.", "As we set aside more and more reserves to protect species diversity, the areas around those reserves continue to be changed by human activities, leaving many of them islands in a matrix of degraded habitat that is unsuitable for the species they contain. Thus, it is critical that we understand reserve design if we are to meet our conservation goals. When Lovejoy and his colleagues embarked, more than 40 years ago, on the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) in the Amazon, one of their goals was to study the effects of reserve design on the maintenance of species diversity (Bierregaard et al. 2001). As it turned out, they learned that habitat fragmentation had even more negative and complicated effects than they had anticipated. One of the first things they learned was that forest fragments needed to be large and close together to effectively maintain their original species diversity. For example, in a study of forest understory birds, Ferraz et al. (2003) found that even the largest fragments they surveyed (100 ha) lost 50% of their species within 12 years. Given that the regeneration time for these tropical rainforests ranges from several decades to a century, they projected that even fragments of 100 ha would be ineffective at maintaining bird species richness until forest regeneration could \u201crescue\u201d species surviving within the fragments. The ecologists calculated that over 1,000 ha would be needed to maintain bird species richness until the forests could be regenerated, an area far greater than the average Amazon rainforest fragment in existence today (Gascon et al. 2000). If forest regeneration did not occur\u2014as is likely when the land around a forest fragment is developed or used for agriculture\u2014the fragment would have to contain 10,000 ha or more to maintain most of its bird species over more than 100 years of isolation (although even a fragment of that size could not sustain them all). The researchers of the BDFFP were also surprised at how even minimal distances between fragments resulted in almost complete isolation of species. Clearings even 80 m (265 feet) wide hindered the recolonization of fragments by birds, insects, and arboreal (tree-dwelling) mammals (Laurance et al. 2002). It seemed that animals avoided entering the clearings for a number of interrelated reasons, the most obvious of which is that they have no innate reason to do so, having evolved within large, continuous, and climatically stable habitats that lacked the fragmentation imposed on them by deforestation. Moreover, even if some animals were inclined to venture into the clearings, specific requirements for their movement, such as trees for arboreal mammals, would not be present to facilitate their travel to other forest patches. A second major finding of the BDFFP was that habitat fragmentation exposes the species within a fragment to a wide variety of potential hazards, including harsh environmental conditions, fires, hunting, predators, diseases, and invasive species. These edge effects, which occur at the transition between forest and nonforested matrix habitat, can act together to increase local species extinctions. Trees, for example, can be killed or damaged by their sudden exposure to brighter light, higher temperatures, wind, fire, and diseases (FIGURE 18.24). Over time, depending on the surrounding matrix habitat, the ultimate influences of edge effects are revealed. If the matrix habitat is left undisturbed, secondary succession occurs, as described in Chapter 17, reducing edge effects. If the matrix habitat continues to be disturbed, however, then the area subjected to edge effects may increase in size. For example, Gascon et al. (2000) describe forest fragments in the southern Amazon that are embedded in huge non-native sugarcane and Eucalyptus plantations where burning is used regularly for crop rotation. The burning keeps the forest edges in a constant state of disturbance. Fire-tolerant plant species, many of them non-native, become more common at the edges and act as conduits for more fires. This positive feedback loop ends up decreasing the effective size of the forest fragments and continually increasing the area subjected to edge effects. Some edge effects can extend a kilometer or more into a fragment, essentially influencing the entire area of a 1,000-ha fragment. FIGURE 18.24 Tropical Rainforests on the Edge The BDFFP\u2019s research showed that deforestation subjects the forest fragments that remain to negative edge effects. (After C. Gascon et al. 2000. Science 288: 1356\u20131358.) The results of the BDFFP have made an immense and sobering contribution to our understanding of forest fragmentation.", "As Laurance et al. (2002) point out, the BDFFP is a controlled experiment that probably provides a conservative estimate of species losses. The BDFFP has shown us that most of the forest fragments human activities are creating are too small to maintain all their original species; thus, habitat fragmentation is likely to result in the loss of many species. We\u2019ll see how the BDFFP\u2019s findings are being applied to reserve design and other conservation efforts when we discuss habitat fragmentation and edge effects in more detail in Concept 24.2. CONNECTIONS in NATURE TROPICAL RAINFOREST DIVERSITY BENEFITS HUMANS Why do we care when species go extinct in a rainforest far away? As we will see in Concept 23.1, such extinctions raise ethical and aesthetic concerns similar to those that arise when great works of art or antiquities are lost to society. In addition, there are economic concerns about the loss of important ecosystem services produced by natural systems, which help sustain human health and well-being. For example, tropical deforestation raises concerns about losses of important foods and medicines that have their origins in rainforests. At least 80% of the developed world\u2019s diet originated in tropical rainforests, including corn, rice, squash, yams, oranges, coconuts, lemons, tomatoes, and nuts and spices of many kinds. Twenty-five percent of all commercial pharmaceuticals are derived from tropical rainforest plants, but less than 1% of tropical rainforest plants have been tested for their potential medical uses. These statistics raise the question, How does the economic value of tropical rainforest plants used for nontimber purposes compare with the value of deforestation? It turns out that there have been very few economic analyses of this type. A few studies come from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), a synthesis of studies on the use of the environment and its relationship to human needs, created by leading scientists from around the world. An example comes from Cambodia, where the total economic value of traditional forest products (e.g., fuelwood, rattan and bamboo, malva nuts, and medicines) was compared with that of unsustainable forest harvesting. The value of traditional forest products is four to five times greater ($700\u2013$3,900 per hectare) than that of unsustainable forest harvesting ($150\u2013$1,100 per hectare). Recognition of the economic benefits of changing our resource management practices has only just begun. Why is this? Part of the answer lies in our not formally recognizing the economic value of the services provided to humans by species or whole communities. Tropical rainforests provide food, medicine, fuel, and a destination for tourists, all of which can be obtained without complete deforestation. Rainforests also regulate water flow, climate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Assigning a value to any of these important services is difficult compared with setting the market price of timber or agricultural products. For that reason, it is easier to justify the use of rainforest timber and land (and even some sustainable forest products) for private profit than to press for the conservation of rainforests based on the ecological services they provide to society in general. If private landowners are not given incentives to value the larger social benefits of ecological services, maximization of personal gain often drives their decisions. Given the importance of ecological services to our planet, we can no longer afford to ignore these economic trade-offs. Species Diversity in Communities KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 19.1 Species diversity differs among communities as a consequence of regional species pools, abiotic conditions, and species interactions. CONCEPT 19.2 Resource partitioning is theorized to reduce competition and increase species diversity. CONCEPT 19.3 Processes such as disturbance, stress, predation, and positive interactions can mediate resource availability, thus promoting species diversity. CONCEPT 19.4 Many experiments show that species diversity affects community function. Can Species Diversity Suppress Human Diseases? A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 On May 14, 1993, a 19-year-old cross-country track star, riding in the backseat of his family\u2019s car, began struggling to breathe. The family immediately stopped at a convenience store to call for help, and the young man was rushed to a hospital in Gallup, New Mexico. The ambulance crew tried to revive him, but he died soon after reaching the emergency room. A chest X-ray showed that his lungs were filled with fluid.", "The deputy medical investigator based in Gallup was called in, and over the course of 2 weeks, he determined that at least five other residents of the area, which included members of the Navajo Nation living in the Four Corners region (where New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah intersect), had also mysteriously died in the same sudden manner. After interviewing families of the victims, the medical examiner determined that all had experienced flu-like symptoms and then acute respiratory distress as a result of their lungs being filled with fluid. The disease appeared to be infectious and viral. By early June 1993, the Viral Special Pathogens Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had determined that the culprit was a previously unknown species of hantavirus, a pathogen carried by rodents. It was given the name Sin Nombre virus (SNV) or \u201cthe nameless virus.\u201d The virus is carried by rodents, which shed the virus in their urine, feces, and saliva. If those sources are disturbed, the virus can become aerosolized and inhaled by humans. It was subsequently determined that the new viral strain was carried by a species of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) whose populations had recently boomed in the Four Corners region (FIGURE 19.1). Research showed that deer mouse populations had increased 20-fold in some locations, triggering the transmission of SNV infections in humans (see Concept 9.5 and Figure 9.17). FIGURE 19.1 Deer Mice Trigger Hantavirus Infection in Humans Can the number of small-mammal species affect the transmission of hantavirus by the deer mouse? Over the last 70 years, the number of emerging diseases affecting humans has substantially increased. Of these diseases, 62% are zoonotic\u2014hosted by wildlife and infectious to humans. Diseases such as the Zika virus, Ebola virus, and avian influenza are all zoonotic diseases that have emerged over the last few decades. The factors that affect zoonotic disease emergence are complex and sometimes disease-specific but often include human-caused events such as species invasions, climate change, pollution, and land use conversion. One seemingly unlikely factor, that of declining species diversity, is starting to be recognized as an important mechanism that may facilitate the emergence and transmission of zoonotic diseases. It turns out that hantaviruses provide a nice model system for studying how the loss of species diversity within a community may affect disease emergence and transmission. A number of observational studies have linked hantavirus infection prevalence in deer mouse host populations with declining small-mammal species diversity. For example, in a field study in Oregon, the one variable that was significantly linked to SNV infection prevalence was small-mammal species diversity, with the prevalence of SNV rising from 2% to 14% as species diversity declined (Dizney and Ruedas 2009). A similar study in Utah came to the same conclusion. These researchers too found a negative correlation between small-mammal diversity and SNV infection prevalence in deer mice (Clay et al. 2009). These observational studies are supported by an experimental study of hantaviruses in rodent communities of Panama. In their study, Gerardo Suz\u00e0n and colleagues (2009) conducted a small-mammal removal experiment in replicate field plots, where zoonotic hantaviruses are native and common. Small-mammal diversity was reduced through trapping of species that were not host to the virus. They found that plots with reduced small-mammal diversity had both an increase in rodent host individuals and that more of those individuals were infected by hantavirus (FIGURE 19.2). FIGURE 19.2 Disease Transmission Increased with Species Diversity Loss An experiment in Panama showed that plots with small-mammal diversity removal (low-diversity plots) increased in (A) the number of rodent host individuals and (B) the number of hosts infected with the hantavirus compared to the control (high-diversity plots). Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After F. Keesing et al. 2010. Nature 468: 647\u2013652.) The observational and experimental evidence presented here point to the role of species diversity in buffering the transmission of zoonotic pathogens to wildlife and ultimately humans. But what explains the effect of species diversity in disease transmission? As we will see, the response of the host to changes in species diversity makes all the difference in the answer to this question. View the script for the video Introduction Communities vary tremendously in the numbers and kinds of species they contain. In Chapter 18, our worldwide tour of forest communities demonstrated the wide variation in species diversity that occurs both globally and regionally.", "We saw that communities in the tropics (such as the Amazon rainforest) had many more tree species than those at higher latitudes (such as the forests of the Pacific Northwest or New Zealand). Moreover, we found that regional species pools had an important, but not an exclusive, influence on the number of species within a community. In this chapter, we will focus on species diversity at the local scale. We will ask two important questions: First, what are the factors that control species diversity within communities? Second, what effects does species diversity have on the functioning of communities? CONCEPT 19.1 Species diversity differs among communities as a consequence of regional species pools, abiotic conditions, and species interactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 19.1.1 Describe how regional species\u2019 pools and dispersal abilities contribute to community membership. 19.1.2 Describe how local environmental conditions act as a \u201cfilter\u201d for community membership. 19.1.3 Describe how species interactions may act to include species in, or exclude species from, communities. Community Membership If you looked across a landscape from the top of a mountain, you would see a patchwork of different communities that might consist of, say, forests, meadows, lakes, streams, and marshes (FIGURE 19.3). You could be sure that each of those communities would have a different species richness and composition. The meadow would be dominated by a variety of grasses, herbs, and terrestrial insects. The lake would be filled with various species of fish, plankton, and aquatic insects, and it might possibly harbor as many species as the meadow. Even though some species would be able to move from one community to another (such as amphibians), the two communities would still be highly distinct. FIGURE 19.3 A View from Above Looking at these mountains in Glacier National Park, Montana, it is easy to see that the landscape is made up of a patchwork of communities of different types. How do collections of species end up coming together to form different communities? One way to answer this question is to consider the factors that control species membership in communities. If you think about the sheer number of species that coexist within any community, it is clear that no one process is responsible for all the species we find there. As we saw in Concepts 9.3 and 18.1, the distributions and abundances of organisms are dependent on three interacting factors: (1) regional species pools and dispersal ability (species supply), (2) environmental conditions, and (3) species interactions. We can think of these three factors as \u201cfilters\u201d that act to exclude species from (or include them in) particular communities (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 19.4). Let\u2019s briefly consider each of them in more detail. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 19.4 Community Membership: A Series of Filters Species end up in a local community by passing through a series of \u201cfilters\u201d that determine community membership. Species are lost at each filter, so local communities contain a fraction of the species in the regional pool. In practice, all the filters work at the same time, rather than in series as the figure suggests. (After J. H. Lawton. 2000. In Excellence in Ecology, O. Kinne [Ed.], Vol. 11. Ecology Institute: Luhe, Germany.) Would it make sense for the fish and frog species in the regional pool to be present in the local community shown in the figure? Explain. Species supply is the \u201cfirst cut\u201d to community membership In Concept 18.1, we saw that the regional species pool provides an absolute upper limit on the numbers and types of species that can be present within communities (see Figure 18.6). Not surprisingly, we saw that regions of high species richness tend to have communities of high species richness (see Figure 18.7). This relationship is due to the role of the regional species pool and, more specifically, the role of dispersal in \u201csupplying\u201d species to communities (see Interactive Figure 19.4A). Nowhere is the controlling effect of dispersal on community membership more evident than in the invasion of communities by non-native species. As ecologists are beginning to learn, humans have greatly expanded the regional species pools of communities by serving as vectors of dispersal. For example, we know that many aquatic species travel to distant parts of the world, which they could not otherwise reach, in the ballast water carried by ships (FIGURE 19.5A). Seawater is pumped into and out of ballast tanks, which serve to balance and stabilize cargo-carrying ships, all over the world.", "Most of the time, the water\u2014along with the organisms it contains (from bacteria to planktonic larvae to fish)\u2014is taken up and released close to ports, where some of the organisms have the opportunity to colonize nearshore communities. An estimated 10,000 marine species are transported in the ballast water of oceangoing vessels each day. Ballast water introductions have increased substantially over the past few decades because ships are larger and faster, so more species can be taken up and more survive the trip. In 1993, Carlton and Geller listed 46 known examples of ballast water\u2013mediated invasions in the previous 20 years. One species, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), arrived in North America in the late 1980s in ballast water discharged into the Great Lakes (FIGURE 19.5B).As a nonnative, invasive species, it has had community-changing effects on inland waterways and native species. Another example of a ballast water introduction with negative ecological consequences, which we learned about in the Case Study in Chapter 11, was the release of the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi into the Black Sea. These introductions highlight the important role dispersal plays in allowing a non-native species to gain a foothold in a community and potentially cause community-wide effects. FIGURE 19.5 Humans Are Vectors for Invasive Species (A) Large and fast oceangoing ships can carry marine species to all parts of the world in their ballast water. (B) The zebra mussel, a destructive invader of the inland waterways of the United States, was carried there from Russia in ballast water. Next let\u2019s turn our attention to the role of local conditions, particularly the abiotic and biotic characteristics of communities that help determine their structure. Environmental conditions play a strong role in limiting community membership A species may be able to get to a community but fail to become a member of the community because it is physiologically unable to tolerate the environmental or abiotic conditions there (see Interactive Figure 19.4B). Such physiological constraints can be quite obvious. For example, if we return to our thought experiment of viewing a landscape from the top of a mountain, it is reasonable to assume that the abiotic attributes of the lakes we see make them good places for fishes, plankton, and aquatic insects, but not for terrestrial plants. Similarly, lakes might be good habitat for certain species of fish, plankton, and aquatic insects, but not for all of them. Some of these species depend on fast-flowing water and are thus restricted to streams. These differences among abiotic environments are obvious constraints (or requirements, depending on how you look at it) that largely determine where particular species can and cannot occur within a region. There are many examples throughout this book that demonstrate how physiological constraints can control the distributions and abundances of species\u2014see, for example, the discussions of aspen (Concept 4.1), creosote bush and saguaro cactus (Concept 9.3), and the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides (Concept 9.3). In our earlier discussion of species introductions by ballast water, it was clear that humans transport many more species than can actually survive in the new locations to which they are carried. For example, the majority of organisms released with ballast water find themselves in coastal waters that do not have the temperature, salinity, or light regimes they need to survive or grow. Luckily, many of these individuals die before they can become a threat to the native community. But ecologists know, based on examples such as the Caulerpa taxifolia invasion in the Mediterranean (see the Case Study in Chapter 16), that it is not wise to rely on physiological constraints to exclude potential invaders from a community. It may be that, with multiple introductions, particular individuals with slightly different physiological capabilities can survive and reproduce in an environment once thought uninhabitable by individuals of their species. Who interacts with whom makes all the difference in community membership Even if species can disperse to a community and cope with its potentially restrictive abiotic conditions, the final cut to community membership is coexistence with other species (see Interactive Figure 19.4C). Clearly, if a species depends on other species for its growth, reproduction, and survival, those other species must be present if it is to gain membership in a community. Equally importantly, some species may be excluded from a community by competition, predation, parasitism, or disease.", "For example, returning to our thought experiment, we might assume that lakes are suitable habitats for many fish species, but could those species all live together in one lake, given that resources are limiting? A simple view suggests that the best competitors or predators should dominate the lake, thus excluding weaker competitors and resulting in a low-diversity community. But we know that most communities are full of species that are actively interacting and coexisting. So what allows this coexistence? There are many important mechanisms that allow species to coexist, and we will spend the next two sections considering them. But first, let\u2019s ask how species might be excluded from communities by biological interactions\u2014 a question that is a bit different, but equally relevant. The invasive species literature provides some of the best tests of whether species interactions can exclude species from communities. The failure of some non-native species to become incorporated into communities has been attributed to interactions with native species that exclude, or slow the population growth of, the non-native species\u2014a phenomenon that ecologists call biotic resistance. Multiple studies in a variety of communities have shown that native herbivores have the ability to reduce the spread of non-native plants in substantial ways. Maron and Vila (2001) found that mortality of non-native plants due to native herbivores can be quite high (about 60%), especially at the seedling stage (up to 90% in some studies). But while native herbivores can kill individual non-native plants, it is still unknown how important native species are in completely excluding non-native species from a community. For example, Faithfull (1997) found that in Australia, adults and larvae of the native lucerne seed web moth (Etiella behrii) breed and feed on the seedpods of the invasive gorse shrub Ulex europaeus, but the plant still continues to spread (FIGURE 19.6). This lack of knowledge about biotic resistance may be an artifact of ecologists being more likely to study why a particular non-native species does or does not spread once it becomes a provisional member of the community than to study all the cases in which it is unable to gain a foothold because of interactions with native species. It may also be true that most failed introductions of non-native species go completely undetected. FIGURE 19.6 Stopping Gorse Invasion? Herbivory by adults and larvae of the native lucerne seed web moth (Etiella behrii) has slowed, but not stopped, an invasion of the non-native gorse shrub Ulex europaeus (the plants with yellow flowers) in Australia. CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION HOW ARE SPECIES INVASIONS ENHANCED BY CLIMATE CHANGE? There is growing evidence that climate change\u2014and, in particular, rising temperatures\u2014may facilitate the invasions of species that would be unable to survive under cooler conditions. As you might guess, climate change can play a role in mediating the ability of species to pass through the three filters described in Interactive Figure 19.4, thus potentially exacerbating the arrival, spread, impact, and management of invasive species. Hellmann et al. (2008) outline five potential consequences of climate change for invasive species (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 19.7A). The first consequence arises when climate change alters the pathways (transport and introduction) of non-native species (see Interactive Figure 19.7A, consequence 1). Such alterations could occur if climate change better links areas that are geographically separate prior to climate change. For example, Sylvia Behrens Yamada and colleagues (2005) have shown that non-native European green crabs (Carcinus maenas) (FIGURE 19.7B), introduced to San Francisco Bay from the east coast of North America, were able to colonize northern Pacific estuaries during warm El Ni years. At these times, crab larvae were transported in stronger, warmer northward-flowing coastal currents to new estuarine locations in Oregon and Washington, where they were able to survive as adults. Thus, changes in coastal currents caused by global warming could create new pathways of dispersal for other non-native species. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 19.7 The Five Consequences of Climate Change for Species Invasions (A) Consequences 1 and 2 directly affect the invasion pathway for new non-native species. Consequences 3, 4, and 5 are emergent after an invader has become established and spread, and they have management implications. Delta (\u0394) means \u201cchange in.\u201d (B) The European green crab (Carcinus maenas) has invaded estuaries along the U.S. Pacific coast. (A after J. J. Hellmann et al. 2008. Conserv Biol 22: 534\u2013543.)", "A second consequence of climate change is the alteration of environmental constraints on non-native species that allows some species to overcome physiological or biotic constraints on their persistence outside of their native range (see Interactive Figure 19.7A, consequence 2). For example, in the green crab invasion mentioned above, it was predicted that green crabs would become locally extinct in northern estuaries once El Ni subsided, because of their intolerance of cold winter ocean temperatures (they are unable to molt and reproduce at temperatures below 10\u00b0C). In fact, the researchers found that green crabs persist as invaders where they experience occasional warm winters, during which they have much greater survival, growth, and reproduction. A third consequence of climate change is the alteration of the distributions of existing invasive species (see Interactive Figure 19.7A, consequence 3). For non-native species that have gained a foothold outside of their biogeographic range, climate change could expand (or contract) their new range in dramatic ways. For example, one could imagine that with warming of estuarine water temperatures above 10\u00b0C, green crabs would not merely exist in small populations but, instead, increase their numbers through enhanced survival and reproduction. The fourth consequence of climate change occurs when the impacts of non-native species are altered (see Interactive Figure 19.7A, consequence 4). The impacts of the green crab under the climatic conditions of today are minimal. Hunt and Behrens Yamada (2003) observed very little overlap in the distribution and resource use of the green crab and the larger native red rock crab (Cancer productus). The red rock crab is dominant in the colder and more saline portions of estuaries, while the invasive green crab occurs in warmer and less saline areas. With climate change, increased temperatures or more rainfall could lead to warmer and less saline estuarine conditions, thus favoring green crabs over red rock crabs and having a greater impact on the estuarine community as a result. The fifth and final consequence of climate change is its effects on the management of non-native species (see Interactive Figure 19.7A, consequence 5). Current management, whether it involves removal of invasive species or restoration of habitats impacted by these species, will need to adapt to changing climate in ways that maintain its control and efficacy. In the green crab example, management has been minimal beyond destroying individuals found in traps. If green crabs expand in population size and range in response to climate change, however, active management may be required to keep this invasive species from becoming a pest to shellfishery and aquaculture operations. As you can see, climate change can act on invasive species in a multitude of ways that may be hard to predict. Studying invasions gives us valuable insights into how species are included or excluded from communities, but how species coexist can be complicated. In the next two sections, we will consider theories of species coexistence and ultimately species diversity. We will start by revisiting the concept of resource partitioning (also known as niche partitioning), which relies on ecological and evolutionary \u201ccompromises\u201d that result in divergence in resource use as a mechanism for coexistence (see Concept 14.3). We will then explore alternative theories and studies that consider the importance of disturbance, stress, predation, and even positive interactions to the coexistence of species and, ultimately, the species diversity of communities. Self-Assessment 19.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 19.2 Resource partitioning is theorized to reduce competition and increase species diversity. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 19.2.1 Define resource partitioning. 19.2.2 Outline observations, experiments, and models that support resource partitioning as a mechanism of species coexistence. Resource Partitioning A simple model of resource partitioning envisions each type of resource available in a community as varying along a \u201cresource spectrum.\u201d This spectrum could represent, for example, different nutrients, prey sizes, or habitat types; note that such a spectrum represents the variability of an available resource, not the amount. We can assume that the resource use of each species falls somewhere along this spectrum and overlaps with the resource uses of other species to varying degrees (FIGURE 19.8A). The assumption is that the more overlap, the more competition between species, with the extreme being complete overlap and competitive exclusion. The less overlap, the more partitioning of resources has occurred, and the less strongly the species will compete with one another. FIGURE 19.8 Resource Partitioning Species coexistence within communities may depend on how the species divide resources. (A)", "The principle of resource partitioning along a resource spectrum. (B,C) Two characteristics of communities that can result in higher species richness. (After J. Hill and R. Hill. 2001. Prog Phys Geogr 25: 326\u2013354.) Which panel shows the most resource partitioning? Which shows the least? Using this guiding theory, we can consider some of the ways in which resource partitioning might result in higher species richness in some communities than in others. First, species richness could be high in some communities because species show a high degree of partitioning along the resource spectrum (FIGURE 14.12), which may reduce competition over time. Second, species richness could be high in some communities because the resource spectrum is broad (FIGURE 19.8C). Presumably, a broader resource spectrum would make a greater diversity of resources available to be used by a wider variety of species, resulting in higher species richness. At this point, let\u2019s turn our attention away from models and take a look at some real communities to see how resource partitioning might work in practice. Early studies suggested that resource partitioning was the main mechanism of coexistence As we learned earlier from the two-species studies of Gause (1934a) on Paramecium (see Concept 14.3) and Connell (1961a,b) on barnacles (see Concept 14.2), species that compete with each other may coexist by using slightly different resources. Robert MacArthur, whose work on the equilibrium theory of island biogeography we described in Concept 18.3, played a pioneering role in understanding how this principle might be applied to whole communities, where multiple species interactions are occurring all at once. MacArthur studied warblers, small and brightly colored birds that co-occur in the forests of northern North America. The idyllic New England forests that MacArthur studied are home to an array of warbler species Setaphaga spp. (renamed from Dendroica spp.) that migrate from the tropics each spring to breed and feed on insects. Through a series of detailed natural history observations in the summers of 1956 and 1957 in Maine and Vermont, MacArthur (1958) recorded the feeding habits, nesting locations, and breeding territories of five species of warblers to find out how they might coexist in the face of very similar resource needs. MacArthur began mapping the locations of warbler activity in tree canopies and found that the warblers were using different parts of the habitat in different ways (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 19.9). For example, yellow-rumped (S. coronata) warblers fed from the middle parts of trees to the forest floor, while bay-breasted (S. castanea) and black-throated green (S. virens) warblers fed more in the middle of a tree, both inside and toward the outside of the tree canopy. Blackburnian (S. fusca) and Cape May (S. tigrina) warblers both fed on the outside tops of trees, often catching their prey in midflight. MacArthur found that the nesting heights of the five warbler species also varied, as did their use of breeding territories. Taken together, these observations supported his hypothesis that the warblers, although using the same habitat and food resources, were able to coexist by partitioning those resources in slightly different ways. MacArthur\u2019s work, which was part of his Ph.D. thesis, earned him the prestigious Mercer Award, bestowed each year for the best paper in ecology. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 19.9 Resource Partitioning by Warblers Robert MacArthur studied the habitat and food choices of five species of warblers in New England forests. He found that the warblers partition resources by feeding in different parts of the same trees. The colored shaded areas in each tree diagram represent the parts of trees where each warbler species fed most often. (After R. H. MacArthur. 1958. Ecology 39: 599\u2013 619.) MacArthur, along with his brother John MacArthur (MacArthur and MacArthur 1961), extended these ideas about resource partitioning in a study of the relationship between bird species diversity (calculated using the Shannon index; Concept 16.2) and foliage height diversity (a measure of the number of vegetation layers in a community that serves as an indication of habitat complexity, also calculated using the Shannon index). They found a positive relationship between the two in 13 tropical and temperate bird habitats from Panama to Maine (FIGURE 19.10). Interestingly, bird species diversity was not related to plant diversity per se, beyond the effects of foliage height diversity, suggesting that tree species identity was less important than the structural complexity of the habitat.", "FIGURE 19.10 Bird Species Diversity Is Higher in More Complex Habitats MacArthur and MacArthur plotted bird species diversity against foliage height diversity (a measure of habitat complexity) for 13 different communities. Both kinds of diversity were calculated for each community, using the Shannon index (H). (After R. H. MacArthur and J. W. MacArthur. 1961. Ecology 42: 594\u2013598.) Another important resource partitioning study comes from phytoplankton communities. In Concept 14.1, we learned about David Tilman and colleagues\u2019 (1981) study of two species of diatoms that competed for silica (which diatoms use to build their cell walls). When the two species were grown together in a laboratory environment with limited supplies of silica, one outcompeted and excluded the other (see Interactive Figure 14.6). How, then, do diatom species coexist in nature? Tilman (1977) proposed what has become known as the resource ratio hypothesis, which posits that species coexist by using resources in different ratios or proportions. He predicted that diatoms would be able to coexist, despite using the same set of limiting nutrients, by acquiring those nutrients in different ratios. By growing two diatom species, Cyclotella and Asterionella, in laboratory environments that differed in their ratios of silica (SiO ) to 2 phosphorus (PO ), Tilman found that Cyclotella was able to dominate only when the ratio of silica to 4 phosphorus was low (approximately 1:1). When the ratio of silica to phosphorus was high (more like 1,000:1), Asterionella outcompeted Cyclotella. Only when the ratios of silica and phosphorus were limiting to both species (in the range of 100:1 to 10:1) could they coexist. Even though both species needed the same set of nutrients, it was the way in which they partitioned those resources that allowed them to coexist. Outside of a laboratory setting, this type of partitioning would work best if resources naturally varied within the environment. What is the support for this possibility in the field? In a detailed survey, Robertson and colleagues (1988) mapped resource distribution in an abandoned agricultural field in Michigan that had been colonized by grassland plants. They found considerable variation in soil nitrogen and moisture at spatial scales of a meter or less (FIGURE 19.11). These patches of nitrogen and water resources did not necessarily correspond to topographic differences, and they were not correlated with each other. If we were to overlay the nitrogen map on the water map, we would find even smaller patches corresponding to different proportions of these two resources. Some of the best evidence of resource partitioning in plants comes from experiments that manipulate species richness and measure productivity, as we will explore in more detail in Concept 19.4. FIGURE 19.11 Resource Distribution Maps MacArthur and MacArthur plotted bird species diversity against foliage height diversity (a measure of habitat complexity) for 13 different communities. Both kinds of diversity were calculated for each community, using the Shannon index (H). (After R. H. MacArthur and J. W. MacArthur. 1961. Ecology Mapping of (A) nitrogen concentrations and (B) soil moisture in an abandoned agricultural field revealed considerable small-scale variation. (From G. P. Robertson et al. 1988. Ecology 69: 1517\u20131524.) The theory of resource partitioning relies on the assumption that species have evolved mechanisms for using resources in different, but complementary, ways, thus increasing their ability to coexist. As we learned in our discussion of species interactions in Unit 4, there are numerous other processes that can alter the outcome of species interactions and allow coexistence. In the next section, we will consider how those processes control species diversity at the local scale. Self-Assessment 19.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 19.3 Processes such as disturbance, stress, predation, and positive interactions can mediate resource availability, thus promoting species diversity. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 19.3.1 Describe the role of disturbance, stress, and predation in mediating coexistence and promoting species diversity. 19.3.2 Define and give examples of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and its variations, including those that consider predation and positive interactions. 19.3.3 Define and give examples of lottery or neutral models. Resource Mediation and Species Diversity We have seen in previous chapters that disturbance, stress, and predation can modify species interactions and allow for species coexistence. We saw that when two species are competing with each other for the same resource, as in the case of the sea palms and mussels competing for space in the rocky intertidal zone (see Concept 14.4), coexistence can be achieved if the population growth of the dominant species is disrupted.", "In that example, mussels are the dominant competitors, and sea palms can coexist with them only where the mussels are disturbed frequently enough by wave action to allow the sea palms to acquire space. In this and many other examples in this book, as long as disturbance, stress, or predation keeps the dominant competitor from reaching its own carrying capacity, competitive exclusion cannot occur, and coexistence will be maintained (FIGURE 19.12). FIGURE 19.12 The Outcome of Competition under Constant and Variable Conditions (A) Under constant conditions, species 1 (the dominant competitor) outcompetes species 2 when it reaches its own carrying capacity (K). (B) If disruptive processes such as disturbance, stress, or predation (represented by the arrows) reduce the population growth of species 1, it will not reach its carrying capacity and will not outcompete species 2, thus allowing coexistence. (After M. Huston. 1979. Am Nat 113: 81\u2013101.) We have also explored the effect of positive interactions between species in ameliorating extreme conditions and allowing coexistence. For example, we saw in the cases of salt marsh plants (Figure 17.14) and plants at high elevations (Figure 15.9) that species that might normally be unable to tolerate stressful conditions can maintain viable populations under those conditions because of the facilitative effects of other species. Let\u2019s expand these ideas about modification of species interactions to whole communities and ask how processes that mediate resources influence species diversity. Processes that mediate resources can allow species to coexist There is an old adage among ecologists that goes something like this: \u201cIf you think it\u2019s a new idea, check Darwin. He probably proposed it first.\u201d In fact, when it comes to theories that explain coexistence, Darwin was the first to formally recognize disturbance as a mechanism for the maintenance of species diversity. In The Origin of Species (1859, p. 55), he noted the following results after an impromptu experiment in which he left a meadow on his property undisturbed by mowing: \u201cOut of twenty species growing on a little plot of mown turf (three feet by four) nine species perished, from the other species being allowed to grow freely.\u201d Without mowing, the dominant competitors in the meadow community competitively excluded weedy plants and cut species richness nearly in half. Darwin used this example, along with a multitude of others, to support the argument that nature applies limits to the tendency of species to increase in abundance and outcompete other species. His hypothesis was that species struggle for existence, a necessary first piece to his theory of natural selection. In 1961, G. E. Hutchinson revived this idea in a paper titled \u201cThe Paradox of the Plankton.\u201d Hutchinson, an influential community ecologist from Yale University (and major professor to Robert MacArthur), provided one of the first mechanistic descriptions of how coexistence could be maintained under fluctuating environmental conditions. He focused on phytoplankton communities in temperate freshwater lakes (FIGURE 19.13). The simple idea behind Hutchinson\u2019s model was the seeming paradox of the presence of 30\u201340 species of phytoplankton given the relatively limited resources at their disposal. He reasoned that all of the phytoplankton compete for the same array of resources, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and trace elements, which are likely to be evenly distributed in lakes. How could so many species manage to coexist with so few resources and in such a structurally simple environment as a lake? Hutchinson hypothesized that the conditions in the lake changed seasonally and over longer periods, and that those changes kept any one species from outcompeting the others. As long as conditions in the lake changed before the competitively superior species eliminated others, coexistence would be possible. FIGURE 19.13 Paradox of the Plankton Phytoplankton from a freshwater lake. How can so many species coexist using the same set of basic resources? G. E. Hutchinson suggested that the answer is the influence of environmental variation over time. Hutchinson\u2019s model has two components that interact to control coexistence among species. One is the time required for one species to competitively exclude another species (t ), which depends on the population c growth rates of the two competing species. The second is the time it takes for environmental variation to act on the population growth of the two competing species (t ). Hutchinson predicted that when competitive e exclusion occurs more rapidly than environmental conditions can change (t << t ), coexistence cannot be ce achieved.", "One could imagine this occurring in communities where there is little environmental change or where the dominant competitor has very rapid growth rates. Conversely, in a fluctuating environment to which the competitors are adapted (where t >> t ), environmental variation does not affect the competitive ce interactions, and competitive exclusion occurs. One could imagine this pattern in environments with frequent, low-intensity environmental fluctuations and long-lived species. Hutchinson argued that it is only when the time it takes for competitive exclusion to occur is roughly equal to the time it takes for environmental variation to interrupt the competitive interaction (when t = t ) that competitive exclusion is ce thwarted and coexistence occurs. Hutchinson argued that this condition is likely to be met often in lake phytoplankton communities; otherwise, very few species, rather than tens of species, would coexist. Hutchinson proposed the idea that competitive exclusion is rare in nature, but did not test it. It was Robert Paine\u2019s work in the rocky intertidal zone of the west coast of North America in the late 1960s that provided some of the most rigorous and convincing evidence that coexistence could be maintained by disruptive processes such as predation or disturbance. Paine (1966) manipulated population densities of Pisaster, a predatory sea star that feeds preferentially on the mussel Mytilus californianus. In plots from which Pisaster was removed, species richness decreased as mussels outcompeted barnacles and other competitively inferior species. In plots where Pisaster was present, species richness was enhanced. There are several important aspects to Paine\u2019s work, including the keystone species concept and the effects of indirect interactions, but we will consider those aspects in more detail in Concept 21.4 when we discuss food webs. For now, let\u2019s concentrate on an idea that arose from the work of Darwin, Hutchinson, and Paine: the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis considers species diversity under variable conditions The intermediate disturbance hypothesis was proposed to explain how gradients in disturbance (although we can easily include stress and predation in this model) affect species diversity in communities (FIGURE 19.14). This hypothesis was first formally proposed by Joseph Connell, Paine\u2019s contemporary and an author of the classic work on barnacle competition (see Figure 14.16). Connell (1978) recognized that the level of disturbance (its frequency and intensity; see Figure 17.4) experienced by a particular community could have dramatic effects on its species diversity. He hypothesized that species diversity would be greatest at intermediate levels of disturbance and lowest at high and low levels of disturbance. Why would this be the case? At low levels of disturbance, competition would regulate species diversity because dominant species would be free to exclude competitively inferior species. At high levels of disturbance, on the other hand, species diversity would decline because many individuals would die and some species would become locally extinct as a result. At intermediate levels of disturbance, species diversity would be maximized simply by the balance between disruption of competition and mortality due to disturbance. FIGURE 19.14 The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis Species diversity is expected to be greatest at intermediate levels of disturbance, stress, or predation. (After J. H. Connell 1978. Science 199: 1302\u20131310.) The intermediate disturbance hypothesis is highly amenable to testing. One such test was carried out by Wayne Sousa (1979a), who studied succession in intertidal boulder fields in Southern California (see Figure 17.15). In a different but related study, Sousa measured the rate of disturbance of communities living on the boulders and documented their species richness (FIGURE 19.15). Small boulders were rolled over frequently by waves and thus constituted highly disturbed environments for the marine algae and invertebrate species that lived on them. The opposite was true for large boulders, which rarely experienced wave forces large enough to dislodge them. Intermediate-sized boulders, of course, were rolled over at intermediate frequencies. After 2 years, Sousa found that most of the small boulders had only one species (early successional species: the macroalga Ulva or the barnacle Chthamalus), while the greatest percentage of the large boulders had two species (late successional species: the macroalga Gigartina canaliculata and others). The greatest percentage of the intermediate-sized boulders had four species, but some had up to seven species (a mixture of early, mid-, and late successional species). Sousa\u2019s study is just one of many that have demonstrated the highest diversity at intermediate disturbance levels.", "FIGURE 19.15 A Test of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis Marine intertidal communities were surveyed on boulders that differed in the level of disturbance they experienced from being rolled over by wave action. (After W. P. Sousa. 1979a. Ecology 60: 1225\u20131239.) Which size boulder had the lowest species richness, and why? There have been several elaborations on the intermediate disturbance hypothesis The intermediate disturbance hypothesis is a simple model that relies on variation in disturbance levels to explain species diversity in communities. A handful of ecologists have used it as a foundation for adding more complexity and realism to their theories. One of the first to elaborate on the model was Michael Huston (1979), who acknowledged the effect of disturbance on competition but reasoned that a second process, competitive displacement, could be an important mediating factor. Competitive displacement occurs when the best competitor uses limiting resources that the weaker competitor requires, ultimately causing a decline in the weaker competitor\u2019s population growth to the point of extinction. Huston\u2019s dynamic equilibrium model considers how the frequency or intensity of disturbance and the rate of competitive displacement combine to determine species diversity (FIGURE 19.16). Like Hutchinson\u2019s model, Huston\u2019s model predicts maximum species diversity when the level of disturbance and the rate of competitive displacement are roughly equivalent (hence the term \u201cequilibrium\u201d in the model name). Species diversity will be highest when the frequency or intensity of disturbance and the rate of competitive displacement are both at low to intermediate levels (see Figure 19.16, point LL). Moreover, species diversity will be lowest either when disturbance is high and competitive displacement is low (point HL) or when competitive displacement is high and disturbance is low (point LH). When both processes are high and roughly similar (point HH), we expect species diversity to be relatively low because both high mortality and competitive displacement will be acting to reduce species diversity. Perhaps because of its added complexity, there have been few observational or experimental studies of the dynamic equilibrium model. One example, which comes from an observational study of riparian wetlands in Alaska by Pollock et al. (1998), can be found in WEB EXTENSION 19.1. FIGURE 19.16 The Dynamic Equilibrium Model The dynamic equilibrium model predicts that species diversity will be highest when the frequency and intensity of disturbance and the rate of competitive displacement are both low to intermediate. (After M. Huston. 1979. Am Nat 113: 81\u2013101.) Another elaboration of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis comes from Hacker and Gaines (1997), who incorporated positive interactions into their model. If we think back to Chapters 15, 16, and 17, we learned that species interactions are highly context dependent, varying in direction and strength depending on certain physical and biological factors. Theory and experiments both suggest that positive interactions should be more common under relatively high levels of disturbance, stress, or predation\u2014all circumstances in which associations among species could increase their growth and survival. Hacker and Gaines reasoned that positive interactions might be particularly important in promoting species diversity at intermediate to high levels of disturbance (or stress or predation) for two reasons (FIGURE 19.17). First, at high levels of disturbance, positive interactions should increase the survival of individuals of the interacting species through both the amelioration of harsh conditions and associational defenses. Second, at intermediate levels of disturbance, species will be released from competition and thus are more likely to engage in positive interactions, an effect that should further increase species diversity. FIGURE 19.17 Positive Interactions and Species Diversity The intermediate disturbance hypothesis has been elaborated to include positive interactions. (After S. D. Hacker and S. D. Gaines. 1997. Ecology 78: 1990\u20132003.) Hacker and Gaines used studies of a New England salt marsh to support their theory. In this community, there is a strong gradient of physical stress due to saltwater inundation. The highest stress occurs closest to the shoreline, where the tides inundate the plants most frequently. A survey of plants, insects, and spiders across the marsh revealed three distinct intertidal zones, each with a different species composition, and showed that the middle intertidal zone had a higher species richness than the high or low intertidal zones (FIGURE 19.18A). The researchers then conducted transplant experiments in which all the plant species were moved to all three zones, with or without the most abundant plant of their own zone: the tall shrub Iva frutescens in the high intertidal zone, and the rush Juncus gerardii in the middle and low intertidal zones (Bertness and Hacker 1994; Hacker and Bertness 1999).", "The results revealed that competition with Iva in the high intertidal zone led to the competitive exclusion of most plant species transplanted there, whether or not Juncus was also present. In the low intertidal zone, physiological stress was the main factor in controlling population numbers, as many individuals died whether Juncus was present or absent. In the middle intertidal zone, however, Juncus facilitated other plant species. Without Juncus, mortality was 100% for most species by the end of the summer. The mechanism of facilitation, described in Concept 16.3, was amelioration of both hypoxia and salt stress by Juncus. Additionally, as we saw in that discussion, Juncus indirectly facilitates an aphid herbivore that depends on Iva for survival (see Figures 16.12 and 16.13). It turns out that such indirect interactions affect a number of insect herbivores that feed on a variety of other plants facilitated by Juncus in the marsh. Hacker and Gaines (1997) concluded, based on these studies, that positive interactions are critically important in maintaining species diversity, especially at intermediate levels of physical stress (FIGURE 19.18B). They recognized that physical stress in the middle intertidal zone of the New England salt marsh both decreased the competitive effect of Iva and increased the facilitative effect of Juncus (and its indirect effects on insects), thus providing ideal conditions for enhanced species coexistence and diversity. FIGURE 19.18 Positive Interactions: Key to Diversity in Salt Marsh Communities? (A) Surveys of plant and arthropod species diversity in a New England salt marsh show diversity to be greatest in the middle intertidal zone. (B) Experiments suggest that the high diversity of plants and arthropods in this zone is controlled by the direct and indirect effects of the facilitating rush species Juncus gerardii as well as by a decrease in the effect of the dominant competitor, Iva frutescens, due to physical stress. (After S. D. Hacker and S. D. Gaines. 1997. Ecology 78: 1990\u20132003.) The Menge\u2013Sutherland model separates the effects of predation from those of disturbance and stress The intermediate disturbance hypothesis assumes that disturbance, stress, and predation all have similar effects on interspecific competition, and thus on species diversity (see Figure 19.14). In particular, it considers disturbance and predation to be similar processes\u2014that is, processes that act to kill or damage dominant competitors and thereby create opportunities for subordinate species. This equating of disturbance and predation ignores an important difference between them: disturbance is a physical process, whereas predation is a biological one. Menge and Sutherland (1987) have argued that because predation is a biological interaction, it is independently affected by physical disturbance and stress and thus should be considered separately. The Menge\u2013Sutherland model predicts that predation should be relatively important in maintaining species richness at low levels of stress (or disturbance), at which predators can most easily feed on, and thus limit the abundance of, competitively dominant species (FIGURE 19.19). As stress increases, the effect of predation decreases as predators become less able to inflict damage on their prey at lower trophic levels. These prey, which are predicted by the model to be more tolerant of physical stress or disturbance, are more likely to compete for resources, especially at intermediate levels of stress or disturbance. But as environmental stress increases to high levels, both predation and competition become less important as more and more species are excluded from the community by their physiological limitations. As with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, the influences of positive interactions, which are especially important at either extreme of predation or physical stress, have since been incorporated into the Menge\u2013Sutherland model (Bruno et al. 2003), leading to conclusions similar to those of Hacker and Gaines (1997) (see Figure 19.17). FIGURE 19.19 The Menge\u2013Sutherland Model Menge and Sutherland\u2019s model of influences on community diversity is similar to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (see Figure 19.14), but it accounts for the effect of predation separately from that of stress or disturbance. (After B. A. Menge and J. P. Sutherland. 1987. Am Nat 130: 730\u2013757.) Another important factor that Menge and Sutherland considered in their model was the influence of a particular kind of dispersal known as recruitment, defined as the addition of young individuals to a population. They predicted that if recruitment was low, competition might not be particularly important in determining species diversity, because resources would be less likely to be limiting. Instead, the interplay between predation under benign environmental conditions and physical stress under extreme conditions would be the most influential factor regulating community membership.", "If recruitment increased, however, the role of competition would also increase, ultimately resulting in predictions similar to those in Figure 19.19. Thus, Menge and Sutherland suggest that dispersal (in the form of recruitment) can be another important influence on species diversity and species composition, as shown in Interactive Figure 19.4 and demonstrated in ANALYZING DATA 19.1. ANALYZING DATA 19.1 A prominent theme in this chapter is that processes such as disturbance, stress, and predation can mediate resource availability, thus promoting species coexistence and species diversity. Another important theme in this and the previous chapter is that regional species pools and the dispersal abilities of species can play important roles in supplying new species to communities. What happens when we combine these concepts in an attempt to explain the factors important to species coexistence within local communities? That was the goal of research on zooplankton communities conducted by Jonathan Shurin (2001),* who explored the effects of predation and dispersal on the species diversity of local zooplankton communities. He used experimental ponds made from plastic cattle watering tanks, which he stocked with a diversity of local zooplankton to create individual zooplankton communities. Next, he imposed one of four predation treatments on each pond: (1) no predators, (2) fish predators only (juvenile bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus), (3) insect predators only (the backswimmer bug Notonecta undulata), and (4) both fish and insect predators. Finally, Shurin applied a second type of treatment: either the ponds received dispersers of a large number of zooplankton species from the regional pool (which Shurin repeatedly added to the ponds at low densities throughout the experiment), or they received no dispersers. The experiment ran over a summer, after which time Shurin counted the number of zooplankton species in each of the pond communities. His results are shown in the graph. 1. How did predation alone affect the species richness of zooplankton within the ponds? Give a plausible explanation for why this occurred. Did fish and insect predators have different effects on local species richness? 2. How does species richness change with the addition of zooplankton dispersal into the ponds? Without knowing anything about the species composition of the ponds, can you say what these results suggest about the dual effects of predation and dispersal on local species richness? 3. Suppose an additional treatment, that of doubling the number of predators, was added to this experiment. Suppose the results showed a decline in zooplankton richness (let\u2019s say six species without dispersal and ten species with dispersal). What would these results suggest about the role of dispersal in pond communities subjected to heavy predation? Considering the entire range of predation intensity, from none to intermediate to heavy, do the results fit the intermediate disturbance hypothesis? Why or why not? See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. *Shurin, J. B. 2001. Interactive effects of predation and dispersal of zooplankton communities. Ecology 82: 3404\u20133416. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis and the Menge\u2013Sutherland model assume that there is an underlying competitive hierarchy among species\u2014that is, that some species are much stronger competitors than others and thus dominate communities if they are not kept in check by disruptive processes. What happens if we assume that there is no competitive hierarchy among species? If species have equivalent effects on one another, then the ability of any one species to live in a community will depend more on chance than on \u201cconflict resolution.\u201d Let\u2019s spend a moment discussing this alternative theory of species diversity. Lottery and neutral models rely on equality and chance A final group of models proposed to explain species coexistence are so-called lottery models and neutral models (Sale 1977; Chesson and Warner 1981; Hubbell 2001). As their names suggest, these models emphasize the role of chance in the maintenance of species diversity. Lottery and neutral models assume that resources in a community made available by the effects of disturbance, stress, or predation are captured at random by recruits from a larger pool of potential colonists. For this mechanism to work, species must have fairly similar interaction strengths and population growth rates, and they must have the ability to respond quickly, by dispersing, to disturbances that free up resources. If there is a large disparity in competitive abilities among species, the dominant competitor will have a greater chance of obtaining resources and eventually monopolizing them. In lottery and neutral models, it is the equal chance of all species to obtain resources that allows species coexistence.", "Lottery and neutral models have most often been applied to highly diverse communities. Peter Sale (1977, 1979) conducted one of the earliest and best-known tests of the lottery model on fishes of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. Fish species diversity on this reef ranges from 1,500 species in the north to 900 species in the south. On any one small patch of reef (about 3 m, or 10 feet, in diameter), up to 75 species might be recorded. In the reef ecosystem, there is strong habitat fidelity and severe space limitation, and many individual fish spend their entire adult lives in roughly the same spot on the reef. Given these conditions, Sale asked the obvious question: How could so many species coexist in such a small space for so long? Sale reasoned that only a portion of the coexistence among these fishes could be explained by resource partitioning, because the species tended to have very similar diets. He noted that vacant sites or territories were highly desirable and were made available rather unpredictably by the deaths of individual occupants (due, for example, to predation, disturbance, starvation, or disease). To look at this system in more detail, Sale observed losses of occupants and recruitment to newly vacated sites among three species of territorial pomacentrid fishes (Eupomacentrus apicalis, Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus, and Pomacentrus wardi). He found the pattern of occupation to be random (FIGURE 19.20)\u2014the identity of the species that had previously occupied a site had no bearing on which species was recruited to that site when it became vacant. One species, P. wardi, both lost and occupied sites at a greater rate than the other two species, but this had no effect on its overall ability to coexist with the other two species. Sale noted that one important component of this lottery system is that fishes produce many, highly mobile juveniles that can saturate a reef and take advantage of open space made available (as described for clownfish in Chapter 7\u2019s Connections in Nature). As Sale put it, \u201cThe species of a guild are competing in a lottery for living space in which larvae are tickets and the first arrival at a vacant site wins that site\u201d (Sale 1977, p. 351). FIGURE 19.20 A Test of the Lottery Model Peter Sale tested the lottery model using coral reef fishes living on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. By counting the individuals of three fish species (Eupomacentrus apicalis, Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus, and Pomacentrus wardi) that occupied vacated sites, he found that the species of the new occupant was random and unrelated to the species that had previously occupied the site. The drawings represent the original occupants of vacated sites, and the colored arrows pointing to each drawing show the number of individuals of each species that took over those sites when they became vacant. (Data from P. F. Sale. 1979. Oecologia 42: 159\u2013177.) The role of chance in maintaining species diversity, especially in unpredictable environments, has intuitive appeal. As long as species win the lottery every once in a while, they will continue to reproduce (i.e., buy more tickets) and be able to enter the lottery once again. It is easy to see how this mechanism might be particularly relevant in highly diverse communities such as tropical rainforests and grasslands, where so many species overlap in their resource requirements. Its relevance decreases, however, in communities where species have large disparities in interaction strength. In those communities, it appears that the \u201cgreat equalizers\u201d are processes that decrease competitive exclusion, such as disturbance, stress, or predation, or increase inclusion, such as positive interactions. Ecologists are a long way from agreeing on any one theory to explain why certain species end up coexisting in space and time. Instead, they continue to strive for generalities while recognizing that the relative importance of different mechanisms of species diversity may depend on the characteristics of the community in question. Up to this point in the chapter, we have focused on the causes of species diversity at the community level. We have asked, Why and how does species diversity differ among communities? In the next section, we will shift gears and instead ask what might be considered the flip side of that question. We want to know, given the variation in species diversity among communities (and the current losses of species diversity due to human activities), whether species diversity matters. In other words, what do species do in communities? Does species diversity have functional significance? Self-Assessment 19.3", "[Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 19.4 Many experiments show that species diversity affects community function. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 19.4.1 Describe the relationships between species diversity and ecosystem functions from observations and experiments. 19.4.2 Compare the hypotheses given to explain species diversity and ecosystem function relationships. The Consequences of Diversity In the Case Study at the opening of this chapter, we saw reduced hantavirus prevalence in small-mammal communities with higher species diversity compared with those with lower species diversity (see Figure 19.2). These results support the notion that species diversity can control certain ecological functions of a community. These community functions, or processes that control community structure, are numerous and include not only disease suppression, but also plant productivity, water quality and availability, atmospheric gas exchange, and even resistance to disturbance (and recovery afterward). Many of these functions of communities provide valuable ecosystem services to humans, such as food and fuel production, water purification, O2 and CO2 exchange, and protection from catastrophic events such as floods or tsunamis (see Concept 23.1). The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), a synthesis of studies produced under the auspices of the United Nations, details the importance of these ecosystem services to humans. The assessment predicts that if the current losses of species diversity continue, the world\u2019s human populations will be severely affected by the loss of the services those species, and the communities in which they live, provide. What evidence underlies these dire predictions? Recent research has attempted to look at the connections between species diversity and community function, not only to seek basic insights into community ecology, but also because of concerns over species losses and the services that may be affected as a result. Some relationships between species diversity and community function are positive The consequences of species diversity to communities were first proposed by both Robert MacArthur (1955) and Charles Elton (1958), who theorized that species richness should be positively related to community stability. A community is thought to have stability when it remains, or returns, to its original structure and function after some perturbation (see Concept 17.4). The diversity\u2013stability theory remained \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d until the mid-1970s, when it was tested mathematically using food web models that varied in species richness and complexity. We will consider those models in more detail in Concept 21.4. But it was not until 40 years later that the theory was first tested experimentally. David Tilman and colleagues used a set of experimental plots on abandoned agricultural land at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, to explore the relationship between plant species richness and measures of community function (FIGURE 19.21A). In the first study, Tilman and Downing (1994) noticed that some of their experimental plots at Cedar Creek seemed to be responding to a drought differently from others. A survey of their plots showed that plots with higher species richness were better able to withstand the drought than plots with lower species richness (but the same density of plants) (FIGURE 19.21B). Drought-induced total plant biomass decrease was less in species-rich plots than in species-poor ones, resulting in a positive, curvilinear relationship between species richness and drought resistance (measured as the difference between biomass before and after the drought). Tilman and Downing reasoned that a curvilinear relationship would be expected if additional species beyond some threshold (the point at which the curve levels off; roughly 10\u201312 species in this study) had little additional effect on drought resistance. These species could be considered redundant in the sense that they had essentially the same effects on drought resistance as other species. Tilman and Downing suggested, however, that once the number of species in a plot declined below that threshold, each additional species lost from the plot would result in a progressively greater negative effect of drought on the community. FIGURE 19.21 Species Diversity and Community Function (A) Tilman and colleagues used their prairie plots at the Cedar Creek site in Minnesota to test the effects of species richness on community function. (B) First, they measured the effects of a drought on plant biomass in plots that varied in species richness. (C) They then created plots that varied in species richness, though all had the same density of individual plants, and measured biomass in those plots after 2 years of growth. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (B after D. Tilman and J. A. Downing. 1994. Nature 367: 363\u2013365; C after D. Tilman et al. 1996. Nature 379: 718\u2013720.)", "To test this idea more rigorously, Tilman et al. (1996) conducted a well-replicated experiment in which species diversity was directly manipulated. In the same prairie ecosystem, a series of plots that differed in plant species richness, but not in the number of individual plants, was created by randomly selecting sets of species from a pool of 24 species. Each plot was provided with the same amounts of water and nutrients. When biomass in the plots was measured after 2 years of growth, the results confirmed the curvilinear effect of species richness on biomass (FIGURE 19.21C) and additionally showed that nitrogen was more efficiently used as species richness increased. There is debate over diversity\u2013function relationships and their explanations Although experiments documenting the relationships between species diversity and community function continue to increase in their sophistication, ecologists have debated over the generality of the relationships and their underlying mechanisms. Naeem and colleagues (1995) summarized at least three possible relationships between species diversity and community function and their corresponding hypotheses. Two variables distinguish these hypotheses: the degree of overlap in the ecological functions of species, and variation in the strength of the ecological functions of species. The first hypothesis, known as the complementarity hypothesis, proposes that as species richness increases, there will be a linear increase in community function (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 19.22A). In this case, each species added to the community will have a unique and equally incremental effect on community function. We might expect this type of pattern if we assume that species are equally partitioning their functions within a community. For example, as more and more species are added to the community, each of their unique individual functions will accumulate and increase the overall community function. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 19.22 Hypotheses on Species Richness and Community Function At least three possible relationships between species diversity and community function and their corresponding hypotheses have been proposed. Two variables distinguish these hypotheses: the degree of overlap in the ecological functions of species, and variation in the strength of the ecological functions of species. (After G. Peterson et al. 1998. Ecosystems 1: 6\u20138.) The second hypothesis, known as the redundancy hypothesis, relies on assumptions similar to those of the complementarity hypothesis, but it places an upper limit on the effect of species richness on community function (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 19.22B). This model best fits the results of Tilman and colleagues described above (see Figure 19.21), in which the functional contribution of additional species reaches a threshold. This threshold is reached because as more species are added to the community, there is overlap in their function\u2014essentially, there is redundancy among species. In this model, species can be thought of as belonging to certain functional groups (see Figure 16.4C). As long as all the important functional groups are represented, the actual species composition of the community is of little importance to its overall function. The third hypothesis, known as the idiosyncratic hypothesis, proposes that the ecological functions of some species have stronger effects than others do and that they vary dramatically (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 19.22C). Some species have a large effect on community function, while other species have a minimal effect. The addition of dominant species to a community will therefore have a large effect on community function, producing a curve with an idiosyncratic shape, as shown in Interactive Figure 19.22C. If communities are assembled in such a way that there are only a few dominant species (e.g., keystone or foundation species; see Figure 16.16), then one would expect community function values to vary dramatically with species richness\u2014that is, there would be peaks and valleys in community function values, depending on whether the dominant species are present or not. As species richness increases, however, the chance that the dominant species will be present also increases. As a result, the variation in community function values should eventually stabilize. Although these models provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how species contribute to community function, testing them is logically challenging because of the number of species involved and the variety of community functions that could be considered. In many ways, these models and tests are at the heart of modern community ecology, not only because they tell us something about how communities work, but also because they may be able to tell us what the future holds for communities that are both losing (by extinction) and gaining (by invasions) species through human influence. Self-Assessment 19.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.]", "A CASE STUDY REVISITED Can Species Diversity Suppress Human Diseases? The potential value of understanding how species diversity controls community function is limitless when we consider the services communities provide to humans. As we have seen, these services are numerous and diverse. One potential service that has been overlooked until recently is the role species diversity plays in infectious disease emergence and transmission. As we saw in the Case Study at the opening of this chapter, Suz\u00e0n and colleagues (2009) showed that plots with reduced small-mammal diversity increased in both host rodent species abundance and the number of SNV-infected rodent individuals (see Figure 19.2). How can species diversity have this effect on disease transmission? Several hypotheses have been proposed. First, if the species that are lost within the community compete with or prey on the host species, then their loss can lead to an increase in the population density of the host and the pathogen. Second, it might be that hosts in more species-diverse situations are simply more likely to come into contact with individuals of other species than their own species (conspecifics), reducing the probability of transmission. Finally, it may be that more diverse communities allow hosts to build up greater resistance to diseases because those hosts are exposed to similar pathogens in other species within the community. The research to date on the effects of species diversity on hantavirus transmission best supports the first two hypotheses. In the case of the experimental plots in Panama, the data support the first hypothesis; there was an increase in the number of rodent individuals that led to an increase in the number of SNV-infected hosts (see Figure 19.2). Presumably, as the number of small-mammal competitors declined, the rodent host species were able to take advantage of greater resources and their numbers increased. More host individuals then lead to greater hantavirus disease transmission. However, the results from the observational studies in Utah and Oregon showed a different pattern that more closely supports the second hypothesis. In those studies, the lower small-mammal diversity increased infection prevalence by simply increasing the encounter rate, rather than density, of individuals of the same host species. Disentangling the effect of higher density from the effect of reduced species diversity can be difficult. One study, using the trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni and its snail host, manipulated species richness while keeping density constant (Johnson et al. 2009). The researchers showed that the presence of other snail species reduced parasite transmission even when the density of the host remained constant. In this case, the multispecies treatments reduced the encounter rate of the snail host with its trematode parasite by providing alternative but suboptimal host species. Other studies have shown that which species are lost within a community can make a difference in disease transmission, supporting principles of the idiosyncratic hypothesis (see Interactive Figure 19.22C). It is clear that the number of examples of species diversity loss and disease transmission is increasing, but the generalities that can be drawn from these examples are still unfolding. By applying basic principles of ecology to zoonotic disease transmission, we can see that we cannot underestimate the role of species diversity in regulating community integrity. We must consider what might seem like inconsequential and esoteric details, such as the number of species that coexist within communities. In this case, species richness makes all the difference, not only in protecting humans from disease transmission, but also in thwarting emerging and potentially dangerous diseases in the future. CONNECTIONS in NATURE MANAGING PATHOGENS BY MANAGING BIODIVERSITY As more evidence accumulates that changes in biodiversity can trigger infectious diseases, there is interest in managing for these outbreaks. Management can come in many forms depending on the pathogen in question. Beyond the obvious recommendation that genetic and species diversity be maintained within ecosystems, there are other management suggestions that can help provide early warning signs or reduce the risk of emerging pathogens altogether. First, it is critical to survey potential \u201cemergence hot spots\u201d where land use changes and agricultural intensification reduce diversity and have the potential to trigger endemic wildlife pathogens, potentially causing them to jump to new host species, including livestock and humans. In fact, research shows that almost half of the zoonotic diseases that have emerged since 1940 have occurred in regions where major changes in land use, agriculture, or wildlife hunting practices have occurred (Jones et al. 2008).", "Second, the research also suggests that another 20% of diseases emerging since the 1940s have arisen through the widespread use of antibiotics and the production of resistant strains of microbes. Antibiotics are thought to select for resistant microbes by both eliminating the diversity of nonresistant microbial strains and by eliminating species that suppress those strains. The observation that a more diverse microbiome can suppress strains that are resistant to antibiotics suggests that avoiding the overuse of these pharmaceuticals in medicine and agriculture is critical in preventing emerging diseases. Finally, managing emerging diseases will involve considering the complex ways that factors such as climate change, invasive species, and pollution interact with biodiversity loss to increase the emergence and transmission of diseases. Despite the many questions that remain, it is clear that managing for biodiversity is a critical component in protecting human populations from potential disease epidemics. Unit 6 Production KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 20.1 Energy in ecosystems originates with primary production by autotrophs. CONCEPT 20.2 Net primary production is constrained by both physical and biotic environmental factors. CONCEPT 20.3 Global patterns of net primary production reflect climate constraints and biome types. CONCEPT 20.4 Secondary production is generated through the consumption of organic matter by heterotrophs. Life in the Deep Blue Sea, How Can It Be? A Case Study Ecologists once considered the deep sea to be the marine equivalent of a desert. The physical environment at depths between 1,500 and 4,000 m (5,000\u201313,000 feet) did not seem conducive to life as we knew it. It is completely dark, so photosynthesis is not possible. The water pressure reaches values 300 times greater than those at the surface of the ocean, similar to the pressure used to crush cars at a junkyard. Organisms living on the floor of the deep sea were thought to obtain energy exclusively from the sparse rain of dead material falling from the upper layers of the ocean where sunlight is sufficient for phytoplankton to carry out photosynthesis. Most of the known deep-sea organisms were detritus feeders such as echinoderms (e.g., sea stars), mollusks, crustaceans, and polychaete worms. Our view of deep-sea life was changed dramatically in 1977, when an expedition led by Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution used the submersible craft Alvin to dive to a mid-ocean ridge near the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago (FIGURE 20.1). The team aboard the Alvin was in search of the deep-sea hot springs thought to occur along mid-ocean ridges. These ridges lie at the junctions of tectonic plates, where the seafloor spreads as the plates are pushed apart by molten rock rising from Earth\u2019s mantle (see Figure 18.10). Because mid-ocean ridges are volcanically active, geologists and oceanographers had hypothesized that seawater seeping into cracks in the ocean floor near the ridges would be superheated by pockets of magma, chemically transformed, and ejected as hot springs. These hot springs were considered potential sources of chemicals for the ocean system as well as sources of heat. Despite their hypothesized existence, no such hot springs had ever been located. FIGURE 20.1 Black Smoker Vent A hydrothermal vent emits super-heated water as hot as 400\u00b0C, rich in iron sulfide, known as a \u201cblack smoker.\u201d Despite the high temperature and toxic nature of the water, abundant life surrounds these features. Ballard\u2019s group did indeed find hot springs, known as hydrothermal vents. However, this geochemical finding paled in comparison with their biological discovery: the areas around the hydrothermal vents were teeming with life. Dense assemblages of tube worms (e.g., Riftia spp.), giant clams (e.g., Calyptogena spp.), shrimps, crabs, and polychaete worms were found in the areas surrounding the vents (FIGURE 20.2). The density of organisms was unprecedented for the deep, dark seafloor. FIGURE 20.2 Life around a Hydrothermal Vent Mussels in the genus Bathymodiolus are scattered near a hydrothermal vent, with several crabs lacking pigmentation in their carapaces. The discovery of these diverse and productive hydrothermal vent communities posed an immediate question: How did the organisms obtain the energy needed to sustain themselves in such abundance? The rate at which dead organisms from the upper zones of the ocean accumulate on the seafloor is very low (0.05\u20130.1 mm/year). The newly formed areas of seafloor where the vents are located are only decades old, and thus the amount of organic material that would have accumulated should not be enough to sustain these high densities of organisms. Photosynthesis in the surface waters therefore did not appear to be the energy source supporting these hydrothermal vent communities.", "The water being emitted from the hydrothermal vents also constitutes a problem for life: its chemical composition is toxic to most organisms. The water emitted by the vents is rich in poisonous sulfides as well as heavy metals such as lead, cobalt, zinc, copper, and silver. Hydrothermal vent communities thus pose two mysteries: First, what is the source of energy that sustains them, and second, how do the organisms tolerate the high concentrations of potentially toxic sulfides in the water? As we shall see, the answers to these two questions are intimately related. Introduction In 1942, the journal Ecology published a controversial paper by Raymond Lindeman, describing the nature of energy flow in aquatic ecosystems. Lindeman had studied the energy relationships among the organisms and nonliving components in lakes in Minnesota. Rather than grouping its component plants, animals, and bacteria according to their taxonomic categories, Lindeman grouped them into categories based primarily on how they obtained their energy (FIGURE 20.3). His views on the importance of the energy base of the system\u2014an \u201cooze\u201d of particulate and dissolved dead organic matter\u2014and on the efficiency of energy transfer among the system\u2019s biological components were groundbreaking. Lindeman\u2019s treatment of energy flow in the lake was considered too theoretical at the time, and his paper was initially rejected. The publishers later reconsidered after Lindeman\u2019s mentor, the prominent limnologist G. E. Hutchinson, advocated its acceptance. Lindeman\u2019s paper was among the first in the area of ecosystem science, and it is now considered a fundamental paper in the discipline. FIGURE 20.3 Energy Flow in a Lake Raymond Lindeman\u2019s diagram describes the movement of energy among groups of organisms at Cedar Bog Lake, Minnesota. Note the general functional categories of organisms Lindeman used, as well as the central position of \u201cooze\u201d (organic matter) in the diagram. The subscripts next to the uppercase Greek lambdas represent trophic levels. (From R. L. Lindeman. 1942. Ecology 23: 399\u2013418.) The term ecosystem was coined by A. G. Tansley, a plant ecologist, to refer to all of the components of an ecological system, biotic and abiotic, that influence the flow of energy and elements (Tansley 1935). The \u201celements\u201d considered in ecosystem studies are primarily nutrients, but they also include pollutants; the movements of those elements through ecosystems are the topic of Chapter 22. The ecosystem concept is now well established and has become a powerful tool for integrating ecology with other disciplines such as geochemistry, hydrology, and atmospheric science. In Chapter 5, we described the physiological basis for the capture of energy through photosynthesis and chemosynthesis by autotrophs, and we explained how heterotrophs obtain that energy by consuming autotrophs. In this chapter, we return to the topic of energy as we explore how energy enters ecosystems, how it is measured, and what controls rates of energy flow through ecosystems. CONCEPT 20.1 Energy in ecosystems originates with primary production by autotrophs. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 20.1.1 Explain how variation in the leaf area index influences gross primary production through both carbon gains and losses. 20.1.2 Describe the relationship between gross primary production and net primary production and how this relationship can change during succession. 20.1.3 Summarize why it is important to measure net primary production and describe some of the ways ecologists measure net primary production at large spatial scales. 20.1.4 Illustrate how the relationship between net primary production and net ecosystem exchange is influenced by the mass of autotrophs versus the mass of heterotrophs. Primary Production The generation of chemical energy by autotrophs, known as primary production, is derived from the uptake of carbon during photosynthesis and chemosynthesis (see Chapter 5). Chemosynthesis can be the main source of energy in some rare circumstances, as we will see at the end of this chapter. However, the majority of energy on Earth comes from photosynthesis, and thus primary production derived from photosynthesis will be the focus of this section. Primary production represents an important energy transition: the conversion of light energy from the sun into chemical energy that can be used by autotrophs and consumed by heterotrophs. Primary production is the source of energy for all organisms, from bacteria to humans; even the fossil fuels we use today are derived from primary production. Primary production also accounts for the largest movement of carbon dioxide between Earth and the atmosphere, and it is therefore an important influence on global climate through its effect on greenhouse gas concentrations (see Chapters 2 and 25).", "The energy assimilated by autotrophs is stored as carbon compounds in plant and phytoplankton tissues; therefore, carbon (C) is the currency used for the measurement of primary production. The rate of primary production is sometimes referred to as primary productivity. Gross primary production is total ecosystem photosynthesis The amount of carbon taken up by the autotrophs in an ecosystem is called gross primary production (GPP). The GPP in most terrestrial ecosystems is equivalent to the total of all plant photosynthesis. The GPP of an ecosystem is controlled by climate through its influence on rates of photosynthesis, as we saw in Concepts 5.2, and by the leaf area of the plants, expressed as the leaf area index, the amount of leaf area over an area of ground. The leaf area index varies among biomes, from less than 0.1 in tundra (i.e., less than 10% of the ground surface has leaf cover) to 12 in boreal and tropical forests (i.e., on average, there are 12 layers of leaves between the canopy and the ground). Shading of the leaves below the uppermost layer increases with the addition of each new leaf layer, so the incremental gain in photosynthesis for each added leaf layer decreases (FIGURE 20.4). Eventually, the respiratory costs associated with building and maintaining additional leaf layers outweigh the photosynthetic benefits. Plants generally match their leaf area index to the climate conditions and the supplies of resources, particularly water and nutrients, in order to maximize carbon gain. FIGURE 20.4 Diminishing Returns for Added Leaf Layers Rates of photosynthesis (expressed here as CO2 uptake) for a tropical rainforest increase as the number of leaf layers, or leaf area index, increases, but the increase is smaller with each additional leaf layer. (After W. Larcher. 1980. Physiological Plant Ecology. Springer: New York; based on L. H. Allen and E. R. Lemon. 1976. In Vegetation and the Atmosphere, Vol. 2, J. L. Monteith [Ed.], pp. 265\u2013308. Academic Press: London.) A plant uses approximately half of the carbon it fixes by photosynthesis in cellular respiration to support biosynthesis and cellular maintenance. All living plant tissues lose carbon via respiration, but not all of them acquire carbon via photosynthesis. Thus, plants that have a large proportion of nonphotosynthetic stem tissue, such as trees and shrubs, tend to have higher overall respiratory carbon losses than herbaceous plants. Plant respiration rates increase with increasing temperatures, and as a result, respiratory carbon losses are higher in tropical forests than in temperate and boreal forests. Net primary production is the energy remaining after respiratory losses Not all of the carbon taken up in photosynthesis is available for growth and other functions in plants. As noted above, some carbon is lost in respiration. Carbon not used in respiration is available for growth and reproduction, storage, and defense against herbivory. The carbon available for these functions is determined by the balance between GPP and autotrophic respiration, and is called net primary production (NPP): The NPP of a terrestrial ecosystem is the amount of energy captured by autotrophs that results in an increase in living plant matter, or biomass. NPP is the energy left over for plant growth, plant reproduction, defense, and consumption by herbivores and detritivores. It also represents the total net input of carbon into ecosystems. Plants respond to varying environmental conditions by allocating carbon to the growth of different tissues. The allocation of carbon within a plant varies considerably according to the species, the availability of resources, and the climate. Allocation of carbon to photosynthetic tissues is an investment in potential future NPP, but the demands of the plant for other resources, particularly water and nutrients, as well as biological interactions such as herbivory, influence whether that investment pays off. A plant\u2019s allocation of NPP to the growth of leaves, stems, and roots is generally balanced so as to maintain supplies of water, nutrients, and carbon to match the plant\u2019s requirements. For example, plants growing in desert, grassland, and tundra ecosystems are regularly exposed to shortages of water or nutrients. Plants in these ecosystems may allocate a greater proportion of NPP to root growth, relative to the growth of shoots (leaves and stems), than plants growing in ecosystems with higher soil water and nutrient availability (FIGURE 20.5). This greater allocation to root growth facilitates their acquisition of the resources that are in short supply.", "In contrast, plants growing in dense communities, with neighbors that may shade them, may allocate NPP preferentially to stems and leaves in order to capture more sunlight for photosynthesis. In other words, plants tend to allocate the most NPP to those tissues that acquire the resources that limit their growth. FIGURE 20.5 Allocation of NPP to Roots The proportion of NPP that plants allocate to roots varies with the resources available to them. (After B. Saugier et al. 2001. In Terrestrial Global Productivity, J. Roy, B. Saugier, and H. A. Mooney [Eds.], pp. 543\u2013557. Academic Press: San Diego, CA.) In addition to low supplies of resources in the soil, what other factors might favor greater allocation of NPP to tissues below the soil surface? Allocation of NPP to storage compounds such as starch and carbohydrates provides insurance to compensate for losses of tissues to herbivores, disturbances such as fire, and weather events such as frost. These compounds are usually stored in the stems of woody plants or in belowground stems and roots of herbaceous plants. Where levels of herbivory are high, plants may allocate a substantial amount of NPP (up to 20%) to defensive secondary compounds, such as tannins or terpenes, that inhibit grazing. NPP changes during ecosystem development As ecosystems develop during primary or secondary succession (see Concepts 17.2), NPP changes as the abundance of plants and associated leaf area index, the ratio of photosynthetic to nonphotosynthetic tissue, and plant species composition all change. Disturbance and succession can therefore influence gains or losses of CO2 from ecosystems, thereby affecting atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Most ecosystems have their highest NPP at mid- successional stages. Several factors contribute to this pattern, including the tendency for the proportion of photosynthetic tissues, plant diversity, and nutrient supply to be highest at mid-successional stages. In forest ecosystems, the leaf area index and the photosynthetic rates of leaves decrease in old-growth stands, lowering GPP and thus NPP. In some grasslands, such as the tallgrass prairies of the central United States, the accumulation of dead leaves near the ground surface and the development of a closed upper canopy of leaves decrease light availability to short plants, lowering the photosynthetic carbon gain of the ecosystem. However, the decrease in NPP over time is far less pronounced in grasslands than in forest ecosystems. Although NPP may decrease in late successional stages, lowering the uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere, these old-growth ecosystems contain large pools of stored carbon and nutrients and provide habitat for late successional animal species. NPP can be estimated by a number of methods There are several reasons why it is important to be able to measure NPP in an ecosystem. As we have seen, NPP is the ultimate source of energy for all organisms in an ecosystem and thus determines the amount of energy available to support that ecosystem. It varies tremendously over space and time. Year-to-year variation in NPP provides a metric for examining ecosystem health, because changes in primary productivity can be symptomatic of stresses such as drought or acid rain. Finally, as noted earlier, NPP is intimately associated with the global carbon cycle, and it is therefore an important influence on global climate change (see Chapters 2 and 25). For all these reasons, scientists have put great effort into improving techniques for estimating NPP over the past 3 decades. TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS Methods for estimating NPP in forest and grassland ecosystems are the best developed because of the economic importance of these ecosystems for wood and forage production. Traditional techniques include measuring the increase in plant biomass during the growing season by harvesting plant tissues in experimental plots. In forests, the radial growth of wood must be included in estimates of NPP. In the tropics, plants may continue to grow throughout the year, and tissues that die decompose rapidly, making the use of harvest techniques problematic. Despite these shortcomings, harvest techniques still provide reasonable estimates of aboveground NPP, particularly if corrections are made for tissue loss to herbivory and mortality. Measuring the allocation of NPP to growth belowground is more difficult because root growth is more dynamic than the growth of leaves and stems, and the soil makes it difficult to observe this dynamic growth pattern. The proportion of NPP in roots exceeds that in aboveground tissues in some ecosystems: in grassland ecosystems, for example, root growth may be twice that of aboveground leaves, stems, and flowers combined.", "The finest roots turn over more quickly than shoots; that is, more roots are \u201cborn\u201d and die during the growing season than stems and leaves. In addition, roots may exude a large amount of carbon into the soil, and they may transfer carbon to mycorrhizal or bacterial symbionts. Therefore, harvests for measuring root biomass must be more frequent, and additional correction factors must be used when estimating belowground NPP. Proportional relationships correlating aboveground to belowground NPP have been developed for some forest and grassland ecosystems so that measurements of aboveground NPP can be used to estimate whole-ecosystem NPP. The use of minirhizotrons, underground viewing tubes outfitted with video cameras, has led to advances in the understanding of belowground production processes (FIGURE 20.6). FIGURE 20.6 A Tool for Viewing Belowground Dynamic (A) Minirhizotrons allow researchers to observe the dynamics of root growth and death belowground. (B) A view of roots from a minirhizotron tube installed in a bog ecosystem in northern Minnesota (www.mnspruce.ornl.gov). Small-diameter roots from ericaceous shrubs can be seen in the foreground against a background of decomposing Sphagnum mosses and peat. The labor-intensive and destructive nature of harvest techniques makes them impractical for estimating NPP over large areas or in biologically diverse ecosystems. Several nondestructive techniques have been developed that allow more frequent estimation of NPP over much larger spatial scales, although with lower precision than harvest techniques. Some of these techniques, which include remote sensing and frequent atmospheric CO2 measurements, provide a quantitative index rather than an absolute measure of NPP. Some techniques use a combination of data collection and modeling of plant physiological and climate processes to estimate the actual fluxes of carbon associated with NPP. The concentration of the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll in a plant canopy provides a proxy for photosynthetic biomass that can be used to estimate GPP and NPP. Chlorophyll concentrations can be estimated using remote sensing techniques that rely on the reflection of solar radiation (ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 20.1). Remote sensing allows NPP to be measured frequently, at spatial scales up to the entire globe, using satellite-based sensors (FIGURE 20.7). Indicators of NPP that are based on chlorophyll concentrations can overestimate NPP if the vegetation is not physiologically active, as in boreal forests in winter, but remote sensing generally provides the best estimate for NPP at regional to global scales. FIGURE 20.7 Remote Sensing of NPP Global NPP estimated using a satellite-based sensor [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)]. Note the latitudinal patterns in NPP corresponding to climate zones. In addition to zones of upwelling, what other coastal zones have high rates of NPP as indicated in this map? NPP can also be estimated from direct measurements of its components: GPP and plant respiration. This approach typically involves measuring the change in CO2 concentration in a closed system, which can be created by placing a chamber around stems and leaves, whole plants, or whole stands of plants. For example, Howard Odum estimated NPP for a tropical forest in Puerto Rico by enclosing a stand of trees inside a 200 m2 \u00d7 20 m tall clear plastic \u201ctent\u201d (Odum and Jordan 1970). The emissions of CO to the atmosphere in such 2 a closed system are from respiration by the plants and heterotrophs, including microorganisms in the soil and animals in the forest. Uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere results from photosynthesis. Thus, the net change in CO2 inside the system results from the balance between GPP and total respiratory release by the plants and the heterotrophs. This net exchange of CO2 is called net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (FIGURE 20.8). Heterotrophic respiration must be subtracted from NEE to obtain NPP; as a result, NEE provides a more refined estimate of ecosystem carbon storage than NPP. Carbon movement into and out of ecosystems, such as carbon lost through leaching from the soil or through disturbances (e.g., fire or deforestation; ANALYZING DATA 20.1), can influence estimates of NEE and NPP. FIGURE 20.8 Components of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) Net ecosystem exchange includes all of the components of an ecosystem that either take up CO (autotrophs, through photosynthesis) or release CO (both autotrophs22 and heterotrophs). ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 20.1 When sunlight strikes an object, it is absorbed or scattered in such a way that the amount and quality of the light that reflects off of the object is changed.", "For example, when sunlight strikes a clear lake, about 5% of the visible light is reflected, while a light-colored sandy soil, such as might be found in a desert, reflects back as much as 40%. The amount of light reflected depends on the wavelengths of the light: different kinds of objects absorb or reflect some wavelengths more than others. The atmosphere scatters more blue wavelengths than red or green, and therefore the sky appears blue to our eyes. The lake, however, appears blue because most of the red and green light is absorbed by the water before it can be scattered back to our eyes. Lakes with high concentrations of phytoplankton appear green because much of the blue light is absorbed by the phytoplankton, leaving only the green light to be scattered back to our eyes. Remote sensing is a technique that takes advantage of light reflection and absorption to estimate the density and composition of objects on Earth\u2019s surface, in its waters, and in its atmosphere. Ecologists use remote sensing to estimate NPP by taking advantage of the unique reflectance pattern of chlorophyll-containing plants, algae, and bacteria (FIGURE A). Because chlorophyll absorbs visible solar radiation in blue and red wavelengths, it has a characteristic spectral signature with greater reflection of green wavelengths. In addition, vegetation absorbs more light of red wavelengths than does bare soil or water. FIGURE A Spectral Signatures of Vegetation, Clear Water, and Bare Soil Note the low reflectances of blue and red wavelengths for vegetation. (After A. R. Huete. 2004.

Ecologists can measure the reflection of specific wavelengths from a land or water surface and estimate NPP using several indices that have been developed. One of the most commonly used indices is the normalized difference vegetation index, or NDVI, which uses differences between visible-light and near-infrared reflectance to estimate the density of chlorophyll: where NIR is the near-infrared wavelength band (700\u20131,000 nm) and red is the red wavelength band (600\u2013700 nm). Note that the spectral signature of vegetation in Figure A shows a large difference between reflectance of red and near-infrared wavelengths relative to the spectral signatures of water and soil, which gives vegetation a high NDVI value and water and soil low NDVI values. The NDVI is coupled with estimates of the efficiency of light absorption to estimate photosynthetic CO uptake. 2 Remote sensing of light reflectance from Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere can be done at large spatial scales using satellites (FIGURE B), which transmit their measurements to receiving stations. Depending on the spatial resolution of the surface measurement and the number of wavelengths measured, satellite remote sensing can generate massive amounts of data that need to be processed. Advances in computing power have enhanced the spatial and temporal capabilities of remote sensing, making it a powerful tool for measuring NPP as well as deforestation, desertification, atmospheric pollution, and many other phenomena of interest to ecologists. FIGURE B Remote Sensing by Satellite Remote sensing instruments mounted on satellites can measure the reflectance of solar radiation from Earth to provide ecologists with large-scale measurements of NPP and other phenomena. Another noninvasive approach to estimating NEE uses frequent measurements of CO2 and microclimate at various heights throughout a plant canopy and into the open air above the canopy. The movement of air in these zones is complex and can be modeled as rotating eddies of air, much like the eddies in flowing streams. These eddies can be modeled using high-frequency measurements at different heights. This technique, known as eddy covariance or eddy correlation, takes advantage of the gradient in CO2 concentration between the plant canopy and the atmosphere that develops because of photosynthesis and respiration. During the day, when plants are photosynthetically active, the concentration of CO2 is lower in the plant canopy than in the air above the plant canopy. At night, when photosynthesis shuts down but respiration continues, the CO2 concentration in the canopy is higher than that in the atmosphere. Instrument-bearing towers established in forest, shrubland, and grassland canopies have been used to measure the NEE of CO2 over long periods (FIGURE 20.9). Depending on the tower height, eddy covariance can provide an integrated NEE for up to several square kilometers of the surrounding area.", "A network of eddy covariance sites in the Americas (Ameriflux: www.ameriflux.lbl.gov) has been established to help researchers better understand the uptake and fate of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and how carbon uptake is influenced by climate. FIGURE 20.9 Eddy Covariance Estimates of NEE (A) A tower projecting above a subalpine forest on Niwot Ridge, Colorado. Instruments attached to the tower measure the microclimate (temperature, wind speed, radiation) and atmospheric CO concentrations at frequent intervals. These measurements are used to estimate net ecosystem exchange of2 CO . (B) Concentrations of CO (in parts per million) from the ground surface to above the canopy in a boreal forest in 22 Siberia, measured over the course of a 24-hour period in the summer. Average canopy height was 16 m. (B after D. Y. Hollinger et al. 1998. Agr For Meteorol 90: 291\u2013306.) What would the daily pattern of CO concentrations look like during the summer in a community made up primarily of 2 cacti? ANALYZING DATA 20.1 We know that on a yearly basis trees take up large amounts of CO from the atmosphere, converting it through 2 photosynthesis to fixed carbon. We also know that occasionally large numbers of trees succumb to fire, insect predation, diseases, and human activities. What effect, if any, might this deforestation have on atmospheric concentrations of CO ? 2 Two studies shed light on this question. Over the past decade, mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) killed millions of trees throughout western North America. Kurz et al. (2008)* studied the effects of a massive beetle infestation in British Columbia, Canada. The team measured and estimated NPP and heterotrophic respiration before and after the outbreak. Use their data (below) to answer Questions 1 and 2. aNPP Heterotrophicarespiration Before outbreak 440 408 After outbreak 400 424 a In g C/m /yr 2 1. Prior to the mountain pine beetle outbreak, was the forest taking up more CO than it was releasing? In other words, 2 was the forest a sink or a source of CO for the atmosphere? 2 2. Was the forest a sink or a source of atmospheric CO following the outbreak? Would you expect this trend in net 2 carbon exchange with the atmosphere to change over the next 100 years? Trees are also being lost at a high rate from the tropical rainforest biome, in this case because of land use change (see Concept 3.1). The ongoing conversion of tropical rainforest to pasture by humans is altering the NEE of this biome. In a study that compared the NEE of a tropical pasture with that of second-growth tropical rainforest in Panama, Wolf et al. (2011)\u2020 obtained the following data, which you can use to answer Questions 3 and 4. aGPP aTotal respiration (autotrophic + heterotrophic) Pasture Second-growth forest 2,345 2,082 2,606 1,640 a 2 In g C/m /yr 3. What is the NEE for the tropical pasture? For the second-growth forest? 4. As noted in Table 20.1, today the tropical forest biome accounts for 35% of terrestrial NPP. The NEE of Earth\u2019s total land surface accounts for a net uptake of 3 petagrams (3 \u00d7 1015 grams) of carbon each year. Given these considerations, use the NEE figures you obtained for Question 3 to determine how much less annual global carbon uptake there would be if half of the existing tropical forest were converted to pasture. (Assume that the numbers from the Wolf et al. study represent the average conditions for undisturbed tropical forest and tropical pasture.)

Global Change Biology 17: 2763\u20132780. AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS The dominant autotrophs in both freshwater and marine ecosystems are phytoplankton, including algae and cyanobacteria. These organisms have much shorter life spans than terrestrial plants, so the biomass present at any given time is very low compared with NPP; therefore, harvest techniques are not used to estimate NPP for phytoplankton, although they can be used for seagrasses and macroalgae. One approach to estimating NPP involves measuring the rates of photosynthesis and respiration in water samples collected in bottles and incubated at the collection site with light (for photosynthesis) and without light (for respiration).", "Although there are errors associated with the artificial environment of the bottles, as well as the inclusion of respiration by heterotrophic bacteria and zooplankton in the bottles, this technique is used widely in freshwater and marine ecosystems. Remote sensing of chlorophyll concentrations in the oceans using satellite-based instruments provides good estimates of marine NPP (see Figure 20.7). As described for terrestrial remote sensing, indices based on absorption and reflection of light of different wavelengths are used to indicate how much light is being absorbed by chlorophyll, which is then related to NPP by using a light utilization coefficient, a term that incorporates the efficiency of light absorption into photosynthetic CO2 uptake. As Figure 20.7 shows, there can be as much as a 50-fold difference in NPP between Arctic and tropical ecosystems. In the following section we will investigate the role of abiotic and biotic factors that influence differences in NPP among ecosystems. Self-Assessment 20.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 20.2 Net primary production is constrained by both physical and biotic environmental factors. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 20.2.1 Contrast the direct and indirect influences of climate on the amount of terrestrial net primary production through its influence on photosynthesis and resource supply. 20.2.2 Describe how plant allocation and growth rates can influence the relationship between climate and net primary production. 20.2.3 List the nutrients that commonly limit the net primary production of freshwater and marine ecosystems. Environmental Controls on NPP As we have seen, NPP varies substantially over space and time. Much of this variation is associated with differences in climate, such as the latitudinal gradients in temperature and precipitation discussed in Concepts 2.3. In this section, we explore the factors that constrain rates of NPP. NPP in terrestrial ecosystems is controlled by climate Variation in terrestrial NPP at the continental to global scales correlates with variation in temperature and precipitation. NPP increases as average annual precipitation increases up to a maximum of about 2,400 mm per year, after which it decreases in some ecosystems (e.g., highland tropical forests), but not in others (e.g., lowland tropical forests) (FIGURE 20.10A). NPP may decrease at very high precipitation levels for several reasons. Cloud cover over long periods lowers available sunlight. High amounts of precipitation leach nutrients from soils, and high soil water content results in hypoxic conditions that cause stress for both plants and decomposers. FIGURE 20.10 Global Patterns of Terrestrial NPP Are Correlated with Climate The graphs show the relationships between NPP and (A) precipitation and (B) temperature in terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. (Mg = 106 g.) (After E. A. G. Schuur. 2003. Ecology 84: 1165\u20131170.) NPP increases with average annual temperature (FIGURE 20.10B). This does not mean, however, that ecosystem carbon storage (NEE, discussed earlier) does the same. The loss of carbon from ecosystems due to respiration of heterotrophic organisms also increases at warmer temperatures, so NEE may potentially decrease. Several lines of evidence suggest that climate change over the past decades has changed NEE in some ecosystems. For example, tundra sites that were once carbon sinks (with GPP greater than carbon loss due to respiration) are now carbon sources (with respiratory carbon loss greater than GPP). These changes are increasing CO2 losses to the atmosphere, as ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 20.1 explains. These correlations of NPP with climate suggest that NPP is directly linked to water availability and temperature. Such links make sense when we consider the direct influence of water availability on photosynthesis via the opening and closing of stomates and the influence of temperature on the enzymes that facilitate photosynthesis (see Concepts 5.2). In deserts and in some grassland ecosystems, water availability has a clear, direct influence on NPP. In other ecosystems where water limitation is not as severe, the causal connection between precipitation and NPP is less clear. The links between climate and NPP may also be indirect, mediated by factors such as climate effects on nutrient availability or the particular plant species found within an ecosystem. How can we detect whether the influence of climate on NPP is direct or indirect? Several approaches, both observational and experimental, have been used. William Lauenroth and Osvaldo Sala examined how NPP in a short-grass steppe ecosystem responded to year-to-year variation in precipitation (Lauenroth and Sala 1992). They also examined the average annual NPP and precipitation across several grassland ecosystems at different locations in the central United States.", "When they compared the correlations between NPP and precipitation in their two analyses, they found that NPP increased more as precipitation increased for the site-to-site comparison than for the comparison among years in the short-grass steppe (FIGURE 20.11). They attributed the difference in the response of NPP to precipitation to variation in plant species composition among the grasslands. Some grass species have a greater inherent capacity to increase growth than others in response to enhanced water availability, associated with greater ability to produce new shoots and flowers. Lauenroth and Sala also suggested that there was a time lag in the response to increased precipitation in the short-grass steppe ecosystem; that is, the increase in NPP in response to an increase in precipitation did not occur in the same year, but was delayed one to several years. Within the grassland biome, differences in the abilities of species to respond to climate variation can contribute to site-to-site variation in NPP, influencing the correlation between climate and NPP among sites. FIGURE 20.11 The Sensitivity of NPP to Changes in Precipitation Varies among Grassland Ecosystems The relationship between aboveground NPP and precipitation is shown for a short-grass steppe ecosystem and for several grassland ecosystems of different types at different sites in the central United States. (After W. K. Lauenroth and O. E. Sala. 1992. Ecol Appl 2: 397\u2013403.) Experimental manipulations of water, nutrients, carbon dioxide, and plant species composition have been used to examine the direct influence of those factors on NPP. The results of numerous experiments indicate that nutrients, particularly nitrogen, control NPP in terrestrial ecosystems. For example, William Bowman, Terry Theodose, and their colleagues used a fertilization experiment in alpine communities of the southern Rocky Mountains to determine whether the supply of nutrients limits NPP (Bowman et al. 1993). They knew that spatial differences in NPP among alpine communities were correlated with differences in soil water availability, as in the grassland ecosystems described above. Bowman and colleagues\u2019 fertilization experiment was performed in two communities, a nutrient-poor dry meadow and a more nutrient-rich wet meadow. They sought to determine whether the supply of nutrients influenced NPP and, if so, whether the response differed between the two communities. They added nitrogen or phosphorus or both nitrogen and phosphorus to different plots in both communities, and they maintained plots with no nutrient additions as controls. Their results indicated that the supply of nitrogen limited NPP in the dry meadow, while nitrogen and phosphorus both limited NPP in the wet meadow (FIGURE 20.12). An additional experiment indicated that the addition of water to the dry meadow did not increase NPP, despite the positive relationship between NPP and soil moisture across the communities. These results suggest that the correlation between soil moisture and NPP in these alpine communities does not indicate a direct causal relationship, but rather is determined by the effect of soil moisture on nutrient supply through its effects on decomposition and movement of nutrients in the soil (described in Concepts 22.2). FIGURE 20.12 Nutrient Availability Influences NPP in Alpine Communities (A) Fertilized plots in an alpine dry meadow community in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, dominated by sedges, forbs, and grasses (see Interactive Figure 3.11). (B) Fertilization of plots in a resource-poor dry meadow and a resource-rich wet meadow with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and both N and P showed that nutrient availability limits NPP. (B after W. D. Bowman et al. 1993. Ecology 74: 2085\u20132098.) In which community would you expect a higher proportion of belowground NPP? Would the allocation to belowground NPP change in response to fertilization? Closer examination of Figure 20.12B shows that the increase in NPP was not uniform across all plant species groups. The dominant plant type of the alpine dry meadow (Kobresia spp.) did not increase its biomass as much as the less common sedge and grass species. The change in NPP in the dry meadow occurred largely as a result of a change in plant species composition within the experimental plots. This was not the case in the wet meadows, where the dominant sedges increased their growth more than the subdominant forb species. These results are consistent with the general trend of results from many fertilization experiments, which indicate that plant species from resource-poor communities have lower growth responses to fertilization than species from resource-rich communities. This apparent contradiction is the result of differences in the capacity of plant species to respond to fertilization.", "Plants of resource-poor communities tend to have low intrinsic growth rates, a characteristic that lowers their resource requirements. Plants of resource-rich communities tend to have higher growth rates, which make them better able to compete for resources, particularly light. Although NPP increases in nutrient-poor communities when they are fertilized, the change in plant species composition that occurs in many such experiments indicates that plant species composition can determine the intrinsic capacity of an ecosystem to increase its NPP when resources are increased (FIGURE 20.13). This study provides an example of the important roles that community dynamics can play in ecosystem function. FIGURE 20.13 Growth Responses of Alpine Plants to Added Nitrogen The effect on plant growth of low to high nitrogen levels (with all other nutrients maintained at optimal concentrations) indicated that alpine plant species vary substantially in their ability to increase growth in response to an increase in nitrogen availability. (After W. D. Bowman and C. J. Bilbrough. 2001. Plant Soil 233: 283\u2013290.) NPP is often limited by nutrients in non-desert terrestrial ecosystems. Some general differences among terrestrial ecosystem types have emerged from resource manipulation experiments and measurements of plant and soil chemistry. In lowland tropical rainforests, NPP is often limited by the supply of phosphorus, since the relatively old, leached tropical soils in which they grow are low in available phosphorus relative to other nutrients. Other nutrients, such as calcium and potassium, can also limit production in lowland tropical ecosystems. Montane tropical ecosystems, and most temperate and Arctic ecosystems, are limited by the supply of nitrogen, and occasionally by phosphorus. Even in some desert ecosystems, NPP is co-limited by water and nitrogen. NPP in aquatic ecosystems is controlled by nutrient availability The primary producers in lake ecosystems are phytoplankton and rooted macrophytes. NPP in lake ecosystems is often limited by the supply of both phosphorus and nitrogen, as we know not only from the results of experimental manipulations, but also from unintentional \u201cexperiments\u201d set in motion by wastewater discharges into lakes (see Figure 22.18). A common approach to determining the response of NPP in lakes to changes in nutrient supply is to incubate translucent or open-top containers, sometimes referred to as \u201climnocorrals,\u201d of lake water, amended with one or more nutrients, in the lake (FIGURE 20.14). The NPP response is measured by changes in chlorophyll concentrations or numbers of phytoplankton cells. FIGURE 20.14 Limnocorrals A researcher snorkels within a contained area (limnocorral) in McKinley Lake near Cordova, Alaska, subjected to experimental fertilization to examine the effects of nutrients on NPP. One of the most convincing studies of the effect of nutrients on NPP in lakes was a series of whole-lake fertilization experiments by David Schindler (Schindler 1974). The experiments were initiated in 1969 in the Experimental Lakes Area in Ontario, a series of 58 small lakes set aside for experimental manipulations. Concern over declining water quality in the lakes of North America and Europe motivated Schindler and his colleagues to establish several experiments to determine whether inputs of nutrients in wastewater were involved in the dramatic increases in the growth of phytoplankton that had been observed. They added nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus to all or half of several individual lakes. The results of these experiments provided strong evidence for phosphorus limitation of NPP (FIGURE 20.15). Massive increases in the abundances of cyanobacteria were responsible for the increase in NPP in response to phosphorus addition. Evidence for nitrogen limitation of NPP in high-elevation lakes, based on small-scale fertilization experiments and measurements of the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus in the water, also exists (Elser et al. 2007). FIGURE 20.15 Response of a Lake to Phosphorus Fertilization Experimental Lake 226 was divided into two sections as part of David Schindler\u2019s experiments on the effects of nutrient availability on NPP. NPP in streams and rivers is often low, and the majority of the energy in those ecosystems is derived from terrestrial organic matter (see Concepts 21.1). Water movement limits the abundance of phytoplankton, except where the water velocity is relatively low. In Concepts 3.2, we introduced the river continuum concept, which describes the increasing importance of in-stream NPP as the river flows downstream. Most of the NPP in streams and rivers comes from photosynthesis by macrophytes and algae attached to the bottom in shallow areas where there is enough light for photosynthesis. Suspended sediment in rivers can limit light penetration; thus, turbidity often controls NPP. Nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, can also limit NPP in streams and rivers.", "Marine NPP is usually limited by nutrient supply, but the specific limiting nutrients vary among marine ecosystem types. Estuaries, the zones where rivers empty into the ocean (see Concept 3.3), are rich in nutrients relative to other marine ecosystems. Variation in NPP among estuaries is correlated with variation in nitrogen inputs from rivers. Agricultural and industrial activities have increased riverine inputs of nitrogen into estuaries, which have caused periodic \u201cblooms\u201d of algae. These blooms have been implicated in the development of \u201cdead zones\u201d\u2014areas of high fish and zooplankton mortality\u2014in over 400 nearshore ecosystems worldwide. NPP in the open ocean is derived primarily from phytoplankton, including a group referred to as the picoplankton, consisting of cells smaller than 1 \u03bcm. Picoplankton contribute as much as 50% of the total marine NPP. Smaller contributions come from floating mats of seaweeds such as Sargassum. Near the coast, kelp forests may have leaf area indices and rates of NPP as high as those of tropical forests. \u201cMeadows\u201d of seagrasses such as eelgrass (Zostera spp.) are also important contributors to NPP in shallow nearshore zones. In much of the open ocean, NPP is limited by nitrogen. In the equatorial Pacific Ocean, however, detectable concentrations of nitrogen can be found in the water even when peak NPP occurs, suggesting that some other factor limits NPP. John Martin and colleagues measured the concentrations of nutrients in the open waters of the Pacific and performed bottle incubation experiments with added nutrients. They found that adding iron to the bottles increased NPP (Martin et al. 1994). Based on this evidence that iron limits NPP in some ocean regions, Martin suggested that windblown dust from Asia, an important source of iron for the open ocean, could play an important role in the global climate system through its influence on marine NPP, and thus on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. During glacial periods, large areas of the continents lacking vegetative cover could have contributed aeolian dust that would have fertilized the ocean. As NPP in marine ecosystems increased, those ecosystems might have taken up more CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing its atmospheric concentration and serving as a positive feedback to cool the climate further. Martin suggested that these findings might be applied to address global warming, saying at the time, \u201cGive me half a tankerload of iron, and I\u2019ll give you an Ice Age.\u201d He recommended the use of large-scale experiments to investigate the influence of iron on ocean NPP. Unfortunately, Martin died in 1993, before his ambitious experiments could be carried out. Martin\u2019s colleagues subsequently performed the first of several experiments in 1993, adding iron sulfate to surface waters of the equatorial Pacific west of the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. This experiment was alternatively referred to as IronEx I or the \u201cGeritol solution\u201d1 to global climate change. During IronEx I, a 64-km2 area was fertilized with 445 kg of iron, which resulted in a doubling of phytoplankton biomass and a fourfold increase in NPP (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 20.16). Three other iron fertilization experiments were subsequently performed, one in 1995 (IronEx II), which produced a tenfold increase in phytoplankton biomass; a second in 1999 in the Southern Ocean; and the last in 2002, also in the Southern Ocean. While the iron limitation hypothesis has been strongly supported by these and other experiments, fertilizing large areas of the ocean is unlikely to provide a solution to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global climate change. Some of the CO2 taken up by phytoplankton is eventually re-emitted to the atmosphere via respiration by zooplankton and bacteria that consume the phytoplankton. In addition, the iron is lost relatively quickly from the surface photic zone, sinking to deeper layers where it is unavailable to support phytoplankton photosynthesis and growth. Iron fertilization on a large scale could also have detrimental effects on ocean biodiversity and could create large dead zones similar to those generated by nitrogen inputs into estuaries. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 20.16 Effect of Iron Fertilization on Marine NPP IronEx I released a plume of iron into the equatorial Pacific Ocean to study the effects of iron fertilization on NPP. (A) This vertical profile shows primary production at various depths outside and inside the iron plume on three specific days: 1, 2, and 3 days following the release of the iron. (B) Researchers deploy a pump to add iron to the ocean. (A after J. H. Martin et al. 1994. Nature 371: 123\u2013129.) The development of remote sensing and eddy covariance techniques has improved our ability to discern global patterns of NPP.", "We\u2019ll examine those patterns in the next section. Self-Assessment 20.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 20.3 Global patterns of net primary production reflect climate constraints and biome types. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 20.3.1 Compare the net primary production of terrestrial and marine ecosystems at a global scale by considering their spatial coverage to evaluate their overall contribution to global net primary production. 20.3.2 Predict which biomes contribute the greatest amount of net primary production at a global scale based on the climatic factors that control net primary production. Global Patterns of NPP Which biomes and marine biological zones have the highest NPP and, as a consequence, the greatest effect on atmospheric CO2 dynamics? Knowing how NPP varies at a global scale is key to understanding how biotic factors affect the global carbon cycle and how future changes in biomes could affect climate change (see Concept 25.1). Initial estimates of global NPP were based on compilations of plot-level measurements from different biomes, scaled up using estimates of the spatial distributions of those biomes. These estimates were subject to error associated with the uncertainty of the actual area covered by each biome type, as well as with the potential for overestimating NPP if undisturbed, old-growth study plots were selected to represent a biome. Remote sensing data now give us rapid direct measurements of NPP, providing an estimate of Earth\u2019s capacity to take up CO2 and its response to climate variation and climate change. Terrestrial and oceanic NPP are nearly equal Chris Field and colleagues estimated total planetary NPP to be 105 petagrams (1 Pg = 1015 g) of carbon per year, based on remote sensing data collected over multiple years (Field et al. 1998). They determined that 54% of this carbon is taken up by terrestrial ecosystems, while the remaining 46% is taken up by primary producers in the oceans. Their estimate of oceanic NPP (which comes to 48 Pg C/year) was considerably higher than previous estimates. Despite the similar contributions of land and oceans to total global NPP, the 2 average rate of NPP on the land surface (426 g C/m /year) is higher than that in the oceans (140 g 2 C/m /year). The lower rate in the oceans is compensated for by the greater percentage (70%) of Earth\u2019s surface they cover. Most of the surface of both oceans and land is dominated by areas with relatively low NPP (see Figure 20.7). The highest rates of NPP on land are found in the tropics (FIGURE 20.17). This pattern results from latitudinal variation in climate and in the length of the growing season. Higher latitudes have shorter growing seasons and sparse short-statured plants, and low temperatures constrain nutrient supply by lowering decomposition rates, which in turn limits NPP. Tropical zones have long growing seasons and high rates of precipitation, promoting high rates of NPP. NPP declines to the north and south of the tropics at about 25\u00b0, reflecting the increasing aridity associated with the high-pressure zones generated by the descending air of the Hadley cells (see Concept 2.2). Another peak in terrestrial NPP occurs at the northern mid-latitudes, where the temperate forest biome is found. NPP in the mid- to high latitudes shows strong seasonal trends, with peaks in summer and declines in winter. In contrast, seasonal trends in the tropics are often slight and are associated with wet\u2013dry cycles. FIGURE 20.17 Latitudinal Variation in NPP These estimates of NPP are based on satellite remote sensing data. Note the strong correlation of the terrestrial pattern with patterns in global average annual temperature (see Figure 2.14) and precipitation (see Figure 2.16). (After C. B. Field et al. 1998. Science 281: 237\u2013240.) Oceanic NPP peaks at the mid-latitudes between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 (see Figure 20.17). These peaks are associated with zones of upwelling, areas where ocean currents bring nutrient-rich deep water to the surface (see Concept 2.2). High NPP is also associated with estuaries at these latitudes. Seasonal trends in NPP occur in the oceans, but their magnitude is less than on the land surface. Differences among biomes in NPP reflect climate and biotic variation It is not surprising that NPP varies among biomes, since biomes are associated with latitudinal climate variation. For example, the high NPP in the tropics is associated with tropical forests, grasslands, and savannas. The low NPP at high latitudes is associated with boreal forests and tundra.", "Tropical forests and savannas contribute approximately 60% of terrestrial NPP and around 37% of global NPP (TABLE 20.1). In the oceans, zones of upwelling (eutrophic zones) have high rates of NPP, but they cover less than 5% of the ocean surface. Although they cover less area than the open ocean, shallow oceans (mesotrophic zones, macrophytes) account for almost half of oceanic NPP. Despite its low rate of NPP, the vast area of the open ocean accounts for the majority of oceanic NPP and approximately 40% of total global NPP.

Saugier et al. 2001. In Terrestrial Global Productivity, J. Roy et al. (Eds.), pp. 543\u2013557. Academic Press: San Diego, CA. As noted in Concept 20.1, much of the variation in NPP among terrestrial biomes is associated with differences in leaf area index. Similarly, the complex structure of ocean macrophyte communities such as kelp beds accounts for their high rate of NPP (see Table 20.1) In addition, the length of the growing season varies markedly among terrestrial biomes, from year-round in some tropical ecosystems to 100 days or less in tundra. Variation associated with different plant growth forms (e.g., grasses vs. shrubs vs. trees) is also important but contributes less to variation among biomes than do growing season and leaf area index. Variation in NPP among aquatic ecosystems, as we saw in Concept 20.2, is primarily related to variation in inputs of nutrients. What happens to all of this NPP? In the next section, we will introduce some of the concepts associated with secondary production. We will cover energy flow among organisms and its consequences for population growth, community dynamics, and ecosystem function in Chapter 21. Self-Assessment 20.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 20.4 Secondary production is generated through the consumption of organic matter by heterotrophs. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 20.4.1 Describe how the diet of a heterotroph can be determined by observation and isotopic analysis. 20.4.2 Evaluate how ingestion, egestion, and respiration influence the amount of net secondary production. Secondary Production Energy that is derived from the consumption of organic compounds produced by other organisms is known as secondary production. Organisms that obtain their energy in this manner are known as heterotrophs, and they include archaea, bacteria, fungi, animals, and even a few plants (see the Case Study in Chapter 14). Heterotrophs are classified according to the type of food they consume. The most general categories, introduced in Concept 5.4, are herbivores, which consume plants and algae; carnivores, which consume live animals; and detritivores, which consume dead organic matter (detritus). Organisms that consume live organic matter from both plants and animals are called omnivores. Further refinement of feeding preferences is sometimes incorporated into the terminology used to describe heterotrophs; insect eaters, for example, are referred to as insectivores. Here we briefly introduce some concepts of secondary production. In Chapter 21, we will discuss secondary production in more detail and in relation to the amount and efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels, the controls on the magnitude of secondary production in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and the concept of food webs. Heterotroph diets can be determined from the isotopic composition of food sources As we saw in Concept 5.4, chemistry is an important determinant of the benefit heterotrophs get from their food. In particular, the ratios of carbon to nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus influence the growth rates and reproductive output of heterotrophs and thus their secondary production. We will revisit this topic in Concept 21.2. Determining what heterotrophs eat may be as simple as watching them feed. Such observations, however, may be a time-consuming and imprecise exercise. Another option is examining their fecal material, which can also be imprecise and not a pleasant task.", "An alternative method of determining a heterotroph\u2019s diet involves measuring stable isotopes (see Ecological Toolkit 5.1). The ratios of naturally occurring stable 13 12 15 14 3432 isotopes of carbon ( C/ C), nitrogen ( N/ N), and sulfur ( S/ S) differ among potential food items. Measurements of the isotopic composition of a heterotroph and its potential food sources can identify the food sources that make up its diet (Peterson and Fry 1987). Isotopic measurements of preserved bone specimens have been used to study the diets of extinct animals as well as modern ones. One mystery in feeding ecology that was solved using isotopic measurements was the diet of European cave bears (Ursus spelaeus). Cave bears went extinct about 25,000 years ago, during the height of the last Ice Age. Cave bears were much larger than the temperate-zone bears of today, as much as triple the size of the modern grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) of North America. Examination of the teeth and the jaw structure of cave bears led some mammalogists to hypothesize that they were primarily herbivores. However, the fact that plants are a poor-quality food, as noted in Concept 5.4, led to skepticism about an herbivorous diet adequately sustaining such a massive bear. G. V. Hilderbrand and colleagues measured the C and N isotope composition of bone samples provided by museums from across the world (Hilderbrand et al. 1996). The samples included cave bears and the herbivores that occurred alongside them (woolly rhinoceros, woolly mammoth, horse, and aurochs, an ancestor of modern cattle). Hilderbrand and colleagues found that bones of cave bears had an isotopic composition different from that of Pleistocene herbivores (FIGURE 20.18). Using information about the isotopic composition of food sources, the researchers estimated that the average diet of cave bears consisted of 58% meat (range from 41% to 78%). This finding refuted the hypothesis that cave bears were primarily herbivores, indicating that the bulk of their diet was meat. In this and other studies, isotopic measurements have provided a useful tool for determining the diets of animals that is more accurate and integrative, and less time-consuming, than other techniques. FIGURE 20.18 Isotopic Composition and Diet Carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of bones of museum specimens of cave bears and herbivores from about 20,000 years ago. The isotopic compositions are expressed as ratios of heavier to lighter isotopes compared with a standard. Higher numbers mean more of the heavier isotope. (After G. V. Hilderbrand et al. 1996. Can J Zool 74: 2080\u20132088.) Net secondary production is equal to heterotroph growth Not all of the organic matter consumed by heterotrophs is incorporated into heterotroph biomass. Some is used in respiration, and some is egested (lost in urine and feces). Net secondary production is the balance among ingestion, respiratory loss, and egestion: Net secondary production by a heterotroph depends on the quality of its food, related to its digestibility and nutrient content. In addition, the physiology of the heterotroph influences how effectively its food intake is channeled into growth. Animals with high respiration rates (e.g., endotherms) have less energy left over to allocate to growth. Net secondary production in most terrestrial ecosystems is a small fraction of NPP, because of predation on herbivores, plant defenses, and the low nutrient content of many plants, as we\u2019ll see in Chapter 21. Net secondary production represents a greater fraction of NPP in aquatic ecosystems than it does in terrestrial ecosystems. The majority of net secondary production in most ecosystems is associated with detritivores, primarily bacteria and fungi. Self-Assessment 20.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Life in the Deep Blue Sea, How Can It Be? In this chapter, we have emphasized the importance of photosynthetic autotrophs as the source of energy for ecosystems, since the vast majority of the energy that enters ecosystems is derived from visible solar radiation. Here and in Chapter 5, however, we have alluded to another source of energy for ecosystems: chemosynthesis. Some bacteria can use chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S and related chemical forms, HS\u2013 and S2\u2013) as electron donors to take up carbon dioxide and convert it into carbohydrates: Bacteria that provide energy for ecosystems via chemosynthesis are known as chemoautotrophs. The existence of chemoautotrophic bacteria was known for at least a century before the discovery of hydrothermal vents, but their role in providing energy for the vent communities was uncertain.", "Initially, hypotheses suggested that the high velocity of water flow around the hydrothermal vents helped direct organic matter from the photic zone toward the filter-feeding invertebrates. However, several lines of evidence suggested that chemoautotrophs were the major source of energy for these ecosystems. First, the 13 12 carbon isotopic ratios ( C/ C) in the bodies of the vent invertebrates were different from those of phytoplankton in the photic zone (see Ecological Toolkit 5.1). Second, the tube worms collected from the vents (Riftia spp.) lacked mouths and digestive systems. These gutless tube worms also had structures called trophosomes, made up of highly vascularized tissues with specialized cells containing large amounts of bacteria (FIGURE 20.19). Elemental sulfur was found in the trophosomes, suggesting that sulfides were being chemically transformed in the tube worms\u2019 bodies. Enzymes associated with the Calvin cycle, the biochemical pathway used by autotrophs to synthesize carbohydrates (see Concept 5.2), as well as enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism were found in the trophosomes. Furthermore, the clams and other mollusks collected from the vent communities lacked some of the critical tissues for filter feeding, and they also had large amounts of bacteria in specialized tissues, as well as enzymes associated with the Calvin cycle. FIGURE 20.19 Riftia Anatomy Riftia tube worms have a number of specialized structures that make them well adapted to their hydrothermal vent environment. All of this evidence pointed to the conclusion that deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities derive their energy from chemoautotrophic bacteria. These bacteria also aid in detoxifying the sulfides in the water, which would normally inhibit aerobic respiration. Many of the abundant ocean vent organisms have symbiotic relationships with the bacteria\u2014that is, they house the chemoautotrophs in their bodies, often in specialized structures. Is this interaction a mutualistic symbiosis of the kind described in Chapter 15? The tube worms and clams housing the bacteria benefit by obtaining carbohydrates to fuel their metabolic processes, growth, and reproduction, as well as from detoxification of the sulfides. Do the bacteria derive any benefit from the invertebrates? The answer is yes: the invertebrates provide them with a chemical environment unlike that found in the surrounding water, supplying them with more carbon dioxide, oxygen, and sulfides than they could obtain if they were free-living in the water or the sediments surrounding the vent. The symbiosis between the bacteria and the invertebrates is therefore mutualistic, resulting in higher productivity than if the organisms lived separately. CONNECTIONS in NATURE ENERGY-DRIVEN SUCCESSION AND EVOLUTION IN HYDROTHERMAL VENT COMMUNITIES Hydrothermal vent environments are dynamic, born with the eruption of new hot springs, which eventually cease to emit sulfide-laden water as the subsurface water channels are altered and the underlying magma cools (Van Dover 2000). When the hot springs no longer emit water, and the sulfide in the seawater has been consumed, the communities surrounding the vents collapse as their energy source disappears and the physical substrate falls apart. The life span of vent communities varies from approximately 20 to 200 years. Studies of colonization and development in these communities over the past 3 decades have provided insights into succession in marine communities in general (see Chapter 17 for a general discussion of succession). Succession in hydrothermal vent communities is relatively rapid and can be observed by periodically revisiting specific vents (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 20.20). Although the logistic difficulty and expense of such investigations has limited the number of observations, some general trends have emerged. The rates of colonization and development of hydrothermal vent communities are higher when they are closer to other existing vent communities, as we might predict based on the theory of island biogeography (see Concept 18.3). Because the community\u2019s energy is derived from chemosynthesis, colonization begins with chemoautotrophic bacteria, sometimes in numbers large enough to cloud the water. Tube worms are often the first invertebrates to arrive. Clams and other mollusks are thought to be stronger competitors for sites with optimal temperatures and water chemistry, and over time they increase in abundance at the expense of the tube worms. A few scavengers and carnivores, such as crabs and lobsters, are found in the developing community, although at low abundances. As the tube worm and bivalve populations decline with the drop in sulfide input when water flow from the vent decreases, the abundance of scavenger organisms increases until the energy available in the form of detritus is gone.", "INTERACTIVE FIGURE 20.20 Succession in Hydrothermal Vent Communities Species composition and abundances in a hydrothermal vent community change over time following the eruption of a hot spring. (From T. M. Shank et al. 1998. Deep-Sea Res II 45: 465\u2013515.) The pattern of succession in hydrothermal vent communities is subject to the same random factors that influence succession in other habitats: the order of arrival of organisms at a site can influence the long-term dynamics of the community (see Concept 17.4). Neighboring vent communities found in the same area of a mid-ocean ridge may show different stages of succession, associated with the stages of hot spring development, as well as different trajectories of succession due to differences in the organisms present. Thus, collections of hydrothermal vents within the same general area are a mosaic of communities at different successional stages, similar to those in terrestrial forest patches, albeit separated by greater distances than the patches within a forest. The unique nature of the energy supply in hydrothermal vent communities would suggest strong evolutionary divergence between the organisms that inhabit the vents and their nearest non-vent relatives (see Concept 6.4). Where phylogenetic relationships between the vent organisms and their non-vent relatives have been worked out, the divergence is indeed deep, usually at the level of genus, family, or order. Since the discovery of hydrothermal vents, approximately 500 new vent species have been described; of these species, about 90% are endemic to hydrothermal vents. However, large areas of mid-ocean ridges potentially containing hydrothermal vents have yet to be explored. The close association between the chemoautotrophic bacteria and their invertebrate hosts suggests the potential for a coevolutionary relationship of the type described in Concept 15.1. Have the invertebrates and their chemosynthetic bacterial symbionts evolved in concert? To address this question, Andrew Peek and colleagues compared the evolutionary relationships (phylogenetic trees; see Figure 6.16) of vent-dwelling clams in the family Vesicomyidae with those of their symbiotic bacteria (Peek et al. 1998). Clams in this family transfer bacteria to their offspring in the cytoplasm of their eggs. Peek and colleagues collected eight species of clams in three genera from hydrothermal vent communities at latitudes ranging from 18\u00b0N to 47\u00b0N and at depths ranging from 500 to 6,370 m. Ribosomal DNA taken from the clams and the bacteria was used to construct the phylogenetic trees. The two trees showed remarkable congruence (FIGURE 20.21), providing strong evidence that speciation in the clams and in their bacterial symbionts has occurred synchronously. Other vent groups lack this apparent coevolutionary relationship, however. For example, three different species of tube worms found in different geographic locations have been found to contain the same species of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. FIGURE 20.21 Coevolution of Vent Clams and Their Symbiotic Bacteria The phylogenetic trees of vesicomyid clams collected from hydrothermal vents and their accompanying chemoautotrophic bacterial symbionts show remarkable parallels, suggesting that these species have coevolved. (After A. S. Peek et al. 1998. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95: 9962\u20139966. \u00a9 1998 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.) Some researchers have suggested that hydrothermal vents are a potential site for the origin of life on Earth. The reducing (i.e., electron-donating) geochemical environment of hydrothermal vents is conducive to the abiotic synthesis of amino acids, which would have been required for the development of living systems. Although amino acids are not stable in ocean water under the high pressures and temperatures found at some deep-sea hydrothermal vents, there are vents with lower temperatures at shallower depths where amino acid genesis could (and does) occur. As Cyndy Lee Van Dover (2000) so eloquently stated, \u201cVent water may be the ultimate soup in the sorcerer\u2019s kettle.\u201d Energy Flow and Food Webs KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 21.1 Trophic levels describe the feeding positions of groups of organisms in ecosystems. CONCEPT 21.2 The amount of energy transferred from one trophic level to the next depends on food quality and on consumer abundance and physiology. CONCEPT 21.3 Changes in the abundances of organisms at one trophic level can influence energy flow at multiple trophic levels. CONCEPT 21.4 Food webs are conceptual models of the trophic interactions of organisms in an ecosystem. Toxins in Remote Places: A Case Study [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] \u2228 The Arctic is considered one of most pristine regions on Earth. Human effects on its environment are thought to be slight relative to those in the temperate and tropical zones, where the vast majority of humans live.", "Thus, the Arctic is one of the last places one would expect to find high levels of pollutants in living organisms. In the mid-1980s, Eric Dewailly, a toxicologist, was studying concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the breast milk of mothers in southern Quebec. PCBs belong to a group of chemical compounds called persistent organic pollutants (POPs) because they remain in the environment for a long time. POPs originate from industrial and agricultural activities and from the burning of industrial, medical, or municipal wastes. Exposure to PCBs has been linked to increased incidence of cancer, impaired ability to fight infections, decreased learning ability in children, and lower birth weights in newborns. Dewailly was seeking a human population from a pristine area that could be used as a control in his study. He enlisted the help of some Inuit mothers from Arctic Canada. The Inuit are primarily subsistence hunters, and they have no developed industry or agriculture that would provide direct exposure to POPs (FIGURE 21.1). Dewailly therefore assumed that Inuit mothers would have few or no PCBs in their breast milk, providing a benchmark against which to compare populations in more industrialized areas. FIGURE 21.1 Subsistence Hunting Inuit hunters skin a seal they have successfully hunted in a remote, very sparsely populated Arctic region. What Dewailly found was startling: the Inuit women had concentrations of PCBs in their breast milk that were seven times higher than those in women of southern Quebec (FIGURE 21.2) (Dewailly et al. 1993). These alarming findings were reinforced by the work of Harriet Kuhnlein, who at the same time found that approximately two-thirds of the children from an Inuit community in northeastern Canada had PCB levels in their blood that exceeded Canadian health guidelines (Kuhnlein et al. 1995). More extensive surveys found that POPs were widespread in Inuit populations. As many as 95% of the people in Inuit communities of Greenland had blood levels of PCBs that exceeded health standards (Pearce 1997). FIGURE 21.2 Persistent Organic Pollutants in Canadian Women The breast milk of Inuit mothers from Arctic Canada was found to contain substantially higher concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and two other POPs\u2014 dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE, a pesticide similar to DDT) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB, an agricultural fungicide)\u2014than that of mothers from southern Quebec. (After E. Dewailly et al. 1993. Environ Health Perspect 101: 618\u2013 620.) How were these toxins finding their way into the Arctic environments where the Inuit live? The POPs that were found in the tissues of Inuit populations occur in gaseous form at most environmental temperatures. Produced in lower-latitude industrial areas, these compounds enter the atmosphere under warm temperatures, but when carried by winds into the colder regions of the Arctic, they condense into liquid forms and fall from the atmosphere, sometimes in snowflakes. The manufacture and use of most POPs has been banned in North America since the 1970s. Some developing countries continue to produce POPs, however, and they are important sources of the compounds found in Arctic regions. Although emissions of POPs have decreased, these compounds may remain in Arctic snow and ice for many decades, being released slowly during snowmelt every spring and summer. While the source of the POPs was known, the high concentrations of these compounds in the Inuit were a mystery. The concentrations of POPs in their drinking water were not high enough to explain this phenomenon. One hint came from the correlation between the levels of the toxins in people and their preferred diets. Communities that had traditionally relied on marine mammals for their food tended to have the highest levels of POPs, while communities that consumed herbivorous caribou had lower levels. We will discover the ecological basis for this difference as we trace the flow of energy and materials through ecosystems in this chapter. View the script for the video Introduction To begin our discussion of energy flow in ecosystems, let\u2019s move from the Arctic to a much warmer place: a North American desert. Deserts contain diverse assemblages of plants, animals, and microorganisms. This diversity is reflected in the variation in the sizes, shapes, and physiology of the animals making up the desert fauna, from nematodes in the soil to grasshoppers in the plant canopy to hawks in the sky. What links these animals together in the context of ecological functioning isn\u2019t necessarily their physical appearances or their evolutionary relationships. Rather, their ecological roles are determined by what they eat and by what eats them\u2014that is, by their feeding, or trophic, interactions.", "In other words, the influence an organism has on the movement of energy and nutrients through an ecosystem is determined by the type of food it consumes as well as by what consumes it. For example, grasshoppers and scorpions are both arthropods, with similar morphology and physiology, yet their ecological effects on energy flow through the desert ecosystem are quite different. In the context of energy flow, grasshoppers are more similar to mule deer than to scorpions. Grasshoppers and mule deer are both generalist herbivores that consume a variety of desert plant species. The scorpion, by contrast, is a carnivorous arthropod feeding primarily on insects and thus has an ecological role more similar to that of a kestrel than to that of a grasshopper. In this chapter, we continue the discussion of energy that we began in Chapter 20, describing its flow through ecosystems and the factors that control its movement through different trophic levels. We will also look at the feeding relationships in an ecosystem as an intricate web of interactions among species, a view that has important implications for energy flow and ecosystem function as well as for species interactions and community dynamics (topics that were covered in Units 4 and 5). CONCEPT 21.1 Trophic levels describe the feeding positions of groups of organisms in ecosystems. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 21.1.1 Describe how energy flow among trophic levels in an ecosystem is related to the food selection of consumers. 21.1.2 Explain how both primary production and detritus can be at the base of food chains. 21.1.3 Evaluate how terrestrial detrital energy inputs from outside an ecosystem (allochthonous) would change in a river from its source to where it reaches the ocean. Feeding Relationships In Chapter 20, we introduced Ray Lindeman\u2019s simplified approach to categorizing groups of organisms in an ecosystem according to how they obtain energy (see Figure 20.3). Rather than grouping them by their taxonomic identity, he grouped them into categories based on how they obtained energy in the ecosystem. In this section, we\u2019ll take a closer look at these feeding categories. Organisms can be grouped into trophic levels Each feeding category, or trophic level, is based on the number of feeding steps by which it is separated from autotrophs (FIGURE 21.3). The first trophic level consists of the autotrophs, the primary producers that generate chemical energy from sunlight or inorganic chemical compounds. The first trophic level also generates most of the dead organic matter in an ecosystem, which also provides energy for organisms in the ecosystem. In our desert ecosystem, the first trophic level includes all of the plants, which we lump together to form a single group, regardless of their taxonomic identity. In Lindeman\u2019s lake ecosystem (see Figure 20.3), the first trophic level was composed primarily of dead organic matter, which Lindeman poetically referred to as \u201cooze,\u201d as well as autotrophs such as phytoplankton and pondweeds. The second trophic level consisted of the herbivores that consume autotroph biomass\u2014which in our desert ecosystem would include grasshoppers and mule deer\u2014as well as organisms that consume dead organic matter, called detritivores. The remaining trophic levels (third and up) contain the carnivores that consume animals at the trophic level below them. The primary carnivores constituting the third trophic level in our desert ecosystem would include small birds and scorpions, while examples of the secondary carnivores making up the fourth trophic level would be foxes and birds of prey. Most ecosystems have four or fewer trophic levels. FIGURE 21.3 Trophic Levels in a Desert Ecosystem Each trophic level is characterized by the number of feeding steps by which it is removed from autotrophs (primary producers). Some organisms do not fit conveniently into the trophic levels defined here. Coyotes, for example, are opportunistic feeders, consuming vegetation, mice, other carnivores, and old leather boots. In trophic studies, heterotrophs that feed at multiple trophic levels are called omnivores.1 Such heterotrophs defy our attempt to group organisms into simple feeding categories. However, their diets can be partitioned to reflect how much energy they consume within each trophic level (Pimm 2002). This partitioning is facilitated by the use of stable isotopes to trace food sources (Post 2002a) (see Ecological Toolkit 5.1 and Concept 20.4). Thus, omnivores occupy intermediate trophic levels as determined by the proportions of the foods they consume. Omnivory is common in many ecosystems.", "All organisms are either consumed or end up as detritus All organisms in an ecosystem are either consumed by other organisms at higher trophic levels or enter the pool of dead organic matter, or detritus (Lindeman\u2019s \u201cooze\u201d in Figure 20.3, or as Tom Waits put it, \u201cWe\u2019re all gonna be just dirt in the ground\u201d). In most terrestrial ecosystems, a relatively small proportion of the biomass is consumed, and most of the energy flow passes through detritus (FIGURE 21.4). Because most of this energy flow occurs in the soil, we are not always aware of its magnitude and importance. Dead plant, microbial, and animal matter and feces are consumed by a multitude of detritivores (primarily bacteria, archaea, and fungi) in a process known as decomposition. We will describe decomposition in more detail in Chapter 22 in the context of nutrient cycling. Since detritus is part of the first trophic level, detritivores are placed with herbivores in the second trophic level. Although autotroph-based and detritus-based trophic levels are sometimes considered separately, they are tightly linked through primary production, nutrient cycling, and the many organisms that acquire energy from both plants and detritus. FIGURE 21.4 Ecosystem Energy Flow through Detritus Detritus is consumed by a multitude of organisms, including fungi such as Mycena interrupta in Myrtle Forest and Leopard sea cucumber (Bohadschia argus) in the Great Barrier Reef. Energy flow through detritus is important in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Detritus in terrestrial ecosystems comes primarily from plants within the ecosystem. On the other hand, a large proportion of the input of detritus into stream, lake, and estuarine ecosystems is derived from terrestrial organic matter, which is considered external to the aquatic ecosystem. External energy inputs are referred to as allochthonous inputs, while energy produced by autotrophs within the system is known as autochthonous energy. Allochthonous inputs into aquatic ecosystems include plant leaves, stems, wood, and dissolved organic matter. These inputs fall into the water from adjacent terrestrial ecosystems or flow in via groundwater. Allochthonous inputs tend to be more important in stream and river ecosystems than in lake and marine ecosystems. For example, Bear Brook, a headwater stream in New Hampshire, receives 99.8% of its energy as allochthonous inputs; the rest is net primary production (NPP) derived from benthic algae and mosses in the stream (Fisher and Likens 1973). In contrast, autochthonous energy accounts for almost 80% of the energy in nearby Mirror Lake (Jordan and Likens 1975). Allochthonous energy is often of lower quality, however, because of the chemical composition of the carbon compounds that enter the system. As a result, the fraction of allochthonous energy that is actually used is lower than the inputs would suggest (Pace et al. 2004). The importance of autochthonous energy inputs usually increases from the headwaters toward the middle reaches of a river, in concert with decreases in water velocity and increases in nutrient concentrations, as suggested by the river continuum concept (described in Concept 3.2). As this aquatic example shows, grouping organisms into trophic levels makes it easier to trace the flow of energy through an ecosystem. That flow is the topic to which we\u2019ll turn next. Self-Assessment 21.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 21.2 The amount of energy transferred from one trophic level to the next depends on food quality and on consumer abundance and physiology. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 21.2.1 Describe how the relationship between biomass and energy is influenced by the life span of primary producers. 21.2.2 Summarize the factors that may influence why a greater proportion of net primary production is consumed in aquatic ecosystems relative to terrestrial ecosystems. 21.2.3 Evaluate how consumer thermal physiology, body size, diet preference, and digestive specialization can determine trophic efficiency. Energy Flow between Trophic Levels The second law of thermodynamics states that during any transfer of energy, some energy is dispersed as unusable energy because of the tendency toward an increase in disorder (entropy). Thus, we can expect that the cumulative available energy will decrease with each trophic level as we move from the first trophic level upward. We know from our discussion of primary production in Chapters 5 and 20 that autotrophs and heterotrophs lose chemical energy through cellular respiration, lowering the amount of energy available to the organisms that consume them. In this section, we will examine more closely the factors influencing energy movement between trophic levels.", "Energy flow between trophic levels can be depicted using energy or biomass pyramids A common approach to conceptualizing trophic relationships in an ecosystem is to construct a stack of rectangles, each of which represents the amount of energy or biomass within one trophic level. When assembled from lower to higher trophic levels, these rectangles form a trophic pyramid. By portraying the relative amounts of energy or biomass at each trophic level, these pyramids show us how energy flows through the ecosystem. As we have noted, some of the biomass at each trophic level is not consumed, and a proportion of the energy at each trophic level is lost in the transfer to the next trophic level. Therefore, the rectangles in a trophic energy pyramid always decrease in size as we move from one trophic level to the one above it. In terrestrial ecosystems, energy and biomass pyramids are usually similar because biomass is typically a good proxy for energy (FIGURE 21.5A). In aquatic ecosystems, however, the high consumption rates and the relatively short life spans of the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) can, in some cases, result in a biomass pyramid that is inverted relative to the energy pyramid (FIGURE 21.5B). In other words, the biomass of heterotrophs may be greater at any given time than the biomass of autotrophs. However, the energy produced by the autotrophs is still greater than that produced by the heterotrophs. FIGURE 21.5 Trophic Pyramid Schemes (A) In terrestrial ecosystems, energy and biomass pyramids are usually similar. (B) In many aquatic ecosystems, the biomass pyramid is inverted relative to the energy pyramid. (C) Inverted biomass pyramids in aquatic ecosystems are most common in nutrient-poor waters with low autotroph biomass. (A,B after F. S. Chapin et al. 2002. Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology. Springer-Verlag: New York. C after J. M. Gasol et al. 1997. Limnol Oceanogr 42: 1353\u20131363.) This tendency toward inverted biomass pyramids is greatest where productivity is lowest, such as in nutrient-poor regions of the open ocean (FIGURE 21.5C). The higher proportion of primary consumer biomass relative to producer biomass in these nutrient-poor regions results from a more rapid turnover of phytoplankton, which have higher growth rates and shorter life spans than the phytoplankton of more nutrient-rich waters. Phytoplankton in nutrient-poor regions thus provide a greater energy supply per unit of time (Gasol et al. 1997). In addition, detritus makes a higher proportional contribution to energy flow in these nutrient-poor waters than in nutrient-rich waters. Energy flow between trophic levels differs among ecosystem types What factors determine the amount of energy that flows from one trophic level to the next? In Concept 20.2, we evaluated the factors that influence NPP in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, emphasizing abiotic factors such as climate and nutrient availability as well as differences in the inherent ability of autotroph species to produce biomass. It would be reasonable to assume that the flow of energy to higher trophic levels is associated with the amount of NPP at the base of the food web. As we will see, however, the situation is not quite so simple. The proportion of each trophic level consumed by the one above it; the nutritional content of autotrophs, detritus, and prey; and the efficiency of energy transfers also play roles in determining the flow of energy between trophic levels. A comparison of the proportions of autotroph biomass consumed in terrestrial and in aquatic ecosystems provides some insight into the factors that influence energy flow between trophic levels. When viewed from space, some parts of Earth\u2019s terrestrial surface appear green, while the ocean appears blue. Why is the land surface green and the ocean blue? Furthermore, in Concept 20.2, we saw that very productive lakes (e.g., those that are experimentally fertilized; see Figure 20.15) can appear green. What these green areas have in common is primary productivity that far exceeds rates of herbivory. Herbivores on land consume a much lower proportion of autotroph biomass than do herbivores in most aquatic ecosystems. On average, about 13% of terrestrial NPP is consumed (range 0.1%\u201375%), while in aquatic ecosystems, an average of 35% of NPP is consumed (range 0.3%\u2013100%) (Cebrian and Lartigue 2004). There is a positive relationship between NPP and the amount of biomass consumed by herbivores (FIGURE 21.6). This relationship, which holds within most ecosystem types, would seem to suggest that herbivore production is limited by the amount of food available. Why, then, is the proportion of autotroph biomass consumed in terrestrial ecosystems relatively low?", "If herbivore production is limited by the supply of energy and nutrients from plants, why don\u2019t terrestrial herbivores consume a greater proportion of the biomass that is available? FIGURE 21.6 Consumption of Autotroph Biomass Is Correlated with NPP The amount of autotroph biomass consumed increases with increasing available NPP in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. (After J. Cebrian and J. Lartigue. 2004. Ecol Monogr 74: 237\u2013259.) Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the lower proportion of autotroph biomass consumed in terrestrial ecosystems. First, Hairston and Hairston (1993) have argued that the population growth of herbivores is more constrained by predation in aquatic ecosystems than in terrestrial ecosystems because of the better-developed higher trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems. Predator removal experiments such as those described in Concept 12.4 and Concept 21.4 demonstrate that predators can effectively influence autotroph biomass through their influence on the abundance of herbivores. Second, defenses against herbivory, such as the secondary compounds and structural defenses described in Concept 13.2, lower the amount of autotroph biomass that is consumed. Plants of resource-poor environments, such as desert and tundra, tend to be more strongly defended against herbivory than plants from resource-rich environments. This greater allocation to defense may explain why the proportion of plant biomass consumed is lower in resource-poor terrestrial environments. Unicellular algae make up the bulk of autotroph biomass in aquatic ecosystems, and they generally lack the chemical and structural defenses of their multicellular terrestrial counterparts. Third, the chemical composition of phytoplankton makes them more nutritious for herbivores than terrestrial plants are. Terrestrial plants contain nutrient-poor structural materials such as stems and wood, which are typically absent in aquatic autotrophs. Herbivores typically require large amounts of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus to meet their demands for structural growth, metabolism, and protein synthesis. The ratio of nutrients to carbon (with carbon representing energy) is thus an important measure of food quality. Carbon:nutrient ratios differ markedly between autotrophs in terrestrial and in freshwater ecosystems. Freshwater phytoplankton have carbon:nutrient ratios closer to those of herbivores than terrestrial plants do (Elser et al. 2000) and thus better meet the nutritional needs of the herbivores that eat them. Each of these factors\u2014predation, plant defenses, and food quality\u2014contributes to differences in the proportion of NPP consumed among ecosystems and, in particular, the greater consumption of autotroph biomass in aquatic ecosystems (Shurin et al. 2006). The efficiency of energy transfer varies among consumers Not all of the food energy consumed by a heterotroph gets incorporated into heterotroph biomass. Some is lost to respiration and excretion. We can use the concept of energy efficiency, defined as the output of energy per unit of energy input, to characterize the transfer of energy between trophic levels. In studies of energy transfer in trophic systems, the concept of trophic efficiency is used, defined as the amount of energy at one trophic level divided by the amount of energy at the trophic level immediately below it. Trophic efficiency incorporates the proportion of available energy that is consumed (consumption efficiency), the proportion of ingested food that is assimilated by the consumer (assimilation efficiency), and the proportion of assimilated food that goes into producing new consumer biomass (production efficiency) (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 21.7). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 21.7 Energy Flow and Trophic Efficiency The proportion of energy transferred between trophic levels depends on efficiencies of consumption, assimilation, and production. (After F. S. Chapin et al. 2002. Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology. Springer-Verlag: New York.) How do the trends in consumption efficiency vary in Figure 21.6? What does this variation suggest about differences in consumption efficiency in aquatic versus terrestrial ecosystems? As we saw above, not all of the biomass available at one trophic level is consumed by the next trophic level. The proportion of the available biomass that is ingested is the consumption efficiency. Consumption efficiency is typically higher in aquatic ecosystems than in terrestrial ecosystems (see Figure 21.6). Consumption efficiencies also tend to be higher for carnivores than for herbivores, although a systematic survey comparing the two groups has not been done. Once biomass is ingested by the consumer, it must be assimilated by the digestive system before the energy it contains can be used to produce new biomass. The proportion of the ingested food that is assimilated is the assimilation efficiency. Food that is ingested but not assimilated is lost to the environment as feces, entering the pool of detritus, or as urine.", "Assimilation efficiency is determined by the quality of the food (its chemical composition) and the physiology of the consumer. The quality of the food available to herbivores and detritivores is generally lower than that of the food available to carnivores. Plants and detritus are composed of relatively complex carbon compounds, such as cellulose, lignins, and humic acids, that are not easily digested. In addition, plants and detritus have low concentrations of nutrients. Animal bodies, on the other hand, have carbon:nutrient ratios that are usually very similar to those of the animals consuming them and so are assimilated more readily. Assimilation efficiencies of herbivores and detritivores vary between 20% and 50%, while those of carnivores are about 80%. How thoroughly food is digested is influenced by the consumer\u2019s thermal physiology and the complexity of the consumer\u2019s digestive system. Endotherms tend to digest food more completely than ectotherms, due to higher thermal stability and a tendency to have a more developed digestive system, and therefore have higher assimilation efficiencies. Additionally, some herbivores have mutualistic symbionts that help them digest cellulose. For example, as described in Concept 5.4, ruminants have a modified stomach chamber that contains bacteria and protists that increase the breakdown of cellulose-rich foods. This mutualistic symbiosis, coupled with a longer period of digestion, gives ruminants higher assimilation efficiencies than nonruminant herbivores. Assimilated food can be used to produce new biomass in the form of consumer growth and production of new consumer individuals (reproduction). However, a portion of the assimilated food must be used for respiration associated with maintenance of existing molecules and tissues as well as with construction of new biomass (see Concept 5.4). The proportion of the assimilated food that is used to produce new consumer biomass is production efficiency. Production efficiency is strongly related to the thermal physiology and size of the consumer. Endotherms allocate much of their assimilated food to metabolic production of heat and therefore have less energy left over to allocate to growth and reproduction than ectotherms do (TABLE 21.1). Thus, ectotherms have considerably higher production efficiencies than endotherms. Body size in endotherms is an important determinant of heat loss and thus of production efficiency. If body shape and insulation (fat, feathers, and fur) are held constant, then, as animal body size increases, the surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. Thus, a small endotherm, such as a shrew, will lose a greater proportion of its internally generated heat across its body surface than a large endotherm, such as a grizzly bear, and thus a small endotherm will tend to have a lower production efficiency than a large endotherm.

Trophic efficiencies can influence population dynamics Changes in food quantity and quality, and the resulting changes in trophic efficiency, can determine the consumer population sizes that can be sustained, as well as the health of the individuals in consumer populations. Here we\u2019ll examine the potential contribution of changes in food quality to the decline in numbers of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in Alaska. From the late 1970s into the 1990s, the total population of Steller sea lions in the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands decreased by about 80%, from approximately 250,000 sea lions in 1975 to 50,000 in 2000 (FIGURE 21.8). The population in the eastern part of the range has recovered some since that time, and the species was taken off the endangered list in 2013. However, the population in the western part of its range, along the southern coast of Alaska, has continued to decline. Andrew Trites and C. P. Donnelly reviewed the available information to try to determine possible causes for this decline (Trites and Donnelly 2003). They found that individual sea lions collected during the period of decline were smaller than individuals within the same age classes collected before the start of the decline. There was also a reduction in the number of pups born per female during this period, which resulted in a shift in the age structure toward older individuals. No evidence was found for outbreaks of disease or parasites.", "The smaller body sizes and declining birth rates suggested that there were fewer prey available, or that the available prey were not providing sufficient nourishment to sustain the sea lions\u2014in other words, that trophic efficiency had declined. Additional data indicated that the sea lions were obtaining prey\u2014primarily fish\u2014as regularly as they had before the decline. Nursing females in the declining population were actually spending less time hunting for the same amount of fish as nursing females in other populations that were not declining. Therefore, the availability of prey, or the sea lions\u2019 ability to capture it, did not appear to be limiting their growth and reproduction. FIGURE 21.8 Steller Sea Lion Population Decline in Alaska The population of sea lions in the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands decreased by about 80% over 25 years. (After A. W. Trites and C. P. Donnelly. 2003. Mamm Rev 33: 3\u201328; based on A. W. Trites and P. A. Larkin. 1996. Aquat Mamm 22: 153\u2013166; A. W. Trites, unpublished data.) Trites and Donnelly considered the possibility that changes in the species of prey fish available had contributed to the decline of the Steller sea lions. They and others suggested that the decline might be related to declining prey quality, an idea they referred to as the \u201cjunk food hypothesis.\u201d Prior to the decline, the diet of the sea lions had been primarily herring, a fish that is relatively rich in fats, along with small amounts of pollock, cod, salmon, and squid. During the period of the population decline, the sea lions\u2019 diet shifted away from herring toward a greater proportion of pollock and cod (TABLE 21.2). This change in diet reflected a shift toward cod dominance of the fish community from the 1970s through the 1990s. The causes of the change in fish community composition are uncertain but may be associated with overfishing, oil spills, disease, and long-term climate change. The proportions of fat and energy per mass of pollock and cod are approximately half those of herring. Captive Steller sea lions raised on a diet of herring and then switched to a diet of pollock lose body mass and fat, even with an unlimited supply of pollock.

L. Merrick et al. 1997. Can J Fish Aquat Sci 54: 1342\u20131348. Based on their review of the available information, Trites and Donnelly concluded that nutritional stress was the most likely cause of the decline in the Steller sea lion population. The amount of prey available to the sea lions did not appear to have changed, but changes in the quality of that prey, and associated changes in trophic efficiency, contributed to the decline in the population through their effects on individual growth rates and birth rates. Others have suggested that the decline in Steller sea lion numbers may also be linked to changes in the trophic structure of the North Pacific (Springer et al. 2003). As described in the Case Study Revisited in Chapter 9, massive harvesting of great whales by humans in the mid-twentieth century may have forced their predators, killer whales, to hunt other prey, including Steller sea lions. As we describe in the next section, such \u201ctop-down\u201d effects of predators on prey can have important consequences for energy flow in ecosystems. Self-Assessment 21.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 21.3 Changes in the abundances of organisms at one trophic level can influence energy flow at multiple trophic levels. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 21.3.1 Compare the factors that influence energy flow in an ecosystem between bottom-up and top-down perspectives. 21.3.2 Describe how changes in the abundance of organisms at the fourth trophic level may impact rates of primary production through a trophic cascade. 21.3.3 Explain how the size of an ecosystem, the rates of disturbance, and the amount of primary production can influence the number of trophic levels. Trophic Cascades There are two possible ways to look at the control of energy flow through ecosystems.", "First, the amount of energy that flows through trophic levels may be determined by how much energy enters an ecosystem via NPP, which in turn is related to the supply of resources (as we saw in Concept 20.2 and 21.2). The greater the NPP entering the ecosystem, the more energy can be passed on to higher trophic levels. This view, which is often referred to as \u201cbottom-up\u201d control of energy flow, holds that the resources that limit NPP determine energy flow through an ecosystem (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 21.9A). Alternatively, energy flow may be governed by rates of consumption (as well as other, nonconsumptive interactions such as competition and facilitation, as discussed in Concept 16.3) at the highest trophic levels, which influence abundances and species composition at multiple trophic levels below them. This view is often referred to as \u201ctop-down\u201d control of energy flow (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 21.9B). In reality, both bottom-up and top-down controls are operating simultaneously in ecosystems, but the top-down view has important implications for the effects of trophic interactions on energy flow in ecosystems. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 21.9 Bottom-Up and Top-Down Control of NPP Production in an ecosystem can be viewed as being controlled (A) by limiting resources or (B) by controls exerted on the species composition and abundances of autotrophs by consumption at higher trophic levels. Trophic interactions can trickle down through multiple trophic levels Changes in abundance or species composition at one trophic level can lead to important changes in abundance and species composition at other trophic levels. For example, an increase in the rate of predation by a carnivore at the fourth trophic level on carnivores at the third trophic level would lead to a lower rate of consumption of herbivores at the second trophic level. More herbivory would decrease the abundance of autotrophs and would therefore lower rates of NPP. Nonconsumptive species interactions, such as competition, can have similar top-down effects on abundance and species composition at lower trophic levels, as we\u2019ll see shortly. Such a series of changes in abundance and species composition is referred to as a trophic cascade. Our understanding of trophic cascades comes primarily from aquatic ecosystems, although there are examples from terrestrial ecosystems as well. Several generalizations have been drawn from studies of these interactions. First, trophic cascades are most often associated with changes in the abundance of top specialist predators. Second, omnivory may act to buffer the effects of trophic cascades through the consumption of prey at multiple trophic levels. Finally, trophic cascades have been hypothesized to be most important in relatively simple, species-poor ecosystems. However, several recent experiments have demonstrated trophic cascades in ecosystems with relatively high species diversity. AN AQUATIC TROPHIC CASCADE Many examples of trophic cascades come from unintended experiments associated with introductions of non-native species or near extinctions of native species. A classic example of the latter type is the interaction among sea otters (Enhydra lutris), sea urchins, and killer whales on the west coast of North America, which was discussed in the Case Study Revisited in Chapter 9. Unfortunately, there is no shortage of examples of trophic cascades associated with the intentional or unintentional introduction of non-native species. One such example resulted from the release of brown trout (Salmo trutta), a popular sport fish, into streams and lakes of New Zealand. The stocking of Kiwi waters by European settlers began in the 1860s, and by 1920 an estimated 60 million fish had been released throughout New Zealand. Native fish populations have declined as a result, and some species have disappeared from streams now dominated by trout. Alexander Flecker and Colin Townsend (1994) investigated the influence of the brown trout on the species composition of its prey (primarily stream insects) and associated effects on primary production in the Shag River. Brown trout were originally released into the Shag River in 1869 by the \u201cOtago Acclimatisation Society\u201d to make settlers feel more at home. The Shag River is one of a small number of streams in New Zealand that still holds both native fish and trout in the same sections. Native fish species include the common river galaxias (Galaxias vulgaris). The morphology and feeding behavior of galaxias are similar to those of trout, as indicated by the common name for the galaxias, Maori trout. Flecker and Townsend compared the effects of brown trout and galaxias on stream invertebrate species composition and abundance as well as on primary production by algae.", "To manipulate fish presence and absence, they constructed artificial stream channels adjacent to the natural channel, made of 5-m lengths of half-cylinders of PVC pipe. The PVC channels had mesh on the ends that kept fish in or out but allowed free movement of stream invertebrates and algae. The researchers placed clean gravel and stone cobbles in the bottoms of the channels to provide a substrate for the invertebrates and algae. The channels were allowed to accumulate algae and invertebrates for 10 days before the fish were added. Three treatments were initiated: channels with introduced brown trout, channels with galaxias, and channels with no fish (controls). Eight fish of similar size and mass were used for each fish species addition. The experiment was run for 10 days, after which samples were collected to determine invertebrate species composition and abundance and algal biomass. Flecker and Townsend had expected brown trout to decrease invertebrate diversity more than the native galaxias, but the effect of fish on invertebrate diversity was relatively small and did not differ between the two fish species. The brown trout, however, reduced total invertebrate density by approximately 40% relative to the control channels, while galaxias resulted in a smaller reduction (FIGURE 21.10A). The abundance of algae increased with both fish, but the effect was greater in the channels with trout (FIGURE 21.10B). Flecker and Townsend suggested that the effect on algal biomass was the result of a trophic cascade in which fish predation not only reduced the density of stream invertebrates, but also caused them to spend more time in refugia on the stream bottom rather than feeding on algae. The trout had a much greater effect on invertebrate density, and thus on primary production, than the native galaxias. These results suggested that trophic cascades associated with the stocking of non-native fish for sport may have consequences not just for native biodiversity, but for the functioning of stream ecosystems as well. FIGURE 21.10 An Aquatic Trophic Cascade Flecker and Townsend used artificial stream channels to study the effects of non-native brown trout and a native fish (galaxias) on stream invertebrates and algae in the Shag River, New Zealand. (A) Effects on invertebrate density. (B) Effects on algal biomass, as estimated using chlorophyll concentrations in stream water. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After A. S. Flecker and C. R. Townsend. 1994. Ecol Appl 4: 798\u2013807.) What factor other than overall consumption rate might explain why the presence of brown trout results in a larger increase in primary production than the presence of native galaxias? A TERRESTRIAL TROPHIC CASCADE As mentioned earlier, trophic cascades have been most commonly observed in aquatic ecosystems, where they are more frequent and their effects are stronger than in terrestrial ecosystems (Shurin et al. 2002). Terrestrial ecosystems are generally thought to be more complex than aquatic ecosystems. In addition, it was believed that a decrease in the abundance of one species in a terrestrial ecosystem was more likely to be compensated for by an increase in the abundances of similar species that were not being consumed as heavily. Thus, trophic cascades were considered unlikely in diverse terrestrial ecosystems such as tropical forests. Lee Dyer and Deborah Letourneau (1999a) tested the effects of a potential trophic cascade on the production of Piper cenocladum trees in the understory of a lowland tropical rainforest in Costa Rica. Piper cenocladum is a relatively common component of the understory in these forests and is eaten by dozens of different herbivore species. Ants of the genus Pheidole live in chambers in the petioles of the leaves of the Piper trees. The ants eat food bodies provided by the trees, and they also consume herbivores that attack the trees. These ants, in turn, are eaten by beetles of the genus Tarsobaenus. Thus, four distinct trophic levels exist in this system (FIGURE 21.11). Dyer and Letourneau had previously noted that plant biomass was lower, and rates of herbivory were higher, when densities of Tarsobaenus beetles were high. They performed experiments to test whether a trophic cascade involving the beetles, ants, and herbivores influenced the production of the Piper trees and how strong that influence was, compared with that of bottom-up factors such as light and soil fertility. FIGURE 21.11 A Terrestrial Trophic Cascade Trophic interactions in the understory ecosystem of a lowland tropical rainforest in Costa Rica. Piper cenocladum trees are consumed by herbivores but provide shelter for Pheidole ants, which consume herbivores attacking the trees.", "Pheidole ants are consumed by Tarsobaenus beetles. Both ants and beetles also consume food bodies produced by the trees. (After L. A. Dyer and D. K. Letourneau. 1999a. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96: 5072\u20135076. \u00a9 1999 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.) Dyer and Letourneau established experimental plots in the understory by planting uniform-sized cuttings of Piper trees. They treated two groups of plots with an insecticide to kill any ants present, then added Tarsobaenus beetle larvae to one of those groups of plots. This procedure established three groups of treatment plots: one group of insecticide-treated plots with beetles, one control group of insecticide-treated plots without beetles, and one control group of untreated plots. In the plots with beetles, the insecticide treatment facilitated the establishment of the beetles by preventing ant attacks on the beetle larvae. In addition, half of the plots were on a relatively fertile soil type, and the other half were on a relatively infertile soil type. Natural light levels in the plots were also varied such that half of the plots were assigned to a highlight treatment and half to a low-light treatment. Dyer and Letourneau maintained these treatments for 18 months and measured herbivory and leaf production within each of the plots. If the production of the Piper trees was limited primarily by resource supply (bottom-up control), then the addition of the Tarsobaenus beetles would be expected to have little effect on Piper leaf production. Soil fertility and light levels would be expected to have greater effects on leaf production if these effects were more important than the influence of the trophic cascade associated with beetles, ants, and herbivores (topdown control). Dyer and Letourneau found, however, that the trophic cascade was the only significant influence on leaf production. The addition of the predatory beetles decreased ant abundance fivefold, increased rates of herbivory threefold, and decreased leaf area per tree to half that in the control plots (FIGURE 21.12). This experiment provided convincing evidence of a trophic cascade affecting the production of the Piper trees. It should be noted, however, that the lack of an effect of soil fertility and light in the control treatments, which had low rates of herbivory, indicates that the resource(s) that actually limit production may not have been manipulated in this experiment. An additional experiment that used more controlled manipulation of light levels and soil nutrients, rather than relying on variation in natural levels, found significant effects of these resources on Piper production, but it also found a continued strong effect of herbivory (Dyer and Letourneau 1999b). Thus, it is clear that trophic cascades do occur in diverse terrestrial ecosystems, although they may require strong interactions between specialist predators and their prey. FIGURE 21.12 Effects of a Trophic Cascade on Production A trophic cascade in a tropical rainforest understory ecosystem (see Figure 21.11) was shown to have important effects on (A) predation, (B) herbivory, and (C) production. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (After L. A. Dyer and D. K. Letourneau. 1999a. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96: 5072\u2013 5076. \u00a9 1999 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.) What determines the number of trophic levels? What determines the variation in the number of trophic levels that occur among different ecosystems, and why do so few ecosystems have five or more trophic levels? These questions are not simply academic. Through trophic cascades, the number of trophic levels in an ecosystem can influence movements of energy and nutrients as well as the potential for toxins in the environment to become concentrated at higher trophic levels, as we will see in this chapter\u2019s Case Study Revisited. Change in the number of trophic levels may be due to the addition or loss of a predator at the top of the food web, the insertion or loss of a predator in the middle of the food web, or changes in omnivore feeding preference for foods at different trophic levels (FIGURE 21.13). FIGURE 21.13 Changes in the Number of Trophic Levels Circles represent species at different trophic levels, and the thickness of the arrows represents the amount of energy flowing between species pairs. Differences among ecosystems in the number of trophic levels may occur because of (A) the addition or loss of a consumer at the top level, (B) the insertion or loss of a consumer at an intermediate level, or (C) a change in the preferred feeding level of an omnivore. (After D. M. Post and G. Takimoto. 2007. Oikos 116: 775\u2013782.)", "Several interacting ecological factors can control the number of trophic levels in ecosystems (Post 2002b). First, the amount of energy entering an ecosystem through primary production has been proposed as a determinant of the number of trophic levels. Because a relatively large amount of energy is lost in the transfer from one trophic level to the next, the more energy there is entering a system, the more is potentially available to support viable populations of higher-level predators (see ANALYZING DATA 21.1). However, this explanation appears to be important primarily in ecosystems with low resource availability. Second, the frequency of disturbances or other agents of change, such as disease outbreaks, can determine whether populations of higher-level predators can be sustained. Because lower trophic levels are required to sustain higher trophic levels, there is a longer time lag for the reestablishment of the higher trophic levels following a disturbance. If disturbances occur frequently, then higher trophic levels may never become established, no matter how much energy is entering the system (Pimm and Lawton 1977). While some support for this hypothesis exists, the ability of some organisms to adapt to frequent disturbances and the potential for rapid colonization of disturbed sites (see Concept 17.1) result in a smaller effect of disturbance on trophic level number than expected. Finally, the area of an ecosystem can influence the number of trophic levels. Larger ecosystems support larger population sizes, which are less prone to local extinction (see Concept 11.3). Larger ecosystems also have more habitat heterogeneity and thus tend to have higher species diversity. ANALYZING DATA 21.1 Support for the effect of ecosystem size on the number of trophic levels is derived primarily from studies of lakes and oceanic islands, ecosystems with discrete boundaries. For example, Gaku Takimoto and colleagues (2008) tested the relative effects of disturbance and island size on the number of trophic levels on 36 islands in the Bahamas. The effect of disturbance was tested by examining 33 of the smaller islands that were either exposed to (19 islands) or protected from (14 islands) storm surges. The number of trophic levels was estimated using isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen (as described in Concept 20.4) in tissues from the top predators, spiders and lizards. Takimoto and colleagues found that exposure to storm surges had no effect on the number of trophic levels. However, disturbance did influence the identity of the top predators: orb spiders were more frequently the top predators on exposed islands, and Anolis lizards were at the apex of the food web on protected islands. Island size, however, was strongly correlated with the number of trophic levels (FIGURE 21.14), providing evidence that ecosystem size can influence the number of trophic levels in a terrestrial ecosystem. FIGURE 21.14 Ecosystem Size Is Correlated with the Number of Trophic Levels On islands in the Bahamas, Takimoto and colleagues found that as island size increased, the number of trophic levels also increased. (After G. Takimoto et al. 2008. Ecology 89: 3001\u20133007.) We turn our attention next to a more detailed investigation of trophic relationships in ecosystems as we cross the disciplinary boundaries of ecosystem ecology and community ecology (the topic of Unit 5) to examine how energy flow can influence the diversity and stability of communities and ecosystems. Self-Assessment 21.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 21.4 Food webs are conceptual models of the trophic interactions of organisms in an ecosystem. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 21.4.1 Explain how food webs are helpful for envisioning ecosystem energy flow, and outline the factors that compromise their accuracy in portraying the full extent of interactions among organisms. 21.4.2 Describe how the use of interaction strengths can aid in the construction of more accurate food web models. 21.4.3 Summarize how ecologists have viewed the relationship between the complexity of food webs and the stability of associated communities and ecosystem processes. Food Webs Ever since Charles Darwin, in The Origin of Species (1859), described \u201ca tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, \u2026 dependent upon each other in so complex a manner,\u201d the interdependence of species has been a central concept in ecology. When we examine these links among species with a focus on feeding relations, they can be described by a food web, a diagram showing the connections among organisms and the food they consume.", "For the desert ecosystem we considered at the start of this chapter, we can construct a simplified food web showing that plants are consumed by insects and ground squirrels and that these herbivores are food for scorpions, eagles, and foxes (FIGURE 21.15A). In this way, we can begin to understand qualitatively how energy flows from one component of this ecosystem to another, and how that energy flow may influence changes in population sizes and the species composition of communities. FIGURE 21.15 Desert Food Webs Food webs may be simple or complex depending on their purpose. (A) A simple six-member food web for a representative North American desert. (B) Addition of more participants to the food web adds realism, but the inclusion of additional species adds complexity. Food webs are complex The desert food web in Figure 21.15A is far from complete. Depending on our purposes, we may wish to add other organisms and links to the food web, providing additional complexity. For example, the scorpion consumes insects such as the grasshopper, but like the grasshopper, it may be food for birds such as shrikes and owls (FIGURE 21.16). In order to add greater realism, it is important to recognize that the feeding relationships of animals can span multiple trophic levels (omnivory) and may even include cannibalism (half-circle arrows in Figure 21.16) (Polis 1991). FIGURE 21.16 Food Webs Can Be Complex In this North American desert food web, complexity overwhelms any interpretation of interactions among the members. Even this food web, however, lacks the majority of the trophic interactions in the ecosystem. (From G. A. Polis. 1991. Am Nat 138: 123\u2013155.) How many of the organisms or feeding groups depicted in this food web consume both plants and animals as food sources? What does this suggest about the frequency of omnivory in this food web? Although food webs are useful conceptual tools, even a simplified food web is a static description of energy flow and trophic interactions in a temporally dynamic ecosystem. Actual trophic interactions can change over time (Wilbur 1997). Some organisms alter their feeding patterns as they age. Maturing frogs, for example, make the transition from omnivorous aquatic tadpoles to carnivorous adults. Some animals, such as migratory birds, are relatively mobile and are thus components of multiple food webs. Furthermore, most food webs fail to account for additional biological interactions among organisms that influence population and community dynamics, such as pollination mutualisms. (In community studies, this problem may be addressed by the use of interaction webs, as described in Figure 16.5.) The critically important roles of microorganisms are often ignored as well, despite their processing of a substantial amount of the energy moving through ecosystems. What are food webs good for, then? Despite these apparent shortcomings, food webs are important conceptual tools for understanding the dynamics of species interactions and energy flow in ecosystems and hence the community and population dynamics of their component organisms. The strengths of trophic interactions are variable As indicated in the quote from Darwin above and in earlier chapters, a core concept of ecological thought is that \u201ceverything is connected to everything else.\u201d However, the links among the species in an ecosystem vary in their importance to energy flow and species population dynamics; in other words, not all connections are equally important. Some trophic relationships play larger roles than others in dictating how energy flows through the ecosystem. Interaction strength is a measure of the effect of the population of one species on the population size of another species (see Ecological Toolkit 16.1). Determining interaction strengths is an important goal of ecologists because it helps us simplify the \u201cspaghetti\u201d in a complex food web by focusing attention on those links that are most important for basic research and conservation. How are interaction strengths determined? Several approaches have been used. Removal experiments, like those described in Concept 16.3 to determine competition or facilitation, can be employed, but performing such experimental removals to quantify every link in a food web would be logistically overwhelming. Therefore, much current ecological research is devoted to discovering simpler, less direct measures that can still give us a reliable estimate of the relative importance of different links. For example, simple food webs can be coupled with observations of the feeding preferences of predators and of changes in the population sizes of predators and prey over time to provide an estimate of which interactions are the strongest.", "Similarly, comparisons of two or more food webs in which a predator or prey species is present in some but absent in others may provide evidence for the relative importance of links. Predator and prey body sizes have been used to predict the strengths of predator\u2013prey interactions because feeding rate is known to be related to metabolic rate, which in turn is governed by body size. The best estimates of interaction strengths in food webs often come from a combination of these approaches. A series of classic studies examining interaction strengths in food webs was performed in rocky intertidal zones of the Pacific Northwest by Robert Paine. Paine (1966) had observed that the diversity of organisms in rocky intertidal zones declined as the density of predators decreased. He reasoned that some of those predators might be playing a greater role than others in controlling the diversity of these communities. One of Paine\u2019s critical observations was that one mussel species (Mytilus californianus) had the ability to overgrow and smother many of the other sessile invertebrate species that compete with it for space. Paine hypothesized that predators might play a key role in maintaining diversity in this community by consuming these mussels and preventing them from competitively excluding other species. To test these hypotheses, Paine conducted an experiment in Washington State in which he removed the top predator in the system, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, from experimental plots. Pisaster feeds primarily on bivalves and barnacles and to a lesser extent on other mollusks, including chitons, limpets, and a predatory whelk (Nucella sp.) (FIGURE 21.17). Following the continuous manual removal of Pisaster from 16-m2 plots, acorn barnacles (Balanus glandula) became more abundant, but with time, they were crowded out by mussels (Mytilus) and gooseneck barnacles (Pollicipes spp.). After 2\u00bd years, the number of species in the community had decreased from 15 to 8. Even 5 years after the experiment began, when sea stars were no longer being removed, dominance by the mussels continued, as individual mussels had grown to sizes that prevented predation by sea stars, and diversity remained lower in the experimental plots than in adjacent control plots (Paine et al. 1985). Experimental removals of higher-level predators in other intertidal zones, including one in New Zealand, which shares no species with the intertidal zone of the Pacific Northwest, resulted in similar reductions in diversity. Predators in these intertidal ecosystems are thus key to maintaining species diversity by preventing competitive exclusion. Such species are more important in food webs than their numbers would indicate. FIGURE 21.17 An Intertidal Food Web This food web from the rocky intertidal zone of Mukkaw Bay, Washington State, was used by Robert Paine to investigate the strength of the interaction between the sea star Pisaster ochraceus and its prey. (After R. T. Paine. 1966. Am Nat 100: 65\u201375.) The experimental research of Paine and others was an encouraging advance in ecology because it demonstrated that, despite the potential complexity of trophic interactions among species, patterns of energy flow and community structure might be governed by a small subset of those species. Paine called animals like it Pisaster keystone species, defining them as species that have a greater influence on energy flow and community composition than their abundance or biomass would predict (see Figure 16.16). The keystone species concept has become an important focus in ecology and conservation biology because it implies that protecting such species may be critical for protection of the many other species that depend on them (as we\u2019ll see in Concept 23.5). Many keystone species are predators at higher trophic levels, which tend to have large effects on prey populations relative to their own abundance. Some species act as keystone species in only part of their geographic range, suggesting that interaction strengths are dependent on the environmental context. Several studies, including those described in Figure 16.19 and Ecological Toolkit 16.1, have found context-dependent variation in the degree to which species behave as keystone species. Thus, while the keystone species concept is intuitively simple, predicting when and where a particular species will behave as a keystone species remains a challenge. One reason it remains difficult to predict the strength of trophic interactions is that the ecological importance of a keystone predator such as Pisaster manifests itself not only through one strong link, such as that between Pisaster and mussels, but also through strong indirect effects (see Figure 16.11), such as the effects Pisaster has on other species by reducing the abundance of mussels.", "If Pisaster consumed only the species that are inferior competitors for space (such as barnacles), it would not play a keystone role in the rocky intertidal community. Thus, predicting the effects of species losses on the remaining community requires an understanding of not only the strengths of individual links, but also the strengths of chains of indirect effects. Does complexity enhance stability in food webs? Ecologists have pondered whether more complex food webs\u2014those with more species and more links among them\u2014are more stable than simpler food webs with lower diversity and fewer links. Stability, in this context, is usually evaluated by the magnitude of changes in the population sizes of the organisms in the food web over time. Stability may also be expressed through ecosystem processes such as primary production. As we saw in Chapter 11, large oscillations in population size over time increase the susceptibility of species to local extinction. Thus, a less stable food web means a greater potential for extinction of its component species. The question of stability is taking on ever greater importance with increasing rates of biodiversity loss and non-native species invasions worldwide, which have significant implications for ecosystem function. Early proponents of the idea that food web complexity increases stability based their arguments on observations of real trophic interactions as well as on intuition. Ecologists such as Charles Elton and Eugene Odum argued that simpler, less diverse food webs should be more easily perturbed, experience larger changes in species population densities, and experience greater species losses as a result. More rigorous mathematical analyses of food webs, however, provided a contrary view. Robert May (1973) used food webs made up of random assemblages of organisms to demonstrate that food webs with higher diversity are less stable than those with lower diversity. The instability in May\u2019s models resulted from accentuation of population fluctuations by strong trophic interactions: the more interacting species there were, the more likely that their population fluctuations would reinforce one another, leading to the extinction of one or more of the species. May\u2019s work overturned the notion that more complex systems are inherently more stable than simpler ones. Yet anyone visiting a tropical rainforest or a coral reef can attest to the fact that highly diverse, productive, and complex communities do persist in nature. Therefore, much ecological research has been devoted to discovering the factors that allow naturally complex food webs to be stable. More recent models, for example, have incorporated distributions of interaction strengths more closely resembling those observed in nature. These models and experiments suggest that, while more complex systems are not necessarily more stable, some natural food webs may have a particular structure or organization that allows increased species diversity to have a stabilizing effect. Other studies suggest that the buffering influence of weak interactions (McCann et al. 1998; Neutel et al. 2002) and of behavioral or evolutionary changes in prey choice (Kondoh 2003) can help to reduce the population fluctuations associated with complex food webs. Additionally, the identity of the species in a food web is important to its behavior, with some species exerting a disproportionally greater influence on stability, and others being more likely to go extinct (Lawler 1993). How diversity at one trophic level affects the stability of populations at other trophic levels has also been of interest to ecologists, particularly in the context of biodiversity loss (as we will see in Concept 23.3). Elton (1958) proposed that plant diversity influences diversity at higher trophic levels, with greater plant diversity stabilizing animal populations. We saw in Concept 19.4 that plant production is often higher in more diverse communities and that more diverse plant communities are better able to recover from disturbances. Do these properties convey greater stability to higher trophic levels? Nick Haddad and colleagues set out to test this hypothesis, using experimental prairie plots established by David Tilman at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Minnesota (Haddad et al. 2011). They studied the abundance and species composition of arthropod (primarily insect and spider) communities in plots with 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 plant species over an 11-year period. A total of 733 different arthropod species were sampled during this period. These arthropods were divided into communities by their feeding preferences, which included detritivores, herbivores, predators, and parasitoids. Stability was evaluated by the amount of change in the abundances of individuals within populations and communities. Haddad et al. found that, in general, the arthropod communities were more stable in the plots with higher plant diversity.", "However, not all arthropod communities exhibited the same relationship between plant diversity and stability. Populations of specialist herbivores (those that eat one or a few species of plants) had lower stability with increases in plant diversity. In contrast, the community of all herbivores showed greater stability with increasing plant diversity. The researchers suggested that the underlying mechanisms by which plant diversity influences arthropod community stability include greater and more stable plant biomass and increased diversity in the arthropod communities (FIGURE 21.18). Higher plant diversity was linked to greater predator abundance and diversity through its influence on habitat diversity. These predators may exert top-down effects on herbivore and plant abundances (trophic cascades). Haddad et al. also suggested that community stability is enhanced by a portfolio effect, in which variation in the population of one species cancels out variation in another such that overall abundance in the community remains the same. Greater diversity among the arthropods would lead to a greater probability of the portfolio effect. The researchers concluded that plant diversity in the prairie ecosystem provides services to humans not only in the form of potential biofuels, but also by keeping arthropod communities more stable and preventing outbreaks of insects that can be problematic for crops and forests. FIGURE 21.18 Plant Diversity and Stability in Food Webs Greater plant diversity enhanced the stability of arthropod communities in experimental plots. The potential mechanisms of this effect include greater and more stable plant biomass. Plant diversity, which is associated with greater habitat complexity, may be associated with greater abundance and diversity of predators, which may lead to greater top-down influences on herbivores and plants (trophic cascades). In addition, plant diversity enhances the diversity of the arthropod community as a whole, enhancing portfolio effects, which keep overall abundance stable. (After N. M. Haddad et al. 2011.

Self-Assessment 21.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Toxins in Remote Places Knowledge of how energy flows through the trophic levels of ecosystems is key to understanding the environmental effects of persistent organic pollutants like those described in this chapter\u2019s Case Study. Some chemical compounds taken up by organisms, either directly from the environment or by consumption with their food, can become concentrated in their tissues. For a variety of reasons, these compounds are not metabolized or excreted, so they become progressively more concentrated in the body over the organism\u2019s lifetime, a process known as bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation can lead to increasing tissue concentrations of these compounds in animals at successively higher trophic levels as animals at each trophic level consume prey with higher concentrations of the compounds. This process is known as biomagnification (FIGURE 21.19). The POPs we discussed at the beginning of this chapter are particularly susceptible to these processes. FIGURE 21.19 Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification Levels of mercury (a toxic heavy metal) show bioaccumulation and biomagnification in a Czech pond ecosystem. (After P. Houserov\u00e1 et al. 2007. Environ Pollut 145: 185\u2013194.) The potential dangers associated with bioaccumulation and biomagnification of POPs were well publicized by Rachel Carson\u2019s book Silent Spring, published in 1962, in which she described the devastating effects that pesticides, particularly DDT, were having on nontarget bird and mammal populations. DDT was thought of as a \u201cmiracle\u201d insecticide during the 1940s and 1950s, when it was widely used to control a variety of crop and garden pests and disease vectors. However, DDT was also accumulating in higher-level predators as a result of biomagnification, and it contributed to the near extinction of some birds of prey, including the peregrine falcon and the bald eagle. In Silent Spring, Carson described the persistence of DDT in the environment, its accumulation in the tissues of consumers, including humans, and its health hazards. Because of Carson\u2019s careful documentation and her ability to convey her message in a well-crafted manner that could be appreciated by the general public, Silent Spring led to increased scrutiny of the use of chemical pesticides, which eventually resulted in a ban on the manufacture and use of DDT in the United States. The concept of biomagnification led researchers to suspect that the high concentrations of POPs found in the Inuit resulted from their position at the highest trophic levels of the Arctic ecosystem. This suspicion was reinforced by comparisons of the concentrations of toxins among different Inuit communities.", "The highest concentrations of toxins were found in communities that consumed marine mammals such as whales, seals, and walruses\u2014animals that occupy the third, fourth, or fifth trophic levels (see ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 21.1 for consideration of biomagnification in polar bears in the Arctic). Inhabitants of communities where herbivorous caribou (at the second trophic level) were a more important part of the diet had lower concentrations of toxins. The Inuit preference for foods rich in fatty tissues, such as whale blubber (muktuk), poses a problem as well because many POPs are preferentially stored in the fatty tissues of animals. Although emissions of some POPs and other pollutants are declining globally as awareness of their effects increases and regulations are put in place, the potential for long-term persistence of these compounds in the Arctic environment means that their effects may not disappear any time soon (Pearce 1997). While the cold temperatures and relatively low light levels in the Arctic limit the chemical breakdown of POPs, their concentrations have gradually decreased in lake sediments. There has also been a gradual decline in the concentrations of some POPs and heavy metals in the blood of Inuit individuals, but new emerging POPs and mercury continue to be a concern for public health. While switching to alternative food sources might seem to be a potential solution to the problem, the cultural identity of the Inuit is strongly associated with their hunting traditions and their diet, and they would be unlikely to make such a switch easily. CONNECTIONS in NATURE BIOLOGICAL TRANSPORT OF POLLUTANTS Pollutants have been reported in almost all environments on Earth\u2014even Antarctic ice holds trace amounts of DDT and lead emitted from the burning of leaded gasoline. Animals in many remote areas have high concentrations of industrial and agricultural toxins in their tissues. Fish in isolated alpine lakes of the Canadian Rockies, for example, contain high concentrations of POPs, which have been associated with condensation of these compounds in snowfields and glaciers above the lakes (Blais et al. 1998). As suggested in the Case Study Revisited, the concentrations of these pollutants are related to the trophic positions of the animals: consumers at the highest trophic levels, such as polar bears, seals, and birds of prey, contain the highest concentrations. The widespread nature of this problem underscores the notion that ecosystems are connected by the movements of energy and materials among them. Ecological processes in one ecosystem can have effects on other ecosystems through these movements (Polis et al. 2004). The movement of POPs and other human-made toxins is usually associated with atmospheric transport from low to high latitudes. However, the behaviors of animals can also influence the movement of POPs. Salmon, for example, have been shown to transport nutrients from marine to freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems during their spawning runs. At reproductive maturity, salmon leave the ocean and move up rivers in large numbers, as described in the Case Study in Chapter 2. From the rivers, they move into freshwater lakes and streams, where they spawn and then die. The potential exists for salmon to move toxins, as well as nutrients, from the oceans to freshwater ecosystems via this spawning behavior. E. M. Krmel and colleagues studied the potential for spawning sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to act as a \u201cfish pump\u201d for pollutants by moving PCBs from the ocean to remote lakes in Alaska (Krmel et al. 2003). Salmon occupy the fourth trophic level, and thus, through bioaccumulation and biomagnification, they accumulate PCBs in their body fat at concentrations more than 2,500 times higher than those found in seawater. Krmel and colleagues collected sediment cores from eight lakes in southwest Alaska that had different densities of spawning salmon (ranging from 0 to 40,000 spawners/km )2 and measured PCBs in the sediments. They found that the concentrations of PCBs were strongly correlated with the density of spawners (FIGURE 21.20). Lakes that did not have visits from spawning fish had concentrations of PCBs similar to expectations based on atmospheric transport 2 alone. The lake with the highest density of spawning fish (40,000 per km ) had PCB concentrations that were six times higher than the levels associated with atmospheric transport. A similar study found that DDT, other POPs, and mercury are transported by northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis, pelagic fish-eating seabirds) from the ocean to small ponds near their nesting colonies (Blais et al. 2005).", "These examples demonstrate how the behaviors of some species (spawning in fish, colonial nesting in birds) can exacerbate problems of pollution associated with biomagnification in ecosystems. FIGURE 21.20 Biological Pumping of Pollutants Spawning salmon act as biological pumps, concentrating toxins from the oceans in their bodies and transporting them en masse to freshwater ecosystems. (After E. M. Krmel et al. 2003. Nature 425: 255\u2013256.) Nutrient Supply and Cycling KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 22.1 Nutrients enter ecosystems through the chemical breakdown of minerals in rocks or through fixation of atmospheric gases. CONCEPT 22.2 Chemical and biological transformations in ecosystems alter the chemical form and supply of nutrients. CONCEPT 22.3 Nutrients cycle repeatedly through the components of ecosystems. CONCEPT 22.4 Freshwater and marine nutrient cycles occur in a moving medium and are linked to terrestrial ecosystems. A Fragile Crust: A Case Study The Colorado Plateau in western North America includes vast expanses of isolated mountains, intricately folded sandstone formations, and deeply cut, multicolored canyons. One of the most unusual features found in this rugged and beautiful region, however, occurs at a very small scale: its patchy cover of dark, convoluted soil (FIGURE 22.1). On closer examination, the soil looks like a miniature landscape of hills and valleys, covered with black, dark green, and white splotches resembling lichens. The comparison is apt, because this crust on the soil surface, known simply as a biological soil crust (or biocrust), is composed of a mix of hundreds of species of cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses (Belnap 2003). Approximately 70% of the soils on the Colorado Plateau, a geographic province that covers parts of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, have some biocrust development. Similar crusts, containing a surprisingly similar suite of species, cover approximately 12% of terrestrial ecosystems globally (Rodriguez-Caballero et al. 2018). The crusty nature of the soil is largely the work of filamentous cyanobacteria, which create a sheath of mucilaginous material as they move through the soil after a rain. When the soil dries out, the cyanobacteria withdraw to deeper soil layers, leaving behind the sheathing material, which helps bind the coarse soil particles together (FIGURE 22.2). FIGURE 22.1 Biological Soil Crust on the Colorado Plateau Biological soil crusts are a common feature in the deserts of the Colorado Plateau. The surface topography and coloration of the crust are clearly visible in this photo. FIGURE 22.2 Cyanobacterial Sheaths Bind Soil into Crusts (A) Cyanobacterial strands surround themselves with a sheath of mucilaginous material as they move through the soil. (B) The sheaths left behind by the cyanobacteria help to bind soil particles together and protect soils from erosional loss. The soils of the Colorado Plateau are exposed to tremendous climate variation and strong erosive forces (Belnap 2003). Surface temperatures can range from \u201320\u00b0C (\u20134\u00b0F) in winter to 70\u00b0C (158\u00b0F) in summer. High evapotranspiration rates often dry out the soils, and the sparseness of the vegetation allows the strong surface winds to carry away fine soil particles. Precipitation in spring and summer often occurs as brief, intense thunderstorms. Biocrusts are critical for anchoring the soil in place in the face of high winds and torrential rains. Although the Colorado Plateau is sparsely populated, humans have had a large and lasting effect on its landscape. Livestock grazing has been an important use of public lands in the region since cattle were introduced there in the 1880s. Most of the land has been affected to some degree by grazing, which has resulted in the trampling of biocrusts and overgrazing of vegetation. Until recently, grazing was the most important human-associated disturbance in the region. Recently, however, a proliferation of off-road vehicles has invaded the region. During the 2005 Moab Jeep Safari, for example, an estimated 30,000\u2013 40,000 participants descended on a town with a year-round population of 5,000. All-terrain vehicle use is also increasing dramatically, joining the motorcycle, mountain bike, and hiking traffic in the wilds. The majority of these users of the desert backcountry obey federal and local laws, staying on designated trails and roads. However, a minority of users drive their vehicles off designated roads and across soils covered with biocrusts. The extraction of fossil fuels has also increased substantially over the past several decades with the advent of new technologies (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking\u201d).", "While the spatial extent of soil surface disturbance associated with off-road vehicle use, fossil fuel extraction, and livestock grazing has not been well quantified, it is clear that a large part of the landscape has been disturbed to some degree during the past 150 years, and that the rate of disturbance is increasing. The recovery of biocrusts following disturbance is extremely slow in arid environments: decades are required for the reestablishment of the cyanobacteria and up to centuries for recolonization by lichens and mosses (Belnap and Eldridge 2001). What are the implications of the loss of biocrusts for the functioning of desert ecosystems? How important are they to the supply of nutrients in those ecosystems? Given the long-term nature of disturbances associated with livestock grazing across the Colorado Plateau, can we still find areas that can serve as controls for studies of the disturbance that has already occurred? Introduction In addition to energy, all organisms require specific chemical elements to function and grow. Organisms get these elements by absorbing them from the environment or by consuming other organisms, living or dead. Iron, for example, is needed by all organisms for several important metabolic functions, but how those organisms get their iron and where it comes from vary substantially. Phytoplankton in the Atlantic Ocean may take up iron that came from dust that blew in from the Sahara. Lions on an African savanna get their iron from the prey they kill and consume. Aphids get their iron in the sap they suck from a plant, whereas the plant takes up water containing dissolved iron from the soil. The ultimate source of all of this iron, however, is solid minerals in Earth\u2019s crust, which are subjected to chemical transformations as they move through the different physical and biological components of ecosystems. The study of the physical, chemical, and biological factors that influence the movements and transformations of elements is known as biogeochemistry. An understanding of biogeochemistry is important for determining the availability of nutrients, which are defined as the chemical elements an organism requires for its metabolism and growth. Nutrients must be present in certain chemical forms to be available for uptake by organisms. The rate at which physical and chemical transformations occur determines the supply of nutrients. Biogeochemistry also encompasses the study of non-nutrient elements that can serve as tracers in ecosystems and of pollutant compounds, such as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, that cause environmental damage. Biogeochemistry is a discipline that integrates contributions from soil science, hydrology, and atmospheric science as well as ecology. In this chapter, we will consider the biological, chemical, and physical factors that control the supply and availability of nutrients in ecosystems. We will emphasize nutrient requirements and acquisition by autotrophs because they in turn are the principal source of nutrients for heterotrophs. We will describe what nutrients are most important, their sources, and how they enter ecosystems, and review some of the important chemical and biological transformations that constitute the cycling of nutrients in ecosystems. In Concept 25.1, we will consider the global-scale cycling of some of these elements. CONCEPT 22.1 Nutrients enter ecosystems through the chemical breakdown of minerals in rocks or through fixation of atmospheric gases. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 22.1.1 Describe the basic roles of nutrients in organisms, and differentiate between the ways in which microorganisms, plants, and animals obtain them. 22.1.2 Summarize the steps involved in the breakdown of minerals and the subsequent release of nutrients. 22.1.3 Describe the physical and chemical properties of soil that influence its fertility. 22.1.4 Explain the processes that fix carbon and nitrogen, converting them into usable forms for organismal function and growth. Nutrient Requirements and Sources All organisms, from bacteria to blue whales, share similar nutrient requirements. How those nutrients are obtained, the chemical forms of those nutrients that are taken up, and the relative amounts of those nutrients that are required vary greatly among organisms. All nutrients, however, come from common sources: inorganic mineral forms that are present in Earth\u2019s crust or as gases in the atmosphere. Organisms have specific nutrient requirements An organism\u2019s nutrient requirements are related to its physiology. The amounts and specific nutrients needed therefore vary according to the organism\u2019s mode of energy acquisition (autotrophs vs. heterotrophs), mobility, and thermal physiology (ectotherms vs. endotherms). Mobile animals, for example, generally have higher rates of metabolic activity than plants or bacteria, and they therefore have higher requirements for nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to support the biochemical reactions associated with movement.", "Differences in nutrient requirements are reflected in the chemical composition of organisms (TABLE 22.1). Carbon is often associated with structural compounds in plant cells and tissues, while nitrogen is largely found in enzymes. Accordingly, the ratios of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) in organisms can indicate the relative concentrations of biochemical machinery in cells. Animals and microorganisms typically have lower C:N ratios than plants: for example, humans and bacteria have C:N ratios of 6.0 and 3.0, respectively, whereas those of plants range from 10 to 40. This difference is one reason why herbivores must consume more food than carnivores to acquire enough nutrients to meet their nutritional demands.

Note: Dashes indicate a negligible amount of an element; blank spaces indicate that the element has not been measured. The nutrients essential for all plants, and the functions associated with them, are presented in TABLE 22.2. Some plant species have specific requirements for other nutrients not found in Table 22.2. For example, many, but not all, C4 and CAM plants (see Concept 5.3 for discussion of these photosynthetic pathways) require sodium, while most plants do not. In contrast, sodium is an essential nutrient for all animals, critical for maintaining pH and osmotic balances. Cobalt is required by some plants that host nitrogen-fixing symbionts (discussed later in this section). Selenium is toxic to most plants, but a small number of plants growing on soils rich in selenium may require it. In contrast, selenium is an essential nutrient for animals and bacteria.

Plants and microorganisms usually take up nutrients from their environment in relatively simple, soluble chemical forms, from which they synthesize the larger molecules needed for their metabolism and growth. Animals, on the other hand, typically take up their nutrients through the consumption of living organisms or detritus, obtaining their nutrients in larger, more complex chemical compounds. Animals break down some of these compounds and resynthesize new molecules; others are absorbed intact and used directly in biosynthesis. For example, 9 of the 20 amino acids that are essential for metabolism in humans and other mammals must be absorbed intact, since we cannot synthesize them ourselves. Minerals and atmospheric gases are the ultimate sources of nutrients All nutrients are ultimately derived from two abiotic sources: minerals in rocks and gases in the atmosphere. Over time, as nutrients are taken up and incorporated by organisms, they accumulate in ecosystems in organic forms (i.e., in association with carbon and hydrogen molecules). Nutrients may be cycled within an ecosystem, repeatedly passing through organisms and the soil or water in which the organisms live.", "They may even be cycled internally within an organism, stored or mobilized for use as its needs for specific nutrients change. Here we describe the inputs of nutrients into ecosystems from minerals and the atmosphere. In the following sections, we will complete the steps that constitute nutrient cycling within an ecosystem. MINERAL SOURCES OF NUTRIENTS The breakdown of minerals in rock supplies ecosystems with nutrients such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Minerals are solid substances with characteristic chemical properties, derived from a multitude of geologic processes. Rocks are collections of different minerals. Nutrients and other elements are released from minerals in a two-step process known as weathering. The first step, mechanical weathering, is the physical breakdown of rocks. Expansion and contraction processes, such as freeze\u2013thaw and drying\u2013rewetting cycles, act to break rocks into progressively smaller particles. Gravitational mechanisms (such as landslides) and the growth of plant roots also contribute to mechanical weathering. Mechanical weathering exposes greater amounts of surface area of mineral particles to chemical weathering, in which the minerals are subjected to chemical reactions that release soluble forms of nutrients. Weathering is one of the processes involved in soil development. Soil is formally defined as a mix of mineral particles; solid organic matter (detritus, primarily decomposing plant matter); water containing dissolved organic matter, minerals, and gases (the soil solution); and organisms. Soils have several important properties that influence the delivery of nutrients to plants and microorganisms. One property is their texture, which is defined by the sizes of the particles that make up the soil. The coarsest soil particles (0.05\u20132 mm) are referred to as sand. Intermediate-sized particles (0.002\u20130.05 mm) are called silt. Fine soil particles (<0.002 mm), known as clays, have weak negative charges on their surfaces that can hold on to cations and exchange them with the soil solution. As a result, clay particles serve as a reservoir of nutrient cations such 2++ 2+ as Ca , K , and Mg . A soil\u2019s ability to hold these cations and exchange them with the soil solution, referred to as its cation exchange capacity, is determined by the amounts and types of clay the soil contains. Soil texture also influences the soil\u2019s water-holding capacity and thus the movement of nutrients in the soil solution. Soils with a high proportion of sand have a large volume of spaces between particles. These spaces (called macropores) allow water to drain through the soil and limit the amount of water it can hold. Another important property of a soil influencing its texture and chemistry is its parent material, the rock or mineral material that was broken down by weathering to form that soil. Parent material for soil is usually the underlying bedrock but may also include thick layers of sediment deposited by glaciers (known as till), by wind (loess), or by water. The chemistry and structure of the parent material, along with the physical environment, determine the rate of weathering and the amount and types of nutrients released, and they thus 2+ 2+ influence the fertility of the soil. Limestone, for example, is high in the nutrient cations Ca and Mg . Soils derived from more acidic parent material, such as granite, have lower concentrations of these elements. In addition, the higher acidity (lower pH) of soils derived from granite lowers the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus to plants. The chemistry and pH of the parent material exert an important influence on the abundance, growth, and diversity of plants in ecosystems. For example, Laura Gough and colleagues (2000) demonstrated that variation in the acidity of the parent material is associated with differences in plant species richness among Arctic ecosystems in Alaska. They surveyed Arctic vegetation across natural gradients in soil acidity associated with the differential distribution of calcium-rich loess, which has lower acidity than other parent materials. They found that the number of plant species increased as acidity decreased (FIGURE 22.3). This variation in diversity was attributed to the negative effects of soil acidity on nutrient availability as well as its inhibitory effects on plant establishment. FIGURE 22.3 Species Richness Increases with Decreasing Soil Acidity Vascular plant species richness in the Alaskan Arctic tundra varies with soil acidity. The gradient in soil acidity is primarily due to differences in parent material: less acidic soils (with higher pH) are associated with greater loess deposits. (After L. Gough et al. 2000. J Ecol 88: 54\u201366.)", "Over time, soils undergo changes associated with weathering, accumulation and chemical alteration of organic matter, and leaching: the movement of dissolved organic matter and fine mineral particles from upper to lower layers. These processes form horizons, layers of soil distinguished by their color, texture, and permeability (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 22.4). Variations in soil horizons are used by soil scientists to characterize different soil types. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 22.4 Development of Soil Horizons Soils develop over time as parent material is weathered and broken up into ever finer soil particles, increasing amounts of organic matter accumulate in the soil, and materials are leached and deposited in deeper soil layers. The rate of soil development is dependent on the climate, the parent material, and the organisms associated with the soil. (After N. C. Brady and R. R. Weil. 2001. The Nature and Property of Soils. Prentice-Hall: Upper Saddle River, NJ.) Given what you\u2019ve learned about primary production in Chapter 20 and about the climate factors that determine weathering and soil development in this chapter, what do you think the horizons of a desert soil would look like? Climate influences the rates of many of the processes associated with soil development, including weathering, biological activity (such as the input of organic matter from net primary production [NPP] and its decomposition in the soil), and leaching. In general, these processes occur most rapidly under warm, wet conditions. Thus, the soils of lowland tropical forest ecosystems, which have experienced high rates of weathering and leaching for a long time, are poor in mineral-derived nutrients such as calcium and magnesium. A high proportion of the nutrients in lowland tropical forest ecosystems are found in the living biomass of trees, in contrast to most other terrestrial ecosystems, in which these nutrients are mostly found in the soil. When lowland tropical forests are cleared and burned to make way for pastures or cropland, most of the nutrients are lost in smoke and ash and through soil erosion following the fires. As a result, these ecosystems may become severely nutrient-impoverished, and it may take them centuries to return to their previous state. Soils in higher-latitude ecosystems have lower leaching rates and are usually richer in mineral-derived nutrients. Organisms\u2014primarily plants, bacteria, and fungi\u2014influence soil development by contributing organic matter, which is an important reservoir of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Organisms also increase rates of chemical weathering through the release of organic acids (from plants and detritus) and CO2 (from metabolic respiration). Thus, rates of biological activity have a strong influence on the development of soils. ATMOSPHERIC SOURCES OF NUTRIENTS The atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen (as dinitrogen gas, N ), 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, increasing amounts of carbon dioxide (0.041%, or 410 parts per million, 2 in 2018), and other trace gases\u2014some natural, others pollutants derived from human activities. The atmosphere is the ultimate source of carbon and nitrogen for ecosystems. These nutrients become biologically available when they are taken up from the atmosphere and chemically transformed, or fixed, by organisms. They may then be transferred from organism to organism before returning to the atmosphere. Carbon is taken up by autotrophs as CO2 through photosynthesis. (The process of photosynthesis was described in Concept 5.2, and the global cycling of carbon is discussed in Concept 25.1.) Carbon compounds store energy in their chemical bonds, and they are important structural components of autotrophs (e.g., cellulose) as well. Although the atmosphere is a huge reservoir of nitrogen, it is in a chemically inert form (N ) that cannot 2 be used by most organisms because of the high energy required to break the triple bond between the two atoms. The process of taking up N2 and converting it into chemically available forms is known as nitrogen fixation (see Connections in Nature in Chapter 17). Biological nitrogen fixation is accomplished with the aid of the enzyme nitrogenase, which is synthesized by only certain bacteria. Some of these nitrogen-fixing bacteria are free-living; others are partners in mutualistic symbiotic relationships (see Figure 15.21). Nitrogen-fixing symbioses include associations between plant roots and soil bacteria, most notably between legumes and bacteria in the family Rhizobiaceae. Legumes \u201chost\u201d rhizobia in special root structures called nodules and supply them with carbon compounds as an energy source to meet the high energy demands of nitrogen fixation (FIGURE 22.5; see also Figure 17.21). In return for supplying the rhizobia with room and board, the plant gets nitrogen fixed by the bacteria.", "Other examples of nitrogen-fixing symbioses include associations between woody plants such as alders and bacteria in the genus Frankia (called actinorhizal associations), associations between Azolla ferns and cyanobacteria, lichens that include fungal and nitrogen-fixing symbionts, and termites with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their guts. Humans also fix atmospheric nitrogen when they manufacture synthetic fertilizers using the Haber\u2013Bosch process, in which ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen and hydrogen under high pressures and temperatures using an iron catalyst. The Haber\u2013Bosch process requires substantial energy input in the form of fossil fuels. FIGURE 22.5 Legumes Form Nitrogen-Fixing Nodules (A) These swollen nodules on the roots of a red clover (Trifolium pratense) plant contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria. (B) Cells inside this soybean root nodule (yellow in this micrograph) are filled with rhizobia. Natural nitrogen fixation also requires a large amount of energy. It consumes as much as 25% of the photosynthetic energy obtained by plants with nitrogen-fixing symbiotic partners. Thus, nitrogen fixation provides these plants with a source of nitrogen, but it represents a trade-off with other energy-demanding processes such as growth, defense, and reproduction. Allocation of energy to nitrogen fixation rather than to growth lowers the ability of nitrogen-fixing plants to compete for resources other than nitrogen. Nitrogen fixation is particularly important during the early stages of primary succession, as we saw in Chapter 17. In addition to carbon and nitrogen, the atmosphere contains fine soil particles (dust) and a collection of suspended solid, liquid, and gaseous particles known as aerosols. Some of this particulate matter enters ecosystems when it falls from the atmosphere because of gravity or in precipitation, a process known as atmospheric deposition. Atmospheric deposition represents an important natural source of nutrients for some ecosystems. Aerosols containing cations derived from sea spray, for example, may be an important source of nutrients in coastal areas. Atmospheric deposition of dust originating in the Sahara is an important input of iron into the Atlantic Ocean and of phosphorus into the Amazon Basin. On the other hand, some ecosystems have been negatively affected by atmospheric deposition associated with human industrial and agricultural activities. Acid rain, for example, is an atmospheric deposition process that has been associated with declines in forest ecosystems in the eastern United States and Europe (as we will see in Concept 25.3). Now that we\u2019ve seen how nutrients enter ecosystems, let\u2019s follow their movements within ecosystems as they are taken up and transformed. The next two sections will focus on terrestrial ecosystems; we will take a closer look at nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems in the final section. Self-Assessment 22.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 22.2 Chemical and biological transformations in ecosystems alter the chemical form and supply of nutrients. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 22.2.1 Describe why decomposition is a critical process in the supply of nutrients in ecosystems. 22.2.2 Evaluate the biological and physical factors that influence rates of decomposition. 22.2.3 Explain how microbial processes may alter the chemical forms of nutrients and make them either more or less available to plants. Nutrient Transformations Once they have entered an ecosystem, nutrients are subjected to further modifications as a result of uptake by organisms and chemical reactions that alter their form and influence their movement and retention within the ecosystem. Foremost among these transformations is the decomposition of organic matter, which releases nutrients back into the ecosystem. Decomposition is a key nutrient recycling process As detritus (dead plants, animals, and microorganisms and egested waste products) builds up in an ecosystem, it becomes an increasingly important source of nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, which often limit production of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (see ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 22.1 for a consideration of how warming in the Arctic may influence NPP through changes in nutrient cycling). Nutrients in detritus are made available by decomposition, the process by which detritivores break down organic matter to obtain energy and nutrients (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 22.6). Decomposition releases nutrients as soluble organic and inorganic compounds that can be taken up by other organisms. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 22.6 Decomposition Decomposition of organic matter in the soil provides an important input of nutrients into terrestrial ecosystems. Similar steps occur in freshwater and marine ecosystems. How would the use of a nonselective pesticide (i.e., one that does not target any specific animals) to control insect herbivores affect the rate of decomposition in a lawn ecosystem?", "Organic matter in soil is derived primarily from plant matter, which comes from above and below the soil surface. Fresh, undecomposed organic matter on the soil surface is known as litter and is typically the most abundant substrate for decomposition. The litter is used by animals, protists, bacteria, and fungi as a source of energy and nutrients. As animals such as earthworms, termites, and nematodes consume the litter, they break it up into progressively finer particles. This physical fragmentation enhances the chemical breakdown of the litter by increasing its surface area. An important final step in decomposition is the chemical conversion of organic matter into inorganic nutrients (i.e., nutrients that are not associated with carbon molecules), which is known as mineralization. It is the result of the breakdown of organic macromolecules in the soil by enzymes released by heterotrophic microorganisms. Because plants often rely on inorganic nutrients, ecologists use measurements of mineralization to estimate rates of nutrient supply. An understanding of the abiotic and biotic controls on decomposition and mineralization is key to understanding nutrient availability to autotrophs. Rates of decomposition are greatly influenced by climate. Decomposition, like other biologically mediated processes, proceeds most rapidly at warm temperatures. Soil moisture also controls rates of decomposition by influencing the availability of water and oxygen to detritivores. Dry soils may not provide enough water for these organisms, and wet soils have low oxygen concentrations, which lower aerobic respiration and the rate of biological activity. Therefore, the activity of detritivores is highest at intermediate soil moistures and warm temperatures (FIGURE 22.7). FIGURE 22.7 Climate Controls the Activity of Decomposers Changes in soil microbial respiration, used as an estimate of decomposition, are modeled as a function of soil moisture at different temperatures. (After E. A. Paul and F. E. Clark. 1996. Soil Microbiology and Biochemistry. Academic Press: San Diego, CA; F. L. Bunnell and D. E. N. Tait. 1974. In Soil Organisms and Decomposition in Tundra. Tundra Biome Steering Committee: Stockholm, Sweden.) Some nutrients are consumed by detritivores during decomposition, so not all of the nutrients released during mineralization become available for uptake by autotrophs. The amounts of nutrients that are released from organic matter during decomposition depend on the nutrient requirements of the decomposers and the amount of energy the organic matter contains. These factors can be approximated by the ratio of carbon (representing energy) to nitrogen (since nitrogen is the nutrient most often in short supply for detritivores) in the organic matter. A high C:N ratio in organic matter will result in a low net release of nutrients during decomposition, since heterotrophic microbial growth is more limited by nitrogen supply than by energy. For example, most heterotrophic microorganisms require approximately 10 molecules of carbon for every molecule of nitrogen they take up. About 60% of the carbon they take up is lost through respiration. Therefore, the optimal C:N ratio of organic matter for microbial growth is about 25:1. Organic matter with a C:N ratio greater than 25:1 would result in all of the nitrogen being taken up by the microbes during decomposition. Decomposition of organic matter with a C:N ratio of less than 25:1 would result in some nitrogen being released into the soil and made available for plants. Not all of the carbon in litter is equally available as an energy source for decomposers: the chemistry of that carbon determines how rapidly the material can be decomposed. Lignin, a structural carbon compound that strengthens plant cell walls, is difficult for soil microorganisms to break down and thus decomposes very slowly (FIGURE 22.8 and ANALYZING DATA 22.1). The rate of nutrient release from plant material containing high lignin concentrations, such as oak or pine leaves, is lower than that from material with low lignin concentrations, such as maple and aspen leaves. In addition, plant litter may contain secondary compounds, chemical compounds not used directly for growth (examples include those described in Concepts 5.4 and 12.2 associated with defense against herbivores and excess light), that can lower nutrient release during decomposition. Secondary compounds slow decomposition by inhibiting the activity of heterotrophic microorganisms and the enzymes they release into the soil or, in some cases, by stimulating their growth, leading to greater microbial uptake of nutrients. FIGURE 22.8 Lignin Decreases the Rate of Decomposition The rate of decomposition of leaf litter, expressed as the percent of biomass remaining, decreases as the ratio of lignin to nitrogen in the litter increases. This ratio varies among forest tree species.", "Note, however, that climate also has an important influence on decomposition rates. (After J. M. Melillo et al. 1982. Ecology 63: 621\u2013626.) ANALYZING DATA 22.1 We\u2019ve learned that lignin, a structural compound found in leaves and stems, can lower rates of decomposition because it is a poorer carbon substrate for microorganisms. However, not all organic matter degradation is biotic. In arid ecosystems, for example, sunlight can break down organic matter on the surface of soils, and it can be more important than biological decomposition (Austin and Vivanco 2006; see also HANDS-ON PROBLEM SOLVING 22.1). How does lignin influence the abiotic decomposition associated with photodegradation? Lignin absorbs more solar radiation than cellulose, and thus it might potentially increase abiotic decomposition. To test this hypothesis, Amy Austin and Carlos Ballar\u00e9 (2010)* did a field experiment examining how the concentration of lignin influenced decomposition via both abiotic photodegradation and biotic activity. They used uniform cellulose sheets (filter paper) with a dilute solution of nutrients added to mimic leaf litter substrate. They added varying amounts of lignin to the sheets and then subjected them to conditions of mainly abiotic or biotic decomposition, by filtering light (biotic) or keeping the substrates isolated from the soil (abiotic). The mass loss from each sheet was measured to estimate the rate of decomposition. The results of Austin and Ballar\u00e9\u2019s experiment are presented in the table. Biotic decomposition Abiotic decomposition Lignin Lignin Mass concentration Mass loss concentration loss (%) (%/day) (%) (%/day) 0 0.29 0 0.01 5 0.15 5 0.07 8 0.13 9 0.10 13 0.11 14 0.13 17 0.10 1. Use the data in the table to plot the relationship between lignin concentration and mass loss for both biotic and abiotic decomposition. 2. What can you conclude about the influence of lignin on abiotic versus biotic decomposition? How does your conclusion support the general hypothesis that plant tissues high in lignin decompose more slowly than plant tissues low in lignin? 3. Under what kinds of environmental conditions and in what types of biomes would you expect the assumption that lignin will lower decomposition not to hold true? See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. *Austin, A. T., and C. L. Ballar\u00e9. 2010. Dual role of lignin in plant litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 107: 4618\u20134622. By varying the chemistry of their litter, as well as the amount of litter they produce, plants can influence decomposition rates in the soil. Lowering decomposition rates lowers the fertility of the soil. What is the consequence for a plant of decreasing its own nutrient supply? For plants that have inherently slow growth rates, lowering soil fertility may protect them from competitive exclusion by neighbors with higher growth and resource uptake rates. Low soil nutrient concentrations can therefore be perpetuated through plant chemistry in a way that benefits the plants themselves (Van Breemen and Finzi 1998). Microorganisms modify the chemical form of nutrients Microorganisms in soil and freshwater and marine ecosystems transform some of the inorganic nutrients released during the process of mineralization. These transformations are particularly important in the case of nitrogen, since they can determine its availability to plants and the rate at which it is lost from the ecosystem (see Figure 22.11 below). Certain chemoautotrophic bacteria, known as nitrifying bacteria, convert ammonia +\u2013 (NH ) and ammonium (NH ) released by mineralization into nitrate (NO3 ) by a process called 34 nitrification. Nitrification occurs under aerobic conditions, so it is limited primarily to terrestrial environments. Under hypoxic conditions, some bacteria use nitrate as an electron acceptor, converting it into N and nitrous oxide (N O, a potent greenhouse gas) by a process known as denitrification. These gaseous 22 forms of nitrogen are lost to the atmosphere and thus represent a loss of nitrogen from ecosystems. Plant ecologists and physiologists once believed that nitrogen availability to plants was dependent solely on the supply of inorganic nitrogen\u2014nitrate and ammonium. Therefore, soil fertility has traditionally been estimated using measurements of these inorganic forms of nitrogen. During the 1990s, much effort was invested in understanding what controls nitrogen mineralization rates, particularly in ecosystems where fertilization experiments had indicated that nitrogen availability limits primary production and influences community diversity. Measurements of inorganic nitrogen production in forest and grassland soils generally came close to estimates of the amount taken up by plants. However, rates of inorganic nitrogen supply in Arctic and alpine ecosystems were substantially lower than what plants were actually taking up.", "These apparent shortfalls in nitrogen supply led to the realization that some plants were using organic forms of nitrogen to meet their nutritional requirements. Earlier work in marine ecosystems had shown that phytoplankton could take up amino acids directly from water, and mycorrhizae had been shown to take up organic nitrogen from the soil and supply it to plants. However, Terry Chapin and colleagues (1993) and Ted Raab and colleagues (1996) demonstrated that some plant species, primarily sedges, take up organic forms of nitrogen without mycorrhizae. Arctic sedges may take up as much as 60% of their nitrogen in organic form. Organic nitrogen uptake has been observed in plants in other ecosystems as well, including boreal forests, salt marshes, savannas, grasslands, deserts, and rainforests. Thus, the mineralization step in decomposition may not be as important for plant nutrition as has been commonly thought (Schimel and Bennett 2004). The use of soluble organic nitrogen by plants has important implications for competition among plants and between plants and soil microorganisms. There is evidence to support the hypothesis that plants in some Arctic and alpine communities avoid competition through the preferential uptake of specific forms of nitrogen\u2014an example of resource partitioning (described in Concept 14.2). Robert McKane and colleagues (2002) examined the forms of nitrogen taken up by several plant species growing together in the Arctic tundra of northern Alaska. For each species, they measured uptake of inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen, as well as the depth in the soil at which nitrogen was taken up and the time of year when it was taken up. They found that all three factors (form of nitrogen, depth of uptake, and timing of uptake) differed among species. Furthermore, the researchers found that the dominant plants in the community tended to be the species that used the form of nitrogen that was most abundant in the soil (FIGURE 22.9). Thus, the ability of a species to dominate a community where nitrogen limits growth may be determined in part by its ability to take up a specific form of nitrogen. FIGURE 22.9 Community Dominance and Nitrogen Uptake Dominance of a species in a plant community in the Alaskan Arctic tundra (measured by proportional contribution to the community\u2019s total NPP) is related to the similarity between the plant\u2019s preferred form of nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate, or glycine, a small amino acid) and the availability of that form in the soil. (After R. B. McKane et al. 2002. Nature 415: 68\u201371.) Plants can recycle nutrients internally Leaves, fine roots, and flowers contain the highest nutrient concentrations of any plant organ. During seasonal leaf senescence, nutrients and nonstructural carbon compounds (such as starch and carbohydrates) in perennial plants are broken down into simpler, more soluble chemical forms and moved into stems and roots, where they are stored. This phenomenon is most obvious in mid-to high-latitude ecosystems as chlorophyll molecules in the leaves of deciduous species are broken down to recover their nitrogen and other nutrients, while other pigments, such as carotenoids, xanthophylls, and anthocyanins, remain, providing the autumnal splendor we humans enjoy. Some of the fall coloration is due to an increase in pigment production, possibly to protect the leaves from high light levels or from herbivores. When growth resumes in spring, the nutrients are transported to growing tissues for use in biosynthesis. Plants may resorb as much as 60%\u201370% of the nitrogen and 40%\u201350% of the phosphorus in their leaves before they fall. This recycling reduces their need to take up \u201cnew\u201d nutrients in the following growing season. As we\u2019ve traced the chemical transformations of nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems, we\u2019ve seen that they move through various components of those ecosystems as they are transformed. In the next section, we\u2019ll look at those movements in more detail and trace the fates of the nutrients as they move through an ecosystem. Self-Assessment 22.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 22.3 Nutrients cycle repeatedly through the components of ecosystems. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 22.3.1 Describe the key processes involved in nutrient cycling in ecosystems. 22.3.2 Summarize what determines the mean residence time of nutrients in ecosystems. 22.3.3 Evaluate how the processes that determine the loss of nutrients from an ecosystem would change during succession and why the loss rates of specific nutrients may vary through time.", "Nutrient Cycles and Losses In the previous section, we saw how nutrients undergo biological, chemical, and physical transformations as they are taken up by organisms and released through decomposition, ultimately returning to their original forms (or similar ones). This movement of nutrients within ecosystems is known as nutrient cycling (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 22.10). For example, we\u2019ve traced the path of nitrogen into and through an ecosystem, starting with nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, as it is converted into chemical forms that can be used by plants. The plants incorporate the nitrogen into organic compounds (e.g., proteins and enzymes), which may end up being consumed by heterotrophs. Eventually plants, heterotrophs, and microorganisms all end up as detritus. Inorganic and organic nitrogen released from the detritus by decomposition is taken up again by plants and microorganisms, thereby completing the nitrogen cycle (FIGURE 22.11). INTERACTIVE FIGURE 22.10 Nutrient Cycles A generalized nutrient cycle, showing the movements of a nutrient among the components of an ecosystem and the potential pathways for inputs and losses. FIGURE 22.11 Nitrogen Cycle for an Alpine Ecosystem, Niwot Ridge, Colorado Boxes represent pools of nitrogen, measured in grams per square meter; arrows represent flows of nitrogen, measured in grams per square meter per year. Note the large amount of nitrogen passing through soil microorganisms, which indicates a high turnover rate for nitrogen in this relatively small pool. (After W. D. Bowman and T. R. Seastedt. 2001. Structure and Function of an Alpine Ecosystem, Niwot Ridge, Colorado. Oxford University Press: New York.) Nutrients cycle at different rates according to element identity and ecosystem type The time it takes a nutrient molecule to cycle through an ecosystem, from uptake by organisms to release to subsequent uptake, can vary substantially depending on the element in question and the ecosystem where the cycle is occurring. In general, nutrients that limit primary production are cycled more rapidly than nonlimiting nutrients. For example, nitrogen and phosphorus may cycle through the photic zone of the open ocean over a period of hours or days, while zinc may cycle over geologic time scales associated with sedimentation, mountain building, and erosional processes. Nutrient cycling rates also vary with climate because of the effects of temperature and moisture on the metabolic rates of the organisms associated with production, decomposition, and chemical transformations of nutrients. Biogeochemists measure rates of nutrient cycling by estimating the mean residence times of elements in some component of an ecosystem: The mean residence time is the amount of time an average molecule of an element spends in a pool before leaving it. The pool of an element is the total amount found within a physical or biological component of the ecosystem, such as soil or biomass. The inputs include all possible sources of the element for that ecosystem component. This approach to estimating mean residence time assumes that pools of nutrients do not change over time and that the mean residence time reflects the overall rate of nutrient cycling. It is most commonly used for estimating rates of nutrient turnover in soil organic matter, which reflect rates of nutrient input and subsequent decomposition. Decomposition rates, as we have seen, are related to climate and the chemistry of plant litter. Given that both inputs of plant litter and decomposition rates control the mean residence times of nutrients in soil, and that both are subject to climatic control, what differences would we expect to see among ecosystems with similar plant growth forms (e.g., forests) in different climates? Relative to boreal and temperate forests, tropical forests have higher net primary productivity, and therefore higher litter input rates. Does this difference result in differences in the mean residence times of nutrients? A comparison of mean residence times for organic matter and for several nutrients indicates that nutrient pools in the soils of tropical forests are much smaller than those in boreal forests (TABLE 22.3). The turnover rates of nitrogen and phosphorus are more than 100 times faster in tropical forest soils than in boreal forest soils. Temperate forests and chaparral have turnover rates that fall in between but are closer to those in the tropics. TABLE 22.3 Mean Residence Times of Soil Organic Matter and Nutrients in Forest and Shrubland Ecosystems Mean resident time (yr)", "Soil organic Ecosystem type matter N P K Ca Mg Boreal forest 353 230 324 94 149 455 Temperate coniferous forest 17 18 15 2 6 13 Temperate deciduous forest 4 5 6 1 3 3 Chaparral 4 4 4 1 5 3 Tropical rainforest 0.4 2 2 1 1.5 1 Source: W. H. Schlesinger. 1997. Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change, 2nd ed. Academic Press: San Diego, CA, and references within. The main reason for this trend in mean residence times is that the influence of climate on rates of decomposition is greater than its influence on primary productivity. Boreal forest soils often have permafrost layers, which cool the soils and lower rates of biological activity. The permafrost also blocks the percolation of water through the soil, creating wet, anoxic soil conditions. Furthermore, the litter produced by boreal forest trees is rich in secondary compounds that slow rates of decomposition in the soil. The variation in mean residence times among specific nutrients is related to their chemical properties (e.g., solubility). Some nutrients, such as potassium, occur in more soluble forms, and thus are lost from soil organic matter more quickly, than others, such as nitrogen, some of which is found as insoluble organic compounds. In Chapter 25, we will return to nutrient cycling at a much larger spatial scale as we consider global cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur in the context of human alterations of these cycles. Catchment studies measure losses of nutrients from ecosystems What determines how long nutrients remain in an ecosystem? The retention of nutrients within an ecosystem is related to their uptake into its biological and physical pools and to the stability of their forms. Nitrogen, for example, is more stable as part of an insoluble organic molecule, such as a protein, than as nitrate, which is more easily leached from the soil. Nutrients are lost from an ecosystem when they move below the rooting zone by leaching, and from there into groundwater and streams. Nutrients are also lost to the atmosphere as gases or small particles and by conversion into chemical forms that cannot be used by organisms. In our consideration of nutrient inputs into and losses from ecosystems, we have been referring to ecosystems as if they had definitive spatial units, but what defines the boundaries of an ecosystem? Ecologists studying terrestrial ecosystems commonly focus on a single drainage basin. This unit of study, which is called a catchment, includes the terrestrial area that is drained by a single stream and its tributaries (FIGURE 22.12). By measuring the inputs and outputs of elements in a catchment and calculating the balance between them, ecologists can make inferences about the use of nutrients in the ecosystem and their importance to ecosystem processes such as primary production. FIGURE 22.12 Catchments Are Common Units of Ecosystem Study A drainage basin (known as a catchment or watershed) associated with a single stream system (blue lines), with boundaries determined by topographic divides (outlined in white), is a unit commonly used in terrestrial ecosystem studies to measure inputs and outputs of nutrients. This catchment is the upper Hunters Creek basin, draining the south side of Longs Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park. What assumptions are made in this simple input\u2013output model of a catchment that may not be realistic? (Hint: Compare this figure with Figure 22.13.) FIGURE 22.13 presents a conceptual model of a catchment. Nutrient inputs into the catchment include atmospheric deposition and fixation. Nutrients that enter the catchment may be stored in the soil (on cation exchange sites or in the soil solution) or taken up by organisms. They are transferred within and between these ecosystem components by consumption, decomposition, and weathering processes. Nutrients are assumed to be lost from the catchment primarily in stream water, so measurements of dissolved and particulate matter in streams draining the catchment are often used to quantify these losses. In reality, the situation is often more complicated, as nutrients are also lost to the atmosphere in gaseous forms (e.g., N2 and N2O from denitrification) and as coarse particulate matter, usually fragmented litter (e.g., bits of leaves), and organisms moving out of the ecosystem. However, measurement of the input\u2013output balance of different nutrients, using methods such as those described in ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 22.1, is instructive for determining their biological importance. FIGURE 22.13 Biogeochemistry of a Catchment This conceptual model depicts the major pathways of nutrient movement into, through, and out of a catchment.", "(After G. E. Likens and F. H. Bormann. 1995. Biogeochemistry of a Forested Ecosystem. Springer: New York.) ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 22.1 Measuring the inputs of nutrients into catchments via atmospheric deposition, as well as their losses in stream water, requires knowing the concentrations of the elements in water as well as the volume of water entering and leaving the catchment (i.e., the amount of precipitation and stream flow). The product of the two, concentration times volume, gives the total amount of the element entering or leaving the catchment. These values are usually averaged over periods ranging from a week to a year to provide input\u2013output balances of specific elements. Atmospheric deposition includes (1) elements captured in precipitation when it falls to the surface (wet deposition) and (2) particles, including aerosols and fine dust, that are transferred to the surface by gravitational fallout or air movement (dry deposition). Total atmospheric deposition can be sampled by placing buckets above the surrounding vegetation to collect the deposited material. However, buckets make good perches for birds, which may deposit their own contribution to ecosystem nutrient input inside the bucket, albeit at much higher concentrations than those found in most other parts of the catchment. This problem can be avoided by placing spiky projections around the edge of the bucket to prevent birds from landing on it. Another problem is that open buckets lose water to evaporation, increasing the concentration of the elements inside. Furthermore, in windy, cold climates, buckets are not good collectors or holders of snow because of their aerodynamics. Wet deposition collectors have been developed that open to the atmosphere only during precipitation events and then close to prevent evaporation (FIGURE A). A moisture-sensitive surface controls a switch that opens and closes the collector. Where snow and wind occur together, windscreens help to prevent loss of snow from the bucket and enhance the capture of the deposition. Separate precipitation gauges may also be used to more accurately estimate the volume of precipitation entering the ecosystem. At regular intervals, the precipitation in the bucket or collector is analyzed for the elements of interest using chemical analyses that typically meet some government standard (e.g., in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency provides these standards). In many developed nations, networks of wet deposition samplers have been established to provide spatial estimates of atmospheric deposition (e.g., the National Atmospheric Deposition Program in the United States: nadp.sws.uiuc.edu; see Interactive Figure 25.19). FIGURE A Measuring Deposition A wet deposition collector is serviced on Niwot Ridge, Colorado. The bucket on the right is covered except during precipitation events. Dry deposition measurements are more complex, usually involving collection of atmospheric samples to measure the sizes of atmospheric particles and their chemical composition. These measurements are combined with wind speed and direction measurements to estimate movements of elements to the surface. Because of the greater difficulty of the sampling and the larger uncertainties, dry deposition is measured less frequently than wet or bulk (total) deposition. In some areas, however, such as deserts or Mediterranean-type ecosystems, dry deposition is the largest component of total deposition. Measuring nutrient losses in stream flow is straightforward. The chemical composition of stream water leaving the catchment is measured by periodically collecting water samples and analyzing their chemistry. The volume of stream water is often estimated by constructing a weir, a small, usually V-shaped overflow dam made of concrete or wood and metal to control the size of the channel, and placing a depth gauge to calculate the volume of water passing through it (FIGURE B). The depth of the water can be measured with an automated system to give continuous volume estimates. FIGURE B Measuring Water Flow A weir on Fool Creek in the Fraser Experimental Forest, Colorado. The best-known catchment studies have been performed at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire (Likens and Bormann 1995), which is considered to be representative of the northern deciduous forests of the United States. Continuous monitoring of the Hubbard Brook catchment began in 1963 under the direction of Herb Bormann and Gene Likens, whose studies have served as models for a number of other catchment-level studies. These studies are providing information about the roles of organisms and soils in nutrient retention, how ecosystems respond to disturbances such as logging and fire, and long-term trends in nutrient flows associated with acid rain and climate change. Long-term ecosystem development affects nutrient cycling and constraints on primary production", "As terrestrial ecosystems develop on new substrates (e.g., in primary succession on new volcanic flows), soil weathering, nitrogen fixation, and the buildup of organic matter in the soil determine the supply of nutrients available to plants. Early in ecosystem development, there is little organic matter in the soil, so supplies of nitrogen derived from decomposition are low. Supplies of mineral nutrients derived from weathering are also low, but higher relative to the supply of nitrogen. Accordingly, nitrogen availability should be an important constraint on primary production and plant community composition early in primary succession (see Chapter 17). As the pool of nitrogen in soil organic matter increases, its limitation of primary production should decrease. Phosphorus enters ecosystems through the weathering of a single rock mineral (apatite), and its supply is high relative to that of nitrogen early in succession. As the supply of phosphorus from weathering is exhausted over time, however, decomposition becomes increasingly important as a source of phosphorus for plants. In addition, soluble phosphorus may combine with iron, calcium, or aluminum to form secondary minerals that are unavailable as nutrients, a process known as occlusion. The amount of phosphorus in occluded forms increases over time, further reducing its availability. As a result, phosphorus should become more limiting to primary production during later stages of succession (Walker and Syers 1976). These observations of changes in nutrient cycling during ecosystem development provide a hypothetical framework for considering how those changes should influence the specific nutrients that limit primary production. Nitrogen should be most important in determining rates of primary production early in succession, nitrogen and phosphorus should both be important at intermediate stages of succession, and phosphorus should be most important late in succession. This hypothesis was tested in the Hawaiian Islands by Peter Vitousek and his colleagues. The movement of the Pacific tectonic plate over millions of years has given rise to the chain of volcanoes that form these islands. The oldest islands are in the northwestern part of the chain, the youngest in the southeast (FIGURE 22.14A). Vitousek\u2019s group studied Hawaiian ecosystems on soils with ages ranging from 300 years to over 4 million years to determine which nutrients were most limiting to primary production. Their study was aided by the similarity of the vegetation and climate at each of the study sites. Vitousek and colleagues added nitrogen, phosphorus, or both nitrogen and phosphorus to plots in three ecosystems of different ages and measured the effects of these treatments on the growth of the dominant tree, Ohi\u2019a (Metrosideros polymorpha). Consistent with their hypothesis, nitrogen was most limiting to tree growth in the youngest ecosystem, while phosphorus was most important in the oldest ecosystem (Vitousek and Farrington 1997) (FIGURE 22.14B). Nitrogen and phosphorus added in combination increased tree growth in the intermediate-aged ecosystem. In contrast to these tropical soils, the soils of ecosystems in temperate, high-latitude, and high-elevation zones are often subjected to major disturbances (e.g., large-scale glaciation, landslides) and are less likely to reach ages at which phosphorus becomes limiting. FIGURE 22.14 Nutrient Limitation of Primary Production Changes with Ecosystem Development (A) Fertilization experiments were conducted in three ecosystems of different ages in the Hawaiian Islands: Thurston (300 years old), Laupahoehoe (20,000 years old), and Kokee (4.1 million years old). Vegetation at all three sites is dominated by a single tree species, Ohi\u2019a (Metrosideros polymorpha). (B) Ohi\u2019a growth rates in response to fertilization treatments with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and both (N + P) in the three ecosystems. The more an added nutrient increased tree growth, the more limiting it was assumed to be. Note the differences in the ranges of the y axes. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (A after T. E.

They are a critical source of nutrients for those aquatic ecosystems, but they can have negative effects as well, as we\u2019ll see in the next section. Self-Assessment 22.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 22.4 Freshwater and marine nutrient cycles occur in a moving medium and are linked to terrestrial ecosystems. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 22.4.1", "Describe the concept of nutrient spiraling in moving waters and summarize the factors that control the spiral lengths. 22.4.2 Differentiate between natural and anthropogenic causes of eutrophication. 22.4.3 Explain why seasonal lake turnover and upwelling are important to enhancing nutrient supply in lakes and oceans. Nutrients in Aquatic Ecosystems In freshwater and marine ecosystems, nutrient transformations and transfers have the added complexity of occurring in a moving aqueous medium. Inputs of nutrients from outside the ecosystem are much more important than in terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, oxygen concentrations are often lower than in terrestrial ecosystems, constraining biological activity and the biogeochemical processes associated with it. Nutrients in streams and rivers cycle while moving downstream Nutrient supplies in streams and rivers are highly dependent on external inputs from terrestrial ecosystems. Terrestrial inputs of organic matter, dissolved nutrients derived from chemical weathering and decomposition in surrounding soils, and particulate minerals are the primary sources of nutrients for riverine organisms. Rivers and streams carry these materials to the ocean, but they are not just conduits for the movement of material between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Biogeochemical processing in moving stream water can change the forms and concentrations of the elements it contains. For example, denitrification and biological uptake in streams and rivers may result in significant losses of nitrogen during transport in stream water. These processes may explain why rivers export less nitrate from regions receiving high amounts of nitrogen pollution than would be expected (FIGURE 22.15A). Both denitrification and biological uptake are enhanced when detritus is abundant on the stream bottom (FIGURE 22.15B). FIGURE 22.15 Rivers Are Important Modifiers of Nitrogen Exports Nitrogen that enters rivers from terrestrial ecosystems is not simply carried to the ocean. (A) The rates of nitrogen exports to the North Atlantic Ocean from major drainage basins are correlated with rates of nitrogen inputs into rivers by human activities. The export rates, however, are substantially lower than the input rates because of biogeochemical processing of the nitrogen in the rivers (notice the difference between the scales in the x and y axes). (B) Denitrification and biological uptake are two of the main processes that lower the export of nitrogen from drainage basins. Both processes are enhanced when benthic detritus is high. DON, dissolved organic nitrogen. (A after R. W. Howarth et al. 1996. Biogeochemistry 35: 75\u2013139; B after E. S. Bernhardt et al. 2005. BioScience 55: P219\u2013P230.) Nutrients in rivers and streams are cycled repeatedly as the water flows downstream. Dissolved inorganic forms of nutrients are taken up by organisms, including fungi, bacteria, and phytoplankton, which incorporate them into organic molecules. These organisms may be consumed by others and pass through a food web, eventually entering the pool of stream detritus. Following decomposition of the detritus, the mineralized nutrients are released back into the water in dissolved inorganic forms. This repeated uptake and release in association with the movement of water can be thought of as nutrient \u201cspiraling\u201d (Newbold et al. 1983) (FIGURE 22.16). The time it takes for a full nutrient spiral to occur (i.e., from uptake and incorporation into organic forms to release in inorganic forms) is related to the amount of biological activity in the stream, the water velocity, and the chemical form of the nutrient. These variables have important impacts on the retention of nutrient pollutants (nitrate and phosphate) in rivers. Greater biological retention (longer nutrient spirals) helps to buffer the impacts of nutrient pollution to downstream sources (lakes, estuaries). The turnover of nitrate in rivers tends to increase downstream, as indicated by increasing spiral lengths, while phosphate is retained equally well upstream and downstream (Ensign and Doyle 2006). FIGURE 22.16 Nutrient Spiraling in Stream and River Ecosystems Cycling of nutrients as the water moves downstream results in repeated spirals of nutrient uptake and release. Nutrients in lakes cycle efficiently in the water column Lake ecosystems receive inputs of nutrients from streams, by atmospheric deposition and nitrogen fixation, and as litter falling from adjacent terrestrial ecosystems. Biological demand for nutrients is highest in the photic zone, where phytoplankton are suspended in the water column, and in the shallow zones at the margins of the lake, where rooted aquatic plants are found. Phosphorus and sometimes nitrogen limit primary production in lakes. Nutrient transfers between trophic levels, like energy transfers (see Figure 21.5C), are very efficient in lakes. Some detritus is decomposed and mineralized in the water column and in sediments in the shallow zones, providing an internal input of nutrients.", "Nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria occurs in the photic zone, particularly when demand for nitrogen by organisms is greater than for phosphorus. Rates of nitrogen fixation in lake ecosystems are similar to those in terrestrial ecosystems. Over time, nutrients are progressively lost from the photic zone of a lake. Dead organisms sink through the water column and are deposited in the sediments of the benthic zone. These sediments are characterized by hypoxic conditions that limit decomposition, and by a reducing chemical environment that may change 3+ 2+ the chemical form of some nutrients. Iron, for example, is often reduced from Fe to Fe , contributing to the dark color of lake sediments. Denitrification is also promoted by the low oxygen concentrations in the sediments, and bacteria may reduce sulfate (SO 2\u2013) to hydrogen sulfide (H S). 42 Decomposition in the benthic sediments cannot provide nutrients to the photic zone unless there is mixing of the water column. In stratified temperate-zone lakes, as we saw in Concept 2.5, this mixing occurs in fall and spring, when the lake\u2019s water becomes isothermal throughout and wind facilitates its turnover. This seasonal turnover brings dissolved nutrients from the bottom water to the surface layers, along with detritus that may be subsequently decomposed by bacteria. Mixing of water layers is less common in tropical lakes, so external inputs of nutrients may be more important for maintaining production in those lakes. Lake ecosystems are often classified according to their nutrient status. Nutrient-poor waters with low primary productivity are referred to as oligotrophic, while nutrient-rich waters with high primary productivity are referred to as eutrophic. Mesotrophic waters are intermediate in nutrient status between oligotrophic and eutrophic waters. The nutrient status of a lake is the result of natural processes associated with climate and with lake size and shape. For example, lakes in high mountain areas are typically oligotrophic because of their short growing season, low temperatures, and tendency to be deep with a low surface area-to-volume ratio, which constrains the rate of nutrient input by atmospheric deposition. In contrast, shallow lakes at lower elevations or in the tropics tend to be eutrophic because of their warmer temperatures and higher nutrient availability. The nutrient status of a lake tends to shift naturally from oligotrophic to eutrophic over time. This process, known as eutrophication, occurs as sediments accumulate on the lake bottom (FIGURE 22.17). As the lake becomes shallower, its summer temperatures become warmer, more decomposition occurs, nutrient pools and the amount of mixing increase, and the lake becomes more productive. Human activities have accelerated the process of eutrophication in many lakes through discharges of sewage, agricultural fertilizers, and industrial wastes containing high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. For example, the water of Lake Tahoe, on the border between Nevada and California, has lost much of its clarity because of increased inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen from streams, groundwater, and surface runoff from neighboring communities. Water clarity, which is used as an indicator of a lake\u2019s nutrient status, is primarily determined by the density of plankton in the water column. It can be measured using a Secchi disk, a black-and-white circular plate that is lowered gradually into the water; the maximum depth at which the disk can be seen is referred to as the depth of clarity. Over the past 3 decades, the average depth of clarity in Lake Tahoe has risen by 10 m (Murphy and Knopp 2000). The rate at which water clarity has been declining has slowed since 2000, partly because of lower amounts of precipitation as well as lower concentrations of nutrient pollutants in streams draining into the lake. FIGURE 22.17 Lake Sediments and Depth Sediments accumulate at the bottom of a lake over time, making it progressively shallower and leading to eutrophication. Changes in the depth contours of Mirror Lake in New Hampshire show the accumulation of sediments there over the past 14,000 years. (After M. B. Davis et al. 1985. In An Ecosystem Approach to Aquatic Ecology: Mirror Lake and Its Environment, G. E. Likens [Ed.], pp. 345\u2013366. Springer: New York.) Anthropogenic eutrophication can be reversed if the discharge of wastes into surface waters is decreased. A classic example of such a reversal occurred in the 1960s and 1970s in Lake Washington, near Seattle. Treated sewage, containing high concentrations of phosphorus, was released into Lake Washington beginning in the late 1940s as neighborhoods and accompanying sewage treatment plants were built near the shore of the lake.", "Decreases in water clarity were noted during the 1950s, corresponding to increases in phytoplankton densities and blooms of cyanobacteria. Public concern grew, and local governments debated what action to take. A prominent local limnologist, W. T. Edmondson, believed that the problem was associated with phosphorus inputs from the treated sewage, which included wastewater from washing machines containing phosphorus-laden detergents. Based on Edmondson\u2019s advice, Seattle stopped its sewage input into Lake Washington completely by 1968. Increases in water clarity were soon noted, and by 1975, the lake was considered recovered from eutrophication (FIGURE 22.18). Edmondson\u2019s recommendation was crucial to the lake\u2019s recovery, and the case contributed to the current U.S. restrictions on the use of phosphates in detergents. FIGURE 22.18 Lake Washington: Reversal of Fortune Inputs of treated sewage between the 1940s and the 1960s caused eutrophication in Lake Washington; cessation of sewage inputs between 1963 and 1968 increased lake clarity. (A) Phosphorus inputs. (B) Measurements of water clarity made with a Secchi disk. (After W. T. Edmondson and A. H. Litt. 1982. Limnol Oceanogr 27: 272\u2013293.) While the story of Lake Washington seems to be a clear \u201cexperimental\u201d demonstration of pollution influencing the nutrient status of a lake, what would make it an even more convincing example? Imports and upwelling are important sources of nutrients in marine ecosystems Rivers join marine ecosystems in estuaries (described in Concept 3.3). In these zones where fresh water meets seawater, salinity\u2014and thus water density\u2014is variable. This variation influences the mixing of waters and the chemical forms of some nutrients. For example, phosphorus bound to soil particles may be released in a form more easily available to phytoplankton as a result of changes in pH when river water mixes with seawater. As the velocity of water flow decreases toward the mouth of a river, suspended sediments begin to settle out of the water. These sediments are substrates for detritivores and nutrients for phytoplankton in the estuary. Estuaries are often associated with salt marshes, which are rich in nutrients because they trap both riverine and ocean sediments. Like benthic sediments in lakes, estuarine and salt marsh sediments have low oxygen concentrations that limit decomposition. As described in Concept 20.2, primary production in the open ocean is limited by several nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and, in some areas, iron and silica. Seawater has relatively high concentrations of magnesium, calcium, potassium, chloride, and sulfur. Sources of nitrogen in marine ecosystems include inputs from rivers and atmospheric deposition as well as tight internal cycling through decomposition. Rates of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria in the oceans are lower than those in freshwater lakes, possibly because these organisms are limited by molybdenum, which is a component of the nitrogenase enzyme. Phosphorus, iron, and silica enter the marine ecosystem primarily in dissolved and particulate form in rivers; a smaller but important contribution comes from atmospheric deposition of dust. Inputs from both of these terrestrial sources are increasing as a result of human activities, including large-scale desertification and deforestation. Deep deposits of sediments (up to 10 km, or 6 miles thick!) have accumulated in the benthic zones of the open ocean. These deposits, which consist of a mix of ocean-derived detritus and terrestrial erosional sediments, are important potential sources of nutrients. Sulfate reduction and denitrification occur in these anoxic sediments, and some decomposition and mineralization of organic matter also occur there. Bacteria have been found as deep as 500 m in these sediments. The deep ocean layers are dense due to cold temperatures and high salt concentrations (see Concept 2.2) and usually don\u2019t mix with the surface waters. Mixing of deep, nutrient-rich waters with nutrient-poor surface waters does occur in zones of upwelling, where ocean currents bring deep waters to the surface (FIGURE 22.19). These zones of upwelling are highly productive and thus are important areas for commercial fisheries. FIGURE 22.19 Zones of Upwelling Enhance Nutrient Supply for Marine Ecosystems Phytoplankton blooms (green areas), fed by upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean water, can be seen off the coast of the Pribilof Islands (Alaska) in this satellite image. Self-Assessment 22.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED A Fragile Crust We\u2019ve seen that nutrient supplies for plants in terrestrial ecosystems are dependent on the weathering of rock minerals and the decomposition of detritus in the soil, as well as on the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. How might the loss of biocrusts from desert soils influence these processes?", "As this chapter\u2019s Case Study explained, the crusts prevent erosional losses of soil by helping to bind soil particles together. The activity of the organisms that make up the crusts may also influence nutrient inputs and, in turn, the productivity of the desert ecosystem, as well as its capacity to withstand the desert climate. Jason Neff and colleagues conducted a study to evaluate the effects of cattle grazing on soil erosion and nutrient availability on the Colorado Plateau (Neff et al. 2005). They selected three study sites in Canyonlands National Park: one that had never been grazed and two that had been grazed historically but were closed to grazing after 1974 (30 years of recovery). Cattle grazing in the park first occurred in the 1880s, and most of its soil surface has been affected. The ungrazed study site was surrounded by rock formations that prevented the movement of cattle into the area. The study sites all had the same parent material and similar plant communities and were located within 10 km of one another. Biocrusts were present at all three sites, although those at the historically grazed sites had clearly been damaged, as they appeared less well developed than those at the site that had never been grazed. Samples of soil and bedrock were collected from each of the sites, and the textures and nutrient contents of the soils were compared. In addition, the retention of fine dust from the atmosphere was estimated by measuring the magnetic properties of the soil. Dust blown in from distant areas contains higher amounts of iron oxides than the native soil, so the more dust present, the stronger the magnetic signal. Retention of this dust is important because it is a source of mineral nutrients; in addition, loss of this dust indicates the potential for erosional loss of the native soil as well. Neff and colleagues found that the historically grazed soils had less fine-textured soil, and substantially less magnesium and phosphorus, than the ungrazed soils (FIGURE 22.20). They attributed these differences to greater retention of dust and lower rates of erosion in the soils with better-developed biocrusts. The crusts may also enhance rates of weathering by altering pH, by increasing the rates of chemical reactions that release mineral nutrients, and by increasing water retention in the soil. Soils in the historically grazed sites also contained 60%\u201370% less carbon (from organic matter) and nitrogen than those in the ungrazed sites. These differences were also related to biocrusts. Although a crust had begun to recover at the historically grazed sites, comparison with the ungrazed site showed that the cumulative loss of carbon and nitrogen from the soils during the period of grazing was high. The cyanobacteria in biocrusts fix atmospheric N2 (Belnap 2003), which represents an important input of a nutrient that may limit plant growth in the absence of water limitation during the spring growing season. In addition, crust-covered soils absorb more solar radiation and retain more water than soils without crusts, creating conditions more conducive to decomposition and mineralization. FIGURE 22.20 Loss of Biocrusts Results in Smaller Nutrient Supplies Historically grazed soils in Canyonlands National Park contained less carbon, magnesium, nitrogen, and phosphorus than soils that had never been grazed. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (Graph after J. C. Neff et al. 2005. Ecol Appl 15: 87\u201395.) CONNECTIONS in NATURE NUTRIENTS, DISTURBANCE, AND INVASIVE SPECIES By increasing nutrient supplies and stabilizing soils, biocrusts enhance primary production. Plants growing in association with the crusts have higher growth rates, and contain more nutrients, than plants growing in soils without crusts. Plant cover also increases in the presence of biocrusts. Furthermore, biocrusts have been shown to lower the germination and survival rates of invasive plants (Havrilla et al. 2019) (see Chapter 23). Thus, the destruction of crusts by cattle grazing has had multiple ecological effects. Are the negative effects of cattle grazing on soil stability and nutrient availability that Neff and colleagues observed in Canyonlands National Park common in other areas? The answer lies in part with the long-term history of grazing and climate in North America. Prior to Euro-American settlement, soils in much of the intermountain West did not experience the amount of grazing by native animals that occurred in other areas, such as the Great Plains, where large herds of bison roamed (see the Case Study in Chapter 3 and the discussion in Concept 3.2).", "A combination of aridity and long-term development of biocrusts may have given the soils of the Colorado Plateau an especially low tolerance for heavy grazing. In the grasslands of the intermountain West, the combination of soil disturbance and loss of biocrust has created a situation conducive to the spread of non-native species\u2014most notably cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum; FIGURE 22.21), a native of Eurasia. Cheatgrass has had profound effects on the ecology of much of western North America. Cheatgrass is a spring annual that sets seed, dies, and dries out by early summer. This life history increases the amount of dry, combustible vegetation that is present during the summer. As a result, cheatgrass has increased the frequency of fires, which now occur about every 3\u20135 years, compared with more natural fire frequencies of 60\u2013100 years. Native grasses and shrubs cannot recover from such frequent fires, so cheatgrass increases its dominance under these conditions. Cheatgrass is an effective competitor for soil resources, and it also lowers rates of nitrogen cycling by producing litter with a C:N ratio higher than those of native species (Evans et al. 2001). This combination of increasing fire frequency, increasing competition, and changes in nutrient cycling has led to decreases in native species richness in many parts of the intermountain grasslands. FIGURE 22.21 Scourge of the Intermountain West Large areas of the intermountain West of North America are now dominated by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), an invasive species that increases fire frequencies, outcompetes native plants for resources, and spreads rapidly across the landscape. Unit 7 Conservation Biology KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 23.1 Conservation biology is an integrative discipline that applies the principles of ecology to the protection of biodiversity. CONCEPT 23.2 Biodiversity is declining globally. CONCEPT 23.3 Primary threats to diversity include habitat loss, invasive species, overexploitation, pollution, disease, and climate change. CONCEPT 23.4 Conservation biologists use many tools and work at multiple scales to manage declining populations. CONCEPT 23.5 Prioritizing species helps maximize the biodiversity that can be protected with limited resources. Can Birds and Bombs Coexist? A Case Study How could the chaos and destruction of preparing for battle be beneficial for conservation efforts? Although it may seem strange, bombing for decades on the Fort Bragg military base in the North Carolina Sandhills has inadvertently protected thousands of acres of longleaf pine savanna, aiding efforts to save the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (FIGURE 23.1). FIGURE 23.1 The Red-Cockaded Woodpecker: An Endangered Species A female red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) approaches her nest cavity. This species was once abundant throughout the pine savannas (communities dominated by grasses intermixed with pine trees) of the United States but has been severely reduced in numbers by the loss of its required habitat. For a century, the forests of Fort Bragg have been used for military training exercises, degraded by off-road vehicles and earth-moving equipment, and set on fire by explosives. These destructive activities take place in the midst of a once common but now rare ecosystem\u2014one that, ironically, survives in large part as a result of the military presence. How can this be? First, pine savanna depends on fire for its persistence, so the fires that result from explosions benefit rather than harm the ecosystem. Second, the designation of large blocks of forest land for military use has kept them from being converted to farmland, forest plantations, and residential uses. While some longleaf pine savanna has been preserved at Fort Bragg and other military bases, overall, this ecosystem has been reduced to only 3% of the more than 35 million hectares (>134,000 square miles) it once covered (FIGURE 23.2). Various factors have contributed to its decline, including rapid growth of the human population; the clearing of land for large plantations where other tree species, such as loblolly pine, are grown; and fire suppression. With the decline of the longleaf pine savanna ecosystem, several plant, insect, and vertebrate species that depend on it have also undergone substantial declines. FIGURE 23.2 Decline of the Longleaf Pine Savanna Community (A) The estimated area covered by longleaf pine savanna at different times. The cover of this community has not changed from 2004 to the present. (B) As seen in this photograph from the southeastern United States, longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savanna consists of open forest with a grass understory. (A after D. H. Van Lear et al. 2005. For Ecol Manage 211: 150\u2013165; based on data from C. C. Frost. 1993. Tall Timbers Fire Ecol Conf 18: 17\u201344; W. G. Wahlenberg. 1946.", "Longleaf pine: Its use, ecology, regeneration, protection, growth, and management. C.L. Pack Forestry Foundation & USDA Forest Service; USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service, Longleaf Pine Initiative: Washington, DC. Accessed 13 Nov 2019. https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/national/home/?&cid=nrcsdev11_023913.) Estimate the hectares of longleaf pine savanna that existed in 1500, 1935, and 2004. Was the annual loss of longleaf pine savanna greater from 1500 to 1935, or from 1935 to 2004? One of these species is the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), a small insectivorous bird that requires large tracts of open pine savanna. Once numbering around 1.3 million breeding pairs and associated helpers (collectively known as clusters), the species currently stands at about 7,500 clusters. Whereas other woodpeckers nest in dead snags, red-cockaded woodpeckers require mature, living pine trees, especially the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), for their nesting cavities. Periodic fires historically helped to maintain longleaf pine savanna. Without those fires, the longleaf pine community soon undergoes succession. As an understory of young oaks and other hardwoods grows up, redcockaded woodpeckers abandon their nesting cavities, apparently because of a decrease in food resources. In the past, the birds would move to parts of the forest that had been more recently burned, but as the area of suitably mature longleaf pines declines, there are fewer and fewer places for the birds to go. This loss of habitat has reduced the woodpecker\u2019s populations, making them vulnerable to the problems associated with small, isolated populations that we discussed in Concept 11.3. There is evidence of genetic inbreeding among the birds, and in 1989, Hurricane Hugo killed 70% of the birds in one population. The recent history of the red-cockaded woodpecker reflects that of thousands of other imperiled species around the world that have experienced gradual population declines with extensive loss of habitat, to critically low numbers. Species that require a specific habitat that is degraded by human activities will experience reductions in populations until, in some cases, they vanish. What can be done to protect species such as the red-cockaded woodpecker? Do we have a responsibility to protect existing biodiversity and to restore some of what has been lost? If so, how can we best allocate our limited resources to be most effective in our conservation efforts? Introduction Over the last few centuries, as the human population has grown and increased its use of resources, many species have lost their habitats through direct destruction or through changes in their biological or physical properties. These changes have precipitated a major increase in the rate of species extinctions and loss of diversity. The 2019 analysis of the Red List of Threatened Species, compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), lists 27,159 species as threatened with extinction\u2014 about 1% of all described species worldwide (TABLE 23.1). This number is certainly an underestimate, as only 5% of the species that have been described have been evaluated, and many species have yet to be taxonomically described.

Note: \u201cImperiled\u201d includes the IUCN Red List categories \u201ccritically endangered,\u201d \u201cendangered,\u201d and \u201cvulnerable.\u201d Some groups have been more thoroughly evaluated (mammals, birds) for conservation status than other groups, for which only a small percentage of described species have been evaluated.", "For those groups, there may be a bias toward completing assessments of imperiled species and making assessments of more common species a lower priority, and thus the estimate of the percent of species is not included. That only 1% of described species are shown as imperiled is an artifact of incomplete evaluation, as the percentage is believed to be much higher. An asterisk (*) indicates insufficient coverage for accurate estimate. Ecologists play an important role in measuring the losses of species and their underlying causes. As we\u2019ll see in this chapter and the next, ecologists are also one part of a diverse team working to find ways to slow the decline of species and their habitats. We\u2019ll begin by introducing you to the field of biology dedicated to reversing those declines: conservation biology. CONCEPT 23.1 Conservation biology is an integrative discipline that applies the principles of ecology to the protection of biodiversity. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 23.1.1 Describe the different biological levels of diversity associated with conservation biology. 23.1.2 Evaluate the reasons why preserving biodiversity may be important. 23.1.3 Assess the factors that prompted the rapid development of the field of conservation biology. Conservation Biology The preservation of longleaf pine savanna at the Fort Bragg military base (described in the Case Study) and on other federal and state lands, coupled with legal protection and extraordinary human effort, has led to stabilization and slow recovery of the numbers of red-cockaded woodpeckers (North American Bird Conservation Initiative 2014). As we\u2019ll see in the Case Study Revisited, this slow recovery has required expertise from biological disciplines such as population biology, genetics, and pathology as well as contributions from disciplines outside biology, including law, economics, political science, communications, and sociology. It has also required working with farmers, landowners, the U.S. military, and the business community. Arriving at a successful management approach required not only data collection and analysis, but also creativity and the ability to work with a wide variety of people with interests and concerns (stakeholders) in the longleaf pine savanna ecosystem. Such an integrative approach is characteristic of conservation biology. Conservation biology is the scientific study of the amount of biodiversity (including genetic diversity, species richness, and landscape diversity), how human activities are impacting it, and how best to maintain it and prevent its loss. Biodiversity includes genetic diversity within a species, the diversity of species, and the diversity of communities across landscapes (see Figure 16.7). Conservation biology applies many of the ecological principles and tools that you have studied in this book to the halting or reversal of biodiversity declines. Later in this chapter, we will look at the reasons why biodiversity is declining and at the strategies conservation biologists use to address conservation problems. But first let\u2019s consider why it is so important to prevent and reverse declines in biodiversity. Protecting biodiversity is important for both practical and moral reasons People rely on nature\u2019s diversity. In addition to the hundreds of domesticated species that sustain us, we make abundant use of wild species for food, fuel, and fiber. We harvest wild species for medicines, building materials, spices, and decorative items. Many people rely on these natural resources for their livelihoods. As discussed in Concept 19.4, the natural functioning of biological communities provides valuable services to humans. All of us are dependent on a wide range of these ecosystem services, such as water purification, generation and maintenance of soils, pollination of crops, climate regulation, and flood control (Costanza et al. 2014). These life-sustaining functions are themselves dependent on the integrity of natural communities and ecosystems. Furthermore, for our emotional health, many people require time spent surrounded by nature\u2019s beauty and complexity. Spiritually, we go to natural ecosystems for solace, wonder, and insight. But beyond our physical dependence on biodiversity, do we have some moral obligation to the other species that inhabit Earth? For many people, biodiversity has inherent value and warrants protection simply for that reason. For others, religious or spiritual beliefs lead to a sense of stewardship, or to the view that other species have a right to exist just as we do. Still others, however, do not share these views and see natural resources primarily as commodities that benefit human society. The field of conservation biology arose in response to global biodiversity losses Scientists have long been aware that human activity affects the abundances and distributions of organisms.", "In the nineteenth century, Alfred Russel Wallace, the \u201cfather of biogeography\u201d whose work we described in Concept 18.2, foresaw the current biodiversity crisis, warning in 1869 that humanity was at risk of obscuring the record of past evolution by bringing about extinctions. In the United States, there was a rising public outcry over the rapid decline of bison in the West, the stunning harvest to extinction of the passenger pigeon (FIGURE 23.3), the extensive use of bird feathers in ladies\u2019 hats, and other assaults on animal populations. FIGURE 23.3 The Passenger Pigeon: From Great Abundance to Extinction The passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), once one of the most abundant birds in North America, was hunted extensively in the nineteenth century. The last passenger pigeon died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914. The ecological effects of its extinction on the eastern deciduous forest, coincident with the loss of the American chestnut (see Concept 13.4), are difficult to estimate but are presumed to be considerable. Ecologists in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century were divided over how strongly they could advocate for the preservation of nature while still maintaining scientific objectivity (Kinchy 2006). Before 1945, the Ecological Society of America frequently lobbied Congress for the establishment of national parks or for better management of existing parks. In 1948, however, the society decided to separate \u201cpure\u201d science from advocacy, and the Ecologists\u2019 Union branched off as an independent entity focused on the preservation of nature. In 1950, this offshoot organization changed its name to The Nature Conservancy, rising in prominence as a nonprofit organization that integrates science with advocacy and on-the-ground conservation work (Burgess 1977). Conservation biology emerged as a scientific discipline in the early 1980s as ecologists and other scientists saw the need to apply their knowledge to the preservation of species and ecosystems. The Society for Conservation Biology, founded in 1985, arose in response to the biodiversity crisis. The emergence of professional journals dedicated to conservation biology during the 1980s and 1990s, and an ongoing increase in the number of academic programs for the training of graduate students and professionals, demonstrate the growing acceptance of and need for this specialized discipline. Conservation biology is a value-based discipline The methods of science call for objectivity\u2014an assurance that the collection and interpretation of data are unbiased by preconceived ideas. Yet science is not free of human values, and it inevitably takes place within a larger social context. Conservation biologists have had to come to terms with the implicit and explicit values that are part of their work. From the founding of the Society for Conservation Biology, the designation of the discipline as \u201cmission driven\u201d (Soul\u00e9 and Wilcox 1980; Meine et al. 2006) and \u201ccrisisoriented\u201d (Soul\u00e9 1985) explicitly revealed the values behind the science. Many ecologists have chosen to speak up or refocus their research programs as they have come to understand the biological consequences of the changes taking place on the planet. For example, in 1986, Dan Janzen, a tropical biologist who had largely committed himself until then to studying tropical plant\u2013insect interactions, wrote that \u201cif biologists want a tropics in which to biologize, they are going to have to buy it with care, energy, effort, strategy, tactics, time, and cash.\u201d Such motivation does not necessarily detract from the objectivity of the scientific studies done by conservation biologists, as they understand that conserving biodiversity will require decisions based on sound and credible analyses, and weighing the trade-offs associated with conservation versus resource extraction. Furthermore, those analyses are subjected to rigorous scientific review by other scientists, who may challenge or even refute their conclusions. In the next section, we\u2019ll meet one ecologist who put the values of conservation biology into practice. Then we\u2019ll examine the extent and causes of the current declines in biodiversity. Self-Assessment 23.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 23.2 Biodiversity is declining globally. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 23.2.1 Differentiate between the current anthropogenically enhanced rate of extinction and the long-term background extinction rate. 23.2.2 Describe the pathway to species extinction from changes in population growth to the disappearance of the species. Declining Biodiversity The tropical botanist Alwyn Gentry devoted his life to identifying, classifying, and mapping the immense diversity of plants found in Central and South America. He also became an eyewitness to plant species extinctions as the region underwent rapid deforestation.", "It was not uncommon for him to identify a new endemic plant species (i.e., a species that occurs in a particular geographic region and nowhere else) during an expedition to Ecuador or Peru, only to return to the same spot a few years later to find the forest cleared and the species gone (Dodson and Gentry 1991) (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 23.4). Gentry worked with a growing sense of urgency to identify rare species in order to protect them from this fate. His death in a plane crash in the Ecuadorian forest in 1993, while doing an aerial survey of land proposed for conservation, cut this work short and was an enormous loss to conservation biology. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 23.4 Loss of Forest Cover in Western Ecuador Between 1958 and 1988, a growing human population and government policies intended to stimulate rapid economic development led to rapid deforestation in western Ecuador. Green indicates forest cover. The extensive loss of forest habitat in this region is estimated to have resulted in the loss of more than 1,000 endemic species. (After C. H. Dodson and A. H. Gentry. 1991. Ann Mo Bot Gard 78: 273\u2013295. Permission granted by Missouri Botanical Garden Press, St. Louis.) Gentry was just one of many taxonomists who have been finding and describing species while witnessing their rapid disappearance due to habitat destruction, disease, or climate change. Extinctions of barely known tropical plant species (and most likely of other species that we have yet to discover) continue throughout the tropics despite our decades-long recognition of the problem. Through greater efforts to explore Earth\u2019s ecosystems, ecologists are gaining knowledge of the world\u2019s biota and tabulating new species at a faster rate, but threats to those species are keeping pace with such gains in our knowledge about them. The rate at which Earth is losing species is accelerating How rapidly are species being lost? That is a difficult question to answer, in part because we do not know how many species exist that remain unknown to us. Most studies have estimated that there are about 5 million to 10 million eukaryotic species on Earth, but there may be as few as 3 million or as many as 50 million (Scheffers et al. 2012) or even more, particularly with greater consideration of microbial diversity (Locey and Lennon 2016). Despite this uncertainty, extinction rates can be estimated using several indirect measures (May et al. 1995; May 2011). For example, estimates of extinction rates from the fossil record can be used to establish a \u201cbackground\u201d extinction rate with which current rates can be compared. For the best-known taxonomic groups, the mammals and birds, paleontologists have estimated that the background extinction rate is on the order of one extinction every 200 years, which is equivalent to an average species life span of 1 million to 10 million years. By contrast, there was about one extinction per year among the mammals and birds over the twentieth century, which is equivalent to an average species life span of only 10,000 years. Thus, overall, the rate of extinction in the twentieth century was 100 to 1,000 times higher than the background rate estimated from the fossil record (Jablonski 2005). A second method for estimating extinction rates uses the species\u2013area relationship discussed in Concept 18.3. In particular, the relationship between number of endemic species and area is used to estimate the number of species that would be driven to extinction by a given amount of habitat loss (Kinzig and Harte 2000). In a third approach, biologists have used changes over time in the assessed conservation statuses of species (e.g., a shift from endangered to critically endangered) to forecast rates of extinction (Smith et al. 1993). Finally, a fourth approach is based on the rates of population decline or range contraction of common species (Balmford et al. 2003). All of these methods have uncertainties affecting their estimates of extinction rates, yet they are the best ways we have to document losses of biodiversity. It can also be difficult to ascertain when a species is definitely extinct. Many species are known from a single specimen or location, and the logistics of relocating them can be daunting. Even an exhaustive hunt for a very rare species can fail to detect some remnant populations. Declaring a species extinct, however, has been known to stimulate biologists\u2019 search efforts, recently aided by the use of drones.", "Since the publication of a flora of Hawaiian plants in 1990, for example, 35 species listed there as extinct have been rediscovered, though only a few individuals have been found. The joy of their rediscovery is compromised by the realization that these extremely small populations cannot serve the same ecological functions as more substantial populations, and that 8% of Hawaii\u2019s native flora of 1,342 species is now considered extinct (Wagner et al. 1999). Although humanity\u2019s growing ecological footprint (see Connections in Nature in Chapter 10) has accelerated the rates of biodiversity loss over the last century, people have had substantial effects on Earth\u2019s biota for millennia (see the Case Study in Chapter 3). David Steadman (1995) described how bones found on Pacific islands revealed the prehistoric extinction of up to 8,000 species of birds (of which perhaps 2,000 species were endemic flightless rails) after these islands were colonized by Polynesians. Most of these species were island endemics, and in some cases the extinctions encompassed entire ecological guilds (FIGURE 23.5). Ecologists can only speculate about the roles the lost frugivores and nectarivores played in maintaining endemic tree populations. Steadman\u2019s findings remind us that extinctions do not only eliminate individual species, but can also cause large changes in ecological communities. FIGURE 23.5 Humans Have Been Causing Extinctions for Millennia Trends over time in (A) the total number of bird species and (B) the number of species classified by feeding guild found in the Pacific island \u2018Eua in the nation of Tonga. Prehistoric extinctions (3,000\u2013200 years ago) occurred on many Pacific islands as a result of hunting and the introduction of rats, dogs, and pigs. (After D. W. Steadman. 1995. Science 267: 1123\u20131131.) Speculate on reasons why losses of birds that feed on fruit (frugivores) or nectar (nectarivores) may have affected the island\u2019s plant communities. (Hint: See the discussion of mutualism in Concepts 15.1 and 15.2.) Extinction is the end point of incremental biological decline In 1954, Andrewartha and Birch wrote that \u201cthere is no fundamental distinction to be made between the extinction of a local population and the extinction of a species other than this: that the species becomes extinct with the extinction of the last local population.\u201d Sometimes the populations of a species gradually erode away, and sometimes they vanish in a spectacular collapse, as in the case of the passenger pigeon. Conservation biologists have approached the process of biological decline and extinction in numerous ways. For example, as we saw in Concept 11.3, small populations are particularly vulnerable to genetic, demographic, and environmental stochasticity, each of which can reduce the population growth rate and increase the risk of local extinction as the population size declines further. Known as an extinction vortex, this pattern can doom a population to eventual extinction once its size drops below a certain point. With this in mind, Caughley (1994) argued that it is important to determine the causes of population declines in particular species, with the aim of identifying actions that could counteract these declines before the extinction vortex takes hold. Ecologists may also study the declines of species using a spatial context by tracking changes in their geographic ranges. Ceballos and Ehrlich (2002) examined patterns of range contraction in 173 declining mammal species worldwide. They found that, collectively, these species had lost 68% of their range area over the past 100\u2013200 years, with the greatest losses in Asia (83%). In a similar study, Channell and Lomolino (2000) examined patterns of range contraction in 309 declining species. They found that a decline often moves through the historic range of a species like a wave, from one end to the other; this could occur, for example, if an invasive species entered the range at one edge and then spread through the range, eliminating the declining species population by population. Such a pattern contrasts with a retreat from all edges of the range into its center, which would probably occur if effects of small population size were prevailing. When populations are lost from an ecological community, there are consequences not only for the declining species, but also for its predators, prey, and mutualistic partners. The loss of bird pollinators, for example, can reduce the reproductive success of plants that depend on those pollinators (FIGURE 23.6), causing plant densities to drop as well (Anderson et al. 2011; Galetti et al. 2013). The resulting changes at the community level may bring about secondary extinctions and ultimately affect ecosystem processes.", "Examples from earlier chapters include the local extinctions and other changes caused by the loss or removal of such species as the amphipod crustacean Corophium volutator (see Concept 13.4), the marsh plant Juncus gerardii (see Concept 16.3), and the sea star Pisaster ochraceus (see Concept 21.4). Modeling results also suggest that while food webs can be resilient to species removal, the loss of certain species can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions. As might be expected, the stronger the interactions of a species in the food web, the greater the effect of its removal (Sol\u00e9 and Montoya 2001). Overall, both empirical and modeling results demonstrate that incremental species loss can have broad ecological consequences. FIGURE 23.6 Loss of Bird Pollinators Reduces Reproductive Success in a New Zealand Shrub Birds that pollinate the shrub Rhabdothamnus solandri are nearly extinct on the New Zealand mainland, but densities of these birds remain high on nearby islands. Researchers recorded the percentage of R. solandri flowers that reproduced successfully (produced seeds) on island and mainland sites for each of three treatments: bagged flowers (which allowed only self-pollination), open flowers (which allowed bird pollination), and open flowers that were hand-pollinated. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After S. H. Anderson et al. 2011. Science 331: 1068\u20131071.) Identify the control and experimental treatments in this study, and explain what can be learned from each of the three treatments. Earth\u2019s biota is becoming increasingly homogenized Organisms are naturally mobile, which influences their dispersal across their geographic ranges, although they are still subject to dispersal barriers such as oceans and mountain ranges. Over the last century, however, people have moved over Earth\u2019s surface at an unprecedented rate, carrying organisms with them and greatly enhancing rates of introductions of new species to all parts of the globe (FIGURE 23.7). FIGURE 23.7 Species Introductions Are Increasing Globally The number of non-native species that have become established in the United States has increased about fivefold over the past century for various organisms, including molluscs, fishes, terrestrial vertebrates, and (A) plants and insects. Similar patterns are seen in many other countries. Photographs in (B) show two examples of introduced species. (After U. S. Congress, OTA. 1993. Harmful Non-Indigenous Species in the United States. U.S. Government Printing Office: Washington, DC, based on contractor reports done for OTA.) While the introduction of non-native species can increase local diversity, they generally have negative effects on native species diversity. For example, introductions of non-natives can contribute to the range contractions of native species whose numbers may already be in decline because of habitat loss and other factors. Typically, the greatest \u201closers\u201d among the native species tend to be specialists\u2014those with morphological, physiological, or behavioral adaptations to a particular habitat\u2014while the \u201cwinners\u201d tend to be generalists with less stringent habitat requirements. The spread of non-native species and native generalists, coupled with declining abundances and distributions of native specialists, is part of a growing taxonomic homogenization of Earth\u2019s biota (Olden et al. 2004). In rare circumstances, non-native species can provide conservation benefits, such as habitat or food for rare species (Schlaepfer et al. 2011). Nonnative tamarisk shrubs (Tamarix spp.), for example, provide nesting habitat for the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus). Species introductions have also increased regional biodiversity in many parts of the world (FIGURE 23.8), although the value of increasing diversity through the increase in non-natives is questionable, as it typically comes at a cost to native diversity. FIGURE 23.8 Introductions of Non-Native Species Can Increase Regional Biodiversity The introduction of non-native species to new regions has led to sizable increases in the numbers of species found on oceanic islands and within continental regions for plants and fishes, but not for birds. (After D. F. Sax and S. D. Gaines. 2003. Trends Ecol Evol 18: 561\u2013566.) The introduction of non-native plants to new regions is associated with a decrease in the global diversity of plants. Explain how that can be true given the results shown in this figure. Island biotas are particularly vulnerable to both invasion and extinction. The decline of island endemics is often accelerated by the introduction of more cosmopolitan species. In a survey of American Samoa, Robert Cowie (2001) found just 19 of the 42 species of land snails historically known from that island group, plus 5 species not previously found there but which he presumed were native. He also found that there were 12 non-native species present on the islands.", "These non-natives occurred in high abundances, representing about 40% of the individuals collected (there was also one abundant native species). Cowie concluded that most native species were declining in abundance, while many non-natives were increasing. Furthermore, the predators contributing to the declines of native land snail species were also non-natives, such as the predatory snail Euglandina rosea and the house mouse (Mus musculus). Cowie has found this trend toward homogenization of land snail faunas to be widespread among Pacific islands. Homogenization has also been observed among the freshwater fishes of the United States, largely as the result of widespread introductions of game fishes. Rahel (2000) quantified the homogenization of U.S. fish faunas by examining the change in the number of species shared between all possible pairs of the 48 conterminous states. He found that, on average, pairs of states shared 15 more species than they did at the time of European colonization (FIGURE 23.9). FIGURE 23.9 U.S. Fish Faunas Are Undergoing Taxonomic Homogenization The numbers of fish species shared by pairs of the 48 conterminous U.S. states have increased since European settlement. (After F. J. Rahel. 2000. Science 288: 854\u2013856.) On a global scale, it is clear that biodiversity is being lost as a result of humanity\u2019s impact on the planet. Let\u2019s look in more detail at the reasons for these losses, and then consider what steps can be taken to counteract them. Self-Assessment 23.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 23.3 Primary threats to diversity include habitat loss, invasive species, overexploitation, pollution, disease, and climate change. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 23.3.1 Compare the most important threats to diversity over the past century with the threats that are increasing the most in importance. 23.3.2 Describe the causes of diversity losses associated with habitat loss and degradation. 23.3.3 Explain the underlying mechanisms determining how invasive species, overexploitation, and water and air pollution lead to diversity loss. Threats to Diversity Understanding the causes of diversity losses is a first step toward reversing them. Multiple factors are likely to contribute to the decline and eventual extinction of any particular species. For example, while the last Pyrenean ibex (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) was killed in 2000 by a falling tree, declines in its populations following the fourteenth century resulted from overexploitation and competition with domesticated livestock, leading to its eventual extinction (Perez et al. 2002). Multiple causes of diversity loss are also apparent in higher taxonomic groups. For example, over 1,223 mammal species (25% of those for which adequate data are available) are currently threatened with extinction (see Table 23.1). Globally, the primary threats facing mammals are loss of habitat, overexploitation, accidental mortality (e.g., road kills), and pollution\u2014but the relative importance of these factors differs between terrestrial and marine mammals (FIGURE 23.10). Some mammals are threatened by additional factors, such as disease. As we\u2019ll see, this scenario, in which multiple types of threats contribute to the decline and extinction of a taxon, is common. FIGURE 23.10 Threats to Mammal Species Globally, 22% of mammal species are threatened by extinction. These maps show the numbers of terrestrial and marine mammal species in various parts of the globe that are negatively affected by (A) habitat loss, (B) overexploitation, (C) accidental mortality, and (D) pollution. (From J. Schipper et al. 2008. Science 322: 225\u2013230.) Contrast the threats to land mammals with those to marine mammals. Habitat loss and degradation are the most important threats to diversity The next time you fly in an airplane over Earth\u2019s surface, look down and ask yourself, \u201cWhat species lived here before these farms and cities were here? Where do the species native to this place live now, and how do they move about?\u201d From 30,000 feet above the landscape, you will find yourself face to face with the source of the diversity crisis: the scale of the human impact on the planet. Earth has been modified across 60% of its land surface (Sanderson et al. 2002), and all marine ecosystems have been affected by humans (Halpern et al. 2008). One species, Homo sapiens, is now appropriating about 25% of Earth\u2019s primary production (Haberl et al. 2014). The influence of human activities on natural habitat is the most important factor contributing to global declines in diversity (Sax and Gaines 2003). There are areas of extreme human influence, such as agricultural regions and certain coastal waters, and areas of little human influence, such as deserts and some polar seas.", "Overall, however, most of the lands and waters of Earth are at least moderately affected by humans (see Interactive Figure 3.5B). Addressing the loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat caused by human activities is central to conservation work. Habitat loss refers to the outright conversion of habitat to another use, such as urban development or agriculture, while habitat fragmentation refers to the breaking up of once continuous habitat into a series of habitat patches amid a human-dominated landscape. Habitat degradation refers to changes that reduce the quality of the habitat for many, but not all, species. Concepts 24.2 and 24.3 will address habitat fragmentation and its effects in detail; in this and the following sections, we\u2019ll cover habitat loss and habitat degradation. On a continental scale, the extent of loss of some habitats is staggering (see Figure 24.12). Similar losses can be observed on more local scales, as in the forests of western Ecuador (see Interactive Figure 23.4). Another example is provided by the Atlantic forest of Brazil (Ranta et al. 1998). This moist tropical forest has many endemic species, perhaps because it has been isolated from the Amazon rainforest for millions of years. Of South America\u2019s 904 mammal species, 73 are endemic to this forest, and 25 of those endemics are threatened with extinction. The forest\u2019s location also coincides with that of 70% of Brazil\u2019s human population. As a result, more than 92% of this habitat has been cleared to make room for agriculture and urban development, and what remains has been highly fragmented, pushing many species to endangerment. How has the loss of Atlantic forest habitat affected diversity? Brooks and colleagues (1999) asked why there have been no reports of extinctions among birds of this region. They offered three possible explanations, which may apply to patterns of biological decline in other regions as well. First, the birds may be adjusting to living in forest fragments. Second, the most vulnerable species might have gone extinct before they were known to biologists. Their third explanation, which they see as the most plausible, is that the time lag between deforestation and extinction has not yet played out. While there may have been no reported extinctions yet, populations have been reduced to such an extent that the birds may no longer be capable of maintaining their populations. Unless drastic measures are taken, such species are doomed to extinction. Moreover, the loss of bird species will have negative effects on other species. Already, as bird populations in the Brazilian Atlantic forest have dwindled to low numbers, reductions in seed size and seedling survival have been observed in plant populations that depend on these birds for seed dispersal (Galetti et al. 2013). Habitat degradation is extremely widespread, and it has diverse causes, including invasive species, overexploitation, and pollution. We\u2019ll turn now to one of those causes, invasive species. Invasive species can displace native species and alter ecosystem properties As discussed earlier, the introduction of non-native species generally has negative effects on diversity. Here, we\u2019ll consider how declines in diversity can be caused by the arrival of these invasive species: non-native, introduced species that sustain growing populations and have large effects on communities. Worldwide, 20% of endangered vertebrates, especially those on islands, are imperiled as a result of invasive species (MacDonald et al. 1989). Invasive species are of particular concern where they compete with, prey on, or change the physical environment of endangered native species. The effect of the Eurasian zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) on the freshwater mussel species of North America is a prime example (see Figure 19.5). North America is the center of diversity for freshwater mussels (bivalves of the order Unionoida), with 297 species, a third of those in the world. Prior to the invasion of the zebra mussel in the late 1980s, North American freshwater mussels were already in trouble. Most of these species are globally imperiled, many are endemic and thus naturally rare, and all are threatened by water pollution and river channelization. Competition with zebra mussels has brought about steep declines in populations of native freshwater mussels (60%\u201390%), including some regional extinctions (Strayer and Malcom 2007). Invasive predators can also contribute to extinctions. In Lake Victoria, introduction of the Nile perch (Lates niloticus) has reduced the diversity and abundance of the native cichlid fishes, a group that shows adaptive radiation (a phenomenon discussed in Concept 6.4), with many species in specific habitats. Historically, about 600 species of cichlids had been recorded, most of which were endemic to Lake Victoria.", "The Nile perch is a large predator, and its introduction into the lake in the early 1960s as a food source for human populations has contributed to the extinction of roughly 200 cichlid species. Before the introduction, the cichlids made up 80% of the biomass of fish in the lake; the Nile perch now accounts for 80% of the biomass. As is often the case, more than one factor is driving the cichlids\u2019 decline: pollution and overfishing augment the negative effect of predation by the Nile perch (Seehausen et al. 1997). In many ecosystems, habitat loss and degradation have increased vulnerability to invasion by non-native species, which in turn may lead to consequences that further degrade the ecosystem. The tropical dry forest of Hawaii, for example, harbors more than 25% of Hawaii\u2019s threatened plant species. The area of tropical dry forest has been reduced by 90% since human settlement. The arrival of invasive feral hogs, rats, and plants has made a bad situation worse. In addition to outcompeting and displacing local plants, invasive grasses are an excellent source of fuel for fires. As a result, the frequency of fires has increased (see Analyzing Data 9.1), furthering the decline of Hawaiian dry forests but favoring the spread of the fire-adapted, introduced grasses. Ecosystem properties such as nitrogen cycling (see Figure 22.11) can be altered by some invasive species. One such species is kudzu (Pueraria montana), an invasive vine that covers more than 3 million ha (7.4 million acres) in the southeastern United States. This species disrupts communities by outcompeting other plants for light (see Figure 14.4). In addition, kudzu can fix up to 235 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, an amount that far exceeds the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen in the eastern United States (7\u201313 kg N/ha/year). To examine the extent to which nitrogen fixation by kudzu affects the nitrogen cycle, Hickman et al. (2010) measured the nitrogen mineralization rate in plots with and without kudzu (as discussed in Concept 22.2, the nitrogen mineralization rate provides an estimate of the rate at which nitrogen is supplied to plants). On average, nitrogen mineralization rates increased more than sevenfold in plots invaded by kudzu (FIGURE 23.11), indicating a large effect on soil nitrogen supply. In addition, more than twice as much of the gas nitric oxide (NO) was released from the soil in plots invaded by kudzu as in plots lacking kudzu (see ANALYZING DATA 23.1 to test whether NO emissions at one of the study sites differ statistically between plots with kudzu and plots lacking kudzu). In the atmosphere, NO participates in chemical reactions that produce ground-level ozone, a pollutant that affects human health and agricultural production (see Concept 25.4). Modeling results suggest that kudzu has the potential to increase the number of high-ozone event days by as many as 7 days per summer across broad regions of the southeastern United States (Hickman et al. 2010). Additionally, the greater supply of soil nitrogen fosters greater spread of invasive plants. FIGURE 23.11 Invasive Species Can Alter the Nitrogen Cycle At three sites in Georgia, net nitrogen mineralization rates (an index of how rapidly nitrogen cycling occurs in an ecosystem) were much higher in soils supporting kudzu than in soils with native vegetation. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After J. E. Hickman et al. 2010. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107: 10115\u201310119.) ANALYZING DATA 23.1 Hickman et al. (2010)* examined the impact of the invasive species kudzu (Pueraria montana) on nitric oxide (NO) emissions at three study sites in Georgia. NO is an important contributor to pollutant ozone formation. At each site, NO emissions were recorded from four plots with kudzu and four plots lacking kudzu. Data from one study site are presented in the table. In this exercise, you will perform a statistical test (the t-test) to determine whether NO emissions in plots invaded by kudzu are significantly different from NO emissions in plots lacking kudzu. 2 Nitric Oxide Emissions (ng N/cm /hr) Plots with kudzu Plots lacking kudzu 4.1 2.0 1.7 0.9 6.1 1.1 2.8 0.9 1. a.

As we saw in the Case Study of the invasive alga Caulerpa taxifolia in Chapter 16, control or eradication of invasive species is difficult, labor-intensive, and expensive, but at times it may be warranted in the interest of protecting economically or culturally valuable native species or natural resources. The best strategy for combating invasive species is to prevent their arrival through careful screening of biological materials at international borders. But once potentially invasive species are present, control measures are best implemented immediately; constant vigilance and quick action are key to minimizing their effects (Simberloff 2003). Overexploitation of species has large effects on ecological communities Overexploitation, the harvest of wild organisms at a rate that exceeds their replacement, can also lead to loss of diversity. For example, many of the world\u2019s people obtain their food, at least in part, directly from a natural ecosystem. The problem is that as the human population increases and natural habitats shrink, the harvesting of many species from the wild has become unsustainable. Globally, overexploitation is contributing to the imperilment of many species, including many fishes, mammals, birds, reptiles, and plants. Overexploitation has been the cause of the probable extinction of at least one primate, Miss Waldron\u2019s red colobus monkey (Procolobus badius waldroni), a subspecies endemic to Ghana and Ce d\u2019Ivoire whose last confirmed sighting was in 1978 (Oates et al. 2000; McGraw 2005). The effects of overexploitation on tropical forests have been substantial, resulting in what Kent Redford (1992) has called an \u201cempty forest.\u201d This phrase refers to forests that look healthy in satellite images, but in which the abundances and diversity of large vertebrates have decreased. The increased accessibility of forests as roads are built through them facilitates this overharvesting of wildlife, as does the widespread availability of guns. The enormous quantity of \u201cbushmeat\u201d being taken from tropical forests is sobering. Redford has calculated that 13 million mammals are killed each year in the Amazon rainforests of Brazil by rural hunters, and it is estimated that in western and central Africa, 1 million tons of forest animals are taken annually for food (Wilkie and Carpenter 1999). Vast numbers of animals are also captured from tropical forests, coral reefs, and other ecosystems and then exported legally to other countries. For example, government records indicate that from 2000 to 2006, 1.5 billion animals, most of which were for the pet trade, were imported to the United States alone (Smith et al. 2009). In the oceans, rapid and steep declines have taken place in both the abundances (FIGURE 23.12) and sizes (FIGURE 23.13) of top-level predators (Myers and Worm 2003). For every ton of fish caught by commercial trawlers, 1 to 4 tons of other marine life may be brought aboard by the nets. Some organisms may survive the experience and be released back into the sea; the rest comprise what is called bycatch. The bycatch of certain threatened species, such as marine mammals, seabirds, and marine turtles, has received attention from fisheries managers, and in some cases, losses have been reduced through changes in gear design (see Ecological Toolkit 10.1). But bycatch remains common, and concern has been raised about the ecological effects of this unnecessary mortality on marine food webs (Lewison et al. 2004). In addition, repeated trawling on the coastal sea bottom has affected benthic species such as corals and sponges and has thereby degraded benthic habitat for many other species.", "Studies indicate that habitat recovery following trawling is very slow (National Research Council 2002). FIGURE 23.12 The Collapse of the Cod Fishery Changes over time in the amount of cod (Gadus morhua) caught off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. Overharvesting led to the collapse of cod populations, which still have not recovered. (After Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005. Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis. World Resources Institute: Washington, DC.) Based on data prior to 1950, roughly how many tons of cod could have been harvested in a sustainable manner? Explain. FIGURE 23.13 Overharvesting Has Led to a Decline in the Sizes of Top Marine Predators Photographs of trophy fish caught on charter fishing boats based in Key West, Florida, in (A) 1957 and (B) 2007. In commercial and recreational fisheries, the largest fish are often the preferred prey. (C) The total length of trophy fish declined more than 50% between 1960 and 2007. Error bars show \u00b1 one SE of the mean. (C after L. McClenachan. 2009. Conserv Biol 23: 636\u2013 643.) Whenever a species has market value, it is likely to be overharvested. This results in an unfortunate confluence between human behavior (i.e., greed) and declining animal and plant populations, when economically valuable threatened species are subjected to an \u201canthropogenic Allee effect\u201d (see Figure 11.15) due to more aggressive search and harvesting strategies. Many scientists and policymakers argue that the best approach to protecting overexploited species is to determine the levels of harvest that will be sustainable and to establish regulatory mechanisms to permit only those levels to be taken. In one example of how this could be done, Bradshaw and Brook (2007) describe management options that provide revenue from meat and trophy hunting of the wild banteng (Bos javanicus), a member of the cattle genus, yet do not jeopardize the prospects for the recovery of this rare species. Pollution, disease, and climate change erode the viability of populations More insidious effects of human activities, such as air and water pollution and climate change, are causing declines in populations of many species. We are also seeing the emergence of new diseases and the transmission of diseases from domesticated animals into wildlife. The effects of all these factors exacerbate declines in species already reduced by habitat loss, invasive species, or overexploitation. Pollutants released by human activities are omnipresent in air and water. These pollutants become contributors to habitat degradation and diversity loss where they are present at levels that cause physiological stress. We will see in Concept 25.3 how some of these pollutants degrade habitats, reduce populations, and threaten the persistence of species. One example of an emerging pollution threat is the growing concentration of persistent endocrine-disrupting contaminants (EDCs), particularly in the marine environment. As we saw in the Case Study Revisited in Chapter 21, persistent organic pollutants such as DDT, PCBs, flame retardants, and organophosphates from agricultural pesticides, some of which are EDCs, end up in marine food webs, where they are bioaccumulated and biomagnified, particularly in top predators. The number of chemicals found in marine mammals, the number of individuals affected, and the concentrations found have risen markedly in the last 40 years (Tanabe 2002). The orcas of British Columbia have been described as \u201cfireproof killer whales\u201d because of the extremely high levels of flame-retardant chemicals (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, or PBDEs) found in their bodies (FIGURE 23.14). These EDCs have been observed to interfere with reproduction, neurological development, and immune function in mammals (Ross 2006). EDCs have also interfered with reproduction\u2014basically by turning males into females\u2014in many other species as well, including a population of the endangered pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) in the Mississippi River downriver from St. Louis. Such problems for species already at low numbers do not improve the outlook for their future. FIGURE 23.14 Persistent Organic Pollutants That Disrupt the Endocrine System Are a Growing Threat to Marine Mammals In British Columbia, the concentrations of PCBs (A) and PBDEs (B) found in killer whales (Orcinus orca) and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are very high. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After P. S. Ross. 2006. Can J Fish Aquat Sci 63: 224\u2013234, based on data from P. S. Ross et al. 2000. Mar Pollut Bull 40: 504\u2013515; P. S. Ross et al. 2004. Environ Toxicol Chem 23: 157\u2013165; S. Rayne et al. 2003. Environ Sci Technol 36: 2847\u20132854; P. S. Ross, unpublished data.) Disease has also contributed to the decline of many endangered species.", "In a striking example, an emerging disease caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has decimated amphibian populations around the globe (Skerrat et al. 2007) (see also the Case Study Revisited in Chapter 1). In the 1930s, the final decline to extinction of the thylacine, or Tasmanian wolf (Thylacinus cynocephalus), was hastened by an undetermined disease. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) appears to be similarly threatened because of the spread of a facial tumor disease (Hawkins et al. 2006), with populations in some parts of Tasmania decreasing by 50% annually. In the North American prairie, the endangered status of the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) was exacerbated by canine distemper (Woodroffe 1999). CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION IMPACTS ON DIVERSITY Although hundreds of species have shifted their distributions to higher latitudes or elevations in response to global warming (Parmesan 2006), only a few cases are known in which species are imperiled directly by climate change (e.g., Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent [Waller et al. 2017]). However, the number of extinctions associated with climate change is expected to increase (Thomas et al. 2004; Wiens 2016). Throughout this book and the accompanying Climate Change Connections on the website, we\u2019ve emphasized that climate change has influenced and will continue to influence diversity in multiple ways. Warmer temperatures can directly influence physiological activity and behavior, influencing reproduction and mortality of individuals (see ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 24.1). We saw an example of this with changes in the length of time lizards can be active, alterations due to climate warming (see ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 4.1). As a consequence of climate change, the probability of population extinctions increases because of constraints on the amount of time the lizards can forage, which may explain local extinction of some lizard populations in Mexico (Sinervo et al. 2010). Climate change may affect how species interact and the intensity of those interactions, as indicated in ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 1.1, which showed that some aquatic ecosystems experience increases in food web connections in a warmer world (Woodward et al. 2010). Changes in the type (antagonistic vs. facilitative) and intensity of biotic interactions make prediction of the fates of species in a warmer world challenging. We saw in Concept 12.3 that the distribution of organisms and diversity in communities can be influenced by predation. If predators and prey respond differently to climate change, the influence of predation on diversity can be positive or negative, depending on which species is more sensitive. If prey are more sensitive to warmer temperatures than predators, then climate change will accentuate the negative impact of predation on diversity. This hypothesis was supported in the rocky intertidal zone by Christopher Harley (2011). Using a combination of experiments and observational studies employing variation in both space and time to examine variation in climate, Harley demonstrated a decrease in diversity of shellfish communities (barnacles and mussels) in the rocky intertidal zone consistent with greater predation and a restriction of habitat associated with climate change. The main predator, a sea star, was less sensitive to warming than barnacle and mussel species. The reduction in habitat increased the susceptibility of the prey species to predation, contributing to the local extinction of some species under warmer conditions. We will explore climate change in greater depth in Chapters 24 and 25. As the human population passed the 7 billion mark, our impact on the environment had already caused all of the world\u2019s biomes to be affected by the threats we have just described. However, the importance of these threats varies among biomes (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 23.15). Habitat loss is greater in the tropics than in the polar zones, for example, but climate change is having more of an effect in the polar zones than in the tropics. What can conservation biologists offer as solutions to these threats from so many fronts? INTERACTIVE FIGURE 23.15 Different Biomes Face Different Principal Threats The effects of different types of threats on different biomes over the past 50\u2013100 years were examined as part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, an international collaboration among more than 1,000 ecologists commissioned by the United Nations. The color of each box indicates the effect of the threat to date; the direction of the arrow indicates the trend in that threat. (After Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005. Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis. World Resources Institute: Washington, DC.)", "At a global scale, what factors have been the most important threats to diversity over the past decades, and what factors are projected to be the most important in the future? How do these current and future threats differ between terrestrial and marine biological zones? Self-Assessment 23.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 23.4 Conservation biologists use many tools and work at multiple scales to manage declining populations. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 23.4.1 Describe how advances in molecular genetics have assisted with assessing genetic diversity in populations. 23.4.2 Evaluate the use of demographic models in projecting the fates of endangered species. 23.4.3 Explain why ex situ conservation may be the best approach to saving a species once it appears destined for extinction. Approaches to Conservation Where should we put our focus in preventing species loss\u2014on the species or the habitat? Conservation biologists have debated this question and have generally concluded that protecting habitat is of primary importance but that understanding species is also important. There is no real dichotomy here, as we must understand the biology of a threatened species in order to identify and preserve its habitat. The U.S. Endangered Species Act functions through the listing of particular species threatened with extinction, but for each of those species, it mandates the identification and protection of critical habitat. Worldwide, many other laws protecting biodiversity take a similar approach. Chapter 24 will describe how the principles of ecology are applied to protecting habitat and how conservation biologists work to manage ecosystems and landscapes. In this section, we will look at the variety of ways in which conservation biologists work to understand and protect biodiversity at the level of genes, populations, and species. Genetic analyses are important conservation tools As we saw in Concepts 6.2 and 11.3, small populations are more likely to go extinct than large populations due to genetic drift and inbreeding, lowering genetic variation and increasing the frequency of deleterious alleles. A decrease in genetic variation can limit the extent to which a population can evolve in response to environmental change. An increase in the frequency of deleterious alleles is also of concern because it can cause birth or survival rates to drop, thereby decreasing the population growth rate. By increasing the risk of extinction in these ways, genetic problems resulting from small population sizes can hinder efforts to conserve a species. In some cases, conservation biologists have addressed this threat head-on by attempting the \u201cgenetic rescue\u201d of populations that otherwise would appear doomed to extinction. Such an effort was used to help preserve the Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), a subspecies of puma (pumas are also called panthers, cougars, and mountain lions). By the early 1990s, the number of panthers in Florida had decreased to fewer than 25 individuals. Compared with other puma populations, the Florida panther population had low genetic diversity and a high frequency of problems such as heart defects, kinked tails, poor sperm quality, and adult males in which one or both testes failed to descend properly. Models similar to those discussed in Concept 11.3 indicated a 95% chance that the population would become extinct within 20 years. In 1995, to rescue the Florida panther from genetic decline and likely extinction, biologists captured eight female pumas from populations in Texas and released them in southern Florida. They selected females from Texas because historically gene flow occurred between the Florida and Texas puma populations. The results were striking (Johnson et al. 2010): panther numbers tripled by 2007, levels of genetic variation doubled, and the frequency of genetic abnormalities decreased substantially (FIGURE 23.16). Increases in panther numbers no doubt were aided by other conservation efforts, including habitat protection and the construction of highway underpasses to reduce mortality from collisions with vehicles, but it is clear that genetic restoration has contributed to the recovery of the Florida panther. The population size has continued to increase, reaching around 200 individuals by 2017. Another example of successful genetic rescue includes the case of the greater prairie chicken (see Concept 6.2). FIGURE 23.16 Genetic Rescue of the Florida Panther With depleted genetic diversity, frequent genetic defects, and a precariously small population size (fewer than 25 individuals), the Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) seemed doomed to extinction in the early 1990s. The gene flow that resulted from the translocation of eight females from P. concolor populations in Texas helped to reverse these trends. Error bars show one SE of the mean.", "(After W. E. Johnson et al. 2010. Science 329: 1641\u20131645.) Genetic rescue is not without risk, however. Introducing populations from other locations to help increase population sizes of endangered species can potentially introduce genes that are maladaptive to the new location and can have the opposite effect than what is desired. For example, ibex (Capra ibex) from the Middle East were introduced into the Tatra Mountains of Czechoslovakia in the 1950s to help rescue declining local populations of ibex (Templeton 1986). Unfortunately, the introduced ibex mated in the fall, rather than in the winter like the local populations. As a result, the young were born in the winter, when food was scarce, rather than in the spring, and the rescue effort failed when the population could no longer sustain itself due to low survival rates of young ibex. As the Florida panther example suggests, genetic analyses can inform conservation decisions by revealing the genetic diversity present in a species and, in extreme cases, by guiding efforts to rescue a population or species from problems stemming from genetic decline. Genetic techniques can also be used in forensic applications related to conservation biology. For example, molecular genetic analyses permitted the identification of illegally harvested whale species in meat that was sold in Japan and labeled as either dolphin or (Southern Hemisphere) minke whale, both of which are legal to hunt (Baker et al. 2002). Cycads have also been genetically \u201cfingerprinted,\u201d allowing tracking of these highly valuable and frequently poached plants (Little and Stevenson 2007). In ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 23.1, we explore how such \u201cforensic conservation biology\u201d is done and how it was used to track the source of a large shipment of contraband elephant ivory. ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 23.1 As we saw in Concept 23.3, overexploitation of wildlife can lead to population declines across entire continents and throughout the world\u2019s oceans. In some cases, conservation biologists or wildlife authorities may know that individuals from protected populations have been captured or killed, but without further information they cannot determine the extent or source of such illegal harvests. This lack of information can make laws that protect threatened species difficult to enforce. Fortunately, in some species, molecular genetic techniques can be used to monitor the extent of illegal harvesting or trace the source of illegally harvested wildlife products. As an example, consider the trade in ivory. High demand for ivory led to the widespread slaughter of African elephants (Loxodonta africana), causing their numbers to drop from 1.3 million to 600,000 individuals between 1979 and 1987. As a response to this problem, an international ban on ivory trade was established in 1989. Initially the ban was successful, but soon an illegal ivory trade sprang up, leading to further declines in elephant populations. The illegal trade in ivory proved hard to combat because even if a shipment was intercepted, it could be difficult to identify where the tusks had come from. In June 2002, more than 5,900 kg (>13,000 pounds) of ivory were confiscated in Singapore\u2014the largest seizure of ivory since the 1989 ban (FIGURE A). Law enforcement officials suspected that these tusks came from elephants killed in multiple regions of Africa. Were they correct? FIGURE A Ivory from the 2002 Seizure in Singapore As in some human forensic cases, DNA evidence was used to answer this question. First, DNA was obtained from tusks seized in the June 2002 raid. As you may recall from your introductory biology class, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify (i.e., produce many copies of) specific regions of DNA that often differ from one individual to another. Such highly variable DNA segments can then be visualized in a computer scan, as shown in FIGURE B. By amplifying several of these highly variable segments, researchers can create a \u201cDNA profile\u201d that characterizes an individual\u2019s genetic makeup. FIGURE B Identifying Individual Elephants DNA from elephant tusks can be analyzed using molecular genetic techniques that detect individual-specific alleles. The graphs show results for three elephants; the highest peak(s) on each graph represent(s) specific alleles. To locate the source of the confiscated ivory, Samuel Wasser and colleagues amplified seven highly variable DNA segments and used them to produce a DNA profile for each of 37 of the confiscated tusks. The place of origin of each tusk was then estimated by comparing its DNA profile with those in a reference database of elephant DNA collected from known geographic locations (Wasser et al. 2007).", "Contrary to what law enforcement officials had originally suspected, the results indicated that all of the tusks came from a relatively small region in southern Africa, centered on Zambia (FIGURE C). These findings enabled wildlife authorities to focus their investigation on a smaller area and fewer trade routes, and they led the Zambian government to improve its antipoaching efforts. More broadly, the approach described by Wasser and colleagues shows promise in forensic applications designed to limit illegal trade in a wide range of threatened animal and plant species. FIGURE C Tracking Contraband Ivory DNA methods indicated that the ivory shown in Figure A came from a relatively small geographic region\u2014 a finding that differed from what law enforcement officials had originally suspected. Each red dot shows the estimated location of origin of one individual elephant. (After S. K. Wasser et al. 2007. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104: 4228\u20134233.) The availability of molecular genetic tools has enhanced our ability to understand the genetic problems faced by small populations and has helped us to address some of those problems. Let\u2019s turn next to some of the ways we can approach conservation at the population level. Demographic models can guide management decisions In Chapters 10 and 11, we introduced population demographic characteristics such as birth and death rates, and models that use them to project the growth of populations. Demographic models have been used to address the following questions, among others: Is the growth rate of the Yellowstone grizzly bear population high enough to allow it to persist? At what life stages are loggerhead sea turtles most vulnerable to predation, and what management decisions would be most expedient to ensure their continued viability? How much old-growth forest habitat must be preserved to ensure the persistence of the northern spotted owl? There are hundreds of quantitative demographic models in use, tailored to the specific biological traits of particular species. The quantitative approach most widely used for projecting the potential future status of populations is referred to as population viability analysis (PVA). This approach allows ecologists to assess extinction risks and evaluate management options for populations of rare or threatened species (Morris and Doak 2002). PVA is a process by which biologists can calculate the likelihood that a population will persist for a certain amount of time under various scenarios. A variety of PVA models have been developed, ranging from relatively simple stage- or age-based demographic models like those described in Concept 10.2 to more complex, spatially explicit models that can take actual landscape features and dispersal of individuals from multiple populations into account. PVA provides conservation biologists with the probabilities that certain outcomes will occur, given assumptions about future conditions (e.g., changes in threats or in management efforts). Thus, PVA is a tool with which ecologists can synthesize data collected in the field, assess the risk of extinction for a population, identify particularly vulnerable age or stage classes, determine how many animals to release or how many plants to propagate to ensure the establishment of a new population, or determine what might be a safe number of animals to harvest (Beissinger and Westphal 1998). PVA has been used to make a wide variety of decisions about how best to manage rare species. In Florida, the fire regime that would best serve population growth in the rare plant Chamaecrista keyensis was determined through PVA simulations of burns at different times of year and at different intervals (Liu et al. 2005). In Australia, the forest-cutting practices that would best serve the persistence of two endangered arboreal marsupial species, the greater glider and Leadbeater\u2019s possum, were determined through extensive PVA modeling coupled with long-term monitoring to verify the accuracy of the data going into the model (Lindenmayer and McCarthy 2006). Such analyses have played a critical role in management decisions for a number of species. Some conservation biologists, however, caution against excessive reliance on conclusions based on the results of PVA. They point to the high level of uncertainty in the dynamics of small populations, the paucity of demographic and environmental data for many endangered species, and the high probability that a model will leave critical factors unaccounted for. To be used effectively, PVA models need to be constantly refined and revisited by different researchers to check their validity against field observations, just as management strategies must be checked and adjusted for effectiveness (Beissinger and Westphal 1998).", "Ex situ conservation is a last-resort measure to rescue species on the brink of extinction When remaining populations of a species fall below a certain size, direct, hands-on action may be called for. Such actions can include the introduction of individuals into threatened populations (as in the Florida panther) or extensive habitat manipulations intended to improve the chance that individuals will reproduce successfully (as in the red-cockaded woodpecker, as we will see in the Case Study Revisited). In some cases, however, the only hope for preserving a species may be to take some or all of the remaining individuals out of their habitat\u2014ex situ\u2014and allow them to multiply in sheltered conditions under human care with the hope of later returning some individuals to the wild. Ex situ conservation efforts have played a major role for around 25% of the endangered vertebrate species whose numbers have increased in recent years (Hoffman et al. 2010). The rescue of the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) is a leading example of this strategy (FIGURE 23.17). This large bird once ranged throughout much of North America, and by the nineteenth century, it was still distributed from British Columbia to Baja California. The condor population declined steeply between the 1960s and 1980s, however, reaching a low of 22 birds by 1982. The species became extinct in the wild in 1987, when the last birds were captured and brought to an ex situ facility in California for breeding (Ralls and Ballou 2004). FIGURE 23.17 Ex Situ Conservation Efforts Can Rescue Species from the Brink of Extinction Ex situ efforts to save the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) involve multiple steps. (A) To reduce inbreeding and increase the number of eggs that hatch successfully, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist removes eggs from the wild (to be taken to an ex situ breeding facility) and replaces them with one egg from the San Diego Zoo. (B) At the San Diego Zoo, condor chick \u201cHoy\u201d is being fed by a condor-feeding puppet to avoid its becoming acclimated to humans. (C) Two condors at the time of their release (spring 2000). The instrument in the right foreground is a scale from which condor weight can be read by telescope when a bird perches on it. (D) This adult, with a wingspan of 9 feet, was bred in captivity and later released. There are now over 450 California condors, some in the wild and some remaining in captivity. Increasing the population to this point has required careful genetic analysis, hand rearing of some chicks, and cooperation among zoos, managers of natural areas, hunters, and ranchers. Maintaining the current population will require continued input of individuals reared ex situ into wild populations, though the ultimate goal is to establish self-sustaining condor populations in the wild. One of the greatest remaining threats is lead poisoning from ammunition found in the carrion condors eat, which has prevented this goal from being met (Finkelstein et al. 2012). Other barriers to the condor\u2019s recovery include the negative health effects of ingesting plastic and other trash, West Nile virus, and genetic drift. Given all these risks and costs, is the recovery of the California condor worth all the effort that has gone into it? Without that effort, the species would now be extinct. Ex situ conservation programs are taking place in zoos, special breeding facilities, botanical gardens, and aquaria all over the world. Such programs have allowed many species at risk of extinction to increase their numbers sufficiently to permit reintroduction into the wild. While ex situ programs play important roles in keeping our most threatened species from extinction, as well as in publicizing the plight of those species, they are expensive, and they can introduce a host of problems, such as exposure to disease, genetic adaptation to captivity, and behavioral changes (Snyder et al. 1996). Furthermore, as the case of the California condor shows, it can be difficult to restore self-sustaining populations in the wild. Could the funds dedicated to ex situ efforts be better spent on managing species in the wild or on securing land for the establishment of new protected areas\u2014that is, for in situ conservation? Sometimes the answer is no, usually when populations have been reduced to critical levels or when not enough suitable habitat is available. But the question must always be asked. Self-Assessment 23.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 23.5", "Prioritizing species helps maximize the biodiversity that can be protected with limited resources. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 23.5.1 Summarize why the rarity of a species may be both helpful and misleading as an indicator of its endangerment. 23.5.2 Describe the potential benefits of using a surrogate species to help conserve habitat and other species found in that habitat. Ranking Species for Protection Conservation efforts can succeed. Indeed, an analysis concluded that conservation actions have reduced the rate of loss of threatened vertebrates by over 20% (Hoffman et al. 2010). But such successes are outweighed by the severity of ongoing threats. How do we allocate the limited resources that are available for species conservation? Do we protect those species that are most threatened, or do we focus on those that play a substantial ecological role? And how should conservation biologists and policymakers decide which areas are critical to protect? The rarest and the most rapidly declining species are priorities for protection Many species have become rare as a result of anthropogenic threats we outlined earlier in this chapter. Other species may have always been rare. In either case, having a measure of how threatened a species is permits us to focus our efforts on those species that are most threatened: the rarest and the most rapidly declining. We may be able to postpone attending to species that are naturally low in abundance but not particularly threatened. What do we mean by rarity, and how do we determine just how rare something is? To clarify the different concepts of rarity, we can use a matrix that sorts out whether a species has a wide or a narrow geographic range, whether it is broad or restricted in its habitat specificity, and whether its local populations tend to be small or large (FIGURE 23.18). There are some rare species, for example, that exist over a wide geographic area and are relatively broad in their habitat requirements, yet tend to occur in very small populations. Other rare species inhabit specific habitats within a narrow geographic range, but may have large populations in those specific locations (Rabinowitz et al. 1986). Conservation of these different types of rare species requires different approaches. Some species require small reserves to protect well-established populations; others require management practices that create habitat conditions suitable for a rare but geographically widespread species. FIGURE 23.18 Seven Forms of Rarity Appropriate conservation measures for a rare species depend on the size of its geographic range, the sizes of its populations, and its habitat specificity. (After D. Rabinowitz. 1981. In The Biological Aspects of Rare Plant Conservation, H. Synge [Ed.], pp. 205\u2013217. John Wiley & Sons Ltd: New York.) An important scientific assessment of the conservation status of species began in 1963 with the establishment of the IUCN Red List (see Table 23.1). A parallel effort was developed in the United States by The Nature Conservancy, which established the Natural Heritage Program (now NatureServe) in the early 1970s in order to assess the conservation status of U.S. species. Both organizations have developed a ranking structure that indicates how threatened a species is and an assessment protocol to determine its rank. The assessment protocol takes into account not only numbers of populations or individuals, but also the total geographic area the species occupies, the rate of its decline, and the threats it faces. Because of the challenge of creating a system that can be applied equally well to a skipper butterfly, a cycad, or a shark, and because the information available on rare species is often incomplete, both systems allow assessors to choose among different sets of criteria to decide whether a species is critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, or under some lesser level of threat. Such assessments of conservation status can be used to locate clusters of threatened species and thus identify areas that are critical to protect (FIGURE 23.19). They are frequently consulted when development projects are planned, and they are important for keeping the public aware of the degree of threat faced by Earth\u2019s biota. These databases are dynamic in that they can change as scientific information is updated: the conservation status assigned to a species can be downgraded if its numbers increase or upgraded if its numbers decline. FIGURE 23.19 Hot Spots of Imperilment The compilation of NatureServe data on the location of imperiled species and their geographic ranges in the United States has permitted the identification of the critical areas to protect.", "California, Hawaii, the Florida Panhandle, and the southern Appalachian Mountains are \u201chot spots\u201d of imperilment\u2014they have high concentrations of imperiled species due to their high rates of endemism. (From NatureServe. 2013. www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/natureserve-hotspots-map.) Protection of surrogate species can provide protection for other species with similar habitat requirements If we protect the habitat that is necessary for the red-cockaded woodpecker, as described in the Case Study, will we simultaneously provide protection for the gopher tortoise, Bachman\u2019s sparrow, Michaux\u2019s sumac, and other rare species that are dependent on the longleaf pine savanna ecosystem? Species may become conservation priorities not only because of their own conservation status, but also because of their capacity to serve as surrogate species whose conservation will serve to protect many other species with overlapping habitat requirements. Some surrogate species can help us garner public support for a conservation project; examples of such flagship species include charismatic animals such as the mountain gorilla (FIGURE 23.20). Other surrogate species are referred to as umbrella species, which we select with the assumption that protection of their habitat will serve as an \u201cumbrella\u201d to protect many other species with similar habitat requirements. Umbrella species are typically species with large area requirements, such as grizzly bears, or habitat specialists, such as the red-cockaded woodpecker, but they may also include animals that are relatively easy to count, such as butterflies (Fleishman et al. 2000). Some researchers prefer to choose not just one species, but several focal species, selected for their different ecological requirements or susceptibility to different threats, with the realization that by thus casting a broader net, we improve our chances of covering regional biodiversity with protection. FIGURE 23.20 A Flagship Species The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is critically endangered in its highland forest habitat of central Africa. Only two populations remain in the wild, with a combined total of only 300 mature animals. Threats to their persistence include loss of habitat, hunting, and disease transmission from humans. Methods have been devised and criteria established to allow for strategic selection of the one or several surrogate species that will best serve conservation aims (Favreau et al. 2006). Conservation biologists recognize, however, that surrogate species approaches are not without problems, and that the distribution or habitat requirements of any one species cannot capture all the conservation targets we may have. Self-Assessment 23.5 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] A CASE STUDY REVISITED Can Birds and Bombs Coexist? As the longleaf pine ecosystem lost 97% of its area over the last several hundred years, the biological traits of the red-cockaded woodpecker that had worked well in the extensive pine savannas of the past turned out to be detrimental in its changing environment. Prime woodpecker habitat became fragmented, consisting of islands of usable habitat in an unsuitable landscape. As a result, the woodpecker\u2019s unusual habit of excavating cavities in living trees\u2014a process that usually takes a year or more to complete\u2014made the availability of cavities a limiting factor for woodpecker populations. Jeff Walters and his colleagues tested the hypothesis that a lack of high-quality habitat was limiting the woodpecker\u2019s population growth, by constructing artificial nest cavities, placing them in clusters, and observing woodpecker behavior. They tried this strategy for two reasons. First, they put cavities in groups because red-cockaded woodpeckers are cooperative breeders (males born in previous years help their parents raise young, forming the woodpecker clusters described at the start of the chapter) and each bird in a cluster must have its own cavity. Second, the birds typically abandon cavity clusters after several years\u2019 use, primarily because of cavity entrance enlargement by other species, or mortality of cavity trees, so there is a continual demand for cavity clusters (Harding and Walters 2002). The artificial cavity clusters constructed by the researchers were rapidly colonized, mostly by helper birds from the vicinity and young dispersing birds (Copeyon et al. 1991; Walters et al. 1992). These results suggested that people could help the red-cockaded woodpecker increase its numbers by going out with drill, wood, wire, and glue and installing groups of cavities within living longleaf pines (FIGURE 23.21). Indeed, these activities have proved a boon to woodpecker recovery. Aided by the construction of artificial cavities, the population of red-cockaded woodpeckers at Fort Bragg increased from 238 breeding groups in 1992 to 368 breeding groups in 2006.", "Cavity construction has also contributed to increased abundances of red-cockaded woodpeckers at other military bases, including Eglin Air Force Base (Florida), Fort Benning (Georgia), Fort Polk (Louisiana), Fort Stewart (Georgia), and Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (North Carolina). Similar successes have occurred at sites other than military bases. For example, when Hurricane Hugo hit the South Carolina coast in 1989, the population of red-cockaded woodpeckers in Francis Marion National Forest, previously home to 344 breeding groups, was severely reduced. The hurricane killed 63% of the birds, and another 18% died the following winter (Hooper et al. 2004). Within 2 years of the storm, however, national forest workers had installed 443 artificial cavities. This strategy averted a severe population decline; by 1992, the population had recovered to 332 clusters. FIGURE 23.21 Installation of Artificial Nest Cavities Has Allowed Populations of Red-Cockaded Woodpeckers to Increase (A) A researcher with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service cores a tree to help determine its suitability for an artificial nest cavity. (B) Installing the artificial nest cavity. Now that managers have identified cavity construction and maintenance as a critical factor for the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers, they are obliged by the Endangered Species Act to continue doing it. This strategy is labor-intensive and expensive, but for now it is necessary for the red-cockaded woodpecker\u2019s continued existence. How long can we sustain this effort? Will we reach a point at which there is enough longleaf pine savanna that the woodpeckers will be able to maintain their own numbers without human assistance? We do not know the answers to these questions. In the decades during which Walters and others have been researching the red-cockaded woodpecker, they have used many of the tools described in this chapter. Models of population dynamics have facilitated the identification of vulnerable stages in the woodpecker\u2019s life cycle. Genetic studies and modeling have focused attention on the threat of inbreeding. Field studies have demonstrated the need for prescribed burning to maintain the community structure required by the woodpeckers. Economic and sociological analyses have led to the development of a \u201csafe harbor\u201d program that makes endangered species management more acceptable to private landowners. CONNECTIONS in NATURE SOME BURNING QUESTIONS As we saw in Chapter 3, recurrent fires promote the establishment of savanna. Hence, to maintain red-cockaded woodpecker populations and the longleaf pine savannas on which they depend, fire is key\u2014whether it is ignited naturally, accidentally by military training exercises, or intentionally under controlled conditions. As with other regular forms of disturbance (see Concept 9.2), differences in the frequency of fires can affect the distributions and abundances of species, and those changes, in turn, along with changes in the physical environment, can affect the cycling of nutrients and water. Because fire affects communities at so many levels, prescribed burning is used as a management tool for conserving species in numerous ecosystems where fire has been a regular natural disturbance (FIGURE 23.22). FIGURE 23.22 Prescribed Burning Is a Vital Management Tool in Some Ecosystems In the southeastern United States, regular burning is used to maintain the high plant biodiversity characteristic of the understory in pine savanna ecosystems. Many threatened species, including the red-cockaded woodpecker, rely on regular burning for their persistence. Here, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service firefighters monitor a prescribed burn intended to preserve habitat for the endangered Florida panther. But the use of fire as a management tool can have unintended and undesirable ecological outcomes where nonnative invasive species are present. In some longleaf pine savannas in Florida, openings resulting from burning have provided favorable habitat for the establishment of cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), an invasive plant from Asia. The presence of this grass, in turn, causes fires to burn hotter and more extensively. The consequences of these hotter fires are increased mortality of longleaf pine seedlings and native wiregrass, favorable conditions for further infiltration of cogongrass, and a resulting threat to the high levels of native plant diversity found in the understory of the longleaf pine savanna (Lippincott 2000). Land managers are faced with a dilemma: to burn or not to burn? The right question is more likely to be when to burn, and how often. Adding people to the burning landscape further complicates matters. Throughout the southeastern United States, prescribed burns are taking place in a complex landscape where patches of forest are adjacent to people\u2019s homes and businesses. Convincing the public that these fires are necessary has required considerable outreach and public education.", "In the North Carolina Sandhills, the days for prescribed burns are chosen not only for safe conditions, but also with regard to wind direction so as to minimize the amount of smoke in population centers. Here, as elsewhere, recognition of people as an integral component of the landscapes that must harbor all of nature\u2019s diversity has been a vital piece of the conservation picture. Establishing protected natural areas as sanctuaries for wildlife is an important part of the solution to the biodiversity crisis, but we must also do what we can to ensure that the vast majority of Earth\u2019s surface outside of protected areas is able to sustain both people\u2019s livelihoods and habitat for other species. This is a difficult challenge that will involve education, cooperation, legislation, and many creative approaches. Landscape Ecology and Ecosystem Management KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 24.1 Landscape ecology examines spatial patterns and their relationship to ecological processes. CONCEPT 24.2 Habitat loss and fragmentation decrease habitat area, isolate populations, and alter conditions at habitat edges. CONCEPT 24.3 Biodiversity can best be sustained by large reserves connected across the landscape and buffered from areas of intense human use. CONCEPT 24.4 Ecosystem management is a collaborative process with the maintenance of long-term ecological integrity as its core value. Wolves in the Yellowstone Landscape: A Case Study The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) both symbolizes the soul of the American wilderness and encapsulates the challenges of managing public lands. The landscape is shaped by a unique complex of natural elements: volcanic eruptions, geothermal activity, glaciers, and repeated fires, sometimes on a massive scale. In addition, the interplay between large herbivores and their predators has the potential to impact the landscape, including the vegetation and landforms. All of these factors have contributed to the mosaic of forests, meadows, grasslands, lakes, and rivers that characterize the GYE. Prior to the early twentieth century, wolves were important predators in the GYE, but extermination programs led to their local extinction. After 70 years of absence, wolves were reintroduced into the GYE between 1995 and 1997 from populations in Canada and northwestern Montana. Wolves hunt among a wide diversity of ungulates and other prey (FIGURE 24.1). The reintroduction of wolves was the culmination of years of research effort and hotly contested policy debate, with vociferous objection from some residents of the region. Twenty years later, its ecological consequences have proved to be multifaceted and profound, and public opinion has become generally more favorable. Wolf reintroduction is perceived as restoring an important natural element to the GYE. FIGURE 24.1 A Top Predator Returns A showdown between a pack of wolves (Canis lupus) and an American bison (Bison bison). After nearly 70 years of absence, wolves were reintroduced in 1995 to Yellowstone National Park, where they are now the main predators of ungulate herbivores including bison, moose, and elk. But how \u201cwild\u201d and natural is the GYE? Larger in area than the state of West Virginia, the GYE includes two national parks and seven national forests as well as other public and private lands (FIGURE 24.2). The region is actively managed by more than 25 different state and federal agencies as well as private corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and private landowners. Decisions about the use of its land and natural resources are complex and often uncoordinated, yet when considered together, these decisions determine which species will or will not be sustained by the ecosystem (Parmenter et al. 2003). FIGURE 24.2 The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem contains Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, seven different national forests, and land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, as well as private lands. (After A. Parmenter et al. 2003. Ecol Appl 13: 687\u2013703.) Despite its fragmented management, the GYE is often perceived as one of the most biologically intact regions in North America. It sustains seven species of native ungulates and five large carnivore species. Understanding how these predator and prey populations interact, and how their abundances affect the whole ecosystem, has been a persistent challenge to ecologists who study the GYE, particularly in light of a century of management of wildlife populations. After wolves were eradicated in the mid-1920s, there were concerns that elk were overgrazing meadows in the northern part of the park. The elk population was regulated from the 1920s to the late 1960s by exporting animals to elk farms and by culling. In 1968, a new policy of \u201cnatural regulation\u201d without human intervention in population growth was implemented.", "The elk population nearly quadrupled over a 30-year period and suppressed the plants they fed on. The reintroduction of wolves has not only reduced the elk population but has also affected the populations of many other species. How? To start to answer that question, let\u2019s go back to the 1950s, when ecologists noticed that beavers had become scarce in Yellowstone National Park. Gradually, it became clear that the cause was increased elk herbivory on the beavers\u2019 preferred food plants, willow and aspen. But a whole suite of other species depend on beaver ponds for their own persistence, and their abundances had declined along with the beavers\u2019. The decision to eradicate wolves did not anticipate these ecological changes to the Yellowstone ecosystem. How can ecologists of today help managers of nature reserves make decisions that will take future consequences into account? Introduction In this chapter we will broaden the spatial scope of our view of ecology to take a landscape perspective. This broader view is facilitated by a powerful assemblage of tools that permit us to monitor the environment in multiple dimensions and at many scales. For example, the emergence of aerial photography gave ecologists a ready means of looking at \u201cthe big picture.\u201d Similarly, our ability to acquire images of Earth through remote sensing, from drones to satellites, has permitted the interpretation of many large-scale ecological patterns, including global patterns of net primary production (see Ecological Toolkit 20.1). The use of geographic information systems (GIS), methods used to visualize and analyze spatial data, has become standard in landscape planning efforts, whether for urban development or for conservation (ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 24.1). In the field, handheld global positioning systems (GPS) have permitted ecologists to document precise locations and integrate them with other landscape variables through GIS. Radiotelemetry has greatly enhanced our ability to follow animal movements and migration patterns, again with the help of GIS. And our ability to analyze all this information is constantly growing, thanks to better computers and new statistical methods of spatial analysis. ECOLOGICAL TOOLKIT 24.1 Geographic information systems (GIS) are computer-based systems that allow the storage, analysis, and display of data pertaining to specific geographic areas. The data used in GIS are derived from multiple sources, including aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and ground-based field studies (FIGURE A). Examples of such data include rainfall, elevation, and vegetation cover at specific locations. Each of these and many other variables may be used in a particular application of GIS\u2014but whatever variables are used, the data are keyed to or referenced by spatial or geographic coordinates so that they can be assembled into a multilayered map. FIGURE A GIS Integrates Spatial Data from Multiple Sources Layers of mapped data can be put together in ways that help to address particular questions. We\u2019ll illustrate this process with an approach often used in conservation biology, called gap analysis. The acronym GAP refers to the Gap Analysis Program, a U.S. Geological Survey program whose mission is to help prevent biodiversity decline by identifying species and communities that are not adequately represented on existing conservation lands. The lark bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys) is one such species. It depends on prairie habitat for its breeding grounds, but much of this habitat has been destroyed by conversion to agriculture. As a result, populations of the lark bunting have been declining by an average of 1.6% per year over the past 40 years, making it a species of conservation concern (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). For the lark bunting, or any other species, gap analysis is a two-step process. First, data on vegetation cover (see the top GIS layer in Figure A) and on other environmental conditions required or preferred by the lark bunting are used to predict its geographic distribution (the second GIS layer in Figure A). Next, that predicted distribution is compared with a third GIS layer showing the locations of conservation lands and protected areas. By combining these two layers, we can calculate that only a small percentage of the bird\u2019s distribution is protected (FIGURE B). Such information is critical to decisions about what lands should be protected to prevent future losses of biodiversity. (See WEB EXTENSION 24.1 for a second example of GIS use in conservation biology.) FIGURE B A Conservation Gap Less than 3% of the lark bunting\u2019s predicted distribution is in protected areas. (Maps courtesy of U.S.G.S. Gap Analysis Project. https://doi.org/10.5066/F7V122T2 and https://doi.org/10.5066/F7ZS2TM0.)", "We saw in Concept 23.3 that habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are primary causes of the current declines in biodiversity. In this chapter, we\u2019ll see how the tools and methods of landscape ecology are used to assess the occurrence and possible causes of biodiversity declines at the landscape and ecosystem scales. Because protected natural areas are at the heart of conservation strategies, we will also consider how conservation biologists identify and design them to maximize their effectiveness. Finally, we\u2019ll examine how ecosystem management integrates ecological principles with social and economic information to help guide decisions about land and water use. CONCEPT 24.1 Landscape ecology examines spatial patterns and their relationship to ecological processes. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 24.1.1 Describe the elements that make up a landscape and illustrate how they can influence ecological processes such as dispersal and ecosystem function. 24.1.2 Show how landscape structure can be evaluated using the number and areas of the elements that make up the landscape. 24.1.3 Compare the benefits and drawbacks associated with using coarse-scale versus fine-scale characterization of a landscape. 24.1.4 Describe how disturbances can affect and be affected by the landscape structure. Landscape Ecology Landscape ecology is a subdiscipline of ecology that emphasizes the causes and consequences of spatial variation in surface features and biota across a range of scales. Landscape ecologists are interested in the spatial arrangement of different landscape elements across Earth\u2019s surface, and they study how spatial patterns affect and are affected by ecological processes. Examples of landscape elements include patches of forest surrounded by pasture, or lakes scattered across a large region of forest. At smaller spatial scales, individual creosote bushes in a desert, or areas of a certain soil type, could be considered landscape elements. These elements are arranged certain ways in space. As we will see, the spatial pattern of landscape elements can influence what species live in an area, as well as the dynamics of ecological processes such as disturbance and dispersal. A landscape is a heterogeneous area composed of a dynamic mosaic of interacting ecosystems A landscape is an area in which at least one element is spatially heterogeneous (varies from one place to another) (FIGURE 24.3). Landscapes can be heterogeneous either in what they are composed of\u2014for example, twelve different vegetative cover types versus only three\u2014or in the way their elements are arranged\u2014such as many small patches arranged regularly over the landscape versus a few large patches. Ecologists often refer to this composite (or pattern) of heterogeneous elements that make up a landscape as a mosaic. FIGURE 24.3 Landscape Heterogeneity Landscapes can be heterogeneous in many different kinds of elements, which may be arranged in ways independent of one another. (A) An aerial photograph of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. (B) A map of six different soil types in the same area. (After H. R. Delcourt. 2002. In Learning Landscape Ecology, S. E. Gergel and M. G. Turner [Eds.], pp. 62\u201382. Springer: New York.) In part (B), which landscape element covers the least area? Landscapes often include multiple ecosystems. The different ecosystems that make up a landscape are dynamic and continually interacting with one another. These interactions may occur through the flow of water, energy, nutrients, or pollutants between ecosystems. There is also biotic flow between habitat patches in the mosaic as individuals or their gametes (e.g., pollen) move between them (Forman 1995). For such movement to occur, patches of the same habitat type must be connected to one another, or the surrounding habitat (the matrix) must be of a type through which dispersal is possible (FIGURE 24.4). In Australia, for example, rats regularly leave patches of forest habitat to forage in adjacent macadamia nut plantations (a part of the surrounding matrix). As a result, nut losses along plantation edges adjacent to forests are greater than along edges adjacent to grasslands or agricultural fields (White et al. 1997). FIGURE 24.4 Movements across the Landscape Movements between adjacent landscape elements may occur frequently (thicker arrows) or rarely (thinner arrows). (A) Exchange between patches of the same type occurs frequently if a corridor that allows movement connects the patches. (B) Exchange between patches of the same type occurs frequently, but exchange with the matrix occurs only rarely. (After A. M. Hersperger. 2006. Landscape Urban Plann 77: 227\u2013239.) Do organisms move more freely across the matrix in (A) or in (B)? Explain. Next, let\u2019s focus in more detail on two aspects of landscape heterogeneity: how it is described, and the scale at which it is studied. DESCRIBING LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY", "The heterogeneity that we see in landscapes can be described in terms of composition and structure. Landscape composition refers to the kinds of elements or patches in a landscape, as well as to how much of each kind is present. These elements are defined by the investigator and are influenced by the source of data used and goals of the analysis. In an example from Yellowstone National Park, researchers designated five different age classes of lodgepole pine forest using ground-based fieldwork, aerial photographs, and GIS (Tinker et al. 2003). The composition of the landscape in FIGURE 24.5 can thus be quantified by counting the kinds of elements in the mapped area (five in this case), by calculating the proportion of the mapped area covered by each kind of element, or by measuring the diversity and dominance of the different landscape elements much as one does for species, using a measure such as the Shannon index (described in Concept 16.2). FIGURE 24.5 Landscape Composition and Structure This map of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forest in Yellowstone National Park shows five different age classes of forest. Structural complexity varies across the landscape, as seen in the varying degree of natural fragmentation. (From D. B. Tinker et al. 2003. Landscape Ecol 18: 427\u2013 439) If we note that one portion of a landscape is more fragmented than another (i.e., broken up into distinct compositional units), we are comparing landscape structure: the physical configuration of the different elements that compose the landscape. In Figure 24.5, we can see that some parts of the landscape contain large contiguous blocks of older forest, while other parts are more fragmented and contain smaller patches of forest with a variety of different ages. Landscape ecologists quantify landscape structure primarily by addressing whether the landscape is characterized by large or small patches, how aggregated or dispersed the patches are, whether the patches are simple or complicated in their shape, and how fragmented the landscape is (Turner et al. 2001). Quantitative analyses of landscape structure allow us to compare one landscape with another and to relate landscape patterns to ecological processes and to the dynamics of landscape change. For example, Tinker and colleagues (2003) were able to use the measures of landscape structure that they derived for Yellowstone to compare the natural, fire-caused fragmentation within the park with fragmentation caused by clear-cutting in adjacent national forests. Logging created greater heterogeneity relative to the landscape primarily impacted by fire, with important implications for differences in population and community processes between the two landscape management types. THE IMPORTANCE OF SCALE Consideration of scale is an important aspect of landscape ecology. A landscape may be heterogeneous at a scale important to a tiger beetle, but homogeneous to a warbler or moose. The scale at which we choose to study a landscape determines the results we will obtain. Part of landscape ecology, therefore, is dedicated to understanding the implications of scale. Scale, the spatial or temporal dimension of an object or process, is characterized by both grain and extent. Grain, which is the size of the smallest homogeneous unit of study (such as a pixel in a digital image), determines the resolution at which we view the landscape (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 24.6A). The selection of grain will affect the quantity of data that must be manipulated in analysis: using a large-grained approach may be appropriate when one is looking at patterns at a regional to continental scale. Extent refers to the area or time period encompassed by a study. Consider how differently we might describe the composition of a landscape depending on how we define its spatial extent. Panel 4 of INTERACTIVE FIGURE 24.6B, for example, shows little late successional whitebark pine, while panel 6 contains a considerable area of it (Turner et al. 2001). There may be natural or human-created boundaries that determine the extent of a study, or they may be defined by the researcher. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 24.6 Effects of Grain and Extent (A) Panels 1\u20133 show the effect of increasing grain, measured here as pixel size. (B) Panels 4\u20136 show the effect of increasing extent. (After M. G. Turner et al. 2001. Landscape Ecology in Theory and Practice: Pattern and Process. Springer: New York.) The grain in panel 1 of (A) is identical to the grain in which of the panels of (B)? Ecosystem and landscape studies considering questions impacted by scale must also determine how processes scale up or down.", "For example, a researcher studying carbon exchange at the landscape level needs to know how leaf-based measurements of CO2 exchange scale up to the whole plant, the ecosystem, and ultimately the mosaic of ecosystems that make up the landscape. This example shows the importance of connecting processes across different scales. Ecologists have developed methods to analyze how patterns and phenomena at one scale affect those occurring at either larger or smaller scales (see Levin 1992). Landscape patterns affect ecological processes Landscape structure plays an important role in ecological dynamics. For example, it can affect whether and how animals move and can therefore influence rates of pollination, dispersal, or consumption. Micka\u00ebl Henry and his associates studied the movements of the fruit-eating bat Rhinophylla pumilio in a tropical forest in French Guiana that had been fragmented by the construction of a reservoir. Using landscape metrics that quantified the degree of patch (the degree to which landscapes allow movement between patches) at their sampling sites, they found that more isolated forest fragments were less likely to be visited by bats, even if they contained abundant food resources (Henry et al. 2007). Thus, the landscape structure affected bat foraging behavior. Furthermore, because frugivorous bats disperse plant seeds, it is also likely that the landscape structure affected the dispersal of the plants that the bats fed on. Landscape structure also influences biogeochemical cycling. Ecosystem ecologists have identified biogeochemical \u201chot spots\u201d where chemical reaction rates are higher than in the surrounding landscape. Many such hot spots are found at the interfaces between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (McClain et al. 2003), but other factors may also play a part. For example, Kathleen Weathers and her colleagues found that inputs of sulfur, calcium, and nitrogen from atmospheric deposition were higher at forest edges than in forest interiors, primarily as a result of greater interception of airborne particles by the denser and more complex vegetation typically found at a forest edge. The fragmented forests that typically surround urban areas are therefore more likely to be influenced by atmospheric inputs of pollutants and nutrients than intact forests. This finding has implications for soil microbial dynamics, plant growth and diversity, and animal communities in the edges of these fragments (Weathers et al. 2001). We will discuss other such \u201cedge effects\u201d in Concept 24.2. Habitat patches typically vary in both quality and resource availability. This variation can affect the diversity and population densities of the species inhabiting each patch, the time animals spend foraging in a patch (see Concept 8.2), and the movement of organisms between patches (see Concept 9.3). Patch boundaries, connections between patches, and the matrix between patches can also affect population dynamics, both within and among patches. For example, Schtickzelle and Baguette studied the movement patterns of the bog fritillary butterfly (Proclossiana eunomia) across fragmented landscapes in Belgium (FIGURE 24.7). Where patches of suitable butterfly habitat were aggregated, female butterflies crossed readily from patch to patch. However, where the habitat was more fragmented and there was a wider distance of matrix to cross, the butterflies were less likely to leave a patch (Schtickzelle and Baguette 2003). FIGURE 24.7 The Bog Fritillary Butterfly The travel patterns of these butterflies (Proclossiana eunomia) are influenced by features of the surrounding landscape. Butterflies will hesitate to leave the patches they inhabit if there is not another suitable habitat patch nearby, but they will traverse a matrix of unsuitable habitat when the next patch is close. While ecological processes are influenced by landscape patterns, landscape patterns are in turn influenced by ecological processes. Large grazing mammals, for example, often shape the landscapes they inhabit. The effects of moose (Alces alces) on Isle Royale in Lake Superior have been studied through the use of exclosures since the 1940s. These studies have shown that high rates of browsing by moose depress net primary production, not just directly through the removal of biomass, but also indirectly by decreasing nitrogen mineralization rates and litter decomposition rates. Moose browsing also shifts the tree species composition toward spruce, which in turn influences rates of biogeochemical processes (Pastor et al. 1988). The moose are thus both responding to and shaping the landscape. At a broader scale, landscape patterns interact with larger-scale disturbances, as we will see next. Disturbance both creates and is influenced by landscape heterogeneity Landscapes are dynamic. Change sometimes comes to landscapes suddenly in the form of large disturbances \u2014forests and prairies burn over large areas, or floods bring sudden inputs of sediment into river ecosystems.", "Changes can also occur more slowly, as a result of gradual shifts in climates and moving continents, but those changes are not our focus here. We saw in Chapter 17 that disturbances can influence community composition. Landscape ecologists have asked, in turn, whether particular landscape patterns slow or accelerate the spread of disturbances or increase or decrease an ecosystem\u2019s vulnerability to disturbances. An opportunity to examine the influence of landscape patterns on the spread of fire occurred after the 1988 forest fires that burned nearly one-third of the 898,000 hectares (ha), or 2.2 million acres, of Yellowstone National Park. Fires this extensive are thought to have occurred in the northern Rockies at 100to 500-year intervals over the past 10,000 years. The 1988 fires burned through forest stands of different ages and species compositions, leaving a complex mosaic of patches that were burned at different intensities (FIGURE 24.8). The type and arrangement of these patches will influence the landscape composition for decades, if not centuries, to come (Turner et al. 2003). Here, a disturbance\u2014fire\u2014was a primary force shaping the landscape pattern of the future. At the same time, the fire was also responding to the existing landscape structure through its influence on burn probability. This reciprocal interaction between landscape pattern and disturbance is a common one. FIGURE 24.8 Disturbances Can Shape Landscape Patterns The fires that burned through nearly one-third of Yellowstone National Park in the summer of 1988 resulted in a complex mosaic of burned and unburned patches. Areas that appear black in this aerial view of Madison Canyon were burned by intense crown fires, and brown patches were burned by severe ground fires, both of which killed most or all of the vegetation. Human actions have greatly altered the nature and extent of landscape-level disturbance. Some places have been more subject to human disturbance than others. People first settled and cleared the areas with the most fertile soils, subjecting these ecosystems to the earliest human disturbance. Areas close to human settlements were converted to agriculture or subjected to logging and hunting earlier than outlying areas. These disturbance patterns can be detected in ecological communities even centuries after people have left the land and it has reverted to forest (Butzer 1992). Such landscape legacies shape communities in ways that are just starting to be understood. In central France, Etienne Dambrine and his colleagues (2007) found that forest plant communities on the sites of recently uncovered Roman farming settlements still reflected the impacts of those disturbances 1,600 years later (FIGURE 24.9). These researchers studied plant diversity in the forest at various distances from the Roman ruins. Dambrine and colleagues found that plant species richness increased in the vicinity of the ruins. An examination of soil properties revealed that this increase was primarily a consequence of higher soil pH and soil phosphorus, associated with the remnants of the lime mortar used in Roman buildings and from Roman agricultural practices. How many other ecosystems on Earth might display the signatures of human activities long since abandoned in their current community structure? FIGURE 24.9 Landscape Legacies In central France, the legacy of Roman farming settlements, abandoned for nearly two millennia, is still reflected by higher plant species richness in the forest that replaced them. More plant species were found closer to the center of settlement sites, including more species that prefer a higher soil pH. The y axis represents departure from the mean calculated for plots 100\u2013500 m from the settlement. (After E. Dambrine et al. 2007. Ecology 88: 1430\u20131439.) Disturbance, whether natural or human-caused, is an important factor shaping the landscape. Some current human activities are creating disturbances with far-reaching ecological effects, as we\u2019ll see in the next section. Self-Assessment 24.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 24.2 Habitat loss and fragmentation decrease habitat area, isolate populations, and alter conditions at habitat edges. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 24.2.1 Describe the impacts of habitat fragmentation that lead to loss of diversity in landscapes. 24.2.2 Evaluate why fragmentation is more likely to impact higher trophic levels relative to plants and herbivores. 24.2.3 Explain how edges between habitat patches and the matrix in a fragmented landscape influence the physical environment and how this in turn impacts ecological processes such as dispersal and habitat use.", "Habitat Loss and Fragmentation In 1986, a massive hydroelectric project in the Caroni River valley of Venezuela inundated a large area of uneven terrain to create a reservoir known as Lago Guri (FIGURE 24.10). The result was the formation of scores of islands of tropical dry forest surrounded by water. This change in the landscape presented an opportunity for John Terborgh and his students and colleagues to study the effects of fragmentation in a tropical dry forest ecosystem. They found that small-and medium-sized islands were lacking the top predators found on the mainland, primarily wild cats (ocelots, jaguars, and pumas), raptors, and large snakes (Terborgh et al. 2006). As a result, generalist herbivores, seed predators, and predators of invertebrates were 10 to 100 times more abundant on the islands than in the remaining intact forest. Species that increased in abundance included leaf-cutter ants, birds, rodents, frogs, spiders, howler monkeys, porcupines, tortoises, and lizards. The increased abundances of these species had a dramatic effect on the vegetation of these islands: tree recruitment decreased and tree mortality increased because of high rates of herbivory, primarily by leaf-cutter ants (FIGURE 24.11). What lessons can we take from this \u201cexperiment\u201d that apply to other fragmented ecosystems? FIGURE 24.10 The Islands of Lago Guri An aerial view of Lago Guri, Venezuela. This lake was formed when 4,300 km2 (1.1 million acres) of forested land were inundated by a hydroelectric dam, leaving isolated islands of tropical forest. FIGURE 24.11 Effects of Habitat Fragmentation by Lago Guri The high abundances of herbivores on small and medium-sized islands in Lago Guri caused a dramatic decline in sapling establishment and survival. The bars show the percentages of (A) small saplings and (B) large saplings in study plots that left their size class through either mortality or growth to a larger size, as well as the number of saplings recruited to each size class, over a 5-year period. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (After J. Terborgh et al. 2006. J Ecol 94: 253\u2013263.) Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the most widespread and important human-caused changes occurring in Earth\u2019s landscapes (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 24.12). When large blocks of habitat are cleared of forests, flooded by dam construction, divided by roads, or converted to human land uses, there are several consequences for the landscape and the species living there. The first is the simple loss of habitat area. Reductions in the amount of suitable habitat available have contributed to the declines of thousands of species, including the red-cockaded woodpecker (see the Case Study in Chapter 23). Second, as the remaining habitat becomes divided into smaller and smaller patches, it is increasingly degraded and influenced by edge effects, as the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project showed (see the Case Study in Chapter 18). Third, fragmentation results in the spatial isolation of populations, making them vulnerable to the problems of small populations described in Concept 10.3. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 24.12 Loss and Fragmentation of U.S. Old-Growth Forests Beginning in 1620, vast regions of old-growth forest (also known as ancient or virgin forest) in the United States were cut down to provide lumber and to make room for agriculture, housing, and other forms of development. (Adapted from A. Gould et al. 2001. In Global Systems Science: A New World View. The Lawrence Hall of Science. University of CA, Berkeley. \u00a9 The Regents of the University of California. http://www.globalsystemsscience.org/studentbooks/anwv/ch3/. Based on C. O. Paullin. 1932. Atlas of Historical Geography of the United States. Carnegie Institution of Washington and the American Geographical Society of New York: Washington, DC, and New York; R. Findley and J. P. Blair. 1990. Nat Geogr 178: 106\u2013136.) The process of habitat loss and fragmentation may take place over many decades. A typical pattern begins with a clearing in a forest, which is then widened bit by bit until only isolated habitat fragments remain (FIGURE 24.13). Roads are often catalysts of habitat conversion, though human access along rivers can also serve to accelerate deforestation. The principal drivers of habitat fragmentation are conversion of land for agriculture and urban expansion. FIGURE 24.13 The Process of Habitat Loss and Fragmentation Historically intact habitats are gradually reduced with increased human presence. These contemporaneous photographs (taken from different locations) illustrate a process that typically takes decades to complete. (A) An intact eucalyptus forest in Western Australia. (B) Areas within the forest have been cleared for grazing. (C) The forest has become further fragmented over time. (D) Only a few remnants of forest remain.", "Habitat fragmentation is a reversible process. The northeastern United States, for example, has more forest cover than it did a century ago\u2014but it will take centuries before these young forests contain as many species as were found in the old-growth forests that once covered the region. Furthermore, the global trend is toward net loss of forests (FAO 2005) and toward increasingly fragmented forest, grassland, and riverine ecosystems. What are the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this fragmentation? Fragmented habitats are biologically impoverished relative to intact habitats When habitat is fragmented, some species go locally extinct within many of the fragments. Reasons for the loss of species include loss of habitat, which can involve changes in climate, shelter, and nesting sites; lower resources; and the impact of genetic and stochastic factors on small populations. Mutualisms may be disrupted if pollinators are missing or as mycorrhizal fungi fail to persist in a particular fragment. Local extinction or decline is not inevitable; indeed, some species flourish under the changed conditions that follow fragmentation. Fragmentation often leads to losses of top predators, giving rise to trophic cascades, sometimes with large consequences for the remaining community as we saw with the Lago Guri example. Another example of such a cascade that has implications for human health is the growing risk of Lyme disease as a result of forest fragmentation in the northeastern United States. Brian Allan and colleagues found that forest fragments of less than 2 ha (5 acres) were very densely populated with white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). Fragments of that size did not support substantial predator populations, and the mice had few competitors there. White-footed mice are the most important reservoir of Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Ticks are the vector of this disease. Tick nymphs collected in these small fragments were significantly more likely to carry the disease, and occurred at higher densities, than nymphs in larger fragments (FIGURE 24.14). The outcome\u2014an increased risk of human infection with Lyme disease\u2014is ultimately a result of the biological impoverishment of habitat fragments (Allan et al. 2003). FIGURE 24.14 Habitat Fragmentation Can Have Consequences for Human Health The loss of predators from small forest fragments in New York State has led to elevated populations of white-footed mice in those fragments. As a result, densities of tick nymphs infected with the spirochete bacterium that causes Lyme disease are higher than in larger forest areas. (After B. F. Allan et al. 2003. Conserv Biol 17: 267\u2013272.) Edge effects change abiotic conditions and species abundances in fragments As intact habitat is fragmented, an abrupt boundary between two dissimilar patch types is created. The total length of habitat boundary, or edge, increases as fragmentation increases. Edge effects are the diverse abiotic and biotic changes that are associated with habitat boundaries (FIGURE 24.15). The effect of edge formation is a change in the physical environment over a certain distance into the remaining fragment. As a result, biological interactions and ecological processes can change as well, as you can explore in ANALYZING DATA 24.1. The impact of the edge on the environment changes over time, so we can separate the immediate responses to fragmentation and edge formation from the responses that develop later (see Figure 18.24). FIGURE 24.15 Edge Effects Deforestation creates new forest edges, exposing trees that once were surrounded by forest to edge effects such as increased light levels, higher temperatures, greater wind speeds, decreased soil moisture, and invasion of disturbance-adapted plants and animals. Some edge effects penetrate a few tens of meters into the forest fragment, while others penetrate hundreds of meters (see Analyzing Data 24.1). ANALYZING DATA 24.1 1. 2. 3. * How Far Do Edge Effects Penetrate into Forest Fragments? When an intact forest is first fragmented, abiotic conditions change near the edge of the patch of forest that remains, giving rise to biotic changes (see Figure 24.15). In a landmark study on edge effects, William Laurance and his colleagues (2002)* synthesized 22 years of data from the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, the world\u2019s largest ecological experiment (see the Case Study in Chapter 18). The graph shows some of the changes they measured in Amazon rainforest fragments. According to the graph, how far from the edge must a tree be located if it is not to experience an increase in wind disturbance? If the tree mortality effect penetrated 300 m on each side of an 800 \u00d7 800-m forest fragment, tree mortality would increase in what percentage of the fragment\u2019s area?", "Are edge effects such as those shown here likely to cause other changes (not shown) in species interactions, community structure, or ecosystem processes? Explain. See the companion website for a similar ANALYZING DATA exercise. Laurance, W. F., and 10 others. 2002. Ecosystem decay of Amazonian forest fragments: A 22-year investigation. Conservation Biology 16: 605\u2013618. Analyzing Data 24.1 and the Case Study Revisited in Chapter 18 describe edge effects seen in large-scale experiments in Brazil. The effects of abiotic changes at a forest edge were also illustrated by a study of microclimates 10 to 15 years after the clear-cutting of an old-growth Douglas fir forest in the Pacific Northwest (Chen et al. 1995). Edges were generally characterized by higher temperatures, higher wind speeds, and more light penetration. Daily temperature extremes were also greater at the edges because more heat was lost from the forest edge at night than in the interior forest. The biotic consequences of these abiotic changes included higher rates of decomposition, more windthrown trees and thus more woody debris on the forest floor, and greater seedling survival of some tree species (Pacific fir) and the same or lower in others (Douglas fir and western hemlock). Habitat edges provide habitat diversity that can facilitate or inhibit ecological functions. Edges can either enhance or inhibit dispersal of organisms. Dispersal of organisms can be greater for some species and lower for others at edges. Novel species interactions may take place at the junctions of two ecosystems. Some species may benefit from foraging in one habitat and reproducing in another. Invasive species are commonly more abundant in habitat edges, influencing the population dynamics for native species (Fagan et al. 1999). For example, birds adapted to the forest interior often have lower breeding success when their nests are close to habitat edges; this can result from higher rates of egg predation by raccoons, crows, and other predators as well as higher rates of nest parasitism, especially by cowbirds. In the tallgrass prairie of Wisconsin, Johnson and Temple (1990) studied the reproductive success of five species of ground-nesting birds. They found that the closer nests were to a wooded edge of the prairie habitat, the greater the probability of nest predation by medium-sized predators and of nest parasitism by cowbirds, and the lower the rate of reproductive success. Similar patterns have been observed in other prairies, in Scandinavian forests, in eastern deciduous forests, and in the tropics (Paton 1994). Some biologists have characterized edges as \u201cbiological traps\u201d as a result of the increased risks that some species face there (Battin 2004). Fragmentation alters evolutionary processes In the time since G. Evelyn Hutchinson\u2019s 1965 depiction of \u201cthe ecological theatre and the evolutionary play,\u201d the stage set has been substantially rearranged by human actions. The \u201cevolutionary play\u201d will indeed go on, but in altered ways that we are only now trying to understand. What are the evolutionary consequences when populations of all species are split into smaller and more isolated populations and thrown together in new communities that lack historical precedent? You have already read in Chapters 10 and 23 about the genetic and demographic problems of small, isolated populations. Marcel Goverde and his colleagues studied the evolutionary consequences of fragmentation by watching bumblebee behavior in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland (Goverde et al. 2002). Their experimental plots included meadow fragments of different sizes (created by mowing) and control plots in unfragmented meadow habitat. The researchers studied the foraging behavior of bumblebees as they visited the flowers of wood betony (Stachys officinalis), which were common in both experimental fragments and control plots. The bees visited fragments less frequently than they visited control plots, and once there, they tended to stay longer in the fragments. Ultimately, these two changes in bumblebee behavior resulted in a lower probability of pollination and an increased likelihood of inbreeding for the wood betony in the fragments, resulting in an altered evolutionary trajectory for those plants. In many other cases, habitat fragmentation has been shown to increase rates of inbreeding and genetic drift for those species confined to fragments. For example, Keller and Largiad\u00e8r (2003) found significant genetic divergence between populations of the flightless ground beetle Carabus violaceus that had been isolated by roads. Habitat fragmentation can also alter selection pressures on organisms. Where plant populations become small and isolated, their chances of encountering their pollinators, their pathogens, their herbivores, their dispersers, and their competitors may all be reduced, with subsequent ecological and evolutionary consequences.", "Similar effects have been observed in animals, whose breeding systems and survival patterns can be altered in small fragments (Barbour and Litvaitis 1993). We have only begun to study the evolutionary implications of habitat fragmentation, and we still have much to learn. As we\u2019ll see in the next section, however, such evolutionary information is only one part of what must be considered in designing nature reserves that will work well to maintain biodiversity in landscapes increasingly modified by humans. Self-Assessment 24.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 24.3 Biodiversity can best be sustained by large reserves connected across the landscape and buffered from areas of intense human use. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 24.3.1 List the factors that constitute a suitable core natural area that sustains diversity in a landscape. 24.3.2 Describe the importance of buffer zones around a core natural area in designing nature reserves. 24.3.3 Evaluate the importance of corridors in the context of environmental change. Designing Nature Reserves You may have a favorite national park, such as Everglades in Florida, Grand Canyon in Arizona, Bialowieski in Poland, or the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. How did these places get to be national parks? What were they before they were parks? Are they the best possible sites for maintaining biodiversity in their regions? Now consider how well the area around you is functioning to sustain native species. Your view is undoubtedly shaped by where you are right now, by what the human history of your area is, and by how effective past conservation work there has been. We turn now to an examination of the ways in which people can work to improve the likelihood of the persistence of species native to their region. To counteract habitat loss, conservation planners worldwide are working to locate and design protected areas where species can persist. The identification and preservation of core natural areas, buffer zones surrounding them, and habitat corridors connecting them is key to maintaining and allowing the growth of populations. In some cases, as we\u2019ll see, degraded ecosystems can be restored as viable habitat for wild species. Core natural areas should be large and compact The principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology have come together to guide biologists in selecting the most vital lands for conservation. The design of new nature reserves focuses on core natural areas, where the conservation of biodiversity and ecological integrity take precedence over other values or uses (Noss et al. 1999). Populations that are able to maintain themselves in core areas may serve as sources of individuals for populations outside the protected areas. Ideally, core areas also provide enough land to meet the large habitat area requirements of top predators. Madagascar is a large island that is a global priority for conservation. It has a rich biota and many endemic species, including more than 70 species of lemurs, a group of primates found only on Madagascar. The biota of Madagascar is seriously imperiled, as only 15% of the island\u2019s original forest remains. Efforts are under way to put more of its land into conservation. In designing a new national park in northeastern Madagascar, Claire Kremen and her colleagues examined both the biological and the socioeconomic circumstances of the region. Their design (FIGURE 24.16) was based on a core natural area that extended across several elevational and climate zones, encompassing a range of vegetation types. The proposed core area encompassed habitat for all of the region\u2019s rare species of butterflies, birds, and primates, and it had as yet been little affected by deforestation. The researchers excluded areas close to villages that had already been fragmented and where hunting had negatively affected animal populations (Kremen et al. 1999). The Masoala National Park, which opened in 1997, is now the largest national park in Madagascar at 211,230 ha (over 521,000 acres). With proper management, the park will give the unique biodiversity of this region an improved chance of being maintained in perpetuity. FIGURE 24.16 Designing Masoala National Park Masoala National Park, in northeastern Madagascar, was established after careful planning that took both ecological and socioeconomic concerns into account. It preserves habitat for many threatened species, including the red ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata rubra), which is endemic to this region of Madagascar. This map was simplified from more complex maps generated by using GIS techniques to analyze satellite imagery. (After C. Kremen et al. 1999. Conserv Biol 16: 605\u2013618.)", "Core natural areas are best when they are large and uncut by roads or even by trails. Large core areas facilitate maintaining large population sizes and help to minimize the problems of small populations and susceptibility to local extinction (see Concept 10.3). Thus, not all protected areas qualify as core natural areas. Many do not fully serve the purpose of protecting the whole biota from human interference. Most national parks in the United States were not established with the conservation of biodiversity as their primary mission, but rather to preserve scenery, often on land that was not considered useful for anything else. Conservation planners recognize that many countries do not have the luxury of carving out large areas of land to be solely dedicated to biodiversity conservation. In the design of nature reserves, some spatial configurations are better than others for fostering the persistence of biodiversity (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 24.17). Overall, large, compact, and connected reserves are ideal, but in some cases smaller or disconnected reserves may be more desirable. For example, diseases may spread less easily between isolated smaller reserves than within a large reserve. The primary biological objectives of reserve configuration are the maintenance of the largest possible populations of organisms, the provision of habitat for species throughout their area of distribution, and the provision of adequate area for maintenance of natural disturbance regimes. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 24.17 The Best Spatial Configurations for a Core Natural Area Some spatial configurations are usually better than others for fostering biodiversity. (After J. M. Diamond. 1975. Biol Conserv 7: 129\u2013146; J. C. Williams et al. 2005. Environ Model Assess 10: 163\u2013181.) For the first five characteristics (reserve size, number of reserves, reserve proximity, reserve connectivity, reserve shape), explain the underlying reasons why the design on the left is better than the one on the right. In many settings where conservation is being accomplished, either the landscape or the social context may not realistically permit adhering to the principles described above (Williams et al. 2005). There are many smaller reserves that have been established with the conservation of a single species or ecological community as their main objective. Such biological reserves, even if they are small, are nevertheless an important part of our conservation efforts. Critically situated smaller reserves may be the best available option, particularly where human population density is high and large reserves are unfeasible. Core natural areas should be buffered by compatible land uses Due to many constraints, relatively small areas of land are most commonly designated as core natural areas. If we are to conserve the majority of the world\u2019s species, however, areas outside of the core areas will have to be able to provide adequate habitat for biodiversity persistence (Soul\u00e9 and Sanjayan 1998). We can augment the effectiveness of protected areas by surrounding them with buffer zones (see INTERACTIVE Figure 24.17), large areas with less stringent controls on land use, yet which are at least partially compatible with the resource requirements of many species. Such lands can be managed in ways that permit the extraction of resources used by humans, such as timber, fiber, wild fruits, nuts, and medicines, but still maintain some habitat value. Activities that may be compatible with the conservation function of buffer zones include selective logging, grazing, agriculture, tourism, and limited residential development (Groom et al. 1999). In the plan for Masoala National Park, Kremen and her colleagues included a buffer zone on the eastern side of the park, which consisted of more than 71,000 ha of forest land designated for sustainable timber harvesting (see Figure 24.16). The researchers first identified areas that were at high risk of deforestation due to their proximity to villages. They then established how much wood each family, and thereby each village, consumed, and calculated how much area would be required to meet this need on a sustainable basis. The buffer zone augments the effective area of the park for many lowland species, even though they may be subjected to some level of hunting or collection. On a cautionary note, buffer zones may serve as population sinks (areas where death rates are higher than birth rates) for some species, as animals that stray out of core areas and into buffer zones become vulnerable to hunting, vehicle collisions, or other sources of mortality. In Peru, where slash-and-burn agriculture is commonly practiced just outside nature reserves, wild animals such as agoutis, armadillos, and tapirs often damage farmers\u2019 crops.", "As a result, these animals are targeted by hunters, and such hunting has altered the relative abundances of mammals in the forest (Naughton-Treves et al. 2003). In other cases, however, buffer zones do not appear to act as population sinks and provide an effective transition zone between the core habitat and developed areas outside the reserve. An analysis of data from 785 animal species found that buffer zones can allow populations to persist in habitat fragments that might otherwise be too small or too isolated to support viable populations (Prugh et al. 2008). The key to success boils down to simple demography: if a buffer zone provides a threatened species with habitat in which birth rates are higher than death rates, it can aid conservation goals. If we can succeed in establishing core areas for protection surrounded by sparsely inhabited buffer zones, have we done all that is necessary for conservation? Recall that landscape connectivity is another important consideration in reserve design. Corridors can help maintain biodiversity in a fragmented landscape Habitat corridors\u2014narrow patches that connect blocks of habitat\u2014have become a staple of urban, suburban, and rural planning (FIGURE 24.18). Connectivity among habitat patches might lessen the impact of fragmentation on small populations by helping to ensure that there are corridors of habitat that link them together. FIGURE 24.18 A Habitat Corridor Wildlife can cross this highway overpass over the A1 highway in the Netherlands. When designing Masoala National Park, Kremen and her colleagues looked at the larger landscape and anticipated connections that would be important in the future. Many of Masoala\u2019s target species are found in areas northwest of the park that lie between Masoala and two important protected areas to the north. The park plan included three corridors to those protected areas. The researchers developed this part of the plan by examining maps, but out of expediency, they did not actually do studies of animal movements (Kremen et al. 1999). The intended function of habitat corridors is to prevent the isolation of populations in fragments. But do we know that corridors actually help to overcome this isolation? And is the effectiveness dependent on body size? For example, do corridors work for beetles as well as for wolves? Is a stream corridor in the suburbs providing necessary landscape connectivity for some species? At the continental scale, could we link the GYE to the Yukon through habitat corridors, as some have proposed? Experimental and observational studies of corridors\u2019 utility have shown mixed results. Nick Haddad and his colleagues established a test of the utility of corridors at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in South Carolina. They set up patches of early successional habitat in a matrix of pine forest, some of them connected by corridors, and observed the movements of organisms between patches (FIGURE 24.19). Their results showed that the corridors did indeed serve to facilitate the movement of butterflies, pollen, and bird-dispersed fruits (Tewksbury et al. 2002). FIGURE 24.19 How Effective Are Habitat Corridors? (A) Nick Haddad and his colleagues tested the effectiveness of habitat corridors by creating experimental patches of early successional habitat within a pine forest and creating corridors between some of the patches. They then observed (B) movements of the common buckeye butterfly (Junonia coenia) between patches and (C) fruit production (which provides evidence of pollination) in winterberry (Ilex verticillata) in patches. Error bars in (B) and (C) show one SE of the mean. (After J. J. Tewksbury et al. 2002. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99: 12923\u201312926. \u00a9 2002 National Academy of Sciences U.S.A.) Other studies, however, have found no benefits of corridors, and still others have found negative effects (reviewed in Haddad et al. 2014). For example, in the same experimental system at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, predation on indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) bird nests was higher in patches connected by corridors (Weldon 2006). There are also concerns that corridors could facilitate the movement of pathogens (Hess 1994) or invasive species (Simberloff and Cox 1987). However, in general, corridors have been found to be effective for facilitating conservation of diversity (Resasco 2019). Ecological restoration can increase biodiversity in degraded landscapes What if habitat corridors are lacking and organisms\u2019 ability to move is impaired by an unsuitable matrix of degraded habitat?", "This was the case in Guanacaste Province on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, where Santa Rosa National Park, in a lowland area of tropical dry forest, was largely separated by 35 km of cattle pasture and forest fragments from the upland forest habitat of the nearby mountains. Tropical ecologist Dan Janzen knew that many insects, birds, and mammals needed to migrate between these lowland and upland forests. He also saw that the tropical dry forest that he had spent his career studying was fast disappearing. Janzen\u2019s effort to reverse this trend became one of the largest and most ambitious ecological restoration projects ever undertaken in the Neotropics. Now covering some 120,000 ha of land and 70,000 acres of marine reserve, the Area de Conservaci Guanacaste (ACG) includes three national parks, a protected corridor linking them, and the surrounding agricultural areas. The ACG is home to some 230,000 species, or 65% of the species in Costa Rica (Daily and Ellison 2002). Within the ACG, cattle ranches have occupied much of the land between the three parks for decades. Janzen has launched an effort to restore 75,000 ha of these pasturelands to the original forest types. His strategies include planting trees, suppressing fires, and limiting hunting (to maintain mammalian and avian seed dispersers). Fire suppression is necessary to halt fires that burn readily in pastures covered in jaragua grass (Hyparremia rufa), an invasive plant introduced from Africa. Grazing will be maintained for some time in some areas to suppress the jaragua grass; cows and horses have also been found to help in tree seed dispersal. Ecological restoration is being applied in many other ecosystems, with varying degrees of success. To be successful, restoration ecologists must correctly diagnose the ecological state of an area, decide what the goals of the restoration should be, and then apply their understanding of ecological processes to recreate the desired type of ecosystem. Anthony Bradshaw, a founder of restoration ecology, referred to this process as the \u201cacid test\u201d of ecology: \u201cEach time we undertake restoration we are seeing whether, in the light of our knowledge, we can recreate ecosystems that function, and function properly\u201d (Bradshaw 1987). In some cases, such as the recovery of native oyster populations highlighted in FIGURE 24.20, results quickly suggest that we\u2019ve passed this acid test. But in others, such as Janzen\u2019s efforts to restore tropical dry forests in Guanacaste, the process is likely to be a long and slow one. That is not surprising, since large-scale changes in ecological communities can take many decades, and it can also take a long time for people to change the ways in which we relate to and manage nature. In the next section, we will look more closely at how ecological principles are applied in making decisions about how to manage natural resources sustainably. Additionally, in the context of environmental change, particularly the spread of invasive species and climate change, it is unlikely that conserving and restoring communities to a perceived \u201coriginal state\u201d is possible (Hobbs et al. 2009). FIGURE 24.20 Dramatic Effects of an Ecological Restoration Project Native oyster populations have collapsed worldwide as a result of habitat loss and overharvesting. (A) In an ecological restoration experiment that began in 2004, oyster reefs were constructed in nine protected areas along the Great Wicomico River in Virginia. Three years later, native oyster populations had recovered dramatically across the 35-ha restoration project. Error bars show one SE of the mean. (B) Oyster habitat before and after restoration.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 24.4.1 Evaluate how collaborative ecosystem management may lead to better solutions to preserving diversity than strictly science-based decisions. 24.4.2 Describe why iterative adjustments to land and marine reserve management policies are needed to help improve their effectiveness. Ecosystem Management In 1989, a convoy of logging trucks and about 300 loggers made the journey to a packed public hearing in Olympia, Washington, to defend their jobs.", "There was talk that the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina; see Figure 9.15) could be listed as a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, which would place its old-growth forest habitat off-limits to logging. Tempers were flaring among loggers and others supported by the timber industry. \u201cWhen it comes to choosing between owls and the welfare of families, the hell with the owl as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said a state politician. At times, some of the testimony was drowned out by the honking of truck horns. The contentious debate about the logging of forests in the Pacific Northwest was reduced to \u201cowls versus jobs\u201d and resulted in bumper sticker and T-shirt slogans, vandalism by both sides, and the exchange of many angry words. Some people recognized that there might be a better way to make decisions about the use of natural resources. The conflict in the Pacific Northwest was in part the outcome of a long history of top-down management of natural resources with a focus on resource production and extraction. In 1995, a federal Interagency Ecosystem Management Task Force was formed to develop alternatives to this approach (DellaSala and Williams 2006). Approaches to managing natural resources have become more collaborative over time Through most of the twentieth century, management of natural resources on U.S. public lands was focused on maintaining individual resources of economic value, whether timber, deer or ducks for hunting, or scenery for visitors. This focus remained at the core of many land management policies until Congress passed the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. By the late 1980s, natural resource agencies had gradually expanded their missions to include \u201cmultiple use,\u201d in recognition that different people had different interests and that it was possible to manage public lands to meet diverse, and at times competing, demands. This was frequently done through spatial compartmentalization of uses, as when different blocks of land were designated as timber extraction zones, recreation zones, or wilderness areas. Since the 1980s, with our greater awareness of the necessity of preserving biodiversity, our goals for land management have shifted again. The ecosystem management approach has emerged as a way to expand the scope of management to include protection of all native species and ecosystems while focusing on the sustainability of the whole system, not just the sustainability of resources of interest. What is ecosystem management? Most simply stated, it is \u201cmanaging ecosystems so as to assure their sustainability\u201d (Franklin 1996). A committee of the Ecological Society of America arrived at a less simple but more comprehensive consensus definition in 1996: \u201cEcosystem management is management driven by explicit goals, executed by policies, protocols, and practices, and made adaptable by monitoring and research based on our best understanding of the ecological interactions and processes necessary to sustain ecosystem structure and function\u201d (Christensen et al. 1996). This definition emphasizes sustainability but also recognizes the need for setting goals and using science to evaluate and adjust management practices over time. The conflict in the late 1980s over old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest was a stimulus to ecologists, government land managers, industry, and citizens to seek a less confrontational way to make decisions. Since that time, more collaborative decision making has been combined with better incorporation of science to arrive at management plans that not only attempt to sustain both biodiversity and people\u2019s livelihoods, but also are responsive to changing conditions. In ecosystem management, the focus is on a particular biophysical ecosystem, or ecoregion, delineated by natural boundaries rather than political boundaries: a watershed, a mountain range, a stretch of coastline. The full range of stakeholders\u2014people with some interest in the project\u2014becomes involved in decision making for the ecoregion, joined together by the common goal of maintaining its ecological integrity and economic viability. Ecosystem management sets sustainable goals, implements policies, monitors effectiveness, and adjusts as necessary Ecosystem management is a process, one that may be implemented in different ways for different projects. Most ecosystem management projects begin with the gathering of scientific data to define the nature of the problems in the ecosystem. That information is then used to set sustainable goals. To meet those goals, a set of actions is needed, many of which may require adapting new policies. Once a new policy is implemented, the ecosystem is monitored to gauge whether that action brings about the desired result. Adjustments to the policies are then made as needed.", "In this iterative process, known as adaptive management (FIGURE 24.21), management actions are seen as experiments, and future management decisions are determined by the outcome of present decisions. FIGURE 24.21 Adaptive Management Is a Vital Component of Ecosystem Management Adaptive management is a systematic way of learning from past management actions and adjusting future decisions accordingly. (After R. Margoluis and N. Salafsky. 1998. Measures of Success: Designing, Managing, and Monitoring Conservation and Development Projects. Island Press: Washington, DC.) Monitoring is a vital component of adaptive management. For example, Mark Boyce developed a model predicting elk and wolf population dynamics in Yellowstone National Park following the reintroduction of wolves described in this chapter\u2019s Case Study. He and his colleague Nathan Varley have taken an adaptive management approach by adjusting this model based on demographic data from the first 10 years of wolf presence. Since their original model estimated elk numbers well, but underestimated wolf numbers, they knew that some of the model\u2019s assumptions needed adjustment (Varley and Boyce 2006). This approach will be important for determining acceptable hunting levels for elk and for future adjustments in response to changing circumstances. Although it is extremely useful, ecosystem management has limitations and drawbacks. One drawback is that it may take a long time to reach a consensus\u2014yet averting an environmental crisis may require that preventive actions be taken quickly. There is also potential for continued conflict generated by those who simply want to disrupt the process, even when extensive efforts at stakeholder involvement have been made. In some instances, the effective spread of false information, a struggle for power among different government agencies, the presence of corruption, or the unmet needs of the people in local communities can produce situations that may not lend themselves to participatory governance. Humans are an integral part of ecosystems Human actions affect natural ecosystems, and human economies are affected by supplies of natural resources. Ecosystem managers must manage natural resources and biodiversity across large landscapes, as well as devise plans that protect both natural ecosystems and human economies. Ecosystem management incorporates human social and economic factors as fundamental parts of the decision-making process, along with legal requirements and, of course, ecological integrity (FIGURE 24.22). The integration of these different components is seen as necessary to achieve a successful management outcome. FIGURE 24.22 Humans Are an Integral Part of Ecosystem Management Ecosystem management integrates interests derived from ecological, institutional, and socioeconomic contexts. The letters represent the overlap of the three contexts: A, zone of regulatory or management authority; B, zone of social obligations; C, zone of informal decisions (as opposed to legal requirements); D, zone of win\u2013win\u2013win partnerships. (From Dennis A. Schenborn, personal communication.) As we have seen, people need natural ecosystems for many reasons, ranging from the economic to the spiritual. Ecosystem management incorporates education of the public about their reliance on ecosystem services as part of its mission. It also engages the public in helping to solve those problems that degrade the ecosystem services that they rely on. Any conservation plan that excludes the human component will not be accepted, ultimately, by the stakeholders. The plan for Masoala National Park took the needs of the people living around the park into consideration. Conservation planners not only calculated their need for wood and provided for them in a buffer zone designated for managed forestry, but also surveyed the region for tree species that would have value in an export market and included them in an economic plan for future use. The idea was to remove economic pressure for park resources by identifying ways that people could support themselves and increase their incomes using resources outside the park. In addition, Kremen\u2019s team worked in conjunction with local people and with the Malagasy government to develop the plan, recognizing the importance of local acceptance of any proposal they made. In the end, the park plan provided for the economic needs of the people, by identifying forest resources that could be used to enrich the region, as well as for the habitat requirements of all the taxa included in the planners\u2019 analysis. While some problems have arisen with time, such as illegal hunting and logging within the park, the original conservation goals have generally been achieved (Kremen 2014). Self-Assessment 24.4 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.]", "A CASE STUDY REVISITED Wolves in the Yellowstone Landscape The reintroduction of wolves into the GYE in 1995 reflected a shift to using an ecosystem management approach in decision making. It was a bold step that followed years of study and preparation. That it happened at all reflects a quantum shift in human attitudes toward nature over the last century. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, wolves were feared and reviled. They were perceived as a threat to people and livestock\u2014an accurate perception as far as livestock were concerned. Wolves were hunted to extinction in the area of Yellowstone National Park by the late 1930s and throughout virtually all of the conterminous United States not long thereafter. The removal of a top predator can alter the landscape substantially, in part because herbivores whose populations were once controlled by the predator may increase in number and negatively affect vegetation dynamics. In Yellowstone, the growth and reproduction of riparian tree species, such as cottonwoods, aspens, and willows, declined after wolves were removed (Ripple and Beschta 2007). A possible reason was that the trees experienced heavy browsing by herbivores such as elk, which roamed freely along rivers and streams once the wolves were gone. How strong is the support for this explanation? Many observations are consistent with this idea. The reintroduction of wolves began in the winter of 1995\u20131996, when 31 wolves captured in Canada were released into the park. Their numbers increased rapidly; by 2004, there were about 250 wolves in the park. Following the reintroduction, populations of elk, the wolves\u2019 principal prey, have declined by 50%. Elk were initially naive and very vulnerable to wolf predation, but they have since modified their behavior, showing a preference for foraging in places that provide high visibility (see Figure 8.10). Furthermore, cottonwoods, aspens, and willows have begun to recover in some areas. In some cases, the early signs of recovery appeared to be concentrated in areas where elk face a high risk of predation, such as locations where visibility is poor, escape routes are lacking, or ambush sites are common. Thus, elk may be avoiding areas where they are most vulnerable to attack by wolves, allowing trees in those areas to recover\u2014and possibly leading to a series of other, cascading effects (FIGURE 24.23). FIGURE 24.23 A Trophic Cascade Hypothesis Wolves are top predators, and their reintroduction to the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) has the potential to cause cascading trophic effects. According to the hypothesis shown here, elk now avoid those sites where they are most vulnerable to predation, and trees and shrubs are now returning to those sites after decades of suppression by elk. Researchers are actively testing this and other hypotheses about effects of wolves in the GYE. (After W. J. Ripple and R. L. Beschta. 2004. BioScience 54: 755\u2013766.) However, some studies have questioned whether a trophic cascade like that shown in Figure 24.23 is occurring. In an experimental test of the hypothesis that elk forage less in areas with wolves, leading to the recovery of woody species in those areas, Kauffman et al. (2010) found that aspen survival was not affected by the presence of wolves. Similarly, Creel and Christianson (2009) found that willow consumption by elk was more strongly affected by snow conditions than by the presence of wolves. Contrary to expectation, willow consumption actually increased when wolves were present. While the reintroduction of wolves may have affected willow and aspen abundance, it may be because predation by wolves has decreased the size of the elk population, not because fear of predation has led to changes in elk foraging behavior. Whatever the outcome of this debate, the reintroduction of wolves provides a wonderful opportunity to test hypotheses about how heterogeneity of a large landscape can be influenced by its component organisms. CONNECTIONS IN NATURE FUTURE CHANGES IN THE YELLOWSTONE LANDSCAPE If riparian trees continue to increase in abundance in the GYE, a series of linked effects (like those described in Concepts 16.3 and 21.3) may ensue. In some locations, increased numbers of willows have slowed stream flow and increased sedimentation rates (Beschta and Ripple 2006). The increased growth of riparian tree species is also expected to provide shade and habitat for migratory birds and for trout, which prefer shade-cooled waters. More riparian bird species have been observed under similar conditions in Alberta (Hebblewhite et al. 2005). As populations of willows, a preferred food for beavers, have increased, new beaver colonies have appeared.", "In turn, the dams built by the beavers have changed patterns of water flow, creating marshlands that may favor the return of otters, ducks, muskrats, and mink. The willow regrowth has also helped reverse the degradation of rivers and streams associated with the heavy grazing of streambank vegetation prior to wolf reintroduction (Beschta and Ripple 2019). Other even more fundamental changes may be taking place in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Recall from Chapters 2, 3, and 4 that climate is the single most important determinant of where species live. With rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, climate warming is occurring and will continue in the coming century (see Chapter 25). Will Yellowstone be able to maintain its current biological diversity in the face of global climate change? A modeling study shows what the vegetation of the region surrounding Yellowstone National Park may look like under a doubling of current atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which may happen within a century (FIGURE 24.24). Generally, the projections are for higher temperatures, no changes in precipitation, and more frequent fires. Based on these projected changes in the physical environment, the model predicts upslope and northward migrations of many species. These migrations will cause shifts in forest communities, with some species declining within the park and others increasing their range to include the park. Species currently rare in or absent from the GYE that may increase substantially there include gambel oak, western red cedar, and ponderosa pine. A near elimination of whitebark pine is predicted to occur as suitable habitat for that species shifts to the north (Bartlein et al. 1997). FIGURE 24.24 Projected Effects of Climate Change in the Northern Rockies Shifts in the distributions of some principal tree species in the northern Rocky Mountains are projected by a model of a future climate driven by twice the current atmospheric CO concentrations. These shifts include (A) the increased distribution of western red cedar, which 2 is currently uncommon in the region, and (B) the near disappearance of whitebark pine. (After P. J. Bartlein et al. 1997. Conserv Biol 11: 782\u2013792.) The loss of whitebark pine would have a number of other ecological impacts. This tree is a keystone species that produces large, fatty, and nutritious nuts, an important food source for Clark\u2019s nutcracker, as well as for black and grizzly bears. Clark\u2019s nutcracker, in turn, is the primary disperser of the whitebark pine\u2019s seeds (Tomback 1982). One consequence of warmer winters during the past few decades has been an expansion of the range of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) to high-elevation pine forests, including those where whitebark pine grows (Logan and Powell 2001). This beetle has devastating effects on whitebark pine (FIGURE 24.25). Whitebark pine is also being attacked throughout much of its North American range by the fungus blister rust Cronartium ribicola, an introduced pathogen (Tomback and Achuff 2010). The combined effects of the mountain pine beetle and blister rust have caused an extensive die-off of whitebark pine, and this die-off has potentially reduced the occurrence of Clark\u2019s nutcracker in some areas (McKinney et al. 2009). Loss of whitebark pine also means loss of a food source for grizzly bears. Thus, it appears that climate change and introduced disease are having a major influence on whitebark pine populations, and that these effects have the potential to be transferred to wildlife, such as grizzly bears. (See ONLINE CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION 24.1 for more information on how climate change is affecting biodiversity in forests and other ecosystems.) FIGURE 24.25 Warm Winters Have Promoted a Devastating Insect Outbreak Once excluded from whitebark pine forests by cold winter temperatures, the mountain pine beetle has expanded its range as temperatures have warmed in recent decades. These beetles have contributed to the death of millions of whitebark pines, which turn red and subsequently gray when they die (as in this forest in Wyoming, USA). In July 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it will list whitebark pine as a candidate species under the Endangered Species Act. As we\u2019ve seen in this chapter, landscape ecology and the use of tools such as remote sensing and GIS can elucidate current patterns of biodiversity and help us to predict future ones. Over the past century we have put much effort into selecting, establishing, and undertaking management of new protected areas, but now we need to ask how well those areas will maintain their species in a warmer world.", "If biodiversity losses are projected under climate change, are there steps we can take now that can improve habitat connectivity, create or improve buffer zones around core natural areas, or restore degraded areas to greater ecological integrity? Or will we need to move species to new areas of suitable habitat, especially if they cannot migrate quickly enough to keep up with climate change? With a growing human population and growing demands on ecosystems, these challenges will be considerable. Ecologists will have the critical role of providing the scientific information needed to make decisions about how we proceed as a society. The future of untold numbers of species relies on how effective we can be at this task. Global Ecology KEY CONCEPTS CONCEPT 25.1 Elements move among geologic, atmospheric, oceanic, and biological pools at a global scale. CONCEPT 25.2 Earth is warming because of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. CONCEPT 25.3 Anthropogenic emissions of sulfur and nitrogen cause acid deposition, alter soil chemistry, and affect the health of ecosystems. CONCEPT 25.4 Losses of ozone in the stratosphere and increases in ozone in the troposphere both pose risks to organisms. Dust Storms of Epic Proportions: A Case Study Dust is usually a subtle nuisance for most city dwellers, a reminder of neglect and lax housekeeping. Living in islands of asphalt and concrete, most urbanites see little bare soil, let alone clouds of blowing dust in the sky. Yet in late spring of 1934, a massive dust storm shrouded the U.S. cities of Chicago and New York in a dark haze never seen before by their residents. People choked on the dust, and it burned their eyes. Twelve million tons of dust fell on Chicago\u20144 pounds for each resident\u2014and an estimated 350 million tons of dust were carried by the storm to the Atlantic Ocean. As frightening as this event was to city dwellers, farmers in the southern Great Plains had suffered through multiple years of frequent severe dust storms throughout the 1930s (FIGURE 25.1). During this period, many people in that region, known as the Dust Bowl, suffered from an often-fatal dust-induced pneumonia similar to the black lung disease that was killing coal miners. FIGURE 25.1 A Massive Dust Storm A wall of dust approaches the town of Clayton, New Mexico, on May 29, 1937. This storm was one of several \u201cblack dusters\u201d that swept through the Dust Bowl during the 1930s. Since the mid-1990s, widespread dust storms have impacted parts of Asia, including China, South Korea, and Japan. Residents of Beijing, China, have had experiences similar to the residents of Chicago and New York who faced massive, unexpected dust storms. An April 2006 storm dropped more than 300,000 tons of dust on Beijing. Residents were encouraged to stay indoors to avoid inhaling the dust and getting it in their eyes. Many of those brave enough to venture out wore surgical face masks to protect their lungs. Some residents lined their windows and doors with rags in an attempt to keep the dust out of their houses and apartments. More intense and frequent dust storms have occurred in the Middle East in the past decade. One storm in August 2015 was so bad that ports and airports throughout the region had to close. Several deaths and thousands of injuries were attributed to the dust. In addition to the direct health impact of dust on human respiratory systems, it can also spread disease such as meningitis. Large dust storms in urban areas are perceived as rare events, potentially linked to unsustainable land use practices such as overgrazing or farming on marginal lands. In the examples mentioned above, farming and grazing in arid areas had increased prior to the dust storms. There is evidence, however, that massive dust storms occur at regular, but infrequent, intervals irrespective of human activities, moving large amounts of soil across whole continents. Over the past century, these events have been associated with prolonged droughts. The urban dust storms in the United States during the 1930s were associated with a decade-long drought in the Dust Bowl (FIGURE 25.2). Similarly, the Beijing dust storms of the past two decades have been associated with drought in Mongolia. The increase in the Middle East dust storm frequency has been attributed to climate change and diversion of rivers for agriculture. FIGURE 25.2 Drought in the Southern Plains During the 1930s, the southern Great Plains of the United States experienced the driest weather on record.", "The drought, in combination with loss of vegetation cover, created conditions conducive to dust input into the atmosphere. The values shown are anomalies (differences between averages for the period 1932\u20131939 and long-term averages). (After B. I. Cook et al. 2009. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106: 4997\u20135001. \u00a9 2009 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.) Dust in the atmosphere is made up of soil particles blown from regions that lack vegetative cover to protect their soils from the wind. As discussed in Chapters 4 and 22, soils are important as sources of nutrients, determinants of terrestrial moisture availability, and habitat for organisms. Therefore, the redistribution of soils from one area to another has the potential to cause ecological change. How widespread are these ecological effects? What role have humans played in the dust storms of the past century? As we will see in this chapter, the movement of dust is an important component in the movement of elements at the global scale. Introduction In Chapter 22, we reviewed the cycling of nutrients within ecosystems associated with biological uptake and decomposition. The movements of these biologically important elements are linked at a global scale that transcends ecological boundaries at the ecosystem and biome scales. Ecological processes at the ecosystem scale (e.g., net primary production, decomposition) influence global phenomena (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions and uptake). In addition, the realization that humans are increasingly changing the physical and chemical environment at a global scale has fostered a greater awareness of ecology at these larger spatial scales. Emissions of pollutants, dust, and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere have caused widespread environmental problems, including climate change, acid precipitation, eutrophication, and loss of stratospheric ozone. A major focus of global ecology is therefore the study of the extensive environmental effects of human activities. The first part of this chapter will cover the global-scale cycles of chemical elements, which are influenced by, but distinct from, the ecosystem-scale cycles covered in Chapter 22. Knowledge of these cycles is important for understanding global environmental change. Humans have had profound effects on these element cycles; for example, human activities now dominate the global nitrogen cycle (Fowler et al. 2015). We will review the environmental changes associated with anthropogenic effects in the remaining sections. CONCEPT 25.1 Elements move among geologic, atmospheric, oceanic, and biological pools at a global scale. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 25.1.1 Summarize the major pools and fluxes associated with global-scale cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. 25.1.2 Describe why anthropogenic perturbations to the global carbon cycle are important mediators of environmental change, even though the fluxes are relatively small compared to net primary production and respiration. 25.1.3 Evaluate why changes to individual element cycles at the global scale have implications for the cycling of other elements. Global Biogeochemical Cycles In this section, we will follow the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur at the global scale. These particular elements are emphasized both because of their importance to biological activity and because of their roles as pollutants. The cycles are discussed in terms of pools, or reservoirs\u2014 the amounts of elements within components of the biosphere\u2014and fluxes, or rates of movement, between pools. For example, terrestrial plants constitute a pool of carbon, while photosynthesis represents a flux\u2014in this case, the movement of carbon from the atmospheric pool to the terrestrial plant pool. Carbon cycles dynamically at the global scale Carbon (C) is critically important for life because of its role in energy transfer and the construction of biomass (see Concept 5.2 and Concept 20.1). At a global scale, C that is actively cycling is relatively dynamic, moving between atmospheric, terrestrial, and oceanic pools relatively quickly (over weeks to decades). It is important that we understand the global C cycle because changes in the fluxes of C among these pools are influencing Earth\u2019s climate system. Carbon in the atmosphere occurs primarily as carbon dioxide (CO ) and methane (CH ). As we saw in Chapter 2, both of these greenhouse gases influence 24 atmospheric absorption of infrared radiation and its reradiation from Earth\u2019s surface. Thus, any changes in the atmospheric concentrations of these gases can have profound effects on the global climate, as we will see later in this chapter. There are four major global pools of C: atmosphere, oceans, land surface (including soils and vegetation), and sediments and rock (FIGURE 25.3) (Schlesinger and Bernhart 2013).", "The largest of these pools is the combination of sediments and rock, which contain 99% of global C. The C in this pool is found primarily in the form of carbonate minerals and organic compounds. It is the most stable of the major pools, taking up and releasing C on geologic time scales. FIGURE 25.3 The Global Carbon Cycle Boxes represent major pools of C, measured in petagrams (1 Pg = 1015 g). Arrows represent major fluxes of C, measured in petagrams per year; anthropogenic fluxes are shown in orange. Note that the largest fluxes are terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) and respiration. (After W. H. Schlesinger. 1991, 2013. Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change, 1st and 3rd eds.

In Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, T. F. Stocker et al. [Eds.], pp. 466\u2013570. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.) How would deforestation influence the magnitude of carbon fluxes? The oceanic pool consists of two main components: surface waters (to depths of 75\u2013200 m), where most marine biological activity occurs, and deeper, colder waters. Carbon dioxide dissolves in ocean water because of the concentration gradient between the atmosphere (which has a higher concentration) and the ocean (which has a lower concentration). There is relatively little mixing between ocean surface waters and deeper waters, although C is transferred between them by the sinking of detritus and carbonate shells of marine organisms and by the downwelling of polar ocean currents described in Concept 2.2. Most of the C in the oceans (>90%) is in the deeper waters. Some flux from this deep ocean pool occurs when upwelling brings carbon-enriched water to the surface, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. The terrestrial pool, which includes vegetated and nonvegetated land surfaces and their associated soils, is the largest pool of biologically active C. The soil pool contains approximately twice as much C as the vegetation pool. The terrestrial pool exchanges C with the atmospheric pool primarily through photosynthetic uptake of CO2 by plants and respiratory CO2 release by plants and heterotrophs. Prior to the Industrial Revolution that began in the early nineteenth century, the exchanges between these two pools were roughly equal, with no net change in atmospheric CO2. As a result of the rapid growth of the human population over the past 200 years and associated industrial and agricultural development, there has been an increase in the release of C to the atmosphere from the terrestrial pool. This anthropogenic (human-generated) release of C is the result of land use change\u2014 mainly forest clearing for agricultural development\u2014and the burning of fossil fuels. Prior to the mid-nineteenth century, deforestation was the largest contributor to anthropogenic C release to the atmosphere. Removing the forest canopy warms the soil surface, increasing rates of decomposition and heterotrophic respiration. Burning of the trees also releases CO2, as well as small amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and CH4, into the atmosphere. During the last half of the twentieth century, deforestation for agricultural development shifted from the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere to the tropics. The rate of anthropogenic emission of C into the atmosphere has continued to increase in recent decades. In 1970, anthropogenic CO2 emissions added C to the atmosphere at a rate of 4.1 petagrams (1 Pg = 1015 g) per year; by 2018, this rate had almost tripled to 11.5 Pg C per year. Today, burning of fossil fuels accounts for approximately 92% of the anthropogenic C flux to the atmosphere; the remaining 8% is associated with deforestation. Approximately half of these anthropogenic CO2 emissions are taken up by the oceans and terrestrial biota. This proportion will decrease with time, however, as the uptake of CO2 by terrestrial and marine ecosystems will not keep pace with the rate of emissions to the atmosphere (IPCC 2013). Emissions of CH4 to the atmosphere from the terrestrial pool have also increased in the past two centuries as a result of human activities. Although atmospheric concentrations of CH4 are much lower than those of CO2, even small increases in CH4 could influence the global climate because it is 25 times more effective as a greenhouse gas per molecule than CO2. Methane is emitted naturally by anaerobic methanogenic archaea that live in wetlands and shallow marine sediments. Methanogenic archaea in the rumens of ruminant animals are also a source of atmospheric CH4.", "Anthropogenic emissions of CH4 have doubled since the early nineteenth century as a result of the processing and burning of fossil fuels, agricultural development (primarily rice, which is grown in flooded fields), burning of forests and crops, and livestock production (IPCC 2013). As a result, atmospheric CH4 concentrations have more than doubled over the past two centuries. The process of photosynthesis is sensitive to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. As a result, photosynthesis has the potential to increase as anthropogenic CO2 emissions increase, primarily in plants with the C3 photosynthetic pathway (see Concept 5.3). Experiments have shown, however, that for some herbaceous plants, these increases may be short-term because the plants may acclimate to elevated CO2 concentrations (Pastore et al. 2019). For other plants, such as forest trees, increases in photosynthetic rates may be more sustained. It is extremely important that we understand the response of forest ecosystems to elevated CO 2 concentrations. Because much of terrestrial net primary production (NPP), and thus C uptake, occurs in these ecosystems, their response will have a profound effect on the fate of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, it is difficult to manipulate atmospheric CO concentrations experimentally in an intact forest. In 2 one successful approach, called free-air CO2 enrichment, or FACE, researchers inject CO2 into the air through vertical pipes surrounding stands of trees while monitoring the atmospheric concentration of CO2 within the experimental stands. The rate of CO injection is controlled to maintain a relatively constant 2 elevated level. One of the first FACE experiments was initiated by Evan DeLucia and his colleagues to investigate the ecosystem effects of elevated CO concentrations in a young loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest in North 2 Carolina (DeLucia et al. 1999) (FIGURE 25.4). The experiment was initiated in 1997, when three plots exposed to elevated CO concentrations and three control plots exposed to ambient CO concentrations were 22 established. The researchers used measurements of tree basal area to estimate aboveground NPP and repeated collections of soil cores to estimate fine root growth and belowground NPP. DeLucia and his colleagues found that the elevated CO concentrations increased the overall NPP of the forest by 25%. Input 2 of C into the soil, from both aboveground litter and belowground fine root turnover, also increased. The results of this experiment indicated that forests may be an important sink for anthropogenic CO . However, 2 DeLucia et al. suggested that their young forest stand represents the upper limit of potential CO uptake and 2 that older forests, and forests with lower water and nutrient supplies, may not have as great a capacity to take up CO . Results from other FACE experiments in forest ecosystems have found similar responses to 2 elevated CO concentrations (an average increase in NPP of 23%; Norby et al. 2005). The greater 2 productivity observed in forests in the Northern Hemisphere over the past five decades may be related in part to elevated atmospheric CO concentrations (Graven et al. 2013), verifying the predictions of the FACE 2 experiments. FIGURE 25.4 A FACE Experiment The circles visible in this aerial photo are free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) treatment rings in a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest in the Duke Forest in North Carolina. Carbon dioxide is released from plastic pipes surrounding treatment plots at a rate calculated to raise the CO concentration to 200 ppm above ambient2 atmospheric CO concentrations. 2 Changing atmospheric CO2 concentration directly alters the acidity (pH) of the oceans by affecting the rate at which CO diffuses into seawater. Greater diffusion of CO into seawater enhances the formation of 22 carbonic acid, which lowers the pH of the seawater: During the past century, ocean acidity has increased by about 30%. Further increases have been forecast using model simulations incorporating the expected increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the twenty-first century (Bopp et al. 2013). The predicted increases will have two negative effects on marine organisms that form protective external shells from calcium carbonate, including corals, mollusks, and many plankton. First, the increase in acidity will dissolve the existing shells of the organisms. Second, lower concentrations of carbonate in seawater will decrease the organisms\u2019 ability to synthesize shells (Feely et al. 2004; Orr et al. 2005). Between 1990 and 2009, the rate of formation of calcium carbonate by corals on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef declined by 14%, an amount consistent with observed decreases in the pH of seawater (FIGURE 25.5) (De\u2019ath et al. 2009).", "Both effects will increase mortality and lower the abundances of marine organisms that rely on calcium carbonate, altering the diversity and function of marine ecosystems. (Make your own prediction of the future of ocean pH and its effect in ANALYZING DATA 25.1.) FIGURE 25.5 Rates of Calcification of Corals on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef, 1900\u20132005 The sharp decline in calcification rates after 1980 is associated with the combined effects of decreasing pH and increasing ocean water temperature. (After G. De\u2019ath et al. 2009. Science 323: 5910.) ANALYZING DATA 25.1 Ocean acidification is one of the consequences of increased anthropogenic CO emissions. There is already substantial 2 evidence that the pH of ocean waters is declining (FIGURE A). Using information about the chemistry of seawater and diffusion of CO from the atmosphere, marine geochemists have projected that the pH of the ocean will have decreased to 2 7.9 by the year 2050, and by 2100 it will be 7.75, assuming \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d CO emissions (a continued increase in 2 the rate of emissions growth) during the twenty-first century (IPCC 2013). * FIGURE A Measured Trend in Ocean pH for Two Stations in the Atlantic Ocean and One in the Pacific Ocean (After IPCC. 2013. Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.) 1. Using the data in Figure A, derive a simple linear mathematical relationship or draw a graph to come up with your own prediction of the ocean pH in the years 2050 and 2100. How well do your predictions match up with the IPCC\u2019s predictions based on seawater chemistry and continued increases in atmospheric CO ? Your answer should give you 2 a higher estimated ocean pH than the one predicted in the IPCC report. What might account for this discrepancy? 2. The decrease in ocean pH is already affecting the calcification rates of marine organisms, as indicated for corals in Figure 25.5. To get a view of what may occur with an even more CO -rich future, Uthicke et al. (2013)\u2020 studied the 2 abundance and diversity of foraminiferans (zooplankton that form carbonate shells) in sediments around natural CO seeps in the ocean (FIGURE B). Using your own and the IPCC\u2019s prediction of change in ocean pH from Question 1 and the relationships shown in Figure B, estimate the percentage decrease in abundance (density) and species richness of foraminiferans from 2000 (pH = 8.10) to 2050 and from 2000 to 2100.

High risk of extinction of benthic foraminifera in this century due to ocean acidification. Scientific Reports 3: 1\u20135. Atmospheric concentrations of C have changed dynamically throughout Earth\u2019s history in association with geologic and climate changes. Concentrations of CO2 have ranged from greater than 3,000 parts per million (ppm) 60 million years ago to less than 200 ppm 140,000 years ago. Over the past 400,000 years, variations in the concentrations of CO2 and CH4, as measured in tiny bubbles preserved in polar ice, have followed glacial\u2013interglacial cycles (see Concept 2.5). The lowest CO2 concentrations during this time were associated with glacial periods (FIGURE 25.6). Over most of the past 12,000 years, atmospheric CO2 concentrations remained relatively stable, varying between 260 and 280 ppm. Since the mid-nineteenth century, however, CO2 concentrations have increased at a rate faster than at any other time over the past 400,000 years (IPCC 2013), reaching values of 408 ppm in 2019. Even if we dramatically decreased our CO2 emissions starting today, atmospheric CO2 concentrations would remain elevated for a long time to come because of a time lag (decades to centuries) in oceanic uptake. The influence of CO2 and CH4 on climate change will be discussed later in this chapter. FIGURE 25.6 Changes in Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations over Time Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have varied with temperature over the past 800,000 years. These gas concentrations were measured in bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice; temperatures were estimated using oxygen isotopic analyses (see Ecological Toolkit 5.1). CO concentrations2 in 2019 are 408 ppm. (After D. Lhi et al. 2008. Nature 453: 379\u2013382.)", "Biological fluxes dominate the global nitrogen cycle Nitrogen (N) plays a key role in biological processes as a constituent of proteins and enzymes, and it is one of the resources that most commonly limits primary production, as we saw in Concept 20.2. Thus, cycles of N and C are tightly coupled through the processes of photosynthesis and decomposition. The largest pool of N (>90%) is atmospheric dinitrogen gas (N ) (FIGURE 25.7). This form of N is very 2 stable chemically and cannot be used by most organisms, with the important exception of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which are able to convert it to more chemically usable forms, as described in Concept 22.1. These fixed chemical compounds are referred to as reactive N because, unlike N2, they can participate in chemical reactions in the atmosphere, soils, and water. Terrestrial N2 fixation by bacteria provides approximately 128 teragrams (1 Tg = 1012 g) of reactive N per year (Cleveland et al. 1999; Galloway et al. 2004) and supplies 12% of the annual biological demand (Schlesinger and Bernhart 2013). The remaining 88% is met by uptake of N from the soil in forms released by decomposition. Oceanic N2 fixation contributes another 120 Tg to the biosphere annually. Geologic pools associated with sediments containing organic matter represent a much smaller fraction of global N than of global C, but some N-rich sedimentary sources may be important sources in some sites (Morford et al. 2016). FIGURE 25.7 The Global Nitrogen Cycle Boxes represent major pools of N, measured in teragrams (1 Tg = 1012 g). Arrows represent major fluxes of N, measured in teragrams per year; anthropogenic fluxes are shown in orange. The percentage of the total atmospheric N pool made up of reactive N is minuscule (it is also difficult to quantify because it is very dynamic). (After W. H. Schlesinger. 1991, 2013. Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change, 1st and 3rd eds. Academic Press: Cambridge, MA; F. S. Chapin et al. 2002. Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology. Springer-Verlag: New York. Data from various sources including C. Cleveland et al. 1999. Global Biogeochem Cycles 13: 623\u2013645; J. N. Galloway et al. 2004. Biogeochemistry 70: 153\u2013226.) Given its small size, why is the reactive pool of N of such great interest? Although the pools of N at land and ocean surfaces are relatively small, they are very active biologically, and they are held tightly by internal ecosystem cycling processes. Fluxes from these pools are small relative to the rates of internal cycling, usually less than 10% (Chapin et al. 2002). The natural flux of N between terrestrial and oceanic pools that occurs via rivers is tiny, but it plays an important biological role by enhancing primary production in estuaries and salt marshes. Denitrification, a microbial process that occurs in anoxic soils and in the ocean (described in Concept 22.2), results in movement of N (as N2 and as N2O, a greenhouse gas, also known as laughing gas) from terrestrial and marine ecosystems into the atmosphere. Oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems also lose N through burial of organic matter in sediments and through burning of biomass. Human activities have altered the global N cycle tremendously\u2014even more than they have altered the global C cycle. Anthropogenic fluxes are now the dominant components of the N cycle (Galloway et al. 2004; Canfield et al. 2010) (FIGURE 25.8). The rate of fixation of atmospheric N2 by humans now exceeds the rate of natural terrestrial biological fixation. Emissions of N associated with industrial and agricultural activities are causing widespread environmental changes, including acid precipitation, as we\u2019ll see in Concept 25.3. Three major processes account for these anthropogenic effects. The first is the manufacture of agricultural fertilizers by the Haber\u2013Bosch process, described in Concept 22.1. Approximately 80% of the N in human tissues is derived from fixation of N2 by this process. Second, growing N-fixing crops such as soybeans, alfalfa, and peas has increased biological N2 fixation. Flooding of agricultural fields for other crops, such as rice, has increased N2 fixation by cyanobacteria. Finally, anthropogenic emissions of certain gaseous forms of nitrogen have greatly increased the concentrations of these compounds in the atmosphere. \u2013 Unlike N2, these compounds, which include oxygenated nitrogen compounds (NO, NO2, HNO3, and NO3 , collectively referred to as NO , and N O), ammonia (NH ), and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), can undergo x2 3 chemical reactions in the atmosphere and are potentially available for biological uptake. Fossil fuel combustion is the primary source of these nitrogenous gas emissions.", "Other contributors include biomass burning associated with deforestation, denitrification and volatilization (conversion to gaseous form) of fertilizers, and emissions from livestock feedlots and human sewage treatment plants. All of these reactive forms of N are returned to terrestrial and marine ecosystems through the process of atmospheric deposition (described in Concept 22.1). FIGURE 25.8 Changes in Anthropogenic Fluxes in the Global Nitrogen Cycle Increases in fertilizer production through the Haber\u2013Bosch process, the growing of nitrogen-fixing crops, and combustion of fossil fuels have all contributed to the tremendous increase in biologically available (reactive) N. (After J. N. Galloway et al. 2004. Biogeochemistry 70: 153\u2013226.) The global phosphorus cycle is dominated by geochemical fluxes Phosphorus (P) limits primary production in some terrestrial ecosystems\u2014particularly those with old, well-weathered soils, such as tropical lowland forests\u2014and in many freshwater and some marine ecosystems. Biologically available phosphorus is derived from the weathering of certain minerals, and decomposition. Phosphorus is added to crops as a fertilizer globally. Phosphorus availability can also control the rate of biological N2 fixation because that process has a high metabolic demand for P. Consequently, the C, N, and P cycles are linked to one another through photosynthesis and NPP, decomposition, and N2 fixation. Unlike C and N, P has essentially no atmospheric pool, with the exception of dust (FIGURE 25.9). Gaseous forms of P are extremely rare. The largest pools of P are in terrestrial soils and marine sediments. The largest fluxes of P occur in internal ecosystem cycles, which form a tight recycling loop between biological uptake by plants and microorganisms and release by decomposition. Typically, very little of the P cycling through terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is lost. In terrestrial ecosystems, most P loss is associated with the process of occlusion (described in Concept 22.3). Movement of P from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems occurs primarily through erosion and movement of particulate organic matter\u2014mainly from plants\u2014into streams. Much of the P transported from terrestrial to marine ecosystems (about 90%) is lost when it is deposited in deep ocean sediments. Ultimately, P in sediments in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems is cycled again in association with tectonic uplift and weathering of rocks, which occurs on a scale of hundreds of millions of years. FIGURE 25.9 The Global Phosphorus Cycle Boxes represent major pools of P, measured in teragrams (Tg); arrows represent major fluxes of P, measured in teragrams per year. The major anthropogenic flux (P fertilization of crops) is shown in orange. (After W. H. Schlesinger. 1991, 2013. Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change, 1st and 3rd eds. Academic Press: Cambridge, MA; F. S. Chapin et al. 2002. Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology. Springer-Verlag: New York. Data from various sources cited within.) Anthropogenic effects on the global P cycle are associated with use of agricultural fertilizers, discharges of sewage and industrial wastes, and increases in terrestrial surface erosion. Phosphorus fertilizers are usually derived from the mining of uplifted ancient marine sediments. Phosphorus from soils and marine sediments is a nonrenewable resource, subject to depletion. Mining releases four times more P annually than is liberated through natural weathering of rock. Globally, P is applied as fertilizer in an amount equivalent to approximately 20% of the P that cycles naturally through terrestrial ecosystems (Schlesinger and Bernhart 2013). While occlusion of P in the soil minimizes the flux of anthropogenic P from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems, that flux still has great potential for negative environmental effects. One such effect is eutrophication in lakes, as described in Concept 22.4. Biological and geochemical fluxes both determine the global sulfur cycle Sulfur (S) is a constituent of some amino acids, but it is rarely, if ever, in short supply for organismal growth. Sulfur plays important roles in atmospheric chemistry. As with the C, N, and P cycles, anthropogenic changes to the global S cycle have important negative environmental consequences, primarily through the generation of acid precipitation. The major global pools of S are in rocks, sediments, and the ocean, which contains a large pool of dissolved sulfate (SO42\u2013) (FIGURE 25.10). Fluxes of S among these global pools can occur in gaseous, dissolved, or solid forms. Weathering of S-containing minerals, mainly sedimentary pyrite, releases soluble forms of S that may enter the atmosphere or oceans. There is a net movement of S from the terrestrial pool to the oceanic pool, associated with transport in rivers and in atmospheric dust. Volcanic eruptions emit substantial amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO ) into the atmosphere.", "Because they are episodic events, however, 2 the amount of S emitted to the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions, on a time scale of centuries, is approximately the same as the amount blown into the atmosphere as dust from bare soils. Oceans release S to the atmosphere as small particles of windborne ocean spray and as gaseous emissions associated with microbial activity. Bacteria and archaea in anaerobic soils also emit S-containing gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H S). Most gaseous S compounds in the atmosphere undergo oxidation to SO 2\u2013 and H SO 2 424 (sulfuric acid), which are removed relatively quickly by precipitation. FIGURE 25.10 The Global Sulfur Cycle Boxes represent major pools of S, measured in teragrams (Tg). Arrows represent major fluxes of S, measured in teragrams per year; anthropogenic fluxes are shown in orange. (After W. H. Schlesinger. 1991, 2013. Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change, 1st and 3rd eds. Academic Press: Cambridge, MA; F. S. Chapin et al. 2002. Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology. Springer-Verlag: New York. Data from various sources cited within.) Anthropogenic emissions of S to the atmosphere, which include gaseous and particulate forms (e.g., dust, aerosols), have quadrupled since the Industrial Revolution. Most of these emissions are associated with the burning of S-containing coal and oil and the smelting of metal-containing ores. What goes up must come down in the form of atmospheric deposition, usually within the same region from which it was emitted, but not always. Long-distance transport of fine dust occurs episodically in association with droughts and major wind events, as described in this chapter\u2019s Case Study. Increases in erosion associated with clearing of vegetation and overgrazing have contributed to anthropogenic input of S into the atmosphere as dust. Transport of S in rivers has doubled over the past 200 years (Schlesinger and Bernhart 2013). Human activities have resulted in changes in all four of the global biogeochemical cycles we have just described, and as we have noted, some of those changes have had important environmental effects. Let\u2019s turn our attention to those effects next. Self-Assessment 25.1 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 25.2 Earth is warming because of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 25.2.1 Relate the observed increase in global temperature over the past century to the potential causes for the change in climate. 25.2.2 Describe the expected and observed responses of organisms\u2019 geographic distributions resulting from climate change. 25.2.3 Evaluate why current climate\u2013community distribution relationships may not adequately predict the future composition of communities under climate change. 25.2.4 Determine the factors that may increase the susceptibility of species to extinction due to climate change. Global Climate Change Throughout this book, we have emphasized the role that climate plays in ecological processes, including the distributions and physiological performance of organisms, the rates of resource supply, and the outcomes of biological interactions such as competition. Thus, changes in climate\u2014particularly changes in the frequency of extreme events such as extensive droughts, violent storms, or extreme high and low temperatures\u2014have profound effects on ecological patterns and processes. Because they are disturbances that result in significant mortality within populations, these extreme events are often critical in determining the geographic ranges of species. As we learned in Concept 2.1, weather is the current state of the atmosphere around us at any given time. Climate is the long-term description of weather, including both average conditions and the full range of variation. Climate variation occurs at a multitude of time scales, from the daily changes associated with daytime solar heating and nighttime cooling, to seasonal changes associated with the tilt of Earth\u2019s axis, to decadal changes associated with interactions between ocean currents and the atmosphere (such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, described in Case Study Revisited in Chapter 2). Climate change, on the other hand, refers to directional change in climate. Evidence of climate change is substantial Climate change is distinguished from climate variation by the presence of significant directional trends lasting at least three decades. Based on analyses of records from numerous climate-monitoring stations, atmospheric scientists have determined that Earth is currently experiencing significant climate change (IPCC 2013) (FIGURE 25.11A). Between 1880 and 2018, the average annual global surface temperature increased 0.97\u00b0C \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F \u00b1 0.4\u00b0F), with the greatest change occurring in the past 50 years.", "This rapid rise in global temperature is unprecedented in the past 10,000 years, although temperature changes at similar rates may have occurred at the onset and end of some glacial cycles (see Figure 25.6). The first decade of the twenty-first century was the warmest decade of the previous 1,000 years, and 2016 was the warmest year since recordkeeping started. In association with this warming trend, there has been a widespread retreat of mountain glaciers, thinning of the polar ice caps and thawing of permafrost, and a rate of sea level rise that is greater than any estimated from the past 3,000 years (Kopp et al. 2016), posing a serious threat to coastal communities. FIGURE 25.11 Changes in Global Temperature and Precipitation (A) Average annual global temperature anomalies (relative to the average global temperature for 1961\u20131990) between 1880 and 2019, averaged from numerous air and sea surface temperature records and normalized to sea level. (B) Regional trends in average annual temperatures for 1901\u20132012. (C) Trends in global precipitation from 1951 to 2010. (A, data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, Climate at a Glance: Global Time Series. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/; B,C from IPCC. 2013. Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.) This warming trend has been heterogeneous across the globe, with most regions warming, others not changing significantly, and some even cooling (FIGURE 25.11B). The warming trend has been greatest in the middle to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Changes in terrestrial precipitation have also occurred, with more precipitation in portions of the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and drier weather in the subtropics and tropics (FIGURE 25.11C). There has also been a tendency toward greater frequencies of some extreme weather events, such as hurricanes (including massive storms such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012) that are potentially fueled by warmer sea temperatures, droughts, and heat waves (IPCC 2013). What are the causes of the observed climate change? As we saw in Chapter 2, climate change may result from changes in the amount of solar radiation absorbed by Earth\u2019s surface or in the amount of absorption and reradiation of infrared radiation by gases in the atmosphere. Changes in absorption of solar radiation may be associated with variation in the amount of radiation emitted by the sun, in Earth\u2019s position relative to the sun, or in the reflection of solar radiation by clouds or surfaces with high reflectivity (albedo), such as snow and ice. The warming of Earth by atmospheric absorption and reradiation of infrared radiation emitted by Earth\u2019s surface is known as the greenhouse effect (see Figure 2.4). This phenomenon is associated with radiatively active greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily water vapor, CO2, CH4, and N2O. The effectiveness of these gases in absorbing radiation depends on their concentrations in the atmosphere as well as their chemical properties. Water vapor contributes the most to the greenhouse effect, but its atmospheric concentration varies greatly from region to region, and changes in its average concentration have been small. Of the remaining greenhouse gases, which tend to be more evenly distributed in the atmosphere, CO2 contributes the most to greenhouse warming, followed by CH4 (which has about 30% of the effect of atmospheric CO , although on a per molecule basis it is 30 times more effective than CO ) and N O (which 2 22 has about 10% of the effect of CO2, but is around 280 times more effective than CO2 on a per molecule basis). As we saw in our discussion of the global biogeochemical cycles of C and N, atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O are increasing substantially, primarily as a result of fossil fuel combustion and land use change (FIGURE 25.12). Are increases in anthropogenic emissions of these greenhouse gases responsible for global climate change? To evaluate the underlying causes of climate change, its potential effect on ecological and socioeconomic systems, and our options for limiting climate change associated with human activities, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. The IPCC convenes panels of experts in atmospheric and climate science to evaluate trends in climate and the probable causes for any changes observed. These experts use a combination of sophisticated modeling and analysis of data from the scientific literature to evaluate potential underlying causes of observed climate change, as well as to predict future climate change scenarios.", "The IPCC releases assessment reports periodically to enhance the understanding of climate change among scientists, policymakers, and the general public. In recognition of their efforts to spread \u201cknowledge about man-made climate change,\u201d the IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. FIGURE 25.12 Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases (A) Long-term trends in the concentrations of CO , CH , and N O. Concentrations prior to 1958 were determined from ice cores; concentrations since 1958 have been 24 2 measured directly. (B) Contributions of greenhouse gases to warming (radiative forcing), showing that CO is the main 2 contributor to the temporal change. (A after P. Forster et al. 2007. In Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, S. Solomon et al. [Eds.], pp. 129\u2013234. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge; B from GlobalChange.gov.) In its third assessment report, released in 2001, the IPCC concluded that the majority of the observed global warming is attributable to human activities (FIGURE 25.13). While this conclusion is still occasionally debated in the political arena, it is backed by the majority of the world\u2019s leading atmospheric scientists. The certainty of an anthropogenic cause of climate change has increased with each new IPCC report, with the 2013 report stating, \u201cIt is extremely likely (95%\u2013100% probability) that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\u201d Paul Crutzen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on stratospheric ozone loss, has suggested that we have entered a new geologic period, which he calls the Anthropocene epoch (anthropo, \u201chuman\u201d; cene, \u201crecent\u201d; epoch, \u201cgeologic age\u201d) to indicate the extensive impact of humans on our environment, particularly the climate system (Crutzen and Stoermer 2000). FIGURE 25.13 Contributors to Global Temperature Change IPCC scientists compared observed global temperature changes between 1910 and 2010 with the results of computer models. The models predicted the temperature changes that would have been expected in that period due to natural climatological factors only, including variation in solar radiation and in atmospheric concentrations of aerosols from volcanic eruptions, and due to both natural and anthropogenic factors, including emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. These comparisons suggest that anthropogenic factors have played a large role in the observed warming. (After IPCC. 2013. Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.) Will the climate continue to grow warmer? The IPCC\u2019s models project an additional increase in average global temperature of 1.1\u00b0C\u20134.8\u00b0C over the twenty-first century (IPCC 2013). The range of variation in this estimate is associated with uncertainties about future rates of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and about the behavior of the terrestrial\u2013atmospheric\u2013oceanic system. Model simulations incorporating different economic development scenarios have predicted vastly different future rates of emissions. Aerosols in the atmosphere represent another source of uncertainty in the models\u2019 predictions. Aerosols, which reflect solar radiation, have a cooling effect on global temperatures; for example, emissions of large amounts of aerosols associated with major volcanic eruptions have had notable cooling effects at a global scale, as described in WEB EXTENSION 25.1. While some aerosols have been increasing in the atmosphere (e.g., dust, in association with land use change and desertification), others have been decreasing (e.g., SO42\u2013, due to decreasing anthropogenic SO2 emissions). Water in the atmosphere may play contradictory roles: clouds may have a cooling effect, while water vapor, which may increase because of greater evapotranspiration, may increase greenhouse warming. Despite these uncertainties in predicting the magnitude of future climate warming, there is a high probability that global temperatures will continue to rise. Even if anthropogenic CO2 emissions were halted completely, global temperatures would likely continue to rise for decades or even centuries due to the reduced capacity of the ocean to absorb heat (Fricher et al. 2014). Ecological responses to climate change are occurring As noted earlier, global warming of 0.97\u00b0C has occurred since 1880. Several physical environmental changes have occurred over the same period, including the retreat of glaciers, increased melting of sea ice, and a rise in sea level. Have biological systems also responded to this warming? Numerous reports of biological changes are consistent with recent global warming (Parmesan 2006; Walther 2010). These changes include earlier migration of birds, local extinction of amphibian and reptile populations, bleaching of coral reefs, fish die-offs in lakes, and earlier spring greening of vegetation. Although they are more difficult to link directly to climate change, there have been changes in the geographic ranges of species that are consistent with warming.", "For example, Georg Grabherr and colleagues studied the vascular plant communities found on summits of mountains in the European Alps. They compared the current species richnesses of those communities with records dating back to the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (Grabherr et al. 1994). They found a consistent trend of increasing species richness resulting from the upward movement of species from lower elevations onto the summits (FIGURE 25.14). Similarly, Camille Parmesan and colleagues recorded a northward shift in the ranges of European nonmigratory butterfly species (Parmesan et al. 1999). Of the 35 species examined, 63% had shifted their ranges northward, while only 3% had shifted their ranges southward. More than half of the plant and animal species that have been investigated have shown geographic range shifts that are consistent with climate change (Parmesan and Yohe 2003). FIGURE 25.14 Plants Are Moving Up the Alps Grabherr and colleagues compared historical records of vascular plant species richness on the summits of mountains in the European Alps with censuses taken in the early 1990s. The blue curve indicates the relationship between species richness and summit elevation in the historical records, while the red curve indicates the present relationship. (After V. H. Grabherr et al. 1994. BioScience 53: 469\u2013480.) Climate change may be causing populations of some species to go extinct. Barry Sinervo and colleagues (2010) found that 12% of Mexico\u2019s Sceloporus lizard populations had gone extinct between 1975 and 2009. Recall from Concept 23.2 that population extinctions are potentially the initial steps toward the extinction of a species. The extinctions of the lizard populations corresponded more closely to increases in temperature than to losses of habitat. Surprisingly, warming in the spring was better correlated with the extinctions than extreme temperatures during the summer. Sinervo and colleagues concluded that the warmer spring temperatures limited the lizards\u2019 foraging time during the breeding season. Ectothermic lizards must move into the shade and remain there to avoid overheating when temperatures become too warm (see Concept 4.2), and during that time they cannot seek out food. The observation that the probability of extinction was greatest at low-elevation and low-latitude sites, where the animals were most likely to be at the limits of their thermal tolerance, was consistent with this explanation. Sinervo and colleagues also used a model of lizard thermal physiology to evaluate current and future worldwide effects of climate change on lizard populations. They estimated that climate change has already resulted in extinction of 4% of lizard populations worldwide. Using projections of future climate change, they suggested that 39% of the world\u2019s lizard populations, and 20% of its lizard species, may go extinct by 2050. Migratory animals may also be adversely affected by climate change (Root et al. 2003). For example, migrating marine species, including whales and fish, may need to make longer journeys because of substantial changes in the distributions of their prey species as ocean temperatures warm. Some migratory bird species that breed in England and North America have been arriving at nest sites as much as 3 weeks earlier than they did 30 years ago because of warmer spring temperatures and faster snowmelt. However, plants and invertebrate prey species have responded faster to climate change than the migrating birds, resulting in a mismatch between bird arrival and prey availability. On the other hand, longer breeding seasons may increase the number of offspring produced by some bird species, particularly in high-latitude ecosystems. Changes in community composition may also be indicators of climate change. These effects may be particularly apparent in some sessile marine species. Concept 3.3 and 17.1 have described the effects of rising water temperatures on corals and the resulting changes in coral reef communities. Changes in the abundances of marine foraminiferans\u2014a type of zooplankton\u2014also reflect global climate trends during the past century (Field et al. 2006). Foraminiferan species have characteristic shells that allow them to be identified in marine sediments. Cores collected from benthic sediments can be examined to determine changes in the species composition of foraminiferans over time. Because the environmental tolerances of different species are known, these changes provide a means of reconstructing marine environments of the past. Following the mid-1970s, an increase in tropical and subtropical foraminiferan species, and a decrease in temperate and polar species, occurred in the eastern North Pacific Ocean, indicating a warming of ocean waters there. Climate change is impacting forest composition in western North America through changes in the frequency and intensity of bark beetle attacks (Anderegg et al. 2015) and forest fires.", "Longer frost-free seasons are allowing mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in some regions to transition from completing one life cycle per year to two, greatly enhancing their population growth and potential outbreaks (Mitton and Ferrenberg 2012). In addition, the beetles are found at higher altitudes and latitudes than in the past, where they are attacking trees lacking defenses to the beetles. As a result of climate change effects on weather and fuel moisture content, forest fires have doubled since 1984 (Abatzoglou and Williams 2016). Climate change will continue to enhance forest fires until fuels become the limiting factor for their occurrence. Changes in global NPP also indicate biological responses to climate change. Ramakrishna Nemani and colleagues used remote sensing data to examine global patterns of NPP over an 18-year period (1982\u20131999) (Nemani et al. 2003). They found that global NPP increased 6% during the study period, or 0.3% per year (FIGURE 25.15). Tropical ecosystems exhibited the largest increase in NPP, which was associated with increases in solar radiation due to less cloud cover in the tropics during the study period. During the first decade of the twenty-first century, however, the trend toward increasing NPP was reversed. The decrease in global NPP during this decade was attributed to major droughts, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere (Zhao and Running 2010). FIGURE 25.15 Changes in Terrestrial NPP Nemani and colleagues calculated changes in net primary production (NPP) between 1982 and 1999, expressed here as percentage change per year. The trend toward increased NPP in tropical regions of South America shown here was reversed in the first decade of the twenty-first century due to prolonged drought. (From R. R. Nemani et al. 2003. Science 300: 1560\u20131563.) There has been a notable decrease in net ecosystem exchange (see Concept 20.1) at high northern latitudes during the past 30 years, which has coincided with some areas of the Arctic switching from a net uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere (acting as a sink) to a net export of CO2 (acting as a source) (Oechel et al. 1993). Large amounts of C are stored in the soils of boreal and tundra ecosystems as a result of low-temperature constraints on decomposition and the long-term buildup of carbon since the last glacial maximum. Warming during the twentieth century, however, increased the rate of CO2 export from Arctic soils, such that losses now exceed gains from NPP. Warming of these high-latitude terrestrial ecosystems could provide a positive feedback to climate change by enhancing their emissions of CO2 and CH4. The rates of CO2 loss from Arctic ecosystems have decreased since the early 1990s, possibly due to changes in rates of nutrient cycling and physiological and compositional changes in the plants (Oechel et al. 2000). However, greater loss of CO2 due to heterotrophic consumption of soil organic matter during winter may offset the gains from greater summer productivity (Webb et al. 2016). Climate change will continue to have ecological consequences What will the projected 1.1\u00b0C\u20134.8\u00b0C change in average global temperature over the next 80 years mean for biological communities? We can get a sense of what such a temperature change might mean by comparing it with the climate variation associated with elevation in mountains. A median value for the projected temperature change (2.9\u00b0C) would correspond to a 500-m (1,600-foot) shift in elevation. In the Rocky Mountains, this change in climate would correspond approximately to a full change in vegetation zone, from subalpine forest (dominated by spruce and fir) to montane forest (dominated by ponderosa pine; see Interactive Figure 3.11). Thus, if we assume perfect tracking of climate change by the current vegetation, climate change during the twenty-first century would result in an elevational shift in vegetation zones of 200 to 860 m. Similar predictions for latitudinal climate shifts suggest movement of biological communities 500 to 1,000 km toward the poles. Climate\u2013biome correlations, such as those described in Concept 3.1 and 4.1, are useful as a demonstration of what could happen with climate change, but it would be na\u00efve to use them to predict what will actually happen to biological communities. We know that biological composition is influenced by a multitude of factors, including climate\u2014particularly climate extremes\u2014as well as species interactions, the dynamics of succession, dispersal ability, and barriers to dispersal (as described in Unit 5).", "Because the ongoing climate change will continue to be rapid relative to the climate changes that have shaped current biological communities, it is unlikely that the same assemblages of organisms will form the communities of the future. Paleoecological records reinforce the suggestion that novel communities may emerge with climate change by showing that some plant communities of the past were quite different from modern plant communities. Jonathan Overpeck and colleagues used pollen records to reconstruct large-scale vegetation changes since the most recent glacial maximum in eastern North America (18,000 years ago) (Overpeck et al. 1992). They found not only that community types had made latitudinal shifts as the climate warmed, but also that community types without modern analogs existed under climate regimes that were unique and no longer present (FIGURE 25.16). Overpeck and his colleagues concluded that future vegetation assemblages would follow similar trends, given the predicted rapid rate of global warming and the potential for the emergence of unique climate patterns with no current analogs. FIGURE 25.16 Past Changes in Plant Communities Vegetation types in eastern North America have changed since the last glacial maximum, 18,000 years ago (ka = thousand years ago). Vegetation composition was determined from pollen preserved in sediments. (From J. T. Overpeck et al. 1992. Geology 20: 1071\u20131074.) What factors may have led to the development of vegetation types different from those found in North America today following retreat of the continental glacier? The rate of climate change will require rapid evolutionary change or the ability to disperse to new environments. Climate Change Connection 6.1 and WEB EXTENSION 6.2 present evidence that organisms with rapid life cycles have undergone evolutionary change in response to climate change. For more long-lived species, evolutionary responses are less likely, and thus for those species dispersal may be the only way to avoid extinction. Organisms\u2019 dispersal abilities, and barriers to their dispersal associated with anthropogenic habitat fragmentation, will be important constraints on their responses to climate change. Plant dispersal rates are, on average, much slower than the predicted rate of climate change. In order to track the projected change in climate over the twenty-first century, plant species populations will need to move 5 to 10 km per year. Plant species that have animal-dispersed seeds, and which can establish viable populations and grow to reproductive maturity in a relatively short time, may be able to disperse rapidly enough to keep pace with climate change. However, this kind of dispersal strategy is common mainly in ruderal (weedy) herbaceous plants. Shrubs and trees have much slower rates of dispersal; as a result, there may be significant time lags in their response to climate change. For most animals, mobility is not a problem, but their habitat and food requirements are intimately associated with the presence of specific vegetation types. In addition, barriers to dispersal may prevent organisms of all kinds from migrating in response to climate change. Dams, for example, may prevent fish from moving to water with more suitable temperatures. Fragmentation of habitat by human development may pose significant barriers to dispersal for some species (see Concept 24.2). Without habitat corridors through which they can disperse, species face a greater probability of local extinction in the face of climate change. Projections of the risk of extinction due to climate change, based on multiple published studies, indicate as many as 17% of Earth\u2019s species could be lost (Urban 2015). In addition to affecting the geographic ranges of species, climate change will affect ecosystem processes, such as NPP, decomposition, and nutrient cycling and retention. Both photosynthesis and respiration are sensitive to temperature, and because their balance determines NPP, the direct effects of climate warming on NPP may be relatively minor. As indicated in Concept 20.2, however, variation in NPP is related to water and nutrient availability and vegetation type, all of which may be affected by climate change. Changes in precipitation patterns and evapotranspiration rates resulting from climate change may strongly influence both water and nutrient availability. Because of the heterogeneity of climate change, and of the resulting changes in vegetation types, both increases and decreases in NPP may occur. Thus, the effect of climate change on NPP will probably not be uniform. The effect of warming on nutrient supplies will be most pronounced in mid- to high-latitude terrestrial ecosystems, where low temperatures constrain rates of nutrient cycling and soils have large pools of nutrients. As a result, climate change may lead to increases in NPP in some temperate forest ecosystems.", "Biological indicators of global climate change are diverse, and they are increasing over time. Experiments, modeling, and comparisons with historical and paleoecological records provide clues to how Earth\u2019s biota will respond to climate change. Substantial uncertainties in predicting the effects of climate change still exist, however, many of which are associated with other environmental changes that are occurring at the same time. In the next section, we\u2019ll look at two such anthropogenic changes that are having profound effects on ecosystems: emissions of sulfur and nitrogen into the atmosphere. Self-Assessment 25.2 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 25.3 Anthropogenic emissions of sulfur and nitrogen cause acid deposition, alter soil chemistry, and affect the health of ecosystems. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 25.3.1 Describe the causes of acid deposition and the mechanisms by which it affects ecosystems. 25.3.2 Assess how atmospheric nitrogen deposition can be both beneficial and detrimental to organismal and community function. Acid and Nitrogen Deposition The negative effects of air pollution have been known since at least the time of the ancient Greeks, when laws protected the quality of air, as indicated by its odor (Jacobson 2002). Since the Industrial Revolution, air pollution has mainly been associated with urban industrial centers, power plants, and oil and gas refineries. These stationary sources of atmospheric pollutants mainly affect the areas immediately adjacent to them and are usually considered regional rather than global problems. During the twentieth century, however, effective emissions dispersal strategies (e.g., tall smokestacks), widespread industrial development, and greater emissions of pollutants from mobile sources, such as automobiles, have increased the spatial extent of air pollution tremendously. Fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, and urban and suburban development have influenced fluxes of N and S to an even greater degree than fluxes of C. Emissions of N and S into the atmosphere have resulted in two related environmental issues: acid precipitation and N deposition. Emissions of N and S are only a subset of the multiple types of air pollution, but they are among the most far-reaching. Sites affected by acid precipitation and N deposition now include national parks and wilderness areas (FIGURE 25.17). FIGURE 25.17 Air Quality Monitoring in the Sierra National Forest Air samples are collected regularly to monitor temporal changes in air chemistry and particulates. Air quality in national parks and wilderness areas, such as the Sierra National Forest, has been compromised by emissions of pollutants, including NO and sulfate aerosols. These x pollutants not only lower visibility, but also pose a health hazard to the organisms that come into contact with them, including humans. Acid precipitation causes nutrient imbalances and aluminum toxicity The detrimental effects of acidic air pollution on nearby vegetation, buildings, and human health have been known for several centuries, although their mechanisms were not well understood. In England during the mid-nineteenth century, industrial processes that released acidic compounds into the atmosphere, primarily hydrochloric acid, were implicated as a major source of harmful pollution (Jacobson 2002). Legislation was enacted in 1863 to reduce these acidic emissions. Despite such legislation, acid precipitation continued to be a problem throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in large industrialized urban centers. During the 1960s, awareness of the widespread effects of acid precipitation, including its effects on nearby \u201cpristine\u201d ecosystems and agriculture, increased. In particular, damage to forests and mortality among aquatic organisms in northern Europe, parts of Asia, and northeastern North America prompted greater attention to acid precipitation. Sulfuric acid (H SO ) and nitric acid (HNO ) are the main acidic compounds found in the atmosphere. 24 3 As we saw in Concept 25.1, sulfuric acid forms in the atmosphere from the oxidation of gaseous sulfur compounds. Likewise, nitric acid originates from the oxidation of other NO compounds. Sulfuric and nitric x acids can dissolve in water vapor and fall to the ground with precipitation (wet deposition). Naturally occurring precipitation has a slightly acidic pH of 5.0 to 5.6 due to the natural dissolution of CO2 and formation of carbonic acid. Acid precipitation has a pH range from 5.0 to 2.0. Acidic compounds may also be deposited on Earth\u2019s surface when they form aerosols too large to be suspended or when they attach to the surfaces of dust particles (dry deposition). Research has focused on determining the causes of the environmental degradation associated with acid precipitation, including increased mortality of plants and amphibians and decreased diversity. Initially, the acidity was considered the main culprit.", "In most cases, however, rainfall and surface waters did not have a low enough pH to cause the observed biological responses. An exception is found in regions at high latitudes or high elevations that develop a seasonal snowpack. During winter, acidic compounds accumulate in the snow. When temperatures increase in spring, water percolates through the snowpack, leaching out all the accumulated soluble compounds. The first meltwater of spring is therefore more acidic than the precipitation that fell during winter. This acid pulse has the potential to be toxic to sensitive organisms in soils and streams, including microorganisms, invertebrates, amphibians, and fish. The vulnerability of organisms in soils, streams, and lakes to inputs of acid precipitation is determined by the ability of their chemical environment to counteract the acidity, known as its acid neutralizing capacity. The acid neutralizing capacity of soils and water is usually associated with their concentrations of base 2+2+ + cations, including Ca , Mg , and K . Soils derived from parent material with high concentrations of these cations, such as limestone, are better able to neutralize acid precipitation than those derived from more acidic parent material, such as granite. The detrimental effects of acid precipitation on plants and aquatic organisms are associated with biogeochemical reactions in the soil that decrease nutrient supplies and increase concentrations of toxic + 2+2+ + metals. As H percolates through the soil, it replaces Ca , Mg , and K at cation exchange sites on the surfaces of clay particles (see the description of cation exchange in Concept 22.1). These cations are released into the soil solution and can then leach out of the rooting zone of plants. The loss of these base cations leads to a decrease in soil pH, or soil acidification. Deficiencies in Ca and Mg, sometimes in combination with other stresses, were associated with large-scale mortality of trees in European forests during the 1970s and 1980s (FIGURE 25.18). In advanced stages of soil acidification, the metal cations aluminum (Al3+) and manganese (Mn3+) are released into the soil from cation exchange sites. Aluminum and manganese are toxic to plant roots, soil invertebrates, and aquatic organisms, including fish. The combination of increasing acidity in precipitation and increasing aluminum concentrations in terrestrial runoff has been linked to fish die-offs in lakes and streams in northern Europe and eastern North America. FIGURE 25.18 Air Pollution Has Damaged European Forests The high tree mortality seen in this spruce forest in the Jizera Mountains, Czech Republic, is associated with acid precipitation and the resulting nutrient imbalance, particularly losses of base cations. Extensive forest decline occurred in Germany and northern Czechoslovakia (now part of the Czech Republic) in the 1970s and 1980s. The realization that acid precipitation was negatively affecting the biota of forest and lake ecosystems prompted enhanced monitoring of atmospheric deposition and, eventually, laws to limit acidic emissions. Restrictions on emissions of S in North America and Europe have resulted in significant reductions in the acidity of precipitation (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 25.19). Forests are recovering from the effects of acid precipitation in central Europe, thanks to legislation limiting S emissions as well as decreased industrial activity in the former Soviet Union. Stream chemistry measurements also reflect the reduced acidity of precipitation and the recovery of aquatic ecosystems. Acid precipitation remains a problem, however, in some countries that have experienced rapid industrial development, such as China and India, though steps are being taken to reduce the emissions of acidic compounds. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 25.19 Decreases in Acid Precipitation The pH of precipitation in different parts of the United States as measured in (A) 1990 and (B) 2017, estimated based on measurements made at sampling points indicated by the dots. (From National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network.) Nitrogen deposition: Too much of a good thing can be bad As we have seen, anthropogenic emissions of reactive nitrogen into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning and agricultural activities have greatly altered global N cycles. Reactive N can fall back to Earth (via dry and wet deposition) after being transported away from the emission source in the atmosphere. Globally, anthropogenic emissions and deposition of reactive N compounds are more than three times greater now than they were in 1860 (Galloway et al. 2004, 2008) (INTERACTIVE FIGURE 25.20). Emissions and deposition of reactive N are expected to double between 2000 and 2050 as industrial development increases to keep pace with the human population.", "Greater deposition of N will increase the supply of N for biological activity, but this abundance will come with an environmental cost. INTERACTIVE FIGURE 25.20 Historical and Projected Changes in Nitrogen Deposition (A) Estimated rates of deposition of inorganic N compounds (NH + and NO \u2013) in 1860. (B) Measured rates for the 43 early 1990s. (C) Projected rates for 2050. (From J. N. Galloway et al. 2004. Biogeochemistry 70: 153\u2013226.) The role of N as a determinant of rates of primary production was described in Concept 20.2. Nitrogen plays an important role in photosynthesis, which forms the base of the food webs that provide energy to all other organisms. Considerable benefit to humanity has accrued from the manufacture of N fertilizers and their widespread application to crops since the early twentieth century. We might expect, therefore, that an increased supply of N would facilitate plant growth and greater overall production in a N-limited ecosystem. Primary production has indeed increased in some ecosystems as a result of increased N deposition (e.g., forests in Scandinavia; Binkley and Hberg 1997). Nitrogen deposition may be partly responsible for the greater uptake of atmospheric CO2 by terrestrial ecosystems observed in the Northern Hemisphere (Thomas et al. 2010). Although primary production is increasing in some ecosystems because of N deposition, there is also strong evidence that N deposition is associated with environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, decreases in primary production, and acidification of soils and surface waters. While N limits primary production in many terrestrial ecosystems, the capacity of vegetation, soils, and soil microbes to take up greater N inputs can be exceeded. This condition, known as nitrogen saturation, has a number of effects on + ecosystems (Aber et al. 1998) (FIGURE 25.21). Greater concentrations of inorganic N compounds (NH4 \u2013 and NO3 ) in the soil lead to enhanced rates of microbial processes (nitrification and denitrification) that \u2013 release N2O, a potent greenhouse gas. Nitrate (NO3 ) is easily leached from soils and can move into \u2013 groundwater, eventually entering aquatic ecosystems. When NO3 moves through the soil, it carries cations, + 2+ 2+ including K , Ca , and Mg , in solution to maintain a charge balance. As in the case of acid precipitation, losses of these cations can lead to nutrient deficiencies and eventually to acidification of soils. Very high \u2013 concentrations of NO3 in surface waters and ground water near agricultural areas has been linked to \u201cblue baby\u201d syndrome, a dangerous condition in which an infant\u2019s ability to take up oxygen is compromised. FIGURE 25.21 Effects of Nitrogen Saturation Aber and colleagues devised a conceptual model of the response of forest ecosystems to increasing inputs of inorganic N resulting in nitrogen saturation. (After J. Aber et al. 1998. BioScience 48: 921\u2013934.) \u2013 Most aquatic ecosystems are limited by P, so the biological uptake of anthropogenic NO3 that enters them from terrestrial ecosystems may be relatively small (although there is greater biological processing of N than expected; see Figure 22.15). Riverine transport of N to nearshore marine ecosystems has increased as inputs of N fertilizer have increased (Howarth et al. 1996). Primary production in estuarine and marsh communities is often limited by N, and thus the influx of N from terrestrial sources into these ecosystems has resulted in eutrophication (described in Concept 22.4). Eutrophication results in heavy algal growth, which can create hypoxic conditions in the bottom waters of nearshore ecosystems. The resulting high inputs of organic matter lead to high rates of decomposition by microorganisms, which consume most of the available oxygen. The resulting hypoxic conditions are lethal for most marine life, including fish. Hypoxic conditions may occur over large areas, creating \u201cdead zones.\u201d Dead zones of up to 18,000 km2 form annually in the Gulf of Mexico, and over 400 dead zones form in locations around the world, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and Chesapeake Bay. In nutrient-poor ecosystems, many plants have adaptations that lower their nutrient requirements, which also lower their capacity to take up additional inputs of N. As a result, N inputs may cause faster-growing species to outcompete the species adapted to low-nutrient conditions. Acidification and increases in soluble aluminum may lead to declines in intolerant species. Eventually, this increased competition and toxicity can lead to lower diversity and alteration of community composition. In the Netherlands, species-rich heath communities adapted to low-nutrient conditions have been replaced by species-poor grassland communities as a result of very high rates of N deposition (Berendse et al. 1993).", "In Great Britain, Carly Stevens and colleagues surveyed grassland communities across the country with a range of N deposition rates (FIGURE 25.22A). At 68 sites, they measured the mean plant species richness in multiple study plots, along with several environmental variables, to try to explain the variation in plant diversity among the sites. The environmental variables included nine soil chemical factors, nine physical environmental variables, grazing intensity, and the presence or absence of grazing enclosures (Stevens et al. 2004). Of the 20 possible factors that may have influenced differences in species richness among the study sites, the amount of N deposition explained the greatest amount of variation (55%): higher inputs of N were associated with lower species richness (FIGURE 25.22B). The results of this study are supported by a similar large-scale study in the United States that found at least 25% of the sites surveyed had reduced species richness in association with greater N deposition (Simkin et al. 2016). In general, rare species appear to be most at risk for loss from plant communities (Suding et al. 2005). High rates of N deposition also facilitate the successful spread of some invasive plant species at the expense of native species (Dukes and Mooney 1999). FIGURE 25.22 Nitrogen Deposition Lowers Species Diversity (A) Inorganic N deposition in Great Britain. Dots on the map indicate the study sites where plant species richness in grassland ecosystems was measured. (B) Correlation between rates of inorganic N deposition and plant species richness. (After C. J. Stevens et al. 2004. Science 303: 1876\u2013 1879.) The ecological effects of S and N result when atmospheric deposition returns anthropogenic emissions to Earth\u2019s surface. In the next section, we\u2019ll describe some anthropogenic compounds that exert negative effects while remaining in the atmosphere. Self-Assessment 25.3 [Please Note: This content is online resource on https://iws.oupsupport.com/, you must have an account to view it.] CONCEPT 25.4 Losses of ozone in the stratosphere and increases in ozone in the troposphere both pose risks to organisms. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 25.4.1 Describe how the release of chlorofluorocarbons poses a serious threat to organisms, including humans. 25.4.2 Explain how ozone in the stratosphere can benefit life on Earth but threaten diversity and ecosystem functioning when it occurs near the ground surface. Atmospheric Ozone Ozone is good for biological systems, but only when it is not in close contact with them. In the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere), ozone provides a shield that protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. When in contact with organisms in the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), however, ozone can harm them. Detrimental changes in ozone concentrations have occurred in both the stratosphere (losses) and the troposphere (increases) as a result of anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants. Loss of stratospheric ozone increases transmission of harmful radiation About 2.3 billion years ago, when prokaryotes first evolved the capacity to carry out photosynthesis, oxygen began to accumulate in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, leading to a series of changes that facilitated the evolution of greater physiological and biological diversity. The increase in atmospheric oxygen (in the form of O2) also led to the formation of a layer of ozone (O ) in the stratosphere (at an altitude of 10\u201350 km). This ozone 3 layer acts as a shield protecting Earth\u2019s surface from high-energy ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation (0.25\u20130.32 \u03bcm). UVB radiation is harmful to all organisms, causing damage to DNA and photosynthetic pigments in plants and bacteria, impairment of immune responses, and cancerous skin tumors in animals, including humans. Stratospheric ozone concentrations change seasonally as a result of changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, particularly in the polar zones, where they decline in spring. British scientists measuring ozone concentrations in the Antarctic were the first to record an unusually large decrease in springtime stratospheric ozone concentrations starting in 1980. Springtime minimum ozone concentrations decreased by as much as 70% between 1980 and 1995 (FIGURE 25.23). There was also a concomitant increase in the area of the Antarctic region experiencing a decrease in ozone, called the ozone hole. An ozone hole is defined as an area with an ozone concentration of less than 220 Dobson units (= 2.7 \u00d7 1016 molecules of ozone) per square centimeter; prior to 1979, average annual ozone concentrations had never been recorded below this level. Ozone decreases have been recorded between 25\u00b0S and the South Pole.", "Similar reductions in ozone have been recorded in the Arctic (from 50\u00b0N to the North Pole), although the magnitude of the decrease has not been as great (thus conferring the name Arctic ozone dent, since ozone concentrations have not dropped below 220 Dobson units). FIGURE 25.23 The Antarctic Ozone Hole (A) Since 1980, there has been a dramatic decrease in springtime ozone concentrations over the Antarctic region, with concentrations dropping below the threshold for ozone hole status (220 Dobson units) for a large proportion of the region after 1984. (B) Average ozone concentrations over Antarctica for the month of September in 1979 and 2019 demonstrate the dramatic decrease that occurred during this period. The lowest ozone concentrations are shown in dark blue. (A, data from ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov.) The decrease in stratospheric ozone was predicted in the mid-1970s by Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland, who discovered that certain chlorinated compounds, particularly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), could destroy ozone molecules. CFCs were developed in the 1930s for use as refrigerants and were later found to be useful as propellants in spray cans dispensing hair spray, paint, deodorants, and many other products. By the 1970s, as much as a million metric tons of CFCs were being produced every year. Molina and Rowland (1974) found that CFCs did not degrade in the troposphere and could remain there for a very long time (50\u2013140 years). From the troposphere, CFCs can move slowly into the stratosphere, where they react with other compounds, particularly in the polar regions during winter, to produce reactive chlorine molecules that destroy ozone. Other anthropogenic compounds with the same effect include carbon tetrachloride, used as a solvent and to fumigate grain, and methyl chloroform, used as an industrial solvent and degreaser. A single reactive chlorine atom has the potential to destroy 100,000 ozone molecules. Thus, the danger posed by chlorinated compounds to the stratospheric ozone layer was clear to Molina and Rowland. The amount of UVB radiation at Earth\u2019s surface increased as concentrations of stratospheric ozone decreased (Madronich et al. 1998). These increases in UVB have been most striking in the Antarctic region, which has experienced an increase in UVB radiation of as much as 130% during spring. Increases have also been recorded in the Northern Hemisphere, including a 22% increase at mid-latitudes during spring. These increases in UVB radiation at Earth\u2019s surface have coincided with an increasing incidence of skin cancer in humans, which is now approximately 10 times more common than it was in the 1950s. UVB radiation had an important role in the evolution of pigmentation in humans (Jablonski 2004). The production of melanin, a protective skin pigment, was selected for in humans living at low latitudes, where ozone levels are naturally lowest and the highest levels of UVB radiation reach Earth\u2019s surface. As humans migrated away from equatorial Africa into colder climates with less sunlight, however, high amounts of melanin in the skin limited production of vitamin D, resulting in selection for lower melanin production in peoples of higher latitudes. As these lighter-skinned humans have subsequently migrated into environments with higher UVB radiation, to which their complexions are not adapted, they have increased their risk of skin cancers. This has become particularly true for populations at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, and South Africa, where exposure to UVB is enhanced by stratospheric ozone loss. Concern is particularly great in Australia, where nearly 30% of the population has been diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. Substantial evidence exists to indicate that increasing UVB radiation has important ecological effects (Caldwell et al. 1998; Paul and Gwynn-Jones 2003). Sensitivity to UVB radiation varies among the species within a community, and as a result, changes in community composition are likely to result from increased UVB radiation. The potential for detrimental UVB effects due to stratospheric ozone loss is greatest at high latitudes and at high elevations (>3,000 m, or 9,800 feet) because of lower atmospheric filtering of UV radiation. The realization of the rapid decreases in stratospheric ozone concentrations, and of their probable anthropogenic cause, resulted in several international conferences on ozone destruction in the 1980s. At these conferences, the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement calling for the reduction and eventual end of production and use of CFCs and other ozone-degrading chemicals, was developed. The Montreal Protocol has been signed by more than 150 countries.", "Atmospheric concentrations of CFCs have remained the same or, in most cases, declined since the Montreal Protocol went into effect in 1989 (FIGURE 25.24). A progressive recovery of the ozone layer is expected to occur over several decades, since the slow mixing of the troposphere, with the long-lived CFCs it still contains, and the stratosphere will result in a time lag before stratospheric ozone concentrations rise. The trends in stratospheric ozone concentrations shown in Figure 25.23 indicate ozone destruction is declining in response to lower emissions of CFCs, but a full recovery of the ozone layer is not expected until 2050. The 2019 Antarctic ozone hole was the smallest since it was discovered in 1985. An estimated 280 million cases of skin cancer and 1.6 million skin cancer deaths have been avoided as a result of the Montreal Protocol. FIGURE 25.24 Progress against the Ozone Killers Measurements of atmospheric concentrations of ozone-destroying chlorinated compounds, in parts per trillion (ppt), at five monitoring locations across the globe show that several of them have declined since the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1989. (Data from NOAA/Earth System Research Laboratory/Global Monitoring Division/HATS Flask Sampling Program. https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/hats/flask/flasks.html) Tropospheric ozone is harmful to organisms Ninety percent of Earth\u2019s ozone is found in the stratosphere. The remaining 10% occurs in the troposphere. Tropospheric (including ground level) ozone is generated by a series of reactions involving sunlight, NO , x and volatile organic compounds such as hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and methane. In some regions, natural vegetation can be an important source of volatile organic compounds, which include terpenes (which give pines their characteristic odor) and isoprene. Under natural atmospheric conditions, the amount of ozone produced in the troposphere is very small, but anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursor molecules have greatly increased its production. Air pollutants that produce ozone can travel long distances, and thus tropospheric ozone production is a widespread concern. Tropospheric ozone is environmentally damaging for two main reasons. First, ozone is a strong oxidant; that is, the oxygen in it reacts easily with other compounds. Ozone causes respiratory damage and is an eye irritant in humans and other animals. An increase in the incidence of childhood asthma has been linked to exposure to ozone. Ozone damages the membranes of plants and can decrease their photosynthetic rates and growth. Ozone also increases the susceptibility of plants to other stresses, such as low water availability. Decreases in crop yields have been associated with exposure to ozone. Characteristic symptoms of ozone pollution have been found in plants near urban areas since the 1940s and 1950s (e.g., in the San Gabriel Mountains near Los Angeles and in the northern Alps in Italy), but more recently, symptoms have been noted in national parks and wilderness areas farther from sources of pollution. For example, plants in the Sierra Nevada of California are negatively affected by ozone generated in the Central Valley and the San Francisco and Los Angeles urban areas (Bytnerowicz et al. 2003). Growth rates of trees in forests of the eastern United States are as much as 10% lower than they would be in the absence of ozone (Chappelka and Samuelson 1998). Second, ozone is a greenhouse gas that can contribute to global climate change. Ozone has a short life span in the atmosphere relative to other greenhouse gases, however, and its concentration can vary greatly from place to place. Thus, the effect of anthropogenic ozone on climate change is difficult to estimate. Strategies to limit tropospheric ozone production have focused on lowering anthropogenic emissions of NO and volatile organic compounds. In most developed countries, efforts to lower emissions of ozone- x producing compounds have met with success. In the United States, for example, emissions of volatile organic compounds dropped by 50% between 1970 and 2004, emissions of NO dropped by more than 30% x (U.S. EPA 2005), and tropospheric ozone concentrations are decreasing near large urban areas (Cooper et al. 2014). Regulation of emissions of ozone-producing compounds has not been as strict in some developing countries, however. Ozone is a serious air pollutant in urban and agricultural regions of China and India.

The movements of dust described in this chapter\u2019s Case Study are also influenced by atmospheric processes, including rainfall patterns and wind. We\u2019ve also seen that humans change the environment at a global scale through emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants into the atmosphere. Land use change, which alters the amount and type of vegetation cover, generally influences the environment at a more local scale. However, land use change in arid zones that are subject to periodic severe droughts can have global-scale effects by enhancing the amount and spread of dust into the atmosphere. During the early part of the twentieth century, the southwestern Great Plains was opened up for agricultural development. The natural vegetation of the region consisted of drought- and grazing-tolerant grasses. Bison, which had grazed the land for centuries, were replaced by cattle in the late nineteenth century. Economic demand for wheat, due to losses of agricultural lands in Europe during World War I, and the recent population expansion into the southern Great Plains encouraged the development of agriculture. Although this area was known to experience periodic droughts, farmers, encouraged by the notion that \u201crain follows the plow\u201d and by recent technological developments in farming, cultivated large areas of land, plowing under the native prairie grasses and replacing them with wheat. For a while, the weather was conducive to agriculture, and the farmers prospered. However, the 1930s brought prolonged severe drought. Fields dried up, and with no protective network of roots to hold it together, the soil began to blow away. Major dust storms carried the soil across the North American continent and all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. The Dust Bowl event is still considered the worst environmental disaster the United States has ever experienced (Egan 2006). Similar circumstances in Asia enhanced the severity of dust storms there. Deforestation, the development of agriculture in marginal zones, overgrazing, and the drainage of the Aral Sea for irrigation have all been implicated in the increased severity of dust storms following the mid-1990s (Wang et al. 2004). While dust storms in urban areas are a rarity, large-scale dust storms regularly occur in desert regions (FIGURE 25.25). However, both the American Dust Bowl and Asian examples suggest that while dust storms are a natural phenomenon, a combination of agricultural development of marginal lands and severe drought exacerbates these events (Cook et al. 2009). At a global scale, extreme droughts and land use change contribute one-third to one-half of the inputs of dust into the atmosphere (Tegen and Fung 1995). Desert regions, such as the Gobi and Sahara\u2013Sahel regions, have expanded at their margins because of land use change since the 1970s, increasing the global impact of dust storms. For example, Asian dust has been detected in the European Alps, traveling two-thirds of the way around the globe in approximately a week (Grousset et al. 2003). On a geologic time scale, major periods of dust redistribution occur in association with the recession of large ice sheets during interglacial periods (see the discussion of glacial cycles in Concept 2.5), as evidenced by the distribution of loess soils, some hundreds of meters thick, across North America and Europe (FIGURE 25.26). FIGURE 25.25 Desert Origins of Global Dust Storms Deserts are sources of dust that may travel large distances and have important ecological impacts in distant regions. (A) The photo on the left is a satellite image of the Gobi desert in early April 2006. The photo on the right shows the same region 3 days later, obscured by a massive dust storm. (B) Sources of the dust deposited in the Caribbean region include the deserts of North America and Asia. The main directions of dust flow are indicated by arrows. (B adapted from illustration by Betsy Boynton in V. H. Garrison et al. 2003. BioScience 53: 469\u2013480.) FIGURE 25.26 Distribution of Loess Soils As continental glaciers receded following the most recent glacial maximum, wind carried substantial amounts of loose soil from the exposed areas. Large areas of (A) North America and (B) Europe were covered with deep layers of this material, which developed into loess soils. (A after D. R. Muhs. 2007. In Encyclopedia of Quaternary Science, pp. 2075\u20132086.", "Elsevier: New York; B after D. Haase et al. 2007. Quat Sci Rev 26: 1301\u20131312.) CONNECTIONS IN NATURE DUST AS A VECTOR OF ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS The ecological effects of dust removal and deposition are not fully understood, but one of the best-studied effects is the movement of nutrients (as described in Chapter 22) at spatial scales ranging from a few meters to continents and oceans (Field et al. 2010). Dust deposition of nutrients can have important consequences for primary production and the global carbon cycle. The supply of iron (Fe) from dust deposition is important for oceanic primary production (Mahowald et al. 2005), as we saw in Concept 20.2. Dust from the Asian storms described earlier has been associated with algal blooms in the Pacific, and inputs of cations from African dust are important to primary production in tropical forests in the Amazon (Okin et al. 2004). In contrast, the removal of surface soils by wind can lead to lower production due to losses of organic matter and fine mineral particles, which are important for nutrient supply and retention. Dust may also be important in long-distance transport of pathogens (Garrison et al. 2003) and pollutants (Jaffe et al. 2003) and may influence disease dynamics (as described in Concept 13.5). The ecological effects of dust movement can be both direct and indirect. Nutrient input and loss are examples of its direct effects. An example of an indirect effect occurs in the southwestern United States when dust transported from the Colorado Plateau falls in the Rocky Mountains and alters the timing of snowmelt. As noted in the Case Study in Chapter 22, grazing and recreational vehicle use have disturbed biological soil crusts in arid lands of the Colorado Plateau, increasing their erodibility and dust input into the atmosphere. Most of the dust is swept away in spring storms, and some ends up deposited in snow on the Rockies (FIGURE 25.27). The dust increases the amount of sunlight absorbed by the land surface, warming the snow and causing accelerated melting. Earlier snowmelt has the potential to increase the length of the growing season for plants growing in areas with deep snow cover. However, rather than stimulating earlier growth of plants in areas that melt sooner, accelerated snowmelt delays the initiation of growth and flowering of alpine plants, which wait to grow when air temperatures are suitable. This delay results in greater synchrony of greening up of alpine plants, possibly leading to greater competition (Steltzer et al. 2009). In contrast, earlier snowmelt in lower-elevation subalpine meadows triggers some plants to initiate growth immediately, exposing them to potentially killing frosts (Inouye 2008). The surrounding subalpine forests may experience water shortages when snowmelt occurs earlier, which may lower their NPP (Hu et al. 2010). The ecological impacts of dust, both direct and indirect, remind us that ecological phenomena occur at a global scale, have widespread importance, and testify to the role of humans in intensifying their effects. FIGURE 25.27 Dusty Snow in the Rockies Dust from the Colorado Plateau is carried by spring storms to the Rocky Mountains, where it increases absorption of sunlight by snow and accelerates its melting. Earlier snowmelt has important implications for mountain ecosystems and regional hydrology."]}
